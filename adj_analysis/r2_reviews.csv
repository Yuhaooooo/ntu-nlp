2,"I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. 

They are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. 

It gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight."
2,"Okay I get it. Trader Joe's has some prepackaged stuff that seems like the gods sent it. But really. This IS the place to get food for your cocktail party.
This ISN'T the place to buy all your groceries.

If you shop here (and other places) long enough, you'll notice that some of the stuff is VERY inexpensive and reasonably priced while other stuff is enourmously out-of-control pricey. And then you'll know your way around.

Cheap:
cheese
beer
vodka/liquor
olive oil
peanut butter
cooler/lunchbag

Expensive:
pasta
pre-made food
smoothies
produce (prewrapped/cut)??? 

Also: they don't know what beets are. If that bothers you, then don't come here."
2,"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a Korean BBQ establishment before as I was with this place. 

First of all, the servers took forever to come take our orders and I thought it was a bit ridiculous that if one of us wanted to order the veggies, we all had to order it as well. 

Secondly, the grill that my friend and I were sharing wasn't working properly and it took them over half an hour to come fix/replace it. Oh, and if we wanted to order more side dishes or drinks, we had to literally wave and yell a server to come to our table.
The food is subpar. Veggies were dry and wilted. The fish smelled a bit funny and the meats were overly seasoned.

To top it off, the route to the bathroom consisted of passing by meat just literally sitting in buckets of blood. I was so grossed out!

All in all, a pretty bad experience to say the least. Don't think I'll be going there again.

Ps, if you don't have cash or credit, don't even think of going into the place."
2,This was the first time and probably the last time going to Dickey BBQ. I heard some good commits so I tried it. The ribs were dry and the potatoes casserole tasted like boxed mash potatoes and the green bean and bacon was just bland.
2,"Closed super early like 9pm on a sunday... and plenty of bars were still open for drinks and football. Average food meh drinks.


Food 3/10
Service 2/10 - Heather is great!
Parking 1/10
Location 9/10
Music 3/10

Would pass and go to the other bars in the quarter"
2,"You would think that with as many ""cowboys"" are in the phoenix area that there would be some great BBQ. I have to say I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. The baked beans were down right horrible. I gave them two stars because of the free soft serve ice cream that you get with every order. :)"
2,"I stopped In here the other day because I was in Henderson and found myself hungry. I love the breads at Great Harvest Bread Company so I decided to try them for lunch. Big mistake! I was on the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich so that is what I ordered.  That, however, is not what I received. What I received was a cheese sandwich that had been put through an oven on a conveyer, Albeit the cheese was melted the bread was as white and untoasted as when they sliced it off the loaf. I inquired of the young lady at the counter as to why this was the case, (A grilled cheese should come out with a golden brown, crispy, crunchy and delicious exterior crust. Which is created by the application of butter to the exterior of the bread before you GRILL it.)  I was told that they put there garlic butter on the inside of the sandwich so as not to mess up the grill...what grill? there is only the oven with a conveyor belt. This is inadequate, to say the least. That's fine if you want to do it that way but don't call it a grilled cheese sandwich, it is not!!! Perhaps your employer would think about purchasing a Panini grill or something that would produce the desired exterior. 

To the young woman who helped me, don't ask me have a had the sandwich here before because clearly I have not! I have a completely different idea of what a grilled cheese sandwich is, as I'm sure most people would. It was not the warm cheese sandwich that I got.

I have not any other sandwiches here. I'm hopefully they are better. perhaps I will try again...maybe."
2,"Don't ask me why I keep frequenting chain restaurants -- I must be a glutton for punishment.  So, I've been to this Outback a few times before, I used to order the prime rib, but it had come out so fatty the past few times that I stopped ordering it.  Last night, I met a couple friends here and this time I ordered the Outback Special Sirloin with the lobster and mushroom topping (an extra $3.95)  for the more ""indulgent steak experience,"" as stated on the menu.  

So the appetizer and salad came out fine, no problems thus far.  Then the steak came out.  It was cooked fine, but they forgot to include the lobster and mushroom topping for the more indulgent steak experience.  I told my server nicely that they had forgotten the topping and he assured me that it would be right out. The steak was decent and cooked correctly, however I was disappointed because the lobster and mushroom topping came out 10 minutes after my steak, which was cold by now and the ""topping""  wasn't really a lobster topping with mushrooms, it was more of a lobster bisque with mushrooms.  If I had known it was going to be so disappointing, I wouldn't have bothered to wait for it while my steak got cold.  It would have been nice if the server apologized and took the ""topping"" off my bill (yes, it was just $3.95 but it's the principle of the matter), or offered a free dessert, but there was no accountability.  I don't expect to have another indulgent steak experience at Outback anytime soon."
2,"Wasn't overly impressed with the food or beer selection. Being named ""the French quarter"", my husband and I were expecting French inspired food. It's run of the mill pub like food. I had the grilled chicken gryo that was ok and my husband had the corned we'd sandwich. Both looked delicious as they were served to us but there wasn't much in the way of flavor."
2,"I made an appointment with the intent of getting cataracts reviewed, one eye in particular is like looking out a thick fog and is becoming annoying. This practice is very busy and operates like an assembly line-while the initial exam seemed thorough, you then get sent to the ""closer"" who makes sure you know of the upgrades available, and finally the dr. My entire appointment took over 3 hours. When I finally got to Dr Wellish, he was in such a meat market rush that I don't think he understood or cared enough to listen to what I was describing-said I had dry eyes (which seems to be the buzz word of the office as there was notices everywhere and a ""survey"" about the topic required)-maybe its a huge profit center. I was rushed out with copay and eyedrops paid for-and absolutely no feeling of a solution or even understanding of why I was there. Writing this review with the same hazy eye and will most likely pick up my records and go elsewhere. Big may be a big outfit but not better."
2,"I'm generally not a harsh critic for many things, if there is effort involved I wouldn't be quick to judge on a first visit basis, but waiting almost 45 minutes just to be approached and then asked what we would like to drink is lousy. That's almost saying that you straight up, don't care. How on earth there was a mix up, is beyond me. Even on a Friday/Saturday night with the place packed that wouldn't be okay. Me and my girlfriend got our drinks after 45 minutes and ordered our food. We got boneless wings/fritters and they tasted like dirty fryer oil, as did the breaded chicken sandwiches. The Hummus was really good though. It honestly deserves 1 star, but the fact that we had a lot of that taken off our bill was nice at least."
2,"Decided to come here as friends were visiting out of town and are a fan of kbbq. This place's location can't be beat so we decided out of convenience to give it a try it. Once you enter, there's a lower level and an upstairs. Although not sure what the lower level is for, we headed upstairs. During our visit, Friday evening, the front door was super crowded and we were confused if there was a wait or not - but people were just standing around blocking the door to keep warm? 

Anyway, we got upstairs and were served immediately. We were surprised at how empty the store was for a Friday night. There were maybe 10 tables max occupied. We were a group of 4 and to our surprise was only given one grill to use (comparing to the other big franchise Chako, which gives 2 grills for 4 people). The waiter came pretty quickly to take our order and drinks. We had the option to choose individual dinner or all you can eat kbbq which was nice. Of course, we went for kbbq as that was our intention of coming. You order all you can eat on a sheet of paper that has all the items. Variety was decent, but vegetables are an additional $3 though. Side dishes were tiny but was nice to have. Food came promptly, however, the first round, we ordered chicken and few others which didn't all come. I think they miss orders on purpose if you order too many? It's really like how other yelpers mentioned, first 15 minutes was okay but the experience goes downhill from there, especially if you come with a party of 4 and everyone's trying to cram all their food on one little grill. I guess it slows down the cooking process so you don't get to eat as much? Anyhow, we had a total of 2 rounds which I see is the norm from the tables beside us. The service was not overall too bad and the servers did attend to us whenever we needed something. We had the grill changed once and they were pretty prompt about it. For the price, I would say it's decent for what you get but it's too bad they don't include dessert like their competitor. Overall, I still prefer Chako and don't think I would return again. 

One issue I had here though was not food or service but the bill. I don't recall seeing it mentioned anywhere but I think they automatically charge a service charge or something because the bill came to $24 after tax which was only suppose to be $18.99 plus taxes. I didn't realize it was more than I should've paid until after I left. Can anyone confirm this?

Ps. it's pretty stuffy and hot in there - bad ventilation - so be prepared to smell like a greaseball coming out of there"
2,"Worst service fron this branch... I ordered some more side dishes and didn't even get them. When we asked for the bill, it nearly took them almost 30 minutes for the bill to come to us. We were about to ditch the restaurant. ALSO, we badely had water. We kept asking and only came for 1 refills.."
2,"This place is centrally located which is good and the food is pretty decent. Two things that are not ok is the service and the cleanliness. The waitress was ok but didn't clear the dishes or refill drinks without being asked. As for the cleanliness, the place was a mess. There was a huge mess on the floor below our table where a family of 8 had all of their kids before us and no one thought to sweep under the table or wipe the chairs before sitting a new group. The rest of the restaurant was no better, including the bathrooms. Blah! If that is what we could see, imagine what we couldn't see in the kitchen!"
2,This place is not managed well. Seldom is there anyone up front to greet you or put your name on the waiting list.  After a 5 min. wait we were seated & ignored it was 23 min. before a waiter came over to take our order & get us drinks. A couple came in after us & was seated in the booth right behind us they placed their order & were leaving by the time we got our food.  They were not that busy & this has happened to us 3x now it shouldn't take 1-1/2 hours to get in/out after a 5 min. wait to be seated. And good look paying your bill sometimes there's someone at the register other times not.
2,"My home warranty company called this company out to replace a salt cell.  Based on my experience, I think this company uses underhanded tactics to double up on its service fees from the home warranty company--which also doubles up my fees, of course.  Read below, and use the lesson here to be careful with your dealings with them.  

I had them out to replace a salt cell under the home warranty.  That weekend the heater for the spa refused to function properly.  I asked Aaron Pools about it and I was told that since it's a heater problem they cannot do anything about it unless I submit a separate home warranty claim specific to the heater.  I did so and told the home warranty people that I believe the incidents are related and also told the Aaron Pools scheduler that the incidents are likely related.  

When the Aaron Pools looked at the pool again, I was told that a ""heater bypass valve"" was cranked the wrong way and that I just shouldn't ever mess with that valve.  Of course, I did not mess with that valve--never have--it says ""heater bypass valve"" and until then the heater was working great (used it twice in the month before the service without issue), so why would I move it?  I pointed out that the only person who would have moved that was the technician who replaced the salt cell, so please don't charge me for the second service.  He said that he came out to service, so that's that--the charge was earned (and blamed me for turning the valve, of course--""do you have a video of [AP technician] turning it?"").  

I submitted a complaint to the BBB and the owner of Aaron Pools said ""We did not charge you for any return visit, the home warranty company has determined that a salt cell claim and a heater claim are separate issues. Therefore the home warranty company charged an additional service fee.""  Of course, this is false--Aaron Pools told me to submit the heater claim--the home warranty company does not care if Aaron Pools fixed the problems causes without charging extra.  The owner suggested that the home warranty company would likely waive the charge.  I called the home warranty company and was told that it cannot waive the charge because it prepays the service companies when each claim comes in.  Obviously Aaron Pools knew that the service fee would not be waived.  

This is when I realized what I think is probably really going on: A little tweak by a technician on an unprofitable home warranty call--a tweak that the homeowner doesn't know how to fix is an easy way to get a second call out to fix another problem and ""earn"" another service fee.  The owner of Aaron Pools claims that his company is not prepaid for service calls.  At this point, however, I frankly do not believe this statement.  It directly conflicts with what I was told by the home warranty company, and of the two Aaron Pools has displayed greater dishonesty.  

The lesson for everyone else now is: when something goes wrong after and Aaron Pools service, first look for some easy fix.  Second, do not allow them to pressure you into a second claim--it's the same claim if it resulted from Aaron Pools own actions.  

(Side note, it is theoretically possible that the initial cranking of the heater bypass valve was done innocently by the first technician in order to reduce flow to take the salt cell out of the water circuit, and then forgot to turn it back.  But I don't think so, because (1) the owner of the company was dishonest with me--dishonesty appears to be a company policy, (2) if the technician knew enough to crank it out of the way, he'd know enough to crank it back, (3) an honest company would not charge for fixing that, and (4) the heater technician said bypassing the water circuit with the salt cell in it would be mostly ineffective.)  

I'm giving two stars rather than one because, although dishonest with me on more than one occasion, they did actually switch out the salt cell properly (eventually--it took two tries, the first one they installed either came cracked, or it cracked under load because of the manner in which the technician turned the valves)."
2,Usually I like this location but I ended up sitting there for 20 minutes with a toddler. No one even acknowledged that I had been there nor offered us a drink. I understand that they get busy but they could have at least acknowledged my presence. The only person who acknowledged us was the host and he apologized.
2,I have been here several times (only because it is the only BBQ for miles) and every time I have been here the kids that work here do not clean up. I am here right now and half of the tables need to be cleans off and there is a lot of food on the floor! The dining room is always dirty. The food is just OK and the service is just OK. If you are stuck on this side of town and want BBQ I guess you are out of luck its this place or no place.
2,"Not as good as I thought from reading reviews.  Oxtail soup had lots of yellow fat on the meat, means meat was cooked, frozen, then thawed out.  Loco moco was ok for first few bites but after that was hard to continue.  Just something about the taste that wasn't what I am used to.   Ice tea was nothing but sugar water, couldn't taste any tea flavor.  Won't return, sorry"
2,"Pretty average/mediocre strip mall sushi joint. Prices are decent but the Sushi seemed a bit not as fresh as other places and they aren't as generous with the actual fish on their sushi dishes. 

I paid about 12 for my lunch order but would gladly pay 20 at Tomo Sushi just a few blocks away on Litchfield and McDowell."
2,"Stumbled upon Chef Ben's and decided give it a shot. Gotta say the prices are what brought us (my daughter and I) in. It seemed fairly priced, clean looking, yet it was not quite welcoming. We ordered the chicken teriyaki,  teriyaki two, and what is usually my favorite, the eel roll. I was completely unsatisfied, the chicken was dry, the beef seemed to be low quality and a bit dry as well. I was most let down by the roll though. I asked the gentleman taking my order ""is the eel fresh water or not?"" His response, ""yes."" I definitely do not believe it to have been fresh water at all. I have had eel numerous times and at plenty places yet have never had such a salty and fishy tasting roll. The taste was overwhelming and I could not force myself to suck down a second bite."
2,"Do not get wings on wing night. Its a matter of them getting wings out and not cooking to order. I can ask for them extra crispy any other day but wing night, you get what they give you."
2,"I'm giving it 2 stars. the food is good ,overall dining experience was good, but this review is for the price...seriously we had the beef Wellington dinner that had potatoes and carrots on the side..$40 the meal itself, I wouldn't have paid no more than $25 and that's still a lot. The pastry was way bigger then the meat and burned on the bottom, the salads are separate we paid 200$ for 4 of us and I honestly could of eaten at a strip big name 5 star that was a 4 coarse meal for that price, I mean I guess If you have the money and you don't even care because the economy is beneath you than be my guest, but if I'm gonna pay for a meal like that I wanna say I spent my money well. Food is good but NOT WORTH THE PRICE THEY ASK FOR ,you could eat at Texas Road House/ Outback same kind of meal for cheaper....that's the truth!!!"
2,"I ordered the two meat plate, brisket and pulled pork, the pork was a low average and the two SMALL slices of Dry Brisket really Sucked.

My wife ordered the smoked turkey, it was a Processed Turkey Roll that was also dry.

That was my second time at this Dickeys and was Definitely the last.

If you want Texas barbecue this is NOT it!"
2,I don't know why and how this place is getting 5 stars. to me Island flavor is 100x better. I got the quarter leg plate and I wasn't that impressed. if you want Hawaiian food then I recommend elsewhere.
2,"This place was alright, my buddy and I went looking for a good meal and a couple beers and found an ok meal w/ nothing special behind the bar. I don't think i'll be going back to any of the chains. Pricing was about in line w/ what we got quality wise."
2,"Of all the restaurants in the courtyard, this is undoubtedly the least impressive.  I wouldn't do it if I were you....."
2,"Came here this morning for the first time to try something different for breakfast. As I was looking at the menu a worker came up and asked what I wanted, and I told her I hadn't been there before and was trying to figure out how it works there. Instead of helping me, she just said ""ok"" and walked to the back. I don't know where she went. I chose the Vegas Veggie sandwich, and I paid and went to my table. Short wait for my food, but when it came to me it was so heavy laden with hummus I couldn't taste anything else. I had the bread toasted and the bread was still soggy from all the hummus. I even tried taking some if it off with my napkin, but I couldn't even finish half my sandwich that I paid almost $10 for (no chips or drinks or anything else included). 

In conclusion, customer service needs some work, portions needs some work, and price is too high for what you get (literally a normal sized sandwich). Probably won't be coming back. I went to Starbucks next door and got a latte, muffin and scone for the same price and enjoyed it way more."
2,"Came with with friends during lunch. Very busy with short wait times. Very loud too. Difficult to hold conversations. Seating too close together. 

Waitress was polite and very attentive. I had the Friday special- salad and cup of lobster soup. Very basic. Soup was mediocre. Definitely not homemade."
2,"I'm giving this a two star rating because of the service.  First time being in the place so I ordered at the counter, when the lady asked me if I wanted it for here or to go I said here.  After placing my order I went over and had a seat waiting for my food.  After about 20 minutes she comes out with everything in a to go bag, when I said I ordered it for here the lady just looked at me with no explanation and turned around and walked away.  I thought humm that was weird.  All I can say about the food is it was ok for what it was but for sure didn't like the egg drop soup.  Couldn't understand the lady at the counter very well at all either.  She didn't speak very good English..maybe that's why she packed my food to go."
2,Not impressed. Everything was extremely greasy with little flavor. The staff was nice. The place is huge but feels very empty. Its doubtful I will be back.
2,"I've tried this location three times and each time liked it less.  My third visit will be my last.  I had the two meat plate of pulled pork and beef brisket with sides of bbq beans and potato salad and sweet tea.  I was there 20 minutes after they opened and my pulled pork was cold, the beef brisket was tender and served hot.  The bbq beans were way too watery, while the potato salad was decent.  The sweet tea was below average in quality.  Also, they over charged me on my order and instead of making the correction in the register and giving me the correct difference back, the employee reached into the tip jar and took out a dollar and handed it to me!

We can use more decent bbq places around the valley, but this location will not be one of them."
2,"Food was ok but nothing to write home about. Be careful with the add-ons and up-sells. Everything is extra, and it adds up. A side of sweet potato fries was over $7. Celery for the wings is extra. If you need extra chips for your spinach dip, they're extra. Our bill ended up being nearly $60 for two people. We could have gone out to a nice steak house for that much."
2,"The service was kind of bad - there was just 3 workers for the entire restaurant, So the person taking your order and money was also serving your food. There was one cook and one busboy. The food was room temperature.  We just can't go back."
2,"Shocking this place got good reviews...no hi, hello or go to hell. Wait try listen to this...paid for my food and da dude tells me no more 1's so I'm like okay??? Leaves me hanging no explanation nothing. Food is ready bagged it to go and jus gives me partial of my change. So I asked um brah where's the rest of my change? His response no mo 1's (freakin really)? Finally I told him no tell me no mo 1's fix da problem. I had to wait 45 minutes so he could go bank. These freaking kanak's is embarrassing. Go try'em maybe u get better service...all I can say is good luck...they lucky I gave'em 2 stars."
2,"We ordered take out from Dickey's this weekend.  I know the reviews weren't great but we have been desperate for BBQ so we thought we would get a variety of items - they couldn't all be bad, right?

I had the two meat platter, sliced brisket and cheddar sausage, cole slaw and waffle fries.

Just ok portion which worked out well since I didn't feel as guilty tossing it into the garbage.  Brisket was fatty and bland, the sausage - I'm not ready to discuss it yet, I'll update the review if I ever get the stomach to speak about it again.  Cole slaw had a nice taste but there was so much liquid in the container it looked like soup, waffle fries were pretty good.  Roll was soft and pale so I didn't bother and I was so grossed out after trying the meats stuffing dry squishy bread down my throat didn't seem to be a good idea.

Husband had the ribs and gave them a ""just ok"".

I gave it two stars because my sides were ok though I may never eat brisket again and I will burn rubber out of the parking lot of any restaurant that I ever see list cheddar sausage on their menu.  One thing for sure, I won't be eating at Dickey's again."
2,"This restaurant isn't the worst but isn't the best either. The cons are poor parking, there is a parking garage close by with very limited spots. The service was lacking at 230-3 pm on a Wednesday. The manager doesn't take concerns very well.  The chicken jumbo takes like it is Cambell chicken soup. 

Pros. Other than the one problem with the soup the food is good. The Chicken on Pita and the Monte Cristo were both delicious."
2,"I would have to agree with most of the reviews for Dickeys...
I got what I thought was a great lunch deal....a brisket sandwich with 1 side and a drink for $6.00.

The bread was ick...nothing at all special , the meat was dry and VERY bland with 2 tiny rings of onion and 2 small pickle slices....if it wasent for the average bbq sauce I would have tossed the sandwich and learned where NOT to go for BBQ!

I chose cole slaw as my side which like the brisket was bland and nothing to speak of.  One  of the people in my party had mac and cheese....""can you say boring""?

Althought another person got the ""baked potatoe casserole"" as a side which was actually really good..... in fact I would say it was the best thing I tasted there.

A nice perk is the mini ice cream cone you make yourself.....especially when you put it in a cup and add Root beer!   

Dickeys is the closest BBQ place to me and yet I would rather go without or take a drive to the next closest place.

Food is s personal preference and I am the most PICKEY person I know and the only reason I would go back is to get some more of that potatoe casserole!

You decide....and in the meantime....

Bon Appetite'"
2,"I planned a get-together event at the Hickory Tavern Northlake for our wedding weekend on April 27, 2013. I initially wanted to have the event at the nearby Fox and the Hound, which I was very comfortable with, but the Hickory Tavern was more conveniently located next to the Hilton Garden Inn Northlake where our guests were staying.
 
To ease things on the restaurant, I called the Hickory Tavern Northlake about a week before and let them know I would have a big group of at least 25 people arriving shortly after 9:30PM on Friday, April 26.

About eight people from the group arrived at 9:30PM, but the majority of the group and I were a little late because our rehearsal dinner ran longer than expected. I got there around 11:00PM and the majority of the guests got there at 11:15PM. 
When I arrived, I was happy to see a big space near the bar with tables that our large group of 35+ people could enjoy. As I was greeting everyone and saying hello, I thought things were great. However, I quickly became frustrated as soon as I wanted a beer and could not get any service. I waited for our server for several minutes.  I tried to go the bar to order a drink, but because I had said hello to my group of friends already at the tables, the bartender said I was not allowed to open a tab unless I was going to sit at the bar. I never got a reason on why this was the case, but it was very frustrating. I finally got my beer from the server after several more minutes. My fiancée arrived a few minutes later and we had to go through the same ordeal. 
 
As the rest of the group arrived on the bus, the problem became extremely obvious since no one was able to get a drink. Everyone tried the same thing I did in going to the bar and each was turned away as soon as they said they were with my group. Seeing their frustration, I went to the bar to figure out a solution. They were not willing to work with me. I ended up having to express to the bar tenders that our group of 35+ people was going to have to leave and get service somewhere else if the situation did not improve. We kept talking with no progress, but eventually a manager came over. The manager assigned us several more waiters, which eased the frustration in our group. The waiters did a great job and provided adequate service, but it would have been a lot easier if the bar would have allowed service there. 

As a result of my experience, I would not recommend Hickory Tavern for large happy hour or drinking type events unless everyone is planning to be seated at the bar or at one table. Unfortunately the bar only seats about 15-20 people. In general, you should not expect their bar environment to behave like a typical bar, even in the 11PM - 2AM time period (the hours that we were there). We had a perfect wedding weekend and this was really the only stress or disappointment I can recall. 

I cannot comment on the quality of their food or dining. 

Sincerely,

Jack Michel Jr.
Charlotte, NC"
2,"Had a ribeye. It may have been 1/3 inch thick at best. Marbled apparently means and exceptionally meaty slab of fat. It was cooked rare perfectly, but the quality of meat for next to $20 was absurd."
2,"My husband and I have frequented this restaurant pretty regularly lately and have been pleased with the food and service in the past.  Tonight we were a little frustrated with the service as there were only 3 other tables and a total of 3 servers.  Our server took our drink order, 10 minutes later my husband was still waiting for his beer as they needed to change the keg and were having issues.... that was fine the problem was the bartender and the server seemed to keep forgetting about it until finally my husband decided to ask for a different beer (server did mention it would be comped because it took so long).  We patiently waited for the server to come take our order, she didn't write it down and while I noticed her talking to another server when going back to enter the order she forgot and asked another server to come and ask what we ordered.  After serving our dinner she never came over to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything, or of my husband wanted another beer (no up sale at all).  She seemed more interested in talking to her co-workers than working.  I'm not a hard customer to please but when mistakes are made, they are best made and easily forgiven when the restaurant is busy and the servers are working. I've also had grilled chicken salads there before that were awesome but this time the chicken was dry and chewy I had to pick the chicken out and eat what was left.  My husband however was pleased with the ribs he ordered.  We will be back again, but if this continues to be the service we get I'm afraid we'll have to go somewhere else. 
Server was Shannon."
2,"I went along with a friend on a Friday evening to this place. At first I was pretty excited because I've heard alot of hype about Korean-style grill places and having had the Chinese-style hot-pot/grill combinations in the past I thought maybe the grill experience wouldn't be that different albeit with a distinctly Korean flair thrown in. What could really go wrong, right...?? Well, it was certainly not a thrilling experience...
Service was somewhat nice with a friendly accommodating waiter who suggested which daiquiris were favorites among the customers. But that's where the experience seemed to end on a positive note...
I have no idea what authentic, traditional Korean grill cuisine is back in the ""homeland"" but I certainly agree with reviews of the Korean yelpers on here who say that there is seemingly nothing authentic about this non-Korean operated eatery. The only feature worth getting all ""oohy/aahwy"" about the whole grilling experience is the gas contraption that is sunk in the middle of the table. Other than that, I really didn't see anything else worth raving about regarding this particular type of culinary experience.
And the items for the all-you-can-eat seemed so limited, listed down on a square piece of paper that was 1/4 smaller than a playing card. AYCE at Japanese places, dim-sum and even hot pot places offer a bigger selection of items to choose from and I don't see why customers would have to pay extra to get raw vegetables. It would have been really great to wrap most of the grilled meat in large lettuce leaves with a few other raw veggies added in like I've seen being eaten on most Korean food shows. Now that would have been a worth-while experience. Presentation of the raw food seemed hap-hazard and bland and that's noticeable in some of the pictures from other yelpers, most of the items from the AYCE option we choose was mainly red or white in color. And there was only one kind of dipping sauce instead of a couple of selections to choose from to add more flavor to the cooked food.
I really hope that the Korean-operated places offer a much better grilling experience than this place. Any suggestions...??"
2,"I went here for lunch on Saturday (yesterday) 
There was an older man serving us 
I had gotten home from work at 5 am the night before and therefore i was very tired, no makeup and had a sweater on ... 
Once he took our order , I asked if i could add pancetta on my pasta-  

This man had the audacity to say to me 'did you bring money with you?'  With an attitude , and chuckled
..........

I dont think I need to say much more. 

Pasta was pretty crap as an addition, very watery rather than creamy, lacked flavour.

Not coming back."
2,"Korean Grill House is a chain restaurant that has a few locations in the downtown core, this location in between College and Dundas, on Yonge, another exists at Yonge and Bloor, and yet another on Queen St. West.

Here's the low-down: you grill your own food, in a firepit, in the middle of your table.  Good first-date activity? YES.  Safe place for the munchies in a state of inebriation? NO.

The style of the restaurant is very modern, you'll likely share a table - but not the grill - with many other restaurant goers.  The washroom at this location is again, shared, you won't find this out until you enter it.  I did a double take when entering it, as so many women where excessively primping and priming themselves.  They would of put a mortician to shame... that's another story.

Service was not so great.  I mean, the waitress was friendly and everything, but she was hard to nail down.  Case-in-point, it took us twenty minutes just to go through the whole bill paying dance.

Not sure I would go back."
2,"Pho broth was bland. It was just eh. I have had better.
Service was good though and people were nice."
2,"+2 stars are for the friendly cash register/waiter guys that were working the front as you walk in.. Michael and another guy in glasses.

-3 stars for the horrible food

There were maybe 4 tables seated.  It was not busy at all! No excuse for crappy service and screaming in kitchen that I could hear at front door where I was waiting. 

To go order.  2 sandwiches  and tater tots.
Everything was burnt with the exception of one of the egg ham sandwiches. 2 orders of tots burnt so badly that I don't even think there was any cheese in them and if so,  it didn't survive being burned to death.  Needless to say,  they were so dry they crumbled. All but the 3 attempts to fund good ones but became crumbled ones were dumped out.

Egg, ham, sausage whatever it was called sandwich. Was very burned on the outside and it was way too maple-y, but nay be that is how it's made.. Not sure.

Asked for a side of mayo (3 times confirmed by glad guy) l, so of course it wasn't in the bag when I got home. He even happily told me it was there as he handed me the bag. 

May I have my $2 tip back? May i just have the whole bill compensated? So disappointing to waste money like that.  

Last time there."
2,"This review is about the customer service I watched while waiting for our food. Which took almost 30 minutes for nachos, a po boy and a kids burger. Now our server Jade, seemed like she didn't really want to be here to work, which i completely understand. But we watched 2 tables walk out on her shift. There were no, sorry I'm running behind, etc etc. just completely ignored them and just shrugged her shoulders after they both went to the hostess to complain. Being in the customer service industry, I know we work for our tips. I guess she could care less."
2,"This place has it's pros and cons, but they are mostly cons.

Went here for a birthday lunch for my stepdad with some family. Started off by taking a bit too long, in my opinion, to be seated for a restaurant that was maybe filled a little over the 1/4 of it's capacity. Found out after being seated that they were understaffed on this particular day, which explained why the service was so slow throughout the whole meal. However, slow or not, their staff was extremely friendly and on point. We ordered some appetizers and drinks, and they were great. This place does have some good appetizers and I really like the bread they give you before your meal. 

When the main courses came out, 2 out of the 7 meals were cold and had to be sent back, one of the meals was not cooked properly and was sent back as well. Now maybe my family was picky, but the table next to us sent their food back as well, and while we were leaving, I heard another table sending back one of their meals. Maybe this was a bad day for this place, but it was enough for me to deem Outback as the ""Walmart of steakhouses.""

Like I said, if you just want some drinks and maybe some appetizers, this is a decent place for that, but if you want a great steak or meal, I suggest another restaurant."
2,I had them scheduled to come through my home owners insurance and they showed up 2 weeks later. The front desk girl is lying about calling 7 times and leaving messages. No one called.
2,"I've been a regular here for a long time, but I've never wrote a review. However, events today have really pushed me to write one. 

To begin, the food is fantastic, although it can be a bit inconsistent in taste at times. Service is typical Asian resto style - quick, curt, but efficient. However, if you don't mind the ""ok"" service, don't let it stop you from trying out their food. Their prices are very reasonable as well.

The reason I am giving Huh Ga Ne 2 stars is mostly because of the service I received today. The restaurant was packed as usual, and we just finished our meal. Our table was on the upper seating area (where we had to leave our shoes at the bottom). As we left to go pay for our meal, I began looking for my shoes but much to my dismay they were NOT THERE.

I'm gonna give whoever took my shoes the benefit of the doubt, and assume that they accidentally took my shoes. I'm also gonna assume that the person is a girl with pretty small feet, because I don't think a grown ass man would want my shoes. Anyway, I approached the waitresses with my dilemma, and told them that someone may have taken my shoes. They were understandably confused, but were too busy to give a crap and quickly forgot about me, leaving me to stand barefoot on the floor like an idiot.

I'm a reasonable person, I wasn't mean nor accusing because I knew it was obviously not their fault that some idiot took my shoes. What I was upset about was that no one really tried to help me out!! I had to wave down the waitress again and explain to them that I have no way of getting home, because no way in heck am I WALKING BAREFOOT home! And that I need someone to do something NOW.

The guy at the cashier (I'm assuming the owner's son), was the most infuriating. He had no idea what to do with me, mostly just standing around absolutely confused out of his mind. Finally, one of the employees had the bright idea of lending me some slippers (yay!), and I proceeded to ask him if I could leave my number with them, just in case the person decides to return my shoes. We were contemplating whether to just leave the restaurant without paying, because we were just so upset with the whole situation. However, after some consideration we decided we would just pay for our meal anyway since it wasn't really their fault that my shoes were stolen. However, we refused to leave any tips because I was just so angry at the whole situation.

I have always been understanding of their service because of how busy they are, but events today have really made me reconsider that. Maybe the fact that they don't speak English all that well may have made the situation more difficult to process, but still there was no reason to just ignore me! I feel that when something happens to your customer (no matter how extraordinary the situation), it is your responsibility to step up and do something about it. Just don't leave me standing there and hope I'll just leave so that you won't need to deal with the problem, because NO, I won't leave.

So to the Girly that took my Navy Blue Toms, GIVE THEM BACK! I left my number with the restaurant just in case you have the conscience to return what is not yours! I have a feeling I know which customer took my shoes, so if you happen to read this, return my shoes! If I ever see you on the street, I will not hesitate to ask you about it! Don't say I didn't warn you!"
2,"Is it just that I've drawn the short straw on locations, or is pain-in-the-ass parking part of Trader Joe's marketing schtick? I don't even have to be going to TJ's for it to make me angry. People dropping passengers off at the main door, just off Monroe, often backs up traffic on this major city street. If you do pull in, you wait for the drop-off driver, you wait for someone to pull out of a narrow spot, you get dirty looks for waiting while they back out, pull back in, back up, pull forward, straighten their car, yada yada yada. Parking. Such a to-do. It's the same way at the Minneapolis and St. Paul locations. 

It might all be worth it if there were enough things inside to make you want to go through the hassle. But the produce is average at best. The meats? Fresh? Frozen? Forget it. The packaged baked goods? Not bad but not great for you. 

So, what makes it worth the hassle? I like their sparkling lemonades. The staff is usually friendly. Other customers seem happy to be in the store if not the parking ramp. Finally, there is enough variety that coming here is an adventure. I usually find a new item or two take home and try. The fact that they keep me sharp and trying new products means that every now and then, I'll suck it up and pull in."
2,"I ordered the T-bone and eggs. The food wasn't the best, especially hash browns and toast. The hash browns were extremely bland and a little burnt. Speaking of burnt, the toast was. One side was charred while the other was slightly burnt. As for the T-bone, i asked for medium and got well-cooked. It was dry but A1 sauce helped a little. The only safe thing was the eggs. But a little later I got a stomach ache. Although I wasn't happy  I gave a 2 star because I've had worse."
2,"Be me, 22M full time student no job 
Thursday hits hit up Denny's with the bros for the weekly Godly worship 

Server comes around, super friendly, everyone orders food finally server get to me I look around at my friends putting on a strong face nothing wrong (don't show them how you feel inside)

I'M 
NOT FINE INSIDE, it's 10pm been studying and going to my hospital clinicals all day no food in my belly no cash in the bank to even feed myself off the 2/4/6/8 menu (I have bills to pay)

I secretly check my bank apps in hope to find the funds to wave down the server to order some food 
But it's over the server brings out the food, funds unavailable for myself I look in horror as my friends stuff their face and I'm left hungry another Thursday night. 
Gone every Thursday to Denny's coming out depressed and starving... The only thing I see from Denny's to this day is depression."
2,"Two very trusted sources recommended this place to me and yes, the food (at least what I've tried) is every bit as delicious as they said it would be which aligns with what other people here seems to be saying as well.  

HOWEVER, the few concerns here regarding tips is VERY valid and is an unfortunate blight for an otherwise excellent eating establishment.  I am a firm believer in leaving tips that are commensurate with the level of service and I will admit that I was reasonably generous here.  The part that caught my attention was when I went to grab the change (cunningly provided in coins only) and it looked like I was about to only leave a loonie behind as a tip (I hadn't even grabbed all the coins yet), not one but TWO of the waitresses looking on let out a small yelp in the form of a ""NO"" until they realized that wasn't my intention and they caught themselves.  It was funny perhaps but also very telling, as if revenues from tips are a part of their business model.  For a food service based business (I have also been a manager in the food service industry) this type of attitude is unacceptable.  One's Tip or Gratuity should not be expected and any amount should be accepted with at least some humility as a measure of how well you've performed your duties.  Of course there are clients out there that cannot be pleased no matter how hard you try, do not believe in tipping, or are otherwise cheap - but there will always be people like that and as this is part of the business and industry, the SERVICE industry, and tips again shouldn't be a hard expectation.  

I'm conflicted as to whether I want to return.  I love good food at decent prices and this place surely fits the bill ... but when it comes time to pay the bill, I'm not sure I want to deal with the lasting impression of the last impression made by the servers with respect to tipping."
2,"Tried this place as it looked similar to Yogis Grill (one of my favorite lunch spots). Got the chicken teriyaki bowl lunch special, again hoping it would be Yogis-esq.

Definitely was NOT. Chicken was rubbery and flavorless. Came with ""vegetables"", which really mean one piece of broccoli. 

Could only eat a few bites"
2,"This is my first time here and I must say I'm a bit disappointed with this place. I came in for Korean grill but very limited options for beef.
I ordered short ribs but got strips and the waitress dumped the entire serving on the gas stove (as shown in pic)
All the while we've had servers come over to our table and turn off the stove without saying a word, leaving us wondering how should we continue cooking the food!
I wouldn't recommend based on their service."
2,Went here on a weekday night. I didn't like it and I probably won't be back.
2,"The other location on Queen street is better. All of the meat here has an odd taste... it tasted like the gas from the grill. It was so unappetizing! Even though its the same restaurant, the banchan, meats, and even rice tasted better at the other location. Service is great here though, no issues here. This time the $17 wasn't worth it. If you have to come to this location, go after 10pm for the owl night special."
2,"Wonderful service at the bar. Our wait was seriously misquoted. Our food was served cold. We could tell that the food would have been delicious if it had been hot, but instead, we received slow food served cold."
2,"Gotta say this place is disappointing. Such a great name, it has to be a fun late night place, right? Nope!!!  They have a good beer selection, but no one who knows anything about beer.  The food is OK, but the atmosphere is just sad. They really want to close by 10:00, so don't plan on sticking around."
2,"Food is great as always but my whole family told them 3 times we are here to celebrate a birthday and it got ignored. A Happy Birthday would have been nice as you only get to choose 1 place for your birthday! we even opened presents as they cleared the table and....nothing!  So go there for the food but don't do any celebrations at this locations. Go to their Toronto location, much better service!"
2,"""Run of the mill food"".
We've been there twice since they opened.
Nothing to get excited about.
Its the kind of place you'll try every year ... to see if its improved.
So far, it hasn't !

When I want BBQ Ribs or Chicken .......
I smoke my own .......
Then finish them off, for 2 minutes on the gas bbq."
2,"The food here was pretty decent other than their complimentary bread service -the bread was rock hard, not warm, and just hard to digest. 

The service was pretty bad here. Our water cups were always empty and we always had to ask for them to get refilled. We never saw our server but rather he was at other tables that weren't even in his section chatting them up. 

And personally, I don't like it when they hand you the bill before they even ask if we are ready for it, or before we even ask for it as it comes off as if you're rushing us out of your restaurant especially when it's not even busy. 

Definitely not going back to this location. The one on Yonge and Eglinton is better in terms of service and food quality."
2,I was looking for a new place to get my nails done and eventually selected The Red Door because it was close to my work. My overall experience was meh. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was quiet (which I appreciated because most nail places are packed and noisy). I selected and booked a mini manicure for $16 online. The nail technician called my name after my waiting for about 15 minutes and showed me to the polish wall. I selected their nail polish that was supposed to last longer and even payed more to have this longer lasting polish. The technician over-drilled my nails and lazily slapped on one coat of the polish before sending me on my way. I have to say two days later the polish is coming off.
2,The service was good but the food was not worth the money. The ribeye had NO marbeling. It was flavorless. I'm disappointed.
2,"I came here the other day to really pamper myself after a stressful day at work. I had let me eyebrows, fingernails, and toenails go rogue for way too long and needed much work done on them. The eyebrow was was a typical eyebrow wax, nothing fancy, but for twice the price of an eyebrow wax at other salons. The aesthetician was super nice and friendly and I would definitely come back to see her...but for half the price! 

I decided to get the milk and honey manicure and pedicure. I had the same nail technician for both and she just did not seem ""into"" it; I could tell she had other stuff on her mind, which she even admitted she was stressed and not all there that day. That is fine, I understand people have lives outside of work that sometimes interfere, but for a service industry where I am paying $40 for a manicure and $80 for a pedicure, it would have been nice to receive something as an ""I'm sorry"" I guess to acknowledge that is not how the services always are. Again, the services were okay, but nothing special; I have had better at many other salons and nail spas that charge much less. I did not like the pedicure chairs at all. They are the benches that you sit on so you cannot adjust anything for short legs, there is no massage chair, and it was kind of uncomfortable. 

While I'm happy I got to say I experienced services here, I must say I was quite let down with the experience and will probably not be returning. The one plus of the trip was the nail polish - I have developed a new love for Essie polish that I may not have had otherwise!"
2,"On my first day working in CLT, my team member raved about this restaurant and their daily lunch specials.

Sooooo, the Shrimp Creole, in a nutshell is one of the Tuesday specials. Its pretty much rice (that's not cooked all the way), embryo shrimp (of the frozen kind from your local grocer), and red spicy sauce (umm, creole sauce?). I tried my best, but I could only eat a 1/4 of the plate, and really that much b/c I was hungry. 

We were seated quickly and the food came in 6min....so I was able to make it back to the office ontime. Guess that's worth 2 stars eh?"
2,"Ordered delivery from here via grubhub, which was seamless with none of the issues that other reviewers seem to have had. Had 5 assorted sushi rolls with egg drop soup, with tax, tip, and delivery charge total of $50. Delivery was quick, quoted an hour and change but actually took just shy of 40 minutes. Why two stars? The food... Not bad, but bland and small. The soup was the usual one quart container, but the sushi and egg rolls were tiny. Everything lacked flavor, but it was fresh at least. What you get here is pretty much the same as what you get at a grocery store Sushi counter."
2,"The prime rib had no salt crust. Almost no flavor. The service was nice, but awkward. My vodka gimlet was far too much rose's lime, but it was serviceable. Crème brûlée was good."
2,"To start off..the staff is friendly & the doctor is good. But just make sure you have AT LEAST 2 HOURS to kill. I mean..seriously...I know doctor's office can get busy but this is the 2nd time here accompanying my mother. At the minimum, plan to sit around & waste 2 hours of your life..waiting."
2,"This has to be the worst Outback. Service is slow, and last 2 times we were there, we have had to ask for silverware after our meal came. Pass this one by. Black Angus is not much better with their service, but it is down the road, as well as other places around the mall for steak."
2,"I've heard their Texas locations are really good.  This place just did not do it for me. I could say more, but I'm not out to bash any staffers.  The food was just eh.  Sorry guys.. won't be back."
2,"This place is terrible and I haven't even gotten to the food. My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to dinner out. We were promptly seated near the bar, but ended up waiting for quite a while before having to ask the host to request a waiter/waitress. Meanwhile parties that came in after us (and seated next to us) were having their drinks served. We must have become invisible and cease to exist once we entered this establishment.
Once we were served, the food was decent."
2,"We were craving BBQ but were too lazy to make our way to Bobby Q. MAJOR MISTAKE. 

The brisket and the ribs were adequate but the portion sizes for the meats were small. The chicken and turkey both looked and tasted processed. The side dishes were uninspired, with the mac and cheese being mushy and tasting like it came out of a box. The area around the beverages and BBQ sauces was absolutely filthy and all the cutlery had to be wiped down before we could use it.

Adding insult to injury, no one told us that there was complimentary ice cream for customers- we discovered that as we were leaving (for the first and last time I might add)!"
2,"We had the termini with mussels and the milano. Both dishes tasted great. However, the service was horrible. We kept being told by the host that it would only be a few minutes, which turned into an hour or so. The wait staff was also very slow and don't refill water at all. It took a very long time to get our bill. We will not be going back."
2,"I only ventured into Huh Ga Ne because my Korean friend told me that the owner of ""Lim Ga Ne"" sold his business and opened up ""Huh Ga Ne"" instead. After coming here for dinner last Friday, I can confirm that the original chef does not make the dishes here. 

The sweet & sour pork appeared as if it was re-heated. The pork was supposed to be deep-fried first, but it tasted soggy. The sauce was clumpy with jello-like texture. 

There's around 8 side dishes that comes with the meal, I almost wished I just ordered rice! We also ordered the fatty pork lettuce wrap (not sure what the Korean name is) - the pork was sliced thinner than other places and not fatty enough (according to my Korean friends). To sum it up, the meat was not juicy at all and the dish would have been very dry if not for the kimchi. 

We were seated in the ""Take Off Your Shoes"" area, and I regretted the decision in less than 10 minutes. There's no back support, so my back was aching by the time we finished dinner. My legs kept going numb from sitting cross-legged.. I don't know how everyone else is doing it. 

They're open 24-hours as well, and on Friday night it was packed! Be prepared to line up, but I wouldn't waste my time."
2,"In general,  I enjoy Great Harvest Bread Company;  I used to eat at locations before I moved here and love the location on Hualapai.  The is was my first venture to this location.  I happened to see it in route to the furniture store and decided to come back for lunch after my purchase. The first thing I noticed,  no welcome when entering..it's a small thing,  but the extra touch that I'm used to at other locations (the store did a a few people, but not by any means crowded).  There was a young lady ringing people and a couple of people in line;  another passed me to take a sandwich to someone, without so much as a peep. I paused the bread slices awaiting my turn, the young lady went back behind the counter, no comment,  no offer of bread. It was my turn so I went to order; no smiles or kindness from the young lady ringing. ..only appeared to be annoyed as I smiled and told her how much I enjoyed the other location and it was my first time there. I asked a question, and with a roll of the eye, was told they didn't have the item I requested. I ordered the sandwich, she rang order & pushed the receipt to me across the counter (not for signature,  but my copy. .is it too much to ask to hand a customer a receipt ). She did ask me if I would like bread/butter, and when giving it to me did the same,  sat it on the counter near the register and slid it across. All the while with a scowl.  The young lady who brought my sandwich, no smile,  appeared irritated as well. The sandwich was ok; great pesto, but the ends of the bread were harder than I'm used to for some reason and the shredded iceberg lettuce was wilted. Perhaps an off day, perhaps selective with niceties, I don't know,  but the staff did not make a good impression to me at this location. With a range of options for good food, I tend to choose places with good customer service. Perhaps management can work on this with staff and perhaps things may improve...I guess time will tell."
2,"All are Trader Joe's cut from the same cloth?

I almost got into an all out brawl with a staffer who tried (hard I might add) to convince me they've never sold lavender laundry detergent. Look, I'm just a guy, a guy who likes lavender, and they sold detergent in two different sizes for years. I've bought it. I didn't see, and because I know things sometimes come and go, I asked about it, and I was met with such resistance and hostility... seemed very out of place for TJs. Not certain if it was just a rough day for them or if I was putting out something that just wasn't being picked up. I'll head back there. They do have decent pricing on non-perishables, but the awkward run in with someone who looked like she was in a managerial role will keep my visits minimal at best."
2,"The bread here is absolutely outstanding! The pumpkin spice is one of my all time favorites and I have never had a better cinnamon roll!! However, I have gone the past 2 Saturday's around 8am (bare in mind they open at 6) only to be told they have no fresh bread (or any bread really for that matter) and wouldn't get a shipment in until 10 or 11!!! Such terrible business structure to have the bakery open but nothing to serve!! Was so broken hearted to walk away empty handed two weeks in a row!!!"
2,"Decided to try this place because it's closer to where I live than Aloha Kitchen. I quickly learned that AK is worth the drive. I had: the Kalua Pig & cabbage and the Kalbi ribs. The ribs were ATROCIOUS!!!  They were all fatty, full of grizzle and impossible to eat.  They were not tender at all. I gave up.  The Kalua pig & cabbage was tasteless; I'm not the type of person who puts salt on my meals, but I doused this dish with soy sauce to try to give it some flavor.  Had I been dining there (instead of ordering takeout), I would have asked for other dishes. No joke. Was not happy with the food overall, but they do have good macaroni salad."
2,"A big let down.

Lacking any good BBQ spots near the Scottsdale Rd. / Shea area, I was excited to try Dickie's when I saw it had opened.  I gathered a couple meat-eating co-workers and headed over for lunch.

I got the three meat plate, two sides for $10.99.  Not a bad price for BBQ, I figured.  Not a bad price, that is, if it's GOOD bbq... this was not good.  First their meat portions were tiny compared to what I get at Cooper's BBQ in Gilbert.  Second, the meats did not have a good, bbq'd taste, they were plain and frankly, the brisket was kind of gross.  The side of beans were so-so and the fries definitely tasted ""fast-foodsy"", if that makes sense... they had that weird, added crap on them.  Third, their BBQ sauce was VERY watery and pretty much sucked.  Fourth, they only had one size drink, this mammoth 32-oz yellow cup made of hard plastic.. not very enviro. friendly, or cost effective i'd imagine.  Then they punish the water drinkers by providing a little dixie cup.

This place sucks and I should have known going to a chain-bbq spot was a bad idea, but I just had to try it.  Note for gluten-free eaters, their BBQ sauce is gluten-free."
2,"Having never been to a Hickory Tavern before but having been to Hickory, NC let's just say I didn't have big expectations. Yes I know they're not related but that's what happens when you name yourself after what I would refer to as an oasis of parking space. Seriously have you been to Hickory before? Tiny stores with gigantic parking lots for such a small town! If they ever have a population boom and everyone moves there, they'll be ready! Anyways back on topic to the actual tavern.

It's a sporty place, TVs everywhere, sports stuff and other things. The food was average bar food. I went on a Wednesday night which turned out to be music trivia night and 50 cent wings night. Alright lets go for the wings then! The hard part is actually getting the waitress's attention to get the wings. Seriously I thought I'd have to tackle her down to put in an order, but I'd probably tackle the wrong one. They all looked similar to me and I asked around the table and no one could remember what our waitress looked like either. After a good while we finally got our orders placed in and wings in front of us. I was just disappointed with my wings. So sad I had ordered a medium spice level on my wings which apparently translates to nonexistent and the sweet Asian glaze that I had selected really needed some heat to balance it out. A quick dunk into the blue cheese dip was a handy solution.

We won trivia night and got a $25 gift card yay! But I don't know about how I feel about coming back here for horribly slow service even if the food is ridiculously cheap."
2,"Ok this an update from my 2016 review.
So we dined in this visit. We saw several booths empty and were not cleaned off. The lady who came to take us back to the our booth she was very nice. However, the booth that was just cleaned off for us she still had to swipe food off the seats. She should not have to do this...It did seem a little under staffed...I'm just sorry we didnt see our favorite waitresses...this Denny's use to be busy no matter what time it was, but this time it was empty around 
Especially at lunch time...please look at your reviews and fix some things"
2,"Hadn't been to an Outback restaurant in years so decided to give it a try.  The waiter was nice, prompt and polite. That was the good.  The bad; took a LONG time to get our food and when it came out we were missing several items. My husband ordered steak and lobster with garlic mashed potatoes.  The steak was tender but tasted off and the lobster was tiny and the mashed potatoes were missing. I ordered the chicken sandwich and the bun was crunchy and the fried were missing.  My daughter had the mac and cheese and loved it.  My son ordered a kids burger and the bun was so hard he couldn't eat it.  Seriously, the bun was hard as heck and crumbled when you pinched it.  The manager came to the table to see how everything was and I showed him the bun.  He was profusely apologetic and offered to take that off the bill and buy us dessert as well.  We ordered two skillet apple pies and a chocolate thunder.  It took 15 minutes for them to bring it and when it came, it was 1 skillet apple pie and 1 chocolate thunder.  So even the apology desserts were wrong!"
2,"Would I consider this a top tier steakhouse? No. Everything that came with the meal was fantastic, except for the steak. Specifically, the steak was the poorly prepared, poorly cut, overly tough item. I overheard another table complaining about only their steak as well. I thought that ""stuff happens"" or ""don't be overly critical"", but then mine was bad as well. Again, everything else in the meal was fantastic, but they specialize as a Steak House. The waiter even told the other table ""Well, I don't grow the cows. Some are more stubborn than others.""

Probably will never return to this restaurant."
2,"So this was a special night. We drove 36 minutes because it was the only restaurant open this hour (wife and I both work overnights and rarely get the same night off).

First wife ordered a BYO burger with a veggie patty and avacados as one of the toppings. They were out of avacados... OK np. Then waitress MacKenzie (whom herself was wonderful although quietly spoken) comes back and says they are out of veggie patties... ok awkward now.

So then she orders French Toast Slam. Wifes french toast was grossly undercooked. Her hash browns were undercooked. Her scrambled eggs were OVER cooked.

I ordered double cheeseburger with nothing on it except cheese but added bacon. Cook forgot the bacon. OK np, by then we were already blech so it was kind of a ""that figures"" moment, so didn't make a tiff just asked it be taken off the check. 

Also my fries were way overcooked. I barely ate half and if u knew me ud know I never only eat half my fries, even when they aren't great.

My double cheese burger, although missing bacon, was REALLY good otherwise. 

Obviously they took the wife's food off the bill but MacKenzie also gave us an additional discount for everything else being crappy. Which wasn't her fault, not really sure what happened in the kitchen tonight though.

The burger itself and MacKenzie are the only things that got them any stars. Everything else was pretty disappointing. At least the 40 minute drive home gave me time to write my first Yelp review. Just wish it was under better circumstances (no I'm not driving)."
2,"Really disappointing, because we wanted to try something different from the major chain sub shops.   However, I couldn't even eat my roast beef sandwich. Bread was dry and broke apart,  so I was left with a gross, fatty pile of meat and no bread.  

My whole family of 4 was so disappointed that we sarcastically joke about eating here every time we are in Las Vegas. Sorry to say but won't be back."
2,"Excellent service, great ambience, nice bread bowl variety, but the food wasn't up to par. The salad was really weird finely chopped lettuce previously mixed with a vinaigrette until it is soft and mushy-looking. We made the mistake of ordering off the three-course menu. He got the brisket appetizer with ribs as the main entree. She got the battered shrimp appetizer and the brisket. All the food was smothered in about ten times more barbecue sauce than any normal person would ever want, but even after scraping off as much as we could, it was still too much. The corn on the cob had obviously been sitting for hours as it was mushy and inedible. His sweet potato was small but okay. The jalapeño spoon bread was cold and crusty. You know it's bad when we don't ask to take home leftovers as that's our normal thing (take some home for second dinner later on!) Perhaps it was our faults for ordering barbecue at a steakhouse, but for $25/person, you expect that it will be good regardless."
2,"The prices are great and they do seem to have decent quality products. But there are better grocery options in Madison. Like the Willy Street Co-op, Jennifer Street Market, Hy-Vee and Metcalfe's.

Trader Joe's is simply not worth traveling across town for. You can get better quality stuff elsewhere, and (good) cheap wine can be found at pretty much every grocery store. The Madison Trader Joe's is very small and always overcrowded with college kids. The parking is a cramped nightmare. It's just not ideal, unless you live nearby. When I was there last night it was a zoo, and it took way too much time to buy just a few items."
2,"This place is downright bizarre.  it's run by the same people who run Greek Isles, which means most of the menu is Greek with some pasta and ""creole"" items.  I say ""creole"" because there is like 2 items on the menu that are supposed to be New Orleans style and those at the tables around us who ordered the special (chicken creole) left most of it on their plate. 

I had a caesar salad and it, I kid you not, comes out in a mixing bowl.  it's huge and really a total waste of salad because it would take 3-4 people to finish one.  I barely made a dent in it.  The salad was just alright, nothing terribly impressive.  

During the week it's full of blue shirts watching ESPN."
2,"Wife and I had not been to an Outback in a while but we were given a gift card and had a discount coupon so thought we would give it another chance. First, the positives were the host sat us quickly, the waitress, Jessica, was excellent, very friendly and attentive, the bread was very good, the salad was good, and the baked potato was also good. Obviously Outback is advertised as a steakhouse, but unfortunately this is where they fall short. My wife ordered the ribeye and it was very thin, no fat to speak of and over cooked so dry, literally no juice or flavor. I ordered the sirloin and shrimp and my steak also was tough like leather, overlooked obviously, and tasteless. We both had to dump on A1 sauce to make eatable. The shrimp really did not have a nice flavor and they were cold. Went to share with wife and she gave them back to me. Not a good sign. If you label yourself a steakhouse you damn sure should make sure you know how to cook steaks. They are a good place for drinks, the onion, a burger or ribs, but please do not order the steaks. Again, Jessica was wonderful so our compliments to her."
2,"Ordered for our office meeting. It was ok. But most everyone got expired chips. Seriously?  I know they're most likely still okay, but still unacceptable in my opinion."
2,This Denny's has the worst service! They can't get an order right. Forget ordering a salad you will never get it. We have been coming to this Denny's for a long time and it's always the same. It's pretty sad when you walk in the door and it takes them 15 minutes to even acknowledge your standing there with only 5 people in the whole place. Food is good but very poor service!
2,"Two years ago I gave this location four stars.  Didn't rate my visit last year thinking it was an ""off"" night.  After yesterday's lunch, I'm certain I won't be back.  There simply isn't any reason - it's just ""so-so"" and completely unremarkable."
2,"I ended up at Hickory Tavern for my cousin's birthday dinner. I expected bar food and big TVs, and that's essentially what we got. I was a little thrown off when my GPS led me past Northlake Mall to Harris Corner, because I initially thought the restaurant was in the shopping center adjacent to the mall, but that's Fox and Hound. Not Hickory Tavern. Anyway, my experience at HT was super underwhelming. Our waitress really tried her best, but it wasn't enough to overcome the rest of the experience. First, the drinks from the bar seemed watered down. I'm not one to expect a double pour when ordering a single, but I also don't expect to order a gin and tonic with hardly any gin. Nobody at the table was pleased with their drink, except for folks who ordered beer and wine. Next, the food. I ordered the wing entree, with tater tots. The tots were room temperature and bland. The wings were ok, but by this point I was a little over the whole thing. There are too many good restaurants in Charlotte to eat mediocre food. I wouldn't go back, but if you decide to go, stick to beer/wine and don't settle for cold tater tots lol."
2,"Disappointed... I thought it would be a lot better after so many recommendations I have received from others. 
Gghanpoongki was mush. Soups were so so."
2,"Big screens? Check. Novelty sports memorabilia on the walls? Check. Giant booths suitable for big crowds? Check. Ability to make a decent burger? ............. 

Hickory Tavern is one of those places that is all for show, with a no-go on good food. Ordered a Honey BBQ burger, and the waitress and the courtesy to ask me how I wanted it cooked. Apparently the chef didn't feel like obliging her, and sent me out a well-done burger instead. 

Apparently a Honey BBQ burger is a regular burger, with a side of honey mustard and a side of bbq sauce. Looking at them, I was skeptical to mix them on my burger, so after experimenting on my plate I did discover that no, sweet and spicy honey mustard and smoky bbq sauce do not create a favorable taste once mixed together. En short, I could have just gotten a regular burger.

I was delighted that instead of just fries or chips, I could get a side of steamed vegetables. Unfortunately, they were soggy and completely tasteless except for a twist of pepper and a sad attempt at a garlic chunk at the bottom for flavoring. 

The person I was with got the teriyaki chicken burger, and while the chicken was very moist and well cooked, this thing must have been marinating for a hell of a long time. The teriyaki flavor was almost overwhelming, and extremely salty. 

Maybe their more expensive meals are made with more care. But if you advertise yourself as a sports tavern and you can't make a good burger, that is a complete out for me. There are plenty of local places where you can watch the game that are cozier, more personable, and know how to actually make a burger to a customer's specifications. For two people, I wouldn't waste your time on this place.


Er, the Woodchuck was good."
2,"I came here to take my boyfriend on a date and was very disappointed with the food.
We sat down..
They brought us hard, cold bread and oil for dipping. COLD!? And HARD!? Like my gums were hurting after eating this bread.
He ordered the steak and it was 25$ and looked like it was only 5oz and it came with cold uncooked potatoes.. and no veg.
I got 11$ pasta which was really good but A small serving..
What is up with the food here?!
I've been to the location on Yonge and Eglington and it was amazing so I expected way more ..
Not coming here again.
The best part of our date was when we were at Dairy Queen getting sundaes !"
2,"Yelpers this was a disappointing one. We decided to check this place out due to some really great reviews (and most resto were booked so...) Sad to be the bearer of bad news but it was and is as ""Cannery"" as it can get. 

Food was mediocre, my Prime Rib was so tough, I must have eaten a quarter and was so done with it (ended up feeding it to the dogs). Scallop potatoes & cream of spinach were not properly cooked (still raw-ish). Only thing I enjoyed was the almond bread other than that nothing worth coming back for.

Service was good, quick in picking up the dirty dishes. But nothing memorable.

Pianist was playing great songs which we enjoyed. (But we were here for the food so on that note, save your money and go to outback - same quality of food)."
2,Small modern designed restaurant. The set up of the shop is very well thought out and well performed. The fans of the grill are on the sides of the grill rather than on top like places. This is good because you dont have smoke in your face all the time. The grill was good and always hot. The Prices for korean bbq VERY good. All you can eat is available for a good price.It includes alot of different meats. You will eat your filling. Ok now on to the part that causes it to get a 2 star. The food here is NOT authentic korean food. 1st of all korean's are known for there little dishes of pickled food at the beginning which most places have around 10-15 of. This place has 5. Kim Chi was one of them and even that was not very good. The meets were ok but not marinated properly. So if you looking for a place to eat just meat and your not into real korean food this is the place to go. If you looking for authentic korean food go to korean town.
2,"I really like Texas food.  Yeah, Tex-Mex for sure.  But, real Texas food... Texas BBQ!

So if you like genuine Texas BBQ, Hot Links, Pulled Pork, then look no further; this is your place. Everything, but beer as they say!

We've been here a few times now and have enjoyed their Brisket, Pulled Pork, and a number of their sausages items.  The sides are equally good, such as Fried Okra, Jalapeño Beans, Fried Onion Tanglers, and Creamy Coleslaw.  All good, A-Ok.  

So how do I rate Dickey's when Yelp gives you the choice of Two Stars (Meh. I've experienced better) or Three Stars (A-OK)?  Well the answer is, we would agree.  I'm sorry for the unintended pun, but both are true.  Have we enjoyed better?  Yep, Texas Roadhouse or Famous Dave's in Mesa comes to mind real quick.  So, is the food A-Ok?  Sure. Absolutely.

So what is Dickey's?   It's just a quick, inexpensive place when you feel like Texas BBQ, and not thirty minute drive to Mesa.  It works for what it is.  So 2 1/2 Stars!  Like I said, everything but beer."
2,"I don't know what to expect anymore out of chain restaurants. Before, I used to be excited to go to Outback/Friday's/Chili's/Applebees etc, but now, ehhh. Went here today for an Easter sunday brunch. Since most of the restaurants were closed, we had no choice but to try and eat here. Went inside, was seated fast because it wasn't busy at all. Maybe 4-5 tables were occupied. They weren't busy and there were still dirty tables waiting to be cleaned. SMH. Anyway, our server was nice, average. The food was, well, I seriously had better. I expected too much I guess. We ordered a combo from their lunch menu - Caesar Salad and an Outback burger, a half rack of ribs and a chicken bacon burger sandwich with ""Aussie"" fries. Funny about the ""Aussie"" fries, it tasted just like ""American""/ ""ordinary"" fries. 

Anyway, the Caesar salad was meh. Forgettable. The Outback burger and the Chicken and Bacon burger were both mediocre as well. To be honest, I've had better burgers in Carl's Jr. The ribs though were decent. It was soft and flavorful. 

Will I come back? No, not really. Not  because I had a very horrible experience but, on their pricing, I can have a much more decent and satisfying meal somewhere else. Or maybe we just ordered wrong? I don't know, and I won't know anytime soon."
2,"The only thing I can rave about here is the portabello fries- they're incredible. Thick slices of mushroom, lightly battered, and served with a great creamy dipping sauce. Definitely start your meal off with an order.

But everything else had issues, including the service.
Lobster bisque was delicate to the point of bland, and tasted more of clams than lobster. Wedge salad was fine, bleu cheese crumbles were so small that it was hard to eat on the salad and most was left behind on the plate. Lamb chops were cooked perfectly to medium-rare, as ordered, and nicely seasoned, but were very fatty, with a thick rind of gristle on each piece. 

Service was polite, but I don't like how I was charged to purchase a side when I subbed a vegetable for the included potato. Server said there'd be a small fee, which I'm fine with- instead, I was rung up for a full side order and simply didn't receive one with my meal. If you can't do substitutions, just say so. I guess they're trying to pad the bill since there were only four tables on a Friday night."
2,"I have to say, I like the food here but the service we got last night was really awful and the food just doesn't make up for it.

We came here for my mom's retirement party and were a party of around 15 people. We were seated at a large table at the back of one of the rooms and the waiter was already somehow annoyed when he arrived to the table to ask if we wanted drinks. 

I ordered the Torino pasta and the food came out out fairly quickly and without any issues. I've had this dish from the other location and found the portion size to be considerably smaller. I was a bit under the weather so I wasn't feeling super hungry but I still managed to finish my meal. A few others commented on the portion sizes but it wasn't a big deal. The prices are pretty reasonable for the food and quality. There was a seafood pasta that was disproportionately massive, if you have a big appetite and enjoy seafood, I'd go for that one, it had some shellfish and squid in it. Looked good but I didn't try it. I think the person who ordered that was the only one to take home any leftovers. Overall food is good, I prefer the other location however for portion sizes.

Now for service, the reason for the mediocre rating, our server was really awful and it really soured our experience there. I would assume this large restaurant is accustomed to hosting parties, this server was flustered throughout, was getting mad if someone would get up and go to talk to other people at the other side of the party and snapped at us when we wanted to split the bills a certain way. He basically told us we weren't allowed to move around, which I understand for the purpose of serving and the bills, but for a long table, I think it's appropriate to stand up once in a while to talk to people on the other end, but it just made him even more flustered. He even accused my dad of moving seats which he didn't even do. This guy was increasingly frustrated throughout the night and everyone really noticed. It's unfortunate because it's a nice large restaurant and it would be perfect to host a large party otherwise. 

I've been to lots of parties at restaurants with similar numbers of people and I've seen it executed so much better than it was here. There seemed to have been a lack of courtesy and training for this guy and a whole lot of attitude and frustration. I'm really disappointed as this should have been a special night for my mom. 

I will likely not return to this location because of the service we received. Management might want to look into better training for their waitstaff for larger parties or keep this guy away from them altogether."
2,"Went on a Saturday afternoon.  10 people in the whole place with 3 servers, but impossible to get a glass of water. Food OK.  Got the London broil sandwich but would not get it again.  Decent bloody Mary."
2,"Not sure why I am posting this because I do not think they read their reviews.  The place is nice enough, service is spotty except for the busser, who should be a waiter, he is polished, polite, and very attentive. The food, some good, some not so much. Asked for the prime rib end cut. Dry and flavorless with a lot of gristle. Also when I asked for a baked potato instead of some cheese laden concoction, I was told that it would have an upcharge. Why? well as the waiter told me its a big potato from Idaho. Whatever. friend had the T-bone. Was cooked well and had good flavor. Side chopped salad and wedge salad were good. Would I spend 100 bucks for dinner there again?  Me thinks not."
2,"Let me preface this review by first saying that I am by NO MEANS a barbecue expert. I like what I like, and I don't like what tastes like crap ;)

My boyfriend and I were having my parents over to his place for their first time, so we wanted to get their favorite - good ol' bbq! Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with Dickey's. We ordered one of their family packs which is definitely a good deal for the money. I believe we paid $40 to feed 5 people - not bad! 

The XL family meal came with 2 orders of ribs, bbq brisket, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, coleslaw, and bread. The only good part of the meal was the ribs, bread, and brisket. I didn't care for the bbq sauce, because it was a bit runny for me (I like really thick, syrupy sauce!) The beans and coleslaw were decent, but the macaroni and cheese was terrible. I LOVE a good macaroni and cheese, but this was a disaster. VERY bland and very boring. 

As far as the service goes, I took the food to go and the wait time was decent. I definitely backed up the line when picking up my order, and I think they could have been more efficient. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back to Dickey's. A bad mac and cheese is a deal breaker in my book!"
2,"went in around 9:30pm wasnt busy so my wife and i thought it was a great quick bite, boy where we wrong. we made our order and waited 25 min for it to all come out and when it did it was cold. meaning it sat, unnattended a good while. To top it off we got to watch garbage bags, full garbage bags being walked through the middle of the place. the manager comped my wifes meal but even at that i had a bad taste in my mouth. will not repeat. The only reason i can even give this location anything more than a 1 is because i still semi enjoyed my mildly cold meal."
2,"I really should give this place a break since it is opening day but with a chain should there really be growing pains? Dickie's is a national chain with tens of stores.. should they be out of pulled pork? Potato Salad? Dirty tables and condiment area? Should the staff be rough around the edges? You know them not having pulled pork is like McDonald's being out of Big Macs!

Eating here lead to more questions then it did answers. Why were the ribs like jerky? Or the beef brisket moist tender and juicy? The food was just all over the place in terms of its preparation. There was a very steady stream of customers who seemed very happy that they were open. Of course I had a cloud above my head and wondered why a chain with so many stores was so off?

Not sure if there will be a repeat visit anytime soon.. perhaps in a few weeks or months they will get it all 'pulled' together? Ouch!"
2,"There are some things we normally love about Outback.   We've been to quite a few Outbacks and there are some things we normally love about them.   Usually we visit for dinner and usually we order the ribeye. 

We visited this Outback during lunch.  There were three of us.  We put in our appetizer order for the onion ring petals.  It was just an appetizer but we had a long wait for that appetizer.  Eventually a comment was made to the hostess that we were concerned since it'd already been a long wait that we'd be getting our lunch on top of the appetizer.  We didn't.  Eventually, the onion petals arrived.  

The potato soup served at our table was delicious.  It was ordered by two in our party.  One was a bowl and one was a cup.  Besides that two of us ordered the 1/2 ribeye melt.  We had expected au jus with it I think because we thought it was a french dip type sandwich.   It wasn't but the waiter brought us au jus anyway.  The au jus was very watered down and very cool -- not good with little flavor.  The sandwich was tough and just not that good either.  

Timing turned out okay.  Waiter was also okay but when he brought the ticket he tried to spark a conversation with us while we were involved in our own conversation.  First it was about our plans for the day and then our plans for Easter.  I thought he'd never leave to go back to the kitchen.  That was awkward and we didn't like it.  It just didn't sit right.   We noticed on our bill that he had deducted the onion petals.  We still weren't thrilled with this Outback and doubt we would return here."
2,"Not sure what pool service should entail but I get inconsistent service.  Sometimes they add chlorine tabs, sometimes not, sometimes they sweep, sometimes not.  This is a rental house where I hired a professional to maintain my equipment and relieve my tenants of the burden but there is a lack of communication somewhere.  Water level dropped to point that it burned up my motor and then they explained their policy about not filling the pool to run up my bill.  The expensive repair on that could have bought about 50,000 extra gallons:("
2,"My wife and I have been wanting to try this spot for a couple years now. We finally checked it out and it was a bit disappointing. 

My loco moco had over-cooked eggs and the beef patty was devoid of flavor. The gravy was bland too. 

The won ton soup was decent but I only found one won ton. 

Crunchy noodles, kalbi and macaroni salad were okay. 

There is only one person cooking so be prepared to wait a little bit.

I would come back, but how can you mess up a loco moco?


Edit: To the owners who clicked the Funny button.... Ain't so funny now huh?"
2,"I have been wanting to try Red Door for a while, the bold Red Door calling my name.  I have been to my fair share of Spas, but lean towards resorts when I am craving luxury.  Stick to old faithful for the bi weekly services.

Any who, I discovered Spa Week in the Valley and saw that Red Door was on the list of providers  I thought I hit the spa jackpot!.  I really was thinking that Spa Week was an awesome promotion, get your facial on week, but now I can't tell if it actually causes the spas to be lazy.

Premise of Spa Week, Spas offer 50 minutes services for $50, each place has a select 3 things they are offering.

I booked a facial with mircoderm and pedicure ($50 each service, microderm extra which is understandable), each service costing $50.  I showed up about 5 minutes before my appt. ( work ran late)  I stood there for about 10 mins, while the front desk had one person  sign in and out.  A couple other employees walked by but seemed to act too busy to assist.  Once completed and one person cutting in line, the front desk escorts me back with another customer, doesn't show us around and leaves me to show the other patron how to use the electronic lock ( used them at Joya :)  

Facial:  I couldn't get mircoderm since I use an acid treatment regularly on my face ( must have 2 week break)  I got a 30 minute facial that was a makeup removal, execration and a face mask.  I got a week arm massage and it was over and not to mention cut short by 10 minutes, you do need to honor the 10 minutes I stood at the front counter.

Pedicure:  This on the other hand was painfully long.  I had asked the front desk to shorten and add a polish change so my nails would match ( I would pay extra)  When the nail tech came to get me, should told me she didn't know and didn't have time.  I am sorry, I don't know why, but the cultural cheaper nails places ( Andy's, Chic and Kens)  They know how to give a pedicure...They get down in there scrub it off and slap on some perfect polish.  I do expect a $20 massage on my feet in a $50 pedicure, not paraffin which I could drip a cancel on my foot.  This is basically what you are paying for.

Well as you can imagine that massage was lack luster as well.  The whole place was lack luster, small locker room and I am not even sure there was a steam room, I was definitely not shown around or told there was.  

I give the Kudos on the Decor, the agency they hired at corporate did a great job.  However, I will not be going back, I fell so let down...I was so excited and the follow thru was just not there, but they did have time to plug some products."
2,"My husband  and I decided to try this place out because we were craving crab legs. We got there and walked to the bar nobody greeted us, the workers were all too busy in their own conversations. We sat down at the bar and the girl there started greeted us but wasn't friendly. She was honestly horrible I was upset they share tips at the bar because I honestly just wanted to tip the other guy that was working the bar. An African American fellow. He was great. She took our order after making us wait. The food was brought out in a timely manner. After that she never checked back in on us. The guy pretty much took over and we asked him for everything else. Meanwhile, the other employees were all just gathered all around us having their own conversations pretty loud. I just didn't think that was too appropriate it was just not the best place I've been to. I think they should have taken their convos to the back or just some place else not around the guests. The food was great but I probably will not return to eat there again."
2,"Used to come here quite often and really enjoyed it but the last few times it has not been good. The quality of food is not good, the zucchini planks were so greasy and the fries used to be really plentiful but instead there were hardly any fries at all. I ordered a side of Cole slaw and paid $1.99 for two spoonfuls. There were bugs on the walls and the temperature was not controlled very well. Very disappointing!"
2,"For a quick bit of BBQ at lunch this is OK - It's a tiny step up from most fast food. I'm not a huge fan of their side orders, but the beef brisket is decent, as is their spicy bbq sauce, which I drowned it in. Good inexpensive place to bring little kids who are new to BBQ."
2,"So I've been to the Outback (all over, not just this one) and I have to say that the typical experience we've had at Outback (which is usually in the 4-star range) is not what we've experienced here.  

We've been to this Outback probably 4 times in the past 2 years.  Unfortunately, our experiences have been consistently sub-par, and it appears that we are not alone in noticing this (often no wait on friday or Saturday night).  For whatever reason, at this particular Outback te service is consistently slow and poor, even when the resturant is only half full.  Incorrect orders probably 20% of the time, forgetting to come back and check on how food was, forgetting to hit refills on drinks, forgetting that an appetizer was ordered... it just goes on and on.  Very frustrating.

On the plus side, I'd say that the food is usually on par with what you'd expect form Outback.  Steaks were usually good and cooked correctly, sides were acceptable, however seafood add-ons' were kind of meh.

I was on the fence between 2 and 3 stars, but after considering where the bar is around here, there are just too many other good options for a steakhouse to say this was a middle of the road performance, esepcially with mutiple experiences contributing to this review.  Disappinting considerng that Outback has always been one of our family's and my parents' favorites, but this location just has not cut it for us.  Hopefully they'll make the changes required to return to the quality we'd expect from the Outback."
2,"OK, the blooming onion is terrific, albeit greasy and unhealthy, but who cares about then when you order fried food?
But the steaks--ewwwww. Don't know who is cutting their meats, but that New York I bought last weekend was an awful combination of fat and gristle. And my friend's sirloin was no better.
The waitress was too harried to notice that our steaks remained on our plates when we asked for the check. Too bad."
2,"Well, mama had a birthday.  She wanted to get her birthday ""Slam"", so here we are.

I will rate my food (since I didn't try hers, but I am on record previously not liking the ""Slam"").  I got a simple burger.  It was one of their ""specialty"" burgers, but still a burger.  And fries.  Nothing too adventurous.

The food took a while to come out.  It was sufficiently hot, so I'll assume the made it after we ordered.  Which is good!  The fries were fine.  Nothing special, but fine.  The burger was OK.  Honestly I didn't really taste the difference between this and a normal burger.  And for some reason it was determined to fall apart on me every time I picked it up.

My wife ordered a bowl of soup which wasn't as big as she expected, nor as flavorful.  I'm not rating this, just passing on the feedback.

Then when we wanted to purchase gift cards because they had a special bonus going (and we could use them to pay for this meal...not the bonus cards, just the gift cards) they didn't have any.  That's right!  They advertised this bonus gift card special and then they had NO GIFT CARDS.  That's just sad.

Service was friendly, but often MIA (missing in action).

All in all, mediocre.  I'd say don't bother unless you want a Slam on your birthday, or you're desperate."
2,"Overall the food was average. Definitely nothing to write home to your mom about. 

We arrived shortly before the dinner rush apparently. We were seated quickly but the hostess set us right next to an older gentleman who was reading. And out of all the empty tables - I didn't understand why she did that. I had a kid with a tablet. I think understanding your customer is important but whatever. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers to start - the tuna poke and onion rings. Okay - for $12 I was mad about the tuna poke serving. It was legit small. Taste wise it was okay. Not a lot of seasoning. 

The onion rings were okay too. (I think you'll here that about most of my food). It came with a little tiny cup of dipping sauce. We asked for another and never received it. 

My son's kid meal sweet potato fries had some kind of simple syrup glaze on it. Yeah, he wouldn't eat it. I tried it and it just didn't need it. Sweet potato fries are naturally sweet - why ruin it and make them soggy and add unnecessary sugar? 


I went with the honey bee sting chargrilled chicken wings with a side of broccoli. I think the plain steamed broccoli was the highlight of my meal. I had two friends tell me how amazing these wings were - yeah no. They were pretty bland. 

My man ordered lemon pepper chargrilled wings and they were completely inedible. Super salty and gross. We attempted to complain to the server about it - but he brushed us off. 

We waited a good 15 minutes just to get our check after we asked for it. And then our server wouldn't even get the payment. Some lady came to our table and snatched it from our table. 

I could have complained to management but I was tired and annoyed and just ready to go. Definitely will not go back."
2,"This place is right around the corner from work so a lot of my coworkers have deemed it the Friday Happy Hour location.

The service was alright, they always have 3 ESPN channels on, and their beer selection is mediocre.

Super uncool: my beer glass was incredibly not clean. How does a bartender not look at the glass before pouring a drink? It makes me cringe thinking about it.

I would set this place to a 3 stars, but the glass thing (a week later!) still makes me cringe."
2,"This place is no big deal. I think if you want a change from fast food and want some quick BBq then this place might make you happy. If your hopping to find a great little BBq place that yoiu just cant wait to go back to forget it. Prices are not bad and they do have free ice cream which is always good in my book. I had acombo meal for $8.50. I chose pulled pork and beef brisket on my sanwich. The brisket was tender but no flavor and dry. The pulled pork was really dried out so you needed lots of bbq sauce. I did get two sides with this I got the mac n cheese. This was watery, cheese needed to be thicker. The waffel fries were ok but could have been cooked a little longer so they were crispy. Mabey it was a bad night that I stoped by but i dont think ill be commin back here."
2,"Lunch today a disappointment.  Five meals ordered and three were served with wrong food.  Had to request a clean knife, the one wrapped in napkin had dried food on it.  This was a disappointment compared to other Outback restaurants, would not return to this one."
2,I ordered takeout and the kung-pao chicken was mediocre at best. It didn't have much flavor or spice. The sushi was also pretty gross.
2,"We had an interesting experience with this particular location.  We are fans of Great Harvest in general and have been to three locations here in Las Vegas.  Yesterday we went in to get a loaf of their ""day old"" cheddar garlic loaf.  They had one there and when we paid for it they charged full price vs. the normal 1/2 price for day old.  When I asked about the price we were informed that "" the bread needs to have been baked 24 hours before in order to be day old"".  I then asked what time they normally bake their bread at this location as the others bake all of theirs early in the morning.  The young lady replied that it was put on the rack at 10AM on Thursday.  I noted that it was 3PM on Friday so the 24 hours had definitely passed.  She then changed her story and indicated that the loaf would go on the ""day old"" rack on Saturday morning - nearly 48 hours after it was baked.  So a word to the wise - the ""day old"" bread at this location is really ""two day old"" bread.  Haven't experienced this problem at the other locations."
2,"Seats were comfy , the place was very clean, service was fast but impersonal. The seats were sufficient but somehow our waitress insisted on rushing our table out of the restaurant. When I asked for more water she said no and insisted we leave . Food was good though."
2,"tl;dr: Equipment repair service is great. Pool service gets you $20 worth of effort for $90 per month. 

I really wish I had read these reviews prior to scheduling these guys for weekly pool service. I had nothing but good experiences having Aaron Pools out for equipment repairs, both covered by my home warranty and out-of-pocket repairs. When I had to leave the state for work for a few months and needed someone to maintain my pool during the summer, however, I was very disappointed.

Their website touts weekly pool service to include: brushing pool walls, checking water chemistry, skimming the pool surface, backwashing the filter, and checking the pool equipment. That should take longer than 15 minutes, right?

I'm not sure what they use to test the chlorine and pH levels of the water, but it varies greatly in comparison to my home test kit and Leslie Pools' computer. I noticed the difference two days after they came to the house when my wife sent a picture of a green pool. According to the sheet they scribble chemical readings on, the chlorine was at a normal level and acidity a 7.0. When I called to ask if the tech would add whatever is necessary to keep my pool from being green, I could practically hear Mandi's eyes roll to the back of her head. Mind you, this was after two months of weekly service. I'd estimate the pool is swept once a month and has never been skimmed unless the visit just happened to be the day after a storm. Since I've been back, I've noticed their visit lasts an average of 10 minutes."
2,"Went here for lunch.  It took them foreeeeeeeeever to serve the food.  We're talking 30 minutes to serve salads and soup when the restaurant is dead.  Pretty ridiculous.

Water glass was not kept full, and wasn't refilled for a good ten minutes despite me asking the server for it pointedly.  Waiter got one order incorrect.  Brother's steak took extremely long because the waiter said it wasn't well-done.

Coconut shrimp were small but tasted fine.  Potato soup was good, not too oniony.

Do NOT order any grilled chicken or fish.  It will be extremely dry."
2,"Had eyebrows done and esthetician ripped my skin off in two places. I called and spoke to the manager Casey and she was rude and blamed me for it. I explained I have had this done a number of times and never had any issues. She asked that I come back in and I was seen by a different esthetician. I saw the new esthetician who was extremely professional and relieved the pain I was feeling in my eyebrow. She apologized and explained to me how this could have happened. When we finished she thanked me and apologized once again. When I was leaving, we saw the manager Casey and the esthetician explained to her what happened. The manager never apologized or thanked me for my business. This woman should not be managing a spa of this caliber. I don't plan on going back there again."
2,"Went here on a football Sunday and I was told that the menu was reduced to be quick and more American. This was a disappointment to me as I would not mind waiting for some good French cuisine. I ordered the only traditional plate left on the menu, avoiding the burgers and fries... it was good but there are better places and better food. I don't know much about about French food so I was curious. The music was too loud an rappish (or R&B) so, although I dined alone, I would imagine it would be difficult to carry a conversation. The staff was friendly and service good but that is not enough to bring me back so I will not repeat."
2,"I have been to Chef Ben's a number of times, and it has been enjoyable. This time however, I was not pleased. 

We ordered the sushi bento box since I've had it before and it has always been tasty. This time, it tasted off... the fish tasted old and just was not very good. I shouldn't have to worry if I'm going to get sick from eating my lunch.

The service was also terrible. Had to explain my order 3 different times (I just didn't want soup. Wasn't that complicated). We also had to fill our own drinks due to the waitress not paying attention. That's not that big of deal, but some service would have been nice.

Not sure what happened here today, usually I love Chef Ben's. This time everything felt off and it seems like this once killer restaurant is on it's way downhill."
2,I wanted to really like this place but it just didn't do it for me. My wife and I went for dinner one night and ordered the Korean style short ribs and kalua pork. The short ribs were OK nothing special and the kalua pork was barely warm. We probably won't be coming back anytime soon.
2,Worst service I've ever had. We waited for over 15 minutes to be even noticed where we were seated. We had to ask who our server was....he finally came to ask our order...then long after the salad was eaten....he said our entry would be coming... we finally got our entree and the potatoes were still crunchy and raw. When we told our server that the potatoes were not cooked he told us that the shift likes them aldente. Instead of offering to have them cooked more or something else replaced he offered nothing. Very disappointing the chicken was tasty and the Bread Basket always good the salad was good too
2,"The food and friendly attitude here is the same as every other Dennys, but after waiting 15 minutes to get a table (by myself), I waited nearly an HOUR to get my food without so much as a coffee warmup. That's beyond the pale and I will never return."
2,":( the food is a 1/5 but the service is good so +1 for that.

Came to a empty restaurant craving Lau Lau but unfortunately none was made for the day.

Ordered: 

Kalua pork with cabbage
Loco Moco overeasy

The pork had a decent flavor but lacked protein I feel like I ordered Kalua cabbage with a side of pork :(

As for the loco Moco the flavor of the gravy was quite bland and the party was a bit tough and chewy. The most disappointing part was the over cooked egg, no runny yolk to cover my plate while I enjoyed it. 

I learned my lesson on these 2 menu items, I will give this place another shot to get what I intended to come here for if they have it next week which is the Lau Lau."
2,"I came to this restaurant because I had heard great things about the pizza, and they certainly did not disappoint. There is an atmosphere that makes it inviting for family and friends. 

HOWEVER, the reason I can only give this place a maximum two stars is because I had an uncomfortable encounter with a girl who gave me my food at this establishment. I don't know her name but she was of a short height and a pretty butch looking girl. She had red tinted hair. Her demeanour was what shocked me; she was SO impolite and aggressive to her fellow staff. I witnessed her yelling crude insensitive comments to her coworkers, which made me feel incredibly sorry for them. I couldn't believe the way she treated them and this made me want to get up and leave. When I had asked friends of mine who'd been here before, they also said they remembered a rude female employee with the same type of description 

My advice is, Grazie Ristorante has great food and a cool atmosphere. However this specific employee  should be immediately terminated before she makes more customers feel uncomfortable through hearing her rude remarks to her own staff..."
2,"Well, it was someones birthday. So I ended up here again. 

The slam still didn't look very good, but I had the Santa Fe skillet, and it was very tasty.  The kid enjoyed her chicken fried steak.  And my wife seemed to like her ""Hobbit Hole"" (yeah, Tolkien themed food...).   And the service was friendly and reasonably good.

So I must amend my previous review.  This was a three star visit.   Maybe 2.5 (like I said, the 'slam' still didn't look appetizing to me).  I can definitely recommend the Santa Fe skillet if you come here.  Though it's still not my first choice of places to come, frankly.  But if you order the right things you certainly could do much worse than this place."
2,"Taste and look of the Pizza- 3/10
Restaurant Environment-  10/10
Wait Staff - 5/10
Host Service- 10/0

Would I go back again?

NO



I wanted to go somewhere to have a nice Italian pizza, and not only being Italian I love my pizza. seeing as Grazie is an Italian restaurant which serves pizza I thought I hit the jackpot. 

I walked into Grazie which was packed and full of life, I thought I had made a right decision here. I ordered my pizza ""the Giovanni"" and a glass of red. 

My pizza comes and at first sight I was disappointed, it looked like it came out of a McCains pizza box, it WAS NOT thin crust nor did it taste any special. It was just an average pizza AT BEST. I wouldn't go there for pizza again."
2,"The place looked VERY busy, but there was no waiting for a table. It's one of those sports bar/restaurant places with ""industrial"" ceilings that make it super loud to begin with. But add a packed house, several televisions and loud music and you can't hear yourself think, let alone talk to your table mates. I expected this and it didn't bother me at first but my 22 year old son (who frequents BW3's which is also loud) said he wouldn't go back because of it. 

We ordered the spinach dip to start. Unfortunately--perhaps because it was so loud--the waitress heard chicken tenders. A man came over with the chicken later and we had to send him away TWICE after we informed him we ordered the spinach dip. The waitress came back and asked if we wanted the chicken and we told her--again--we ordered the spinach dip. She said would fix it and she did. The dip came fairly quick after that. But, we barely took one bite before our entrees descended on us. This annoys me because an appetizer is not supposed to be served with the entree and there was no room for 5 large plates and 4 small ones on the pub-style table. However, the dip was quite good. We all agreed.

My son ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. I could see immediately that the chicken was, albeit large, very saturated with oil. He ate it and said it was ok, but refused to eat the fries for the same reason. He tried doctoring them up and still couldn't eat them. They were oily and limp. 

His friend had the rack of ribs. It was $17-ish, I think he said, and not worth it at all. According to him, it was about 20% fat and not tasty. However, this boy eats about 4 things total and is very picky so I'm not sure how accurate that assessment is. He also agreed his fries were very oily but those are one of his staple foods and he ate them.

My son's other friend had a sandwich of some kind, which he devoured. He also said the fries were super greasy, but his mother doesn't let him eat a lot of greasy foods so he thought it was great. LOL. 

I ordered a Cuban sandwich and I really liked it. However, half way through eating my (oily) fries...I realized I had ordered the Kettle chips. So, our order was wrong again. I figured I already ate half of them so I didn't complain.

Getting out of there was fairly speedy. We all considered not tipping (or not tipping much) but I personally having worked for tips in the past couldn't bring myself to punish the waitress for the crappy work of the cooks or the fact that she couldn't hear a damn thing in there. She should have accounted for this and refused to serve bad food or double checked what we wanted, though.

I guess I would give the place another try if someone wanted to, but wouldn't suggest it."
2,"The salads are fresh and crisp. The pasta is ok. The pizza's are very, very good. The service is not at all good. I asked for a house red and was told they don't do house wines. I noticed after I made my order that they had feature wines on a notice board, but I wasn't told about any. Several other tables were served before ours and the service was cool and indifferent. The food is good but I won't bring anyone I'm trying to impress to this location. It just didn't feel special."
2,"We were done shopping at Vaughan Mills and Pickle Barrel had an hour wait for a table so we came to Grazie. The service was friendly and pleasant. They started us off with one basket of bread for the table that wasn't even enough for one piece each, but they happily replenished each time we were out. Some of our waters were dirty so that was questionable. I ordered the Brunello and it was very watery instead of being oily... it was pretty bland, thankfully they came around with parmesan and fresh ground pepper. Not sure I would return again just because it wasn't personally worth it for me."
2,The crab legs were delivered COLD and with no Krackers. No refills on drinks.  Waitress friendly but not accommodating in her profession. Spoke to mgt but doubt it made difference.  I hate leaving bad reviews because the person reading doesnt know the background or basis of my post. Check my other reviews
2,"I'm a regular, eating here at least once a week. I work in the same area. Not one of them recognize me yet (no worries).  Just tired of the ""robotic"" greeting. 

Today, I got my regular pastrami sandwich. Wow. Soooo disappointed. Came in the normal basket.  Here's the deal. Look at the photo. The shredded lettuce covered the basket and sandwich. I didn't order a lettuce sandwich with pastrami. After swiping most of lettuce off to find sandwich, the lettuce filled HALF the basket. 

It seems to be getting worse and worse. 
So sad."
2,"We love going for the lunch specials, the food is decent. The service is very bad, there is hardly any communication. The servers act like they do not want tone there. We ordered the same soup, sushi and rice bowl, but the last two times we got very sick and we have stopped going. Well try again in a month or so."
2,"Is it better than your average fast food place? Yes. Is it the best BBQ ever? No way! 

But Dickeys food is decent. Food is cheap Ribs and pulled pork are good, rolls and okra- darn good. 

Went in the other day because I didn't want to cook, and after watching ""Super Size Me'"" about a month ago, I stay away from the obvious ""fast food"" restaurants completely. So, craving some red meat I went to Dickeys for take out because it was close and I figured their food wouldn't be as processed as McD's- seriously that movie gave me nightmares. 

The staff was super friendly, the football game was on TV., the food was done quickly- giving me enough time to make myself a root beer float and watch AZ lose in OT- :( 

For 3 of us I ordered the ribs, the turkey, coleslaw, mac and cheese, fried okra, potato casserole, and 2 rolls. 

When I got home I was disappointed to see that the turkey looked like processed poo on a plate. Really guys- picture slimy poo on a plate-it was that gross! I refused to taste it, and everyone else was brave enough to at least try it, only to decide they couldn't eat more than 1 bite- but the dog thought it was delicious. 

Never tried the potato casserole because Dickeys forgot to pack it. The mac and cheese was gross! I'm not a salt person, but it definitely needed salt and pepper to give it flavor and the macaroni was over cooked to that gross slimy noodle consistency. 

So, the 3 of us shared 4 ribs, okra, and an individual size coleslaw with 2 rolls- one person was hungry enough to go ahead and eat the mac and cheese even though he didn't like it. 

Dickeys would have gotten 1 star but the ribs and okra were pretty darn good and I made one hell of a root beer float while I was there. 

I may be seen in Dickeys again because I have a fondness for fried okra and I have tried their pulled pork Sandwiches before and liked it. But I will definitely check my takeout before I leave to make sure it is all there and I will never order the mac and cheese or processed turkey poo again."
2,"The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule."
2,"Doctors seem fine but if you are planning to have an ""on time"" appointment, even if you are scheduled first thing in the morning, beware. This office NEVER runs on time and has no respect for their patient's calendar or time. Always at lease one hour late with no explanation."
2,"Very confused by this spot.  When I lived up town (2012), I remember this place being very different.  The location is so so amazing so I hope they really step their game up. They are right across from the brand new park Uptown.  They advertise their dishes to be ""comfort food with a touch of cajun"" but that really doesnt come through at all.  It is simply a Greek restaurant called French Quarter.  

Having said that, they do have very good daily lunch specials and numerous local beers on tap up at the bar.  I have stopped in here a few times for a quick lunch while at work and ordered the chicken tips.  The best part was the gravy.  Everything else... so-so.  

-Ian M."
2,"Mediocre all around

Mediocre food and subpar service

We were a party of 20 coming in for a birthday, from the get go we were treated as though we were in convenicing them because we happened to be waiting in their narrow bar area waiting for a table to be ready

Finally when the tables freed up we were seated and told they couldnt do separate tabs but would do it by table... hmmm ok even Moxies and Jack Astors can manage separate tabs but sure lets go with it

We order a Caesar salad to start and the trapani and teramo pasta dishes.

The server brought out 2 baskets of crusty bread with one tiny saucer of oil/vinegar for a table setting 12 people. Basically one side of the table got to use the oil/vinegar and the other side went without and had to try and track the server down in order to request some for the others, which in of itself took 20 mins. The bread with rock hard, everyone was commenting how it was so crusty that it felt like it was cutting your gums and the roof of your mouth

After the server initially brought us water, it never occurred to him or the other assistants they had to replenish the water or offer refills... even though they walked by and constantly glanced at our tables10 to 15 times.

When the mains came out, again one side the the table was offered parm and black pepper and the other side was forgotten until one of us managed to flag someone down

The food itself was ok. It wasn't bad and it wasn't something to come home about. To be perfectly honest, its not anything you couldn't make at home.

When it came down to the bill I guess the server had a change of heart and decided all of a sudden he could split the tabs, except since he decided he would do this at the end he managed to have everyones tabs differently. When I asked him if he could correct the bill his words are he couldn't handle the corrections and he couldn't handle splitting it it according to what it needed to be split. No offense buddy, but when you're automatically making 18% gratuity I don't think clicking on a screen here and there is too much work. Nor do I think making sure we have water, bread, oil, vinegar should be considered too much to handle. He had about 5 other servers helping him and he or Grazie in general was acting like they were hosting a wedding reception because they were managing 2 tables.

You would think knowing getting 18% would ensure good, courteous and prompt service. But the service at Grazie was geared towards small tables were I guess for them hoping for 15% is their target. Doesn't make any sense to me and based on that and theyre mediocre food none of us will be coming back. Ciao Grazie Arrivederci!"
2,"Trader Joe's as a concept is hard to resist.  Everything you need on a regular basis is under one ""hood"".  Never mind that we don't know the exact provenance of branded items, with bags of ""designer"" salad at less than $3, who has time for trivial questions?  As it turns out, there are major inconsistencies with specific brand products with respect to quality control.  On a recent trip, I made the fateful decision of trying what they label Multi-Grain Country Style Bread.  If there is ANY bread out there that tastes more like wood pulp, I'd be really surprised.  Also disappointing was the bulk-sliced white cheddar cheese, albeit the ""lite"" variety, which had a synthetic and bitter quality all it's own.  It also had sticky paper in between each slice which may be a problem for sight impaired or the elderly.  Finally, the low sodium turkey was also low flavor, save for a smoky aftertaste that was likely the last stop on the assembly line where it was packaged.  

As with restaurants, I hate playing russian roulette with my own money, and for that reason, I will patronize places like Jenifer St. Market when I want a local version of the above chain."
2,Food was just food it seems like Dennys has gone downhill and I have been very disappointed with Denny's. Corporate has no idea what the public wants. Since the menu change everything seems to be a disappointment. The server was ok but seem to be more interested in cleaning and bussing tables instead of finishing  working with my table.
2,"Arrived to be seated my a friendly hostess. But seconds after being seated noticed 2 dead bugs on our table.  Waitress laughed and made a joke of it.  Not amused.  

Food was good.  Not fantastic but not bad either.   Was slow to come out and with a few errors but they did correct them.  

I Would return for the sliders."
2,80 mins deep tissue massage costs 205 dollars plus tip. However the massage therapist did not perform a deep tissue massage at all. I am always bad at face to face confrontation so I was not able to tell them this was probably one of the worst deep tissue massages I ever received.
2,"GH used to be one of my favorites. The Bonanza location was seriously the best and is sorely missed. I went to the Marks store today for lunch...where do I begin? I was greeted by a less than friendly cashier who not once offered me a slice of bread. No biggie since I would have declined anyway but not to be offered...strange. I got a very simple turkey sandwich and other than the bread (which was, as usual, fantastic!) it was really lackluster. The turkey was somewhat dry and the edges of the cheese were hard. I got it with basil mayo but it was so scarce I couldn't taste it-not one bit. 
Maybe the most disappointing part of my visit was the sugar cookies. What in the crap has happened to the formerly soft, buttery, fresh cookies with the perfect amount of delicious frosting? Let me tell you...they're not to be found at this store! The cookies were hard! Not inedibly hard but just not the soft sugar cookies that, in my book, made GH my most favorite cookie stop. Boo! 
To add insult to injury, I get all the back to work and realize that I never got my drink! Ugh! I love your bread, GH, but I will not be back for sandwiches or cookies!"
2,"As a breakfast snob I really do not like Denny's.  They don't really do anything especially well.  Also, I've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions.  I can't slam this place for one unpleasant waitress, but I can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better.

In fact, this place was the very last Denny's I ever ate.  The food took forever, it wasn't well done, came out all screwed up, and the waitress was unpleasant.  After that experience I decided to never set foot in another Denny's."
2,"Yes, it's been a year (or more?), but I'm here again.  Late night at work, late from the gym, and hungry.  With most places closed or closing.  And we had a coupon for Denny's.

It's a diner.  A mediocre diner, but a diner.  The service was good.  Looking at my past reviews that seems to be a constant.  I decided to try something different.  Not a burger.  Not a chicken-fried steak.  I got this chicken skillet thing.  It wasn't fancy.  Some sauteed vegetables and potatoes (maybe even pan-fried) and a few pieces of boneless chicken.  It was tine.  I thought the flavor was nice.  Nothing special, but nice.

We then opted for the ""sundae"".  It was three scoops of ice cream with chocolate syrup and crumbled oreos.  It wasn't as good as it sounds.  It was OK.  Not bad.  But not as good as it sounds like it should be."
2,"I used to patronize Great Harvest regularly but not so much these days. For one thing, the bread, though fresh baked, sometimes has an odd odor, often excessively yeasty. And way too much sodium, if you check the package. Pricey too at $5.95 for a loaf of honey whole wheat. Some employees at the Marks St. location are a bit lackadaisical and take their time serving customers, to the point where I've had to call to workers behind the counter to get their attention. However, they do give out generously-sized samples to anyone who walks through the door, which is always a plus. Caution: They have a ""light wheat"" bread, which sounds like reduced-calorie (doesn't it?) but turns out to be half white and half wheat. Seems misleading."
2,"I'm totally confused. It's called French Quarter, giving the southern-Nola type food idea, owned by Greek people, and called French food. I looked at the menu and saw more Greek options than Nola/French inspired. In fact there was like one ""cajun"" option......So why be deceitful? Being from Louisiana I'm always skeptical of french/cajun restaurants but this one didn't even try! Sorry....not falling for the trick."
2,"Nice clean restaurant. Typical sports bar type fare with a few twists. I had a meatball sandwich, which featured their homemade meatballs. The meatballs weren't very good. The sandwich was clumsy and a but undercooked as there was a cold spot as I ate it. The hand cut fries were disappointing as they had no salt on them. It was okay, but nothing I would crave or want to return for."
2,The French dip sandwich was really good and well cooked. The wings were mediocre. The service at the bar was fairly poor and slow. It wasn't really busy on a mid week evening and the 2 bartenders didn't really seem to have much of a clue. She was only friendly when she handed me the bill. I wouldn't go back.
2,"It was like a real outdoor bbq, complete with flies everywhere. Only problem, we were sitting inside! Gross. Food was okay but I was too grossed out by the flies. Won't return. Doubt this place will last."
2,"I had the pumpkin chocolate chip bread and it was delicious! However, the customer service was awful. I ordered a cold turkey sandwich and received a hot grilled one that wasn't good because the turkey over powered the bread and it had way too much of the sauce they used. As a person that worked in customer service for 15 years, I was very disappointed at the girl's attitude at the cash register and the way she handled the situation. I wouldn't go back to this place."
2,"The concept is all you can eat BBQ. Order up your meats and vegetables and you cook them on the round circular grill . 

There's a veggies option for $3 more. It includes lettuce, pineapple, onions, green pepper, mushroom, roasted garlic. We tried this tonight, it was pretty good, and  breaks up the monotony of a pure meatfest. Lettuce wrapped beef = yum! 

It's fricken cold in here. It is sparsely decorated, a majority of the seating is at the second level. 

The service was terrible tonight. We found ourselves having to ask at least twice for anything and if he had forgotten we didn't bother asking again. 

I'd say only worth it to go late night  (after 10pm) or during lunch when it's $8.99. I would also strongly advise to not sit downstairs. It cold and the kitchen is upstairs to begin with. 

Oh yeah the food, this time leaving the worse til last. Massively salty."
2,The food was good enough and the prices were fair with pastas at around $16 and meat dishes at $25. However our server was unscrupulous by not announcing the prices of the daily specials. We assumes that they were similar to the regular menu prices but were not. The veal special was $38 and two other specials were $30-$35.We ordered 2 Chardonnays and the server suggested that we should  order 1/2 litre instead which turned it to be $32.We had two deserts and 3 coffees and the total tab came to $229 for 4.Buyers beware!
2,"I've been to many Italian restaurants and this is one of the worst ones I've been to. 
First off, make sure to book a reservation on weekends since it can get very busy. We waited for 45 minutes before we were seated in the crowded dining area.
I ordered pasta with shrimp and it was not good. The sauce was very liquidy and the pasta was overcooked. It didn't have much flavour either.
I wouldn't return here. Much better restaurants in the area."
2,"Disclosure: I am having PRK done elsewhere because of my experience with Jason. I am giving Wellish a two, however, because even though a member of their staff might be misogynistic, at least he was prompt. Intrigued? 

Jason is one the dudes who does consultations there. I don't know if he is the only guy or one of many. He seemed likable, at first. We chatted a bit and then got down to business with the tests and then afterwards came the sexism. 

Jason: ""I always ask the women this...so, how scared are you?""

So weird, right? Apparently fear is something only women experience! I never knew! And then...I can't even really describe it really. He was pushy and there was just something slimy and kind of creepy about him. He was really condescending and alternated between treating me like an uninformed child or some kept, trophy wife woman who hasn't a clue how the world works. It was really off-putting.

I left the office and had another consultation and then emailed Jason some follow up questions. It took forever to get a clear response from him and again, the weirdness continued. It felt like he mocked me for being concerned about money (the other place I'm going to is $400 cheaper) and then started talking about how I can't see LASEK the same way I would a ""mommy makeover"" or ""breast augmentation."" What those have in common with eye surgery, I do not know, and the fact that those were the examples he gave just solidified my thought that this guy is a creep. It's too bad, too, because I was really considering the Wellish Institute based off their reviews, but I didn't want to deal with Mr. Creepy Jason."
2,Had the Teri Beef plate. Flavor wise their marinade is onolicious but I have to go to back to my usual loco kine grindz spot Island Flavor. I'm a big eater and I struggle to finish the heaping plate of thick juicy steak at Island Flavor. The Kauai Cafe teri beef was tasty but the portion was like a mini plate for $10.76 out the door. I had to go directly to the nearby Carl's Jr to have 2 bacon guacamole burgers right after because I was still so hungry.
2,"I ordered a pizza for myself. The food was great. The issue was my server who was hardly present during my lunch. I came here on a weekend and the restaurant was half full at most. We were promptly seated and then waited 8 minutes before we got water and bread. When we were ready to order, our server was hardly anywhere to be found. My friend and I finished our water and waited for another 15 minutes before anyone came to refill our water and take our order. Mind you, we sat next to the computer system where the servers punch in, so we saw servers quite frequently, but never OUR server. Our food arrived and it was great, but not once did our server come by to ask if everything was okay or refill our drinks. It was insulting because we saw him asking other guests how everything went and also laughing with them. Every refill after had to come from us asking other waiters as they walked by to refill water.

I wish I remembered his name so I could give a proper complaint. I remember he had a beard and an average/bit muscular build. I wish there would have been a way to redirect our entire tip to the servers who were actually present during our stay."
2,"Pros: Free underground parking with elevators into the shopping center, very friendly staff, large wine section, plenty of checkout lanes (as long as they are fully staffed).

Cons: There is a covered parking lot connected to the main entrance - this is city parking and NOT free. Shocked by the lack of fresh produce. Small shoppe with random sections, seems disorganized, a bit aloof. 

Overall opinion: It's very hippie-dippie. Where's all the fresh produce? I was expecting A LOT more and A LOT better selection. Unless you don't mind your produce wrapped in plastic - they've got lots of that. I was most surprised by their extraordinarily large amount of desserts and sugar / processed foods. I was under the impression this was a grocery chain which promoted healthy options. Coming from Green Bay, we have a place called Fresh Thyme - which is a glorious place with a ton of fresh produce, bulk syrups like honey and molasses, bulk coffees, a juicery, a deli, and bakery. The overall cost is very reasonable. This is what I expected to compare Trader Joe's to, because I was told the two chains were similar. 

I was recommebded to go there for their ""generous coffee and tea section."" That turned out to be a farce. I think they have 4 types of company coffee and a handful of others. 

This place reminded me of World Market but without all the international items and without the furniture or beer section. I bought some coffee, lunch meat, bread, cheese, a bottle of wine and some eggs. $55. I thought HyVee was expensive. 

I recommend this place only for specific items like specialized flour or if you just need a gallon of milk or eggs. They've otherwise got a crap load of desserts!"
2,Stopped for a late lunch here. It wasn't very busy yet we still waited quite some time for anyone to get to us. We ordered a burger & a chicken sandwich. Both were okay but nothing special.  The service was incredibly slow & our drinks went unfilled until someone other than our waiter refilled them. Asked for ranch & honey mustard & didn't get that until we were both about done with our meals. Pretty pricey for what you get. Doubt we'll be back
2,"I have been to this spa several times since moving back to Phoenix. Their services are great - love the facials, massages and haircut/style services. The problem I've run into my last two appointments is the complete lack of customer service. My last visit a month ago I waited 35 minutes for my appointment (25 minutes past my appointment time). No one came to check on me or apologize for running late. I had to go up to the front desk and inquire about my appoinment... then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes. 

Today I made an appoinment for a Mother's Day haircut and again, got there 10 minutes early and sat for 30 minutes waiting. Not very busy surprisingly, which made it strange that no one payed attention to the fact that it was 20 minutes past my appoinment time and hadn't been taken back. I again inquired at the front desk and was told he was still with the clients whose appoinment proceeded mine, and they had no ETA on when he would be done. No offer to find someone else to cut my hair, just an ""I'm sorry."" Since my husband and son were having ice cream and waiting for me, I had to leave... 30 minutes after my scheduled appoinment time.

I will not be going back to Red Door at Biltmore."
2,Went today for lunch and were there a couple minutes before they opened. We were seated immediately in the bar area. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful but it took about 15 minutes to get the bread and butter and when we did get it it was hard. Like they just toasted an old loaf and served it to us. My husband ordered the grass fed burger with cheddar and i had the prime rib french dip sandwich. My husband said his burger was ok. My sandwich however seemed like had stale or day old bread. We notified the waiter in regards to the bread and he apologized and said the head waiter whom is supposed to have fresh bread ready was 20 minutes latr that day and they just were really not ready when they opened today. He did offer to bring us fresh bread but it was a little late at that point but he brought it anyway and it was better.  Outback is pretty expensive for lunch and I do expect a bit more for my money when eating herr. I can say I am now over Outback and will stick to Texas Roadhouse even though they don't serve lunch during the week.
2,"I usually go to Denny's for their breakfast.  I've never ventured out to their lunch/dinner menu. Now I know why I avoided it for so long. It was not good. I had the ""new"" Chicken and Avocado Sandwich.  It had pico de gallo and sour cream on it too. The only thin I tasted was sour cream and chicken. The pico de gallo and avocado had no flavor whatsoever. My fries also were way too salty and didn't come out with the sandwich. Not a huge deal.

We did have a few more food issues around the table. My wife's turkey bacon was not cooked at all. It looked like it came right out of the package. Her toast was also burnt--both items were sent back.  Our waitress was quick and friendly about the errors and was very apologetic.

Luckily my daughter didn't finish her pancakes so I did enjoy something.  From now on, it's breakfast at Denny's."
2,"I was driving by and saw this place so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the brisket sandwich. The meat was tender and quite tasty but all 3 of the BBQ sauces that they had were bad. I love good BBQ and to me and my husband, the sauce is a huge part of the meal. I'm sorry to say that we won't be going back anytime soon, even though the price was right."
2,"Decent place for apps and standard  American bar fare.  Not a huge fan of this type of food, but if that's what you like, they do a good job.

Chicken fingers, fries and dipping sauces.  Tasty, but not great for cholesterol levels.  

Mid-to-lower-mid price hangout joint / bar area.  

Staff has always been friendly.  Don't see a lot of managers; but, that doesn't seem to have made a difference in a negative way.  

Wait personnel, greeters, etc., all young. . .but nice."
2,"Really disappointed by this place.  We've tried a lot of good, authentic, flavourful Korean places in North York, but this place is not one of them.  The ribs for 2 cooked on your table was rough and poorly seasoned.  I have done much better ribs myself at home.  Side dishes were boring particularly the kim chi was a let down.  Pricey parking nearby as well."
2,"This place is okay. I don't know, it doesn't really do it for me. I'll start this off by saying I've never eaten here, only drinks a few times around 9pm-12am on Saturday nights. It has a strange vibe that I don't really like, because every time I've been there late at night for drinks, they close half of the restaurant, their ""dining room"" down. Maybe I'm just bein weird, but it's not really inviting to have half your place shut down, lights off, chairs on tables. I come with a group of friends and last time we walked in, there was 2 tables dirty and dirty drinks lined up on the bar and the bartender told me to sit at the bar...so we almost left but a different waitress cleaned up a table for us. The bartender was more concerned with her boyfriend/interest at the bar than cleaning up/good service/etc. 

This place isn't a dancing bar, it's not a sports watching bar, it's just got a dad-sits and drinks at the bar by himself kinda vibe. Maybe like BWW's without as many TVs or wings. They play a weird mix of music but there's touch tunes, I guess, if you wanna spend like $1/song. Got some sports...stuff on the walls. 

The service is average, the drinks are priced average. I think Average Moose is more accurate than happy moose - at least after 9pm."
2,"So, after hearing what others had to say about Happy Moose, I held some high expectations on the place.  I must say, they were greatly misplaced.  It's a general, run of the mill gastropub.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  

When you first walk in, there are NO signs that say if you have to wait to be seated or if it was seat yourself.  After waiting for 5-6 minutes, hubby and I decided to seat ourselves, when someone miraculously appeared to seat us.  The place was NOT busy, so I really don't understand what took so long.

We were seated at a tall table with chairs and our waitress promptly came by and took our drink orders.  After a few more minutes, she returned with our drinks and took our orders.  I must say, the promptness of the food would have given them 5 stars.  Within 5 minutes, we had our orders.  Hot and yummy.  I ordered the Irish Nachos because I was told that they were ""to die for.""  I tasted them and was like, ""Meh.  I've had better.""  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't ""to die for"" either.  I really have had better.  I was offered a refill on my ice tea just after the check came, so points lost of that.  While the service overall was friendly, it was not always prompt.  The place looked clean overall, but I didn't get a chance to visit the restrooms.  While there are TV's everywhere, the rest of the decor was sparse.   The big windows bring lots of light to a very dark place, so I'd hate to see how dark it really is in the evening.

While I won't write them off, I certainly won't promote them either.   Are they kid friendly.  I would not bring my kids here in the evening.  Yes, for lunch in the middle of the day, but definitely NOT in the evening or dinner.  Yeah.... You won't catch me being a regular here."
2,"The only thing I like about this restaurant is all you can eat for a reasonable price and a good atmosphere. They provided an ordering form so we can number the items that we want to eat. Also, I like how they have the grill in the middle of the table so we can grill it ourselves. Overall, it was a good atmosphere.   

Services at this place is average to poor. They get really busy and they didn't bother coming back to check on us and see if we want more food. We were ignored most of the time and had to remind them constantly if we want some thing for our table. The servers seem unhappy when serving. 

Food taste is average. They provide good meat options but it appears that they didn't bother to take time to marinate it. All of them taste the same, salty. I would suggest ordering the beef ribs, lamb, and chicken. They don't have a variety of kimchi and it tastes average at best. 

Overall, if you like to eat a lot and don't care about taste or service, go here. Otherwise, there are better Korean restaurants out there."
2,Not really sure how to rate this place. I mean its ok but I have had better. Maybe its because I have gone close to closing each time and I am getting what is left but hey it is what it is. The polish sausage was good as well and the bread was nice and warm. Oh and they do give you free ice cream. You will have to judge for yourself on this one.  Its not my favorite bbq place as the portions are kinda small and its just lacking a certain something that I can't quite put my finger on.
2,"Allow me to quality this review based on my 6 visits to the Wellish Vision Institute on Box Canyon, over the course of 5 weeks.

This review is not on the quality of work performed by Dr Wellish.  He did an excellent job caring for my Dad, who had cataract surgery, on each eye, 4 weeks apart.  My father is very happy with the results, and the follow-up care was exemplary, particularly Dr Ortiz, who we both really liked.  He was thorough and answered all our questions clearly.  Again, this review has nothing to do with the doctors themselves.

What ticks me off is the total lack of respect, this office has towards patients, when an appointment is scheduled for 1:15 pm, and after being moved from the front waiting room, to another, large. rear waiting room, it wasn't until 3:20 pm that we were called in to see the doctor.
Another epic scheduling fail, was arriving for a 9:10 am appointment and not being seen until 10:45 am.
To me, this is really an unacceptable practice, on their part, and it is a shame because I will not recommend this physician to others, based on their poor scheduling efficiency.
Here's one more example...
My Dad's first surgery was scheduled for 2 o'clock and he wasn't wheeled off until 3:40 pm.
The shortest wait time we ever had was about 40 minutes.  Whoever is responsible for scheduling this office's appointments really does their whole practice a gross injustice.

My Dad has 2 more follow-up appointments, already scheduled, and I will update this review, as appropriate."
2,"Not really sure why they call this place The French Quarter. Nothing about the menu items say Louisiana or French Quarter. The decor has slight hints of Bourbon Street. My family ordered the bacon burger, chicken fingers, and a Greek wrap. No real kids menu.  The food was very tasty, waitress was very cordial. Nice place for basic bar food."
2,"The brisket was dry.  The green beans were bland.  The baked beans were watery.  My daughter thought it was soup. The brisket sandwich was okay. Mac and cheese good.  Fried okra was decent.  

The sandwich and one side and drink was $8

Would  I go back?  No."
2,I ordered the dish online and received it after 1 hour and my drink only had 70% in the cup .. this is the second time I have this situation
2,"This restaurant was very difficult to find.  I drove all around the Smith's shopping center on W Tropicana Ave/S Hualapai Ave in Las Vegas. It was located between the Subway and a Chinese restaurant.

They have a Facebook page which updates their specials and their closures due to equipment malfunction or family death.  I was planning on going and they just happened to be closed those days.  They are also closed on Mondays.

They had a limited menu.  I ordered the Kalbi Short Rib Plate($10.95) and the Won Ton Min ($8.95) to go.  They offer a Military discount like many of the other Hawaiian restaurants in the area which saved me a few dollars.

The 3 strips of Kalbi was served on a bed of raw shredded cabbage.  There was one large scoop of rice and a partial regular scoop of macaroni salad.  The texture of the macaroni salad was a little grainy, like it was whole wheat.  It was pretty tastless compared to other Hawaiian restaurants.  The Kalbi was grilled medium and was tough and fatty.

The Won Ton Min had about 5-6 won tons.  They were very bland including the broth.  The saimin texture was also a little grainy.  It was garnished with sliced fish cake, char sui, spam, carrots, cooked scrambled egg, and green onions. 

I was very disappointed with the food."
2,"First off, there are not many french options when I went which was odd... but the Monte Cristo was fantastic, the service was supa slow though"
2,Well this place sure went downhill. Waitress never checked on us once. Had to ask another tables waitress for a refill. 2 stars only because the food was ok. Except the pancakes. I mean have they always used high fructose corn syrup???
2,The wait was short but the quality of care by the doctor was ridiculous.  Extremely overpriced for the care of my son with total disregard for any previous interactions with other medical doctors.  Dehydration seems to be the go to diagnosis for everything and yet they failed to provide any treatment.  If he's so dehydrated why wasn't he given an IV?  Complete waste of time and money!!  I have completely lost my confidence in the healthcare system after seeing three doctors and no real diagnosis.
2,"Really? I got a concrete paid for extra Oreo, when she handed it to me I questions it so she took it back and asked the manager, who had it remade, and this is what I got! Less then before. The fact that they charge .70 for extra. Really disappointed"
2,"My husband and I ate here 4 days ago and I wasn't impressed. I had order a chicken burger and there was hardly any chicken, I felt the chicken was lost in the bun but had tons of flavour. As for the beef He felt the bun was soft, beef was flavourful but more bun then meat. Our burgers were upgraded to a combo and the poutine was too salty for me but he enjoyed. Spent about $25 for two burgers a poutine, fries and two drinks.

I wouldnt recommend anyone to eat here. I say buy your own ground beef season it to your liking and grill, pan fry or bake to perfection."
2,"I had my knee surgery here back in January. That's the only reason in giving this crap hospital 2 stars. 
 As I sit here in Arrowhead Hospital now. I realize I will never come back here again.
 I came in the ER two days ago in excruciating pain. Everything was fine until I was admitted. 
 They had put me on an antibiotic that I think did more harm than good.  Tonight I have to say I've got the worst nurse I've ever had. I waited almost an hour and a half for pain medication.  Yes. It was due at 8pm. Didn't get it til 9:30.  Some computer problem. Ok. Understandable. But don't ignore me. Explain it. I'm in pain. I don't want to chase you for my medication.  Do your job. 
  Gallbladder attack.  They want to do test after test. If there's nothing wrong. Quit trying to find something wrong. Cut me loose.  I'm in an incredible amount of pain. I guess that is normal like the tests. 
I'd rather go somewhere else and get a second opinion."
2,Overrated and our first time trying this place out. The prices were high for what you get. The double burger patties maybe equaled the size of a regular burger any where else. The steak burger tastes like regular hamburger. They forgot an order of our fries. We noticed when we were already home. I'd go again if someone requested but I wouldn't go here.  Smash Burger and In n Out are better
2,"Mediocre burgers, surprisingly small and expensive. Service is terrible"
2,"I don't like the set-up of the showrooms here.

When you walk in the building, there's the box office, a small bar where you can order food, and a couple tables where you can eat or just hang out before/after the show. They also have a few video game machines. Don't expect anything fancy.

There are two rooms here: the Mainstage and the Cabaret. I have seen shows in both rooms.

The Mainstage room can fit over 100 people but it's pretty small and cramped. Most chairs are the foldable type and they are very close together. There is little leg room and little elbow room. I saw a show here on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy, maybe a quarter full, so I got to spread my legs. Had it been packed, I would've been very uncomfortable. The floor isn't graded so if you get stuck behind a big person you're gonna have a bad time.

The Cabaret room is smaller than the Mainstage room. It holds about 30-40 people. Seating is a mix of lone chairs, chairs with tables, and couches. It is less cramped than the Mainstage room. I went here on a Saturday night and it was almost full. Some things I didn't like included the fact that the doors to this room were glass, so if you're sitting near them or facing them, it can be tempting to look out into the lobby/bar area. Also, the room wasn't sound-proofed all that well so the noise from the lobby/bar area was somewhat distracting. I don't know how well the Mainstage room is sound-proofed since I didn't go there on a busy night. The floor isn't graded in the Cabaret room either but that isn't as much of a problem since the seating is more mixed and the sightlines are better.

Their website has pictures of both rooms so you can see for yourself.

There is no waiter service during the shows in either room. If you want something to eat or drink, you either have to order it before the show and bring it in with you or you have to get up during the show and leave the showroom to get it yourself. This is the only comedy club I've been to in Toronto without waiter service. In both rooms, most of the seats do not have an accompanying table so you'd have to hold your food/drink in your hand or in your lap or put it on the seat next to you if there's no one there. 

The comedy itself (in both rooms) was below-average but a few acts were good. I know comedy shows can be hit or miss but even on a good night, I would still have serious issues with the layout of the rooms which would prevent me from fully enjoying myself.

The staff were friendly and the pre-show atmosphere around the bar was okay. The shows I saw were Jokebox Live and Momics. Both ran for about 1.5 hours. Sometimes the shows sell out early depending on the day of week and what show it is.

I was not happy with this place."
2,"Probably about 15% of what I saw was funny.  If the show wasn't free I would be giving this place one star.  Did I maybe hit an off night, possibly, I guess only a return trip will tell."
2,"I have had Burger Factory bookmarked for the longest time.  Finally after more than a year I got around to trying it and let me tell you I was very disappointed.  Ordered 2 cheesy Lucy combos and added bacon.  The price was just over $30.00 so already that rang a bit of a bell for me.  I don't mind paying a bit more for something good so although $30 seemed high to me it wasn't that big of a deal.  We sat down and waiting almost half hour for our meal.  Now if it was busy then I can understand but there were only 2 people sitting in the restaurant on that Wednesday afternoon.  Again I don't mind waiting as long as its worth the wait in the end.  Upon receiving my order my first thing were to try the fries.  The fries were awesome.  Fresh cut, salted perfect and nice and crispy.  This made me even more excited to try the burger.  Upon opening the wrapped of the burger all I could see was a bun soaking in burger juice.  The bun became super soggy which was my first turn off.  For the price paid for that burger it was very small.  Burger was tasteless, bacon under cooked, bread soggy.  The middle of the patty was stuffed with cheese and was nice and melted as the pictures showed but didn't do much to help the taste.  After my meal was completed I had the nasty taste of plain unseasoned meat in my mouth for hours.  I give 2 stars only for the fries.  Very disappointed.  I could have caught them on a bad day but seeing how many burger joints I passed along the way to Burger Factory I wont be returning again."
2,"We are long time Freddy's customers and have sent lots of friends here for great burgers, fries and custard. Tonight's visit was a disappointment however. I ordered my single burger California style, and it was pretty much a salad on a bun.  The ""burger"" was quite literally a whisper of meat that was so thin and crisply fried that I couldn't even taste it. It couldn't have been more than 2 ounces of meat. I left hungry after spending $8 on a combo. Not good Freddy!"
2,"Firstly I wish you could give half ratings on yelp.  Cause then I'd give this place 2.5/5 
They do seem to have a good selection but honestly the burger wasn't terrific.  
I got the veggie burger (looked like a quinoa patty)  with the basics of lettuce,  tomatoes and onions.  And then some fried cheese. 
They do have a good selection of toppings though. I loved that fried cheese was an option,  since that's rare, but I could barely taste it because the patty was so thick.  
I also got a side of fries... And man... The fries were terrible.  They were thinly cut,  which is fine,  but they were all wilted and over oiled.  I really did not enjoy them, which was unfortunate cause I was really in the mood for fries and I ate them all anyways. 
The lady who took my order was very nice and I got out relatively quickly cause I was first in line when I got in. 
I didn't eat in but noticed the layout wasn't great but was actually still similar to a lot of places in the area, as there's only a limited amount of things you can do with a space that small. 

Service 5/5
Burger 2.5/5
Fries 0/5"
2,"Good service and delicious cornbread are not enough to recommend the successor to Fisher's.  Tough chicken, pulled pork and tasteless hamburger are surprisingly available at this restaurant run by the excellent Quagliata restaurant family.
The menu is extensive and maybe there are items which would have been better, but half of our group vowed never to return to try them.  Too bad."
2,The first time in had a burger and fries. They were ok. The second time had a hot dog here. It tasted ok but made me feel pretty sick later. Won't be going back.
2,"Great Day to take a stroll on Yonge street and decided give this place a try. Pictures of the burgers looked absolutely delicious, but when I ordered it, it looked different and super tiny. I don't mind if it's small as long as it tasted good. I ordered the Canadian Eh burger. I couldn't taste the meat because it was about 1/8 inch high, 
The cheese was over melted on the griddle, bacon was not crispy and the worst part of it all was the bun. The bun was moist and soggy. The bun wasn't toasted enough. Overall, experience was not good. Overpriced for a 11 dollar burger."
2,"Didn't really enjoy the burger. Tasted very generic like something I would cook at home from a frozen box of patties. The poutine was good but since this place is known for its burgers (according to its name) I have to give it below average for taste. 

Another complaint I have is that the seating area was really crammed.. It was hard to fit the 4 of us comfortably at lunch time.

I won't be going back here."
2,"First off, the burgers are OVERPRICED! I seriously thought the burgers were big which is why I decided to buy the burger. I tried the BUROGIE BURGER because the of burger of the day wasn't my thing I also brought large fries but changed it to small size and the cashier gave me attitude because I gave her the amount for the large fries. I CLEARLY SAID ""I WANTED SMALL FRIES INSTEAD!"" (No, I didn't yell)Then I hear one of the cooks saying 'that's a lot of fries' I just wanted to leave! Clearly, they didn't respect me and think no one can change their minds at the last minute and worst part, they just put the fries in the fryer! Ok, they're done wrap my burger and but the fries in a brown box but the cashier puts the fries in WITHOUT closing the top and put it in a brown bag. I'm thinking maybe there's no lock on top of the box or something so I let it go. But once I'm at home, the box actually has a closing section on top! the cashier either didn't give a damn or just being lazy! smdh! I didn't even get to the burger! The burger was SMALL and SLIGHTLY BURNT! If I didn't spend over $9+ for a burger or extremely hungry, I would've thrown it out from the first bite!"
2,"This is not a review for comedy, as I didn't get to see any, but a review of food and venue.

The layout is confusing and the staff is none-too-willing to help you navigate the place. As Karl R has said, ""it's confusing for the first time visitor and the staff seems to assume you know the setup."" Staff was decidedly unhelpful and I saw more than a few people milling around trying to figure out what the etiquette was. I overheard ""What time does the show start?"" ""Where is the stage?"" ""Do you guys have food?"" etc.

You walk in (basement) and there's a bar. You can sit at the bar and order food. To the right there's an area with tables, where you can eat said food. To the left (unseen) there is a corridor that leads to the secluded/soundproofed comedy area with stage. I learned this by essentially giving myself a tour and wandering through the place and opening every door possible and poking around. It's pitch black in the comedy room, so if the show has already started, STFU and stand wherever you can because finding a seat in the dark is obtrusive to the performance and the room is tighter than a...I don't know.

I asked the bartender what time the next show started, but she didn't know. I accepted the fact that I would not be enjoying any comedy that night, and since I was famished, I ordered food - Mac & Cheese. It was not good. 

I must not have been the only person who thought so, because just now when I went to check the website for the exact price (I recall it being ~$9), it was no longer on the menu. Thank you, Comedy Bar, for removing this underwhelming version of a dish that should be difficult to fuck up from your menu. It was watery instead of creamy, lacking salt and any semblance of cheesiness despite (reportedly) containing three types of cheese. I would even say it was offensively bland, but I was so hungry I plowed through exactly 1/3 of it - and I don't exactly scoff at anything with the words ""baked"" and ""cheese"" in the description."
2,"Burgers were fresh but they had an aftertaste to me. The fries weren't the greatest, they were soggy. It isnt really too good of a place to sit and relax. After looking around this is definitely not worth coming back for."
2,"I want to give this place a way better review, as I've seen some good shows there. However, last time I went, I put my credit card behind the bar to open a tab, and they completely lost my credit card. They told me that they've lost cards before and can usually find them. After reassuring me that they always find it in the morning when it's less crowded, etc, they called the next day to inform me that my card was, indeed, nowhere to be found. What a way to put a bitter taste to the end of an otherwise good night. 

Anyway, I would highly advise others to keep an eye on your payment method at all times here because the bartenders are clearly not organized enough to do so."
2,"Out of the two burgers we ordered - one was pretty good the other was mediocre. It seems the international burgers aren't customizable in any way - meaning no ketchup or mustard, lettuce or tomato on the mushroom and Swiss. The regular burger was good with all the fixings. 

However service was atrocious. Will not be back"
2,"My husband ordered half slab ribs. 4 minature ribs with very little meat. I ordered pork chop which was decent. Won't be returning here. Slaw was in tiny cup. Also, came with roll which looked and tasted from a package."
2,"Unpleasant, dirty place. Other than that their special is nothing special, and milk shakes are too sugary. Cherry coke is OK though. Oh, and it's cash only."
2,"I just really don't like the set up of this venue at all. 

Upon entering it was kind of confusing to figure out which room had the comedy taking place, it's set up as a series of smaller rooms. Once we found the correct room, it was quite disappointing. It's a very small room and not a lot of seating, with lots of the tables having bad visibility of the small stage at the front.

It was also absolutely freezing inside, I kept my winter coat on the entire time.

The show we saw wasn't particularly funny, but it was a special event and it was free, so I don't think it is a reflection of the regular line up at Comedy Bar."
2,"My husband was admitted to Abrazo Arrowhead 3 days ago.  There was no wait in the ER and he was seen quickly.  Note that the word quickly will not be used again in this review.  Once determined that he needed to be admitted, we waited 6 hours for a regular room. In fairness, we were told they were busy and there was a shortage of beds.  The nurses on the 3rd floor (where he currently is) have been very nice. My main complaint and the reason for only 2 stars are the doctors. They. Are. Nonexistent.  The doctor has stopped by twice in 3 days.  We're talking 2 minute visits.  Both times, as we were talking to the doctor, he was busy texting on his phone and acted like he was doing my husband a great favor by gracing us with his presence.  This doctor does not know what is wrong with my husband, nor does he seem to care. There does not seem to be any communication between doctors and nurses. In a nutshell: the ER staff and the nurses are great. The doctors - NOT SO MUCH."
2,"Went back last night with the girlfriend to give it one more shot.  Lukewarm french fries, and again, I was not impressed with the burgers.

The people that work there are friendly enough, but I guess I am just not a fan."
2,"Had the Burgerrito.  Very disappointing.  The patty was not very lacking and loose. They grill it so its slightly crispy on the outside which is not my preference at all.  You certainly don't get a feeling of fullfillment and satasfication after the meal like you would a good burger.  It felt more like I was eating toppings with a side of ground beef, rather than having the other ingredients  add to the experience of the burger."
2,"Tried the Canadian burger. Bit dry and smaller than expected for $10.  Dark place with not a lot of customers and no real enthusiasm on the part of the staff to take your order. Fries were OK, not quite a ""large"" size; more like a medium.

Will try other places."
2,"The bun here is pretty decent although skip the pho. The broth is ridiculously sweet. I'm the type that does not add hoisin sauce into my soup and yet it tasted like a whole bottle had already been poured in. Unless you like sweet broth, I wouldn't recommend"
2,"Like the food, but today was my first time at this location. Clean location and convenient for a quick lunch. However the food was  too salty. All customers were frustrated because no one understands what we are asking for. I'm pretty sure they were saying something about my butt in Spanish. People left with food but frustrated and the lady taking the food orders kept answering her cell phone that rang incessantly. I won't be back to this location. For lunch maybe a different shift."
2,"I tried this with a friend, hoping that our craving for the Japanese chain Sukiya would be be met. We both had the beef bowl and it was mediocre at best. The employees were  rude and I won't be back."
2,"Burgers were good. Avoid the veggie burger!

The guy taking the orders was having an off day - got my order wrong, gave me wrong toppings, side, and extra drink. Paid for it all, not a huge deal, but nothing too special."
2,Thanks for mopping 45 minutes before you close. My food tastes like pine sol. It WAS delicious... But the rudeness in timing ruined my meal with my son. Did I miss tipping you and I'm getting this kind of service? Wait til I walk out!!!!
2,"Don't know why people like this place so much.  Got the beef bowl that people were raving about on here.  It came with some vegetables that were obviously low-quality frozen ones.  The beef was tender, and I don't mind that it was thin, but it was almost all fat.  The miso soup tasted like water, none of the salty/savory flavor that usually makes it good."
2,"Came in for the first time, asked the lady at the counter what's the difference between the ""Beef"" and the ""Angus Beef"" and got the answer, ""they're 2 different beefs"". That's not what I meant, I meant is either one more tender or flavorful because it's about the same price. She still responded ""it's 2 different beefs"". Ok let me say I ordered the Angus Beef and was sort of disappointed with both the flavor and the chewy-ness from all the fat that was on every piece. Sauce is just drenching all over the meal (not a good sign that they don't really marinate their meats). The rice was not soft but more of an undercooked texture and taste. 2 stars was for the price being under $8 a plate, but this place is more a 1 1/2 stars compared to other non ""authentic"" Japanese places you'll find in a shopping mall."
2,"I got the teriyaki chicken bowl and it was alright. But if you're thinking about going here, you might as well be at Aloha Kitchen."
2,"I enjoyed my CenturyLink service at first. It was a fair and competitive price. I checked out all of the providers in the area before purchasing. However, once my promotional deal ended I was paying double. I called and spoke to a very kind customer service representative, but she was unable to lower my bill because I was not a new customer. All of the promotions are for new customers only. Annoying. I canceled my service and switched providers which cut my bill in half. After paying what I thought was my last and final CenturyLink bill I received another bill! Disconnection fees. What a rip off! And I returned my rented equipment myself to the CenturyLink store. I called about disconnection fees as well. The only thing they could offer was that she would put a note on my account that I was never informed about the fee. Not very helpful for me."
2,"Based on the great reviews, I decided give this place a chance. The burger was just OK, but at $9 just for the sandwich, I expected something more -- either better quality/taste, or something that is more filling.

I also ordered a poutine... The fries themselves are actually quite good; unfortunately, the gravy and cheese were anything but. The gravy was rather bland, and the cheese was not anything I have ever seen on a poutine (i.e. not curds, and not grated mozzarella) -- I am not quite sure what it was, but it did not work well on a poutine."
2,"BEWARE OF YOUR FIRST BILL!! Apparently your credits for the packages you sign up for do not apply to your first month. Therefore, my $95 per month package I signed up for came out to $279 for the first two months. Doesn't quite add up. They did end up removing a $15 ""one-time charge"" that they also stuck on my bill, because if you go to their website and build your package it says ""$0 for one-time charges."" They said my next bill should be the $95 plus taxes/fees, so probably $100ish, but I guess I will find out.
The service is good, and the installer was excellent, but their billing practices are dishonest."
2,"We found JBs though all the hype on instagram and was excited to try the international burgers and Poutine. I got the Burgetta burger and the JB House poutine. The Poutine was tasty with all its toppings and the burger patty was good, but there was barely any toppings and much smaller than anticipated. I reread the description of the burgetta burger and realized that I didn't even get the fried eggplant! I felt very mislead by the advertising and disappointed. I would give this company an A for creativity but I will not be coming back for an undersized meal with an oversized pricetag."
2,"Didn't enjoy it at all. I ordered the large beef bowl and requested to add green onions. I pushed all the beef out of the way and proceeded to only eat the rice. Even after adding soy sauce and red peppers, the meat remained tasteless."
2,"I had bbq ribs just ok.mac n cheese not tasty not served warm.my wife had pulled pork
Not served hot very dry.service was just ok
Server could care less attitude."
2,"The food in here is okay. The burgers are actually quite good but avoid this place at all costs during lunch peak times. The order will either be missing, wrong, undercooked and it will take at least 30 minutes to be given to you. Quite disappointed after coming couple of times and waiting for a burger for more that 30 minutes and getting something less than average. This place needs better management and cleaning."
2,"Someone told me they used to love this place in LA. I was driving by UNLV and thought I'd try it. Omg, it was horrible. The food was soggy and the meat was fatty and poor quality. I actually couldn't finish my food. I'm only giving them a 2 because the cashier was really friendly."
2,"Dr. Folkstad is my primary doctor for my current pregnancy and has been nothing short of amazing which is why I have a hard time making a bad review. This has nothing to do with his office and everything to do with the labor and delivery team/my recent experience with them. Yesterday I was admitted to the hospital for several issues including abdominal pain, contractions, head ache, leaking, back ache/body aches, and nausea. I was told that my urine looked fine but they still wanted to give me an IV and have me drink lots of water. The nurse who provided the IV was extremely aggressive and hurt me in the process of doing it. I've been to this location multiple times and have never felt that much pain from an IV stick. I even told her my right arm is where they usually do it because it's easier but she said my veins looked fine on my left so continued with the left because it was more convenient for her. She didn't want to move the station to the other side and then blamed me for my vein getting lost while she was hurting me with the needle fiddling around inside trying to find the vein. Then gave me attitude the entire time. The other nurse who has longer hair was an absolute doll and really sweet to me, made me feel comfortable. But both nurses failed to get me the nurse call button and I was not searching around the room for it so I had to undo my own hook up to be able to get up and use the restroom. When I went to do so and notified them, the rude nurse who did my IV pointed at the restroom door like I was stupid and didn't apologize for not being there to help. I never want to work with this nurse again as my c section is suppose to be at this hospital. She was apart of the night shift as there were only two once the earlier shift left. Not only have my symptoms continued after the experience. I didn't get my baby checked by ultrasound following my multiple concerns. Just because my dilation hasn't changed doesn't mean a mothers intuition isn't right. I'm going to my doctor office today with help because I can hardly walk or stand and if there's an underlying issue that they decided was too hard to look into and easier to push me out, were going to have a real problem. (Attached is where my bruising is from the IV and you can see where the needle was placed.)"
2,"Expensive, burger was poorly made and fell apart, taste wise it was pretty much a generic chicken souvlaki sandwiched in between two buns. Nothing special."
2,"I went to Jackson burger on a Friday with a friend to try their buy one get free deal. Friday is Fish day. They describe the sandwich as a cod fillet stuffed with shrimp and cheese. Promo and tax included my friend and I payed a little over $14 which included 2 fish burgers no drink, no fries. Therefore on a regular day the fish burger would cost $14.

It took long to receive our order we watched two tables get and eat their food before we received ours. When we finally received our burger we were surprised at how tiny they were. The cod was flavorless and there was only ONE shrimp in the burger, with barely any tar tar sauce. All other toppings cost extra. When we asked how many shrimp is in each burger they said one as advertised. Which I disagree it says stuffed with shrimp not stuffed with one/a shrimp. 

We left extremely disappointed and still hungry! The sad thing is I personally believe McDonald's fish fillet taste way better and with what we paid we could of got a better tasting fish burger with fries and a drink.

The only reason I gave two stars is because the staff is extremely kind. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they enjoy over paying for flavorless food."
2,"If this location is any indication of how Nevada Yoshinoyas are, then may I suggest that training be done in California. Extremely slow and dirty, not a good experience at all."
2,This business only accepts cash. Please start accepting debit card. The food is good here though.
2,"For only a $5 cover this is a fabulous deal to see new upcoming talent. The downside is that you must get into the small venue first to get a decent seat.

Our seats were at the back of the very small and narrow room. Right next to the door to the bar area and holy mackerel you can not hear a thing other than the bar.

One of the comedians that watched a portion of the show from the back turned up the mic when he went up to perform but to be honest that was not any better.

It is not worth visiting there if you are sitting in the last 3 rows. If you can push your way up to the front then it is well worth the $5!"
2,"A very cozy place with sticky table... Maybe they prefer to go orders. We ordered 1 regular burger and 1 cheese burger with fries and drink combos for just less than $20. I wanted to try their original burger flavour to see if there is something special to it. We waited for 35 mins before we got our order... The burger was good but not that great. It wasn't as juicy I thought it would be. I would buy my own meat and bbq  myself which will most likely turns out the same but cheaper (for a regular hamburger). Nothing special with fries and they cheap out when put them in tall box... half bottom box was empty. 

Not a place I will take my kids... Maybe with friends who are burger lovers and wants to try different flavour burger."
2,"Wonderbread?? Are you kidding me?

Let me start off by saying I was really looking forward to trying JB's out. I went on the day that the Mexican burger was 2 for 1. I think $10 for a burger is pretty outrageous but I went with a co-worker so $5 each seemed pretty reasonable. The service was good but we were both pretty dissapointed when we saw the size of the burger itself and the stacks of Wonderbread buns in the corner. 

The ""Avocado Explosion"" was the highlight of the entire experience. It went really well with the burger. I am a fan of the fact that the meat is (claimed to be) local and hormone free but I found it to be lacking any type of seasoning and very greasy (which took it's toll on the Wonderbread bun). 

The onion rings weren't crispy either. Just kind of soft and greasy. 

Will not be going back any time soon."
2,This place is owned and is family run.  I've been here a few times already and I would only recommend the banh hoi here.  Everything else is mediocre and  washrooms are terrible.
2,"Well I (sadly) must agree with the majority of reviewers on this place. I'm sure (meaning I hope) that things will improve as they continue on but my first visit today for lunch was overall pretty disappointing. First off, lets take about the AC. The dining room felt like a meat locker and everyone who had a sweater or jacket was wearing it inside the dining room. This makes for an uncomfortable experience before you even have anything to eat or drink. Had the pulled pork, jalapeno cheddar sausage and corn bread. The pork was of good quality but pretty flavorless. No bark or burnt ends. They have 3 sauces you can add, all were OK, not great, but you shouldn't have to. The jalapeno cheddar sausage tasted like neither jalapeno nor cheddar. It wasn't unpleasant but odd and with a very grainy not meaty texture. The corn bread was quite good. As others have stated, too many staff who kept trying to remove our plates before we were done. For a BBQ place at this price point with this kind of foodie pedigree it was quite a disappointment. Hope things turn around."
2,"I dined at Smokin' Q's BBQ last night with my boyfriend for the third time.  I am not a huge meat eater but was pleasantly surprised which the BBQ on my first visit.  I commented to the waitress that the food was quite a bit better than Michael Symon's bbq joint Mabels downtown.  The food on the second and third visits was just as good however there are some improvements to be had otherwise.  The restaurant is situated right on the road so the entrance is on the back by the parking lot and is a rather awkward.  Once inside, diners will find a pleasant interior however the lighting is HORRIBLE!  Cute hanging lights over the booths are illuminated with awful ""environmentally friendly"" bulbs that are so bright it is almost painful to look at the person across from you.  Similar lights in the bar area appear to use old fashioned filament bulbs which are much more appropriate.  The lighting over the booths is so awful we had to ask for them to be dimmed which they did for about five minutes before turning them up again to full capacity!  It really makes for an unpleasant dining experience.  In addition, the wait staff could use some additional training.  Often water glasses are left unfilled.  During two of our meals our waitress changed during the meal and the new waitress got our orders incorrect.  Also, it doesn't appear to be the cleanest of establishments.  Hopefully, with the food on track, the manager can focus on the smaller details which can truly make or break a dining experience.  At this point, I will be taking a long break from Smoking' Q's."
2,"I love Freddy's but this location has terrible service! I've been there multiple times and everytime there is something wrong with my order or service is slow. The last time I went, some pecans inexplicably found their way into my oreo skake! What if I had been allergic!!! Luckily, I'm not however it was extremely irritating to get excited thinking I got a chunk of oreo only to find out it was a pecan! Not cool bro!"
2,"Food is 8/10
Service is 1/10

I like their food, one of the better ones in downtown. But service is HORRIBLE. I've been there about 5 times. Everytime I go there, no one is giving us menus and (most) tables are not cleaned. They just leave the dirty dishes on the tables and flies are having their meals (during the summertime). I understand it's a family business. But if you need one more server, then you need one. I am always left sitting there with no menus etc etc. I'm so tired of this - not going back anymore!"
2,Small menu and all food tastes same. It hot in here with ac barely working. Been at UNLV four years and now I know why no one ever mentioned this place.
2,"went out of my way to come to this place, for a couple of reasons
close to transit 
close to Y&D square
lots of options...
lots of non-beef options...

i understand what this place is trying to do, offer a supreme burger, with awesome toppings and options, for a price, which sounds great.
i think other then a mcds cheeseburger, the burger me and my s.o recieved from this place, would be about the same size. i think they're trying to maximize their bottom dollar, by offering awesome flavors, but small portions. 
to be completely fair, the poutine was a bigger portion then the burger, being a burger place i'd like to think the portion would be a bit bigger.

Excellent flavors, i was very satisfied with the flavor.
the poutine was above decent, given the size, fries, cheese and gravy. 
the staff are great, and churn out food like a military operation, which is cool.
the location is tiny as well, less then ten seats, or ten seats only. i can't remember atm. 

also i rank this a bit lower cause of the portion size, as well i don't like the advertisement of ""two minute walk from y&d square"" yeah maybe at midnight, if your doing a fast walk."
2,"Despite the good reviews and high hopes for this place, I was very disappointed. The food was just so-so, it wasn't really cheap either and the service was very, very bad. The waiter and the rest of the staff at the back were completely emotionless and very cold. Definitely not going back."
2,"I was told by a Vietnamese friend that this is the Viet restaurant in Toronto - Pho Hung paled in comparison. So I knew that I had to try it. 
Upon first stepping inside, I had my doubts. The place had a mysterious and unpleasant smell when I walked in. The menu was limited, but the server was really nice and accommodating, so I kept my judgments at bay. I ordered a curry beef satay vermicelli  - OK and imperial rolls - not even close to my top 5 Viet spring rolls. My dining partner had the pho special with tripe, beef balls, etc. - whatever. Not a memorable pho. 
I went for dinner last night at 7 pm. Right now at 3:45 pm the next day, I'm still in an MSG haze. I don't know what they put in which sauce, but I didn't pay for this type of high. 
Needless to say, I wouldn't go back."
2,"Went to check out this place and was disappointed. Waited half an hour for a burger and the taste was only decent that the wait wasn't worth it. I ordered the Juicy Lucy. The meat was a bit dry, factory sauce was okay and bun was soft. Not recommending this place simply because the wait time was too long."
2,"Did they change management? It's been a while since I've been here and it's always been good. I went today around 5pm and the Freddy's original tasted good but wasn't very hot. The french fries were awful. They were cold and rubbery. How long were they sitting there before they gave them to me?? Of course I went thru the drive-thru so I was already home when it was discovered. I couldn't eat the fries, they went in the garbage. Very upset."
2,"CRAP! The other reviews are idiotic (sorry, but it has to be true, since this is crap!)  Over priced - over sauced - horrible place. Oh, and very dirty.  

You have been warned - enjoy!"
2,"BF had appendicitis and was transferred by ambulance from emergency room of heart hospital to Arrowhead for surgery - we were in a room for two hours before he saw doctor which means  he had no pain mess and a raging fever. I had to ask for ice for his head to bring fever down. Thankfully we got transferred to a single room so I can stay night. 
In waiting room now and patient progress tracker not working. 
Thankfully this isn't a life or death situation - but I'm not a fan of this place. Once you've been to Scottsdale Healthcare you won't want to go anywhere else."
2,"In one word: ""Meh!""

I went to Comedy Bar on a weeknight just to check out the venue and get the feel for the comedy they like to play. As it turns out, the show that night was some sort of combined effort of the house student teams and a guest festival trouppe. The act itself was hit-n-miss but IMO definitely not worth the full price they were charging. As a side note - in most places I've been to, the student shows are normally discounted. But it was not all that bad - what was killing the act is the most annoying yammering of the hosts. This pathetic duo was as cheesy as tey make'em and obviously felt they were doing a phenomenal job entertaining the other members of the house team. 

On the balance: good venue with a bar and good vibe, pathetic overpriced act. Maybe it was just my luck with this particular show but honestly, I dont think I would give it another try."
2,"They always burn/overcook the burgers, if you like a extremely well done (burnt) burger this is your place :/"
2,"Honestly not worth it. I get that it's no hormone and free range and stuff, but for a $11 combo I expect some seasoning in the patty. I'm an individual who gets a lot of sauces with my burgers and subs whenever I get the choice (btw they don't even have honey mustard), and even with 3 sauces slathered on the meat still tastes bland. 

In fact they just grind up fresh beef and don't add anything, it's admirable commitment to healthiness, at the cost of taste.  I'd rather have hero or a burger from a pub."
2,"The best item on the menu is the Viet wraps.

The broth for their soup items is delicious because it is loaded with MSG. I know this because have a sensitivity to MSG that makes me extremely sleepy... and I passed out almost immediately after leaving the restaurant. 

If you order soy milk, make sure you ask for it with no ice. Otherwise they give you big chunks of ice in a cup and you only end up getting very little of the soy milk that costs you $2."
2,All of us were vegetarians and we ordered veggie burgers and fries. The burger was just minced veggies and a whole lot of oil and no flavour. The fires were OK. Too pricey for what we get. At half the price we can get good burgers at Harvey's or even Licks
2,"Pho had a nicely seasoned broth and was satisfactory. Unfortunately the fresh prawn spring rolls were not as appealing when we noticed the shrimp had not been deveined and was full of shrimp feces. 
Disappointing as the atmosphere was nice and clean. Servers were friendly. 
Please clean your shrimp!!!"
2,"Not a good experience with my recent visit to yoshinoya. The rice bowl and veggies were greasy and unflavorful. The cooks might be using some cheap oil to cook their rice bowls with. Also, if you ask for some hot sauce or pepper your gonna get charged .70. The clam chowder that came with my rice bowl tasted better than the rice bowl and that is not saying much. The clam chowder was too watery and not one single clam in the cup. Also, the restaurant had a funky smell. Also, the floor was dirty and the restroom was very dirty. I hate to sound negative but the yoshinoya management needs to read this review. This restaurant needs some major changes fast if they wish to stay in business."
2,"Good home made style burger. Don't be alarmed by the size of the place and if there are no seats when you walk in. Pattied are grilled fresh, so by the time you burger is ready somebody wwould have finished thier meal. It is a tad pricey though.

Now I am fan buttery goodness, but the fries were a bit too greasy. If I had to guess the were re-fried.

I would give them another chance and get thier daily special. Speacial is buy one burger, get one free and they have different burger on special each day of the week. 

If take two goes well, I'll update my review."
2,"Grrr I was in the middle of doing this one. Actually this is another staple in LA. Where there's a Yoshinoya Beef Bowl on Every corner. Ok if you have the Chicken bowl. Understand Chicken has the weird color...yea. It's just how it is. It's EXTRA COLOR = EXTRA FLAVOR. I just dont like to drown everything in salt. ESPECIALLY VEGGIES. Ok the beef bowl. It's normally served like that. I guess I'm used to it.
No...It's not the best of Teriyaki bowls. But then again. This isn't a teriyaki place. This is Beef Bowl....They serve shaved beef. They serve Luminescent Chicken and Veggies...."
2,"I know this place has a following. Some people think it's a Montreal landmark in the food category. But I don't get it. It's a seared baloney sandwich. It's to Montreal what spam is to Hawaii. Do you yearn for spam? If yes, by all means go to Wilensky's. Otherwise, I'd pass. In all states of the world, good Montreal smoked meat dominates - first time and millionth time."
2,"We tried it yesterday for the first time.  We love barbeque.  We ate outside.  The outside patio is noisy as heck from car traffic.  There's plenty of room behind the deck, build another one farther from the road.  The meat did not fall off the bone as they said it would.  The ribs were tough.  My son had a chicken sandwich, very dry.  Sadly don't recommend."
2,"Have been to this place four times. The sliced brisket has been fatty all three times I had it. They seem to forget parts of your order. Forgot bbq sauce the second time and the fourth time our corn bread. Funny thing is I repeated my order twice and the person taking my order did too. When I picked up my order and asked if the corn bread was in the bag she said yes. I get home and only one slice corn bread. When I called to ask if they could add it to the next time I come in, planning on ordering take out again. She said said ok. Then she calls me back and said I didn't pay for it and I would have to pay if I get another. I was planning on paying for it when I ordered two, but they messed up my order. Looking for another bbq place."
2,"It was ok.  Many good burger joints out there and this place didn't stand out.
They do have some pretty good specials, if you wanted two, which is too much for me. The place is pretty small and it's more likely that I'd visit it alone.  If I was in a group or date, I'd travel to one of the better spots in the area.  Sorry..."
2,"I don't get these reviews. First time in and last time out. I hate to slander small enterprises. I really like to see more instead of the big franchises. Here's my review. Burgers are very ordinary as you can do at home. Ordered the basic burger and it was clearly basic. Small patties and buns are small as people have said. With two people in line (me being #2), it took almost 20 mins to get this burger ready! Way too long. And they missed putting tomato had I not keep an eye on the assembly. Watching how they kept track of the order was funny. After it was wrapped up, they didn't know which burger was which so they had to unwrap it to check. OK common sense needs to prevail. Mark the dang thing after its wrapped! So disorganized it makes me wanna cry. Toppings are expensive when you add it together. Ohh the funny part is if you buy 100 burgers the next one is free!! Economically that's something like if you spend $700 you will get a freebie. How nice...Positives. The fries look good. Maybe I should have just ordered those instead."
2,Not at all impressed. I love BBQ and yes know the difference between smoked meat BBQ and Famous Daves. Meat was fatty waitress terrible drinks to expensive. Side dishes expensive and not very good.  Don't plan on returning until waitress learns not to argue with customers. I guess nothing else to ad.
2,"I was looking forward to the opening as I've been a customer of Fisher's Tavern for many years. However, I had a very disappointing experience. The menu was very limited and the pricing was too high for the quantity and quality of the food. I had a cheese and fajita dip appetizer that was soupy with very little fajita makings in it. The chips were thick and tasteless. My friend's pulled brisket sandwich was very small in size for the price and the french fries were an extra cost! I would have liked a cocktail, but they were all too pricey. Unless pricing, food quality, quantity and choices change, I won't be coming back."
2,"We both ordered baby back ribs. They were under cooked, clearly not slow cooked. Seemed like they were precooked and reheated. There were hard to get off the bone without a knife. What ever happened to falling off the bone? They need a real pit master that has some experience doing ribs. If you can't get the ribs right at a barbecue spot, that is not a good sign.

In fairness the corn bread was very good and the barbecue sauce was also good. Unfortunately brioche bun was dry and uninteresting. There are other much better barbecue spots in town. Hopefully these folks get it figured out, it is hard to go back after a very mediocre experience.Even though the manager asked how we liked everything, it was quickly apparent he was only open to positive feedback.  If you don't want the truth please don't ask."
2,"I always read the yelp reviews but this time I chose to ignore them for a variety of reasons.  Smokin Q's is less than a mile from my home, I love barbecue and have fond memories of the old Fishers Tavern.  So l could not wait to try it.  Met a friend for lunch on the deck.  At first glance, was impressed with the renovation.  Liked the openness but could not help but notice how dirty the floor was.  Sugar pack wraps etc. all over.  Whatever, we ate outside.  Our waitress clearly hates her job.  Not a hint if a smile or any effort to do anything than the bare minimum.  Had to track her down to place our order.  I had the fat hefer  and my friend had the shrimp tacos.  What little meat there was on my bun was dry, dry, dry! My friend's lunch was so bad she only had a few bites.  The presentation was poor.  Wish I had taken a picture of our lunches.  Waitress came and got our paid checks while we were still sitting there! Never said a word, just picked them up and left.  Never had that happen before.  So sorry I left her a tip. Passed the manager in the hallway as we were leaving, he looked right at us and never said a word.  No ""Thank you for coming or How was your food?."" Nothing.  It is clear these people do not want you coming to their restaurant.  I will gladly accommodate them and stay far away.  Too bad, because I really wanted to make this a regular spot in my neighborhood."
2,"I ordered here for lunch one day. Initially I tried to order online but it got so messy and confusing I gave up and just walked over. I decided on the Canadian Eh! burger, bacon, eggs, cheese, what could go wrong! Service at the counter was pretty good, although I have to say, the place was not very clean. I know things get messy in the food industry especially at a prime location like Yonge and Gerrard...but...the floor was gross! I got my overpriced food back to work and boy...I had to choke that burger down. The patty was DRY as the Sahara, the toppings could not make up for the beef. The saving grace however was the excellent fries! Shoestring-esque and salted to perfection, they made my lunch worth eating. Will I be back? Likely not unless I get a hankering for some fries!"
2,"These reviews are solely for the ER. The facility itself is a bit run down. The floors are beat up and look dirty, even if they aren't. I've had to take my daughter there a couple of times and have mixed reviews.

Incident 1: My infant daughter had an allergic reaction to the food she ate. Pediatrician instructed to go to the hospital immediately due to hives, swollen face, etc. It took nearly TWO HOURS for her to be seen. And of course, by the time she was seen the reaction had almost completely subsided and the instructions were ""Well, now you know she's allergic to that. Don't let her eat that anymore."" 

Incident 2: My daughter was 1 year old and had a fever of 105 that we couldn't get to come down. The doctor could not figure out what was wrong and even had us hold her down to catheterize her so they could check for a urinary tract infection. That was clear. Sent us home with instructions to give Tylenol and Motrin. Followed up with the pediatrician the next day and found out she had an ear infection! (Yes, the doctor checked her ears when we were at the hospital and apparently didn't notice.)

Incident 3: My daughter hit her head on the cement while playing outside and had a concussion. It took about 30-45 minutes before she was seen by the NP. I thought this was somewhat reasonable since her symptoms were subsiding. The NP gave good insight/advice and we opted not to do a CT scan. Came back a day later due to continued vomiting. This time we were admitted a little sooner but we were there for about 3 hours total. All of the nurses (besides one) were helpful and friendly. Only saw the doctor for about 2 minutes, but he was pleasant and to-the-point.  

Ultimately, I'd prefer to go somewhere else, but in a pinch, it's better than nothing."
2,"I lived in Japan for about 2 years so anytime I feel reminiscent of those drunken 4am nights I come here.  Not really so much like the ones in Japan though.  And I didn't think Yoshinoya was one of the better gyu-don places in Japan anyways.  

They should add Japanese curry to their menu.  I also wish they offered white meat chicken too.  I also agree with the weirdness of the veggie color.  I don't know why its gotta be so damn yellow.  Just go to Ichiza instead."
2,"Have been to this place four times. The sliced brisket has been fatty all three times I had it. They seem to forget parts of your order. Forgot bbq sauce the second time and the fourth time our corn bread. Funny thing is I repeated my order twice and the person taking my order did too. When I picked up my order and asked if the corn bread was in the bag she said yes. I get home and only one slice corn bread. When I called to ask if they could add it to the next time I come in, planning on ordering take out again. She said said ok. Then she calls me back and said I didn't pay for it and I would have to pay if I get another. I was planning on paying for it when I ordered two, but they messed up my order. Looking for another bbq place."
2,"Dr. Folkstad is my primary doctor for my current pregnancy and has been nothing short of amazing which is why I have a hard time making a bad review. This has nothing to do with his office and everything to do with the labor and delivery team/my recent experience with them. Yesterday I was admitted to the hospital for several issues including abdominal pain, contractions, head ache, leaking, back ache/body aches, and nausea. I was told that my urine looked fine but they still wanted to give me an IV and have me drink lots of water. The nurse who provided the IV was extremely aggressive and hurt me in the process of doing it. I've been to this location multiple times and have never felt that much pain from an IV stick. I even told her my right arm is where they usually do it because it's easier but she said my veins looked fine on my left so continued with the left because it was more convenient for her. She didn't want to move the station to the other side and then blamed me for my vein getting lost while she was hurting me with the needle fiddling around inside trying to find the vein. Then gave me attitude the entire time. The other nurse who has longer hair was an absolute doll and was really sweet to me, made me feel comfortable. But both nurses failed to get me the nurse call button and I was not searching around the room for it so I had to undo my own hook up to be able to get up and use the restroom. When I went to do so and notified them, the rude nurse who did my IV pointed at the restroom door like I was stupid and didn't apologize for not being there to help. I never want to work with this nurse again as my c section is suppose to be at this hospital. She was apart of the night shift as there were only two once the earlier shift left. Not only have my symptoms continued after the experience. I didn't get my baby checked by ultrasound following my multiple concerns. Just because my dilation hasn't changed doesn't mean a mothers intuition isn't right. I'm going to my doctor office today with help because I can hardly walk or stand and if there's an underlying issue that they decided was too hard to look into and easier to push me out, were going to have a real problem."
2,"Tried this place out after seeing a review of it online.

For a $4.99 burger, it ain't so bad! I'm happy to get good meat for a good price.

Pros:
Good location, good service (not a lot of customers), and good variety of sides. I also love the idea of fresh-squeezed juice, although I don't know how that matches with burgers (weird).

Cons:
It's a $4.99 burger. Only eat here if you don't have another choice. I would not call this a gourmet burger place because some of the items just don't make sense. I mean, you just slap a piece of salmon on a salad without even thinking if it goes together with the rest of your menu? The buns in this place look like death too. I'll bring my own bun next time haha!

All in all- not a bad try. I wasn't expecting anything more than average at this location. M'eh."
2,"I stopped in for lunch and was the only customer. Food was ok overall, as the burger was decent. The fries were soggy and when you add it all up over $10 for a lunch combo I expect better."
2,"I wouldn't venture off the strip, but ""The Bachelore"" of our group required a visit to Yoshinoya.  

He lives in Chicago and whenever he ventures to the west coast, he seeks out a Yoshinoya.  I have never been to a Yoshinoya in the states.  The only time was in the location across from the Kabukicho gate.  That experience was three stars.  Meat was decent and cheap.

However, this experience at this Las Vegas location was disappointing.  The sesame chicken wings tasted fresh enough, but I had to force myself to consume the beef bowl with vegetables.   Uhm, the iced tea tasted fine. :)

I always describe the meat as ""wet bacon"" on overcooked rice.  It was spot on.  More fat than meat.  Rice was clumpy and fat with water.  

To top it off, it was a $26 cab ride there from the strip (back and forth) and my buddy bought THREE large beef bowls to bring back to Caesar's.  I had to give it two stars since my buddy was smiling with MSG drool for the next three meals.  ack!

Only the best for ""The Bachelore""."
2,"I really do love the Internet service that is ultimately provided by Century Link. However, most recently I was very disappointed with how our service order was handled. We were given the time of 12pm to 4pm for a technician to come out to the property and set up our wireless. At 4:15, I had to call the store myself and ask where the tech was and what was going on. They said that he was delayed and would be over shortly. Time kept passing and by 7pm, still no sign. Finally I called corporate the next day when I could get a customer service attendant on the phone and they had changed our service speed and had ""activated"" the service without telling us. Ultimately, I'm very glad that the service was activated, but I feel that the communication was very poor. I would probably just go through corporate next time to get everything communicated properly."
2,"Food was cold, The Mac&chesse we ordered was so cold at the bottom.  So the waitress took it back.  That was the only hot food. We ordered brisket an pork combo."
2,I had a chicken sandwich where the chicken was so tough I couldn't cut it.  It also was very spicy.  Heard the food here was not that good and expensive..they were right on both.  Go to Austin steakhouse if you want a good deal.
2,"I was excited to try this place based on other reviews. To my surprise there wasn't a single veg-friendly item on the menu. The waiter was helpful in adapting an existing meat-based dish, which was nice, but the food was only so-so, and lackluster for the price. This may be a great place for omnivores, but I'd avoid it if you're vegetarian or vegan."
2,"I've been to this location a few times which was once a Pizza Hut with a pizza buffet.  I miss those Pizza Hut buffets where can I find one huh?

First I'll review Yoshinoya as a chain.  Not a big fan of super thinly sliced meat unless it's in a sandwich or in a broth dish like pho. Which is what I got with the Teriyaki chicken with vegetables bowl. I should've gone across the street to Aloha Kitchen for their Teriyaki chicken bowl.  I think I paid more for what I got.

There was once a so called knockoff of Yoshinoya in town, not so far from here Yoshi something, before this location opened up.  That place was way better but it eventually closed down.  This location does seem run down.  The condiments area was completely empty, there was only an almost empty container of pickled ginger that didn't look pleasing. There wasn't even any soy sauce or salt and pepper dispensers. The napkins in the dispenser were all wet and counters need cleaning.  For decoration there's a few UNLV items on the walls. They could use a renovation."
2,"TLDR; what a BBQ restaurant would be like if it was opened by someone who didn't know how to make BBQ.

This seems like a take on a central Texan ""meat market"" style BBQ joint, but the meat has to have good flavor for that to work.

It seems like they're missing a pitmaster. No technical skill in smoking department. The sauce was watery (decent flavor), needs another few hours on the stove. 

We tried the pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and sausage. I had the pulled pork and sausage, so I'll speak to those first. The pork had no bark. I'll repeat for emphasis: the pork had no bark!  For those uninitiated to the finer points of BBQ, bark is the tasty outer crust of rub on the outside of the meat. For pulled pork to have no bark means it had no flavor too. As for the sausage, it was tasty and very garlicky. I did not catch a flavor of jalapeño Or cheddar, but it was tasty. 

Moving on to the pork ribs, they were big a meaty. Unfortunately, they too suffered from a lack of bark. A bit dry, but better than the pulled pork. They did have a nice smoked pepper flavor (chipotle or ancho maybe), but that was the only interesting note. The sliced brisket was at best mediocre for similar reasons as the prior reviewed meats. The burnt ends were nice and fatty, with more bark than any other meat we had. At a none BBQ restaurant, I would have considered them good. 

Now that we've covered the meats, I'll keep the sides and fixings quick. The rolls were simple dinner yeast rolls, they did not have the light crumb or high fat content of a brioche (as advertised on the menu). The pickles, onions, and slaw were fine. All on par with the quality a friend who just got into cooking.

We tried the Mac n Cheese and the corn bread. The  former had too thin a sauce for the noodle type, and did not hold flavor. As a cheddar sauce, it probably could have used more (or any) roux in addition to some salt and mustard powder for flavor. The corn bread was actually solid all around.

Mexican undertones of flavor in the menu are common at BBQ joints these days, and maybe the tacos are the way to go here. I can't say I plan on coming back to found though. 

On the note of beers: the list is small, maybe a dozen on tap. The first 2 I ordered were not available. Unclear if they weren't in yet or if they had already run out.

Managers and owners: I'd love to come in and help you with a tune-up on your meat game."
2,"The ""spicy guacamole"" is too hot. Habanero hot. Too bad it was mixed throughout my food. IThe food seemed fresh, but two bites in, my mouth was scorched and couldn't taste anything."
2,Disappointed after spending $100 for a Valentines Day floral arrangement. Roses lasted 3 days before they wilted and never opened up.
2,"Good service and delicious cornbread are not enough to recommend the successor to Fisher's.  Tough chicken, pulled pork and tasteless hamburger are surprisingly available at this restaurant run by the excellent Quagliata restaurant family.
The menu is extensive and maybe there are items which would have been better, but half of our group vowed never to return to try them.  Too bad"
2,"Ordered our favorites to go:  sizzling rice soup and egg foo yung.  Neither tasted as good as we remembered.  Soup was bland and egg foo yung was missing bean sprouts.  When I called, I was told there is a new owner and the food changed a little.  Too bad.  It was our favorite Chinese restaurant.  No longer."
2,"PROS: Student living is the worst anywhere, but this place is the cream of the sucky crop. It's also close to the college! 

It's gated. Comfortable amount of space. Comes furnished (well sort of).

CONS: semi-dangerous area. Really difficult leasing contracts. Dirty rooms.

Expensive prices. it's not the greatest deal in the world. Staff has a poor time addressing problems."
2,Ordered take-out.  I was so hoping the food was going to be good because I love chinese food and it is the closest to my home.  The spring rolls and cashew chicken were very average.  The wonton soup was a disaster...It was thick with mushy pieces of pastry with not one wonton to be found!
2,"Food was mediocre, service was weird. We were told there was a wait of 15 minutes for our party of 2. There was another group of 6 waiting also. Thing is, there were 4 empty tables. After waiting about 10 minutes, the party of 6 was seated at one of the tables that had been empty the whole time they were waiting. 10 minutes later, we were seated at a table that had been empty the whole 20 minutes we were waiting. Not sure why, my husband would  not let me ask. Maybe they do it so the wait staff and kitchen can keep up? Not good business.  This place won't last with the current menu and service. Plenty of people working, the place is not big so no excuse"
2,"While the waitress we had was great, the restaurant itself was not up to expectations.  The floors were sticky, the bathrooms were dirty, and the food was very salty.  While  we have eaten at other restaurants in this chain before and will likely stop at one in the future, we will not go back to this one again."
2,"Mediocre food, had curry chicken on rice nothing too special. Terrible service, waiters miss one of our orders. Had to ask twice on our order. Wont come back..."
2,"The service was friendly and the food came quickly, so I have to be fair and give them praise for that.  Unfortunately we weren't very happy with how our food tasted.  Our Crab Rangoon, and Fried Rice were too salty.  Our Egg Rolls and Won Tons in our soup were bland.  The Thai Tofu dish was too dry, although the green beans and flavor of the sauce was good.  I don't think I'll return again.  I'll drive further down South to Flo's."
2,"Two stars simply because they eventually brought our food that was not good, after spilling soup across our table.  The soup tasted very salty and was not good. My salad was not good.  Very disappointed tonight.  I've eaten here once a week for four weeks and every time delicious except tonight."
2,New management has ruined my favorite restaurant. No longer as good as they were. Biscuits taste like crap overcooked and udercooked. Steaks come out burnt or really fatty. I gotta find a new spot. Someone please help me
2,"My friend and I were walking around King West and stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. We were planning on going to another restaurant down the street but decided to give this place a try. Honestly I regret this decision because the food was mediocre and not worth the price. I had the Gringo and my friend had the benny. Plates were quite bare and very average tasting. I had to ask the server for butter which he essentially took two slabs from a brick of butter that was hardly melted. I would not come back again, this place is only nice for pictures."
2,"This place actually looks like a very nice bar...but this is a restaurant review!  On that note, the food was completely overpriced and mediocre quality - even for a tavern style place.  I'd go back here to have a drink or shoot pool, but never to eat.  Maybe I'd get a burger if I was starving...how bad can you screw that up.  One more note, their bleu cheese salad dressing was gross."
2,"So I haven't ever given anything a bad review in my life

But for you, Rebel Place, I will make an exception.

First off, the people who work the desk are friendly and great.  They are one of the reasons RP has any stars at all.  They deserve 5 stars for sure.

The other reason is because they have furnished 4BRs for 500-600 per pop.  Great price.

But the other stuff is ridiculous. 

You can read the other reviews for the litany of issues with RP.  

Let me just contribute that we're currently in the middle of an unannounced all day fire drill.  That means the shrieking started at 8:45am and apparently will continue at random intervals throughout the day."
2,"Okay I feel bad giving them a 2 star review, but I will explain. We went to Texas Roadhouse twice in  two weeks.  My boyfriend, myself and a friend went, we all had the onion blossom , pretty good, the fried pickles we're better then expected and of course a few beers and stawberry banana margarita, can't go wrong with any of those. We all had the huge Tbone steak, salads and potato. Everything tasted great and I was super thrilled for my first time there. A week later we went back a took my brother, same deal same food, good stuff!

 Now for the bad. The fist visit my bf and his friend felt miserable and spent forever in the bathroom. I know its gross but unless you want the same experience, I'd keep this review in mind. So after being miserable the day after we chalked it up to over eating. 2nd visit, all 3 of us same thing all over again. This time had nothing to do with over eating because we left more then a little on our plates. Everything seemed to taste fine, so I can't rule out any one part of the meal that caused it. All 3 steaks were cooked at different temperatures, we each had a different type of potato and only 2 out of the 3 of us had Caesar salad. We shared the baby blossom which we also did the 1st time, so maybe that was it. Not for sure.

So as far as my review goes, the food tasted fantastic, but I've never felt worse after eating. I really wish it was just a fluke because I was so psyched about this place. :("
2,"I genuinely liked almost everything here, But when I tried to return a dish (dessert) which did not reach min standard (Not sweet at all which by basic purpose has failed) they refused to do that, which I really felt unhappy about."
2,"I'm a little confused. 

After driving by Imperial Garden, and time after time seeing a packed parking lot, I finally tried the place. It's basically the typical Americanized, overpriced sit-down Chinese restaurant. Why so many cars and why so many people eating there? I'm not sure.

The BBQ pork in our appetizer was almost cold and chewy. (Was it supposed to be jerky?) Other items on the appetizer platter were okay, but lacked seasoning.

Our entrees weren't much better. The sweet-and-sour sauce was more like sweet-and-strange sauce. The very odd thing about the sauce was that it was too sweet. (And I'm someone with a sweet tooth and then some!) The sauce seemed sort of like a red version of corn syrup. Just very weird.

The sweet-and-sour chicken entree came with the usual -- chicken, peppers, onions, pineapples -- and maraschino cherries. I only want to see and see those with a milkshake. As part of a dinner entree? No, no.

I am still scratching my head as to why this place has a full parking lot and why it has won some of the ""Best of Madison"" awards.

PS: Our server was nice!"
2,"The food was good, ehich is why I come here. 
However, their customer service is terrible."
2,"They serve Kool-Aid as a ""drank"", y'all. That's just so ghetto, ain't it? As I have waited for flights at Sky Harbor, I noticed this spot before thinking with disgust who in their right mind would wolf down chicken and waffles before a flight? Apparently nobody around me in that food court since everybody else was eating salads and staring at the gluttony about to occur. Now here's a case where what you do in Phoenix may not stay in Phoenix since who knows what would come out of you after the ""Fasten Seat Belts"" light comes on.

So yes, I had a half-hour and a weak moment at the same time and decided to give it a try. What may have not been a great sign is that I had to cajole the server to come out of the kitchen to take my order. He seemed a touch perturbed as he was chatting with the cook. It gave me more time to decide to go full gonzo and order the $14.50 Lo-Lo's Hood Classic. It consisted of three pieces of Southern fried chicken on top of two full waffles in a weak styrofoam container (photo: http://bit.ly/2m6cUi9). Don't judge me.

I was hungry because they didn't serve lunch at my business meeting. It was a huge amount of food as the people around me can attest, but I was disappointed how bland and dry it was once you get over the finger-burning heat of the chicken. The waffles were rubbery and merely acted as a sponge for all the grease (photo: http://bit.ly/2mlCFfa). It was hardly worth the massive calorie intake, and I ended up eating only half of it. My biggest challenge afterward was keeping it down, especially when my plane hit turbulence. Not pretty.

FOOD - 2 stars...big pieces of fried chicken but bland with dry meat and third degree burns when you touch the poultry
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's the airport...are you serious?
SERVICE - 2 stars...I didn't get a lot of Phoenix love here
TOTAL - 2 stars...Southern by Southwest?...hmmm, not really"
2,"Went here for dinner last night. This is the 4th time I've eaten here, or gotten take out. The flavor is generally pretty good, but every time the food has been lukewarm, or the sauce is hot but the centre of the meat is cold. I've concluded that everything is reheated instead of cooked from fresh. Time to find another Indian place to eat in Scarborough."
2,"2.5 stars


I got the Malay Chicken Curry
- comes with potato salad, bun (good), vegetable soup (good), milk tea (ok)
- curry was spicy but no hint of Malay flavor or coconut... 
- chicken was tender but personally I don't like previously deep-fried chicken ... 
- rice was super hard and dry 

Price is about $1 more than other HK style in the area.."
2,"Most of the time Texas Roadhouse is a dependable restaurant with gods quality food and service. Last night my son and I ate here with some friends. We waited about 10 minutes at our table before we were even offered any drinks. The service was extremely slow for a Texas Roadhouse, there were large gaps of time between our appetizers, salads and entrees. My son got the ribs and after one bite only ate his fries. My steak was just okay not the quality that I was expecting and my baked potato a little on the not done side.  When my son complained our server only said sorry and then offered him a box to take his food home. When the bill came we were charged for both entrees and no adjustments were made. Not the experience that I have had in other Texas Roadhouses."
2,"If you're reading the other great reviews for Lo-Lo's and hope to catch a taste in the airport...please don't let this small kiosk style location taint your experience.  This smaller Lo-Lo's is definitely NOT on the same level as the location we visited in Scottsdale.  The food is prepared well but the menu is limited.  For example breakfast and desserts were showing on the menu board but are no longer available (...and my wife was tuned up for her some red velvet cake too!).  The biggest issue though is the time it takes...+15mins...for many entrees.  In fairness they do tell you up front and because of the longer time it takes you know it was freshly prepared.  

We will continue to sing Lo-Lo's praises to others and hope to visit the  DFW spot in the very near future but we seriously doubt we will do this smaller joint again."
2,"Food is okay, but really not special or made specially well. Ive had breakfast, lunch and dinner here before and it's like they don't put much care into the way dishes. 

And to add basic things is always some ridiculous extra charge. Hot chocolate, coffee, etc is regular but Ovaltine which is the same is 1.00 more. You get a french toast with peanut butter and condensed milk and they just drizzle enough for two bites. Honestly, what are you trying to save on? 

Wouldn't recommend this place and wouldn't really want to return."
2,"First time dined in ,,,, impressive with their serving. Great for lunch special..... 2nd time ordered take out,,,, whoa!!!! Half of the size as if somebody already ate half of it... Not sure what happened.... 3rd time dined in lunch special,,,, yup serving surely got smaller,,,,,....we still eat here occasionally.


Update: pricey ..... Got higher....."
2,"Imperial Garden has been around a long time and seems to be a local favorite. That struck me as a very bad sign when I came to Madison almost 20 years ago, and that continues to be the case. The food is insipid, blandly spiced to appeal to unadventurous midwestern tastes and with a menu reminiscent of the Americanized Chinese palaces of the 1950s. I end up there with various groups on occasion, but try to keep it to no more frequent than once every five years (more frequently in my first years in Madison, less so now). It's not that there are vastly superior authentic Chinese options (although I prefer P. F. Chang's, recognizing its limitations), but one does better with other Asian options when in Madison--particularly Thai/Laotian, but also Indian (with many new options in recent years)."
2,"We went around 3pm on a Thursday. The waitress seemed so uninterested in being there. I could talk about the lack of any customer service but I'll leave it at that. 

The food was pretty good. I ordered Dumplings, steamed dumplings, sugar pancake, and flower bread( I'm pretty sure there's some translation issues there). One of the bread items was suppose to come with condensed milk, and she didn't bother notifying us until she served the dish. That's what makes that dish. It's like saying that here's a fried rice dish but I forgot to tell you that we're out of rice. :S

Service: 1/5
Food: 3/5
Overall: 2/5"
2,"This place used to be much much better years ago. They recently made cuts to their food and instead of large plates of food and free noodle things... They give you half the food, no noodle things, and still charge the same amount.  Last time I ordered the General Chu chicken which tasted very old and fridge tasting. The tea tasted bad- I guess on the account they do not have filtered water. Will probably not be caught in there again-- too high of prices for small portions and old food."
2,"Kitchen M is a huge unit and there's never any wait time no matter when you come, though the restaurant itself is lively enough and has plenty of customers.  There's a cool shelf towards the right side of the restaurant in the back with a lot of superhero figurines.  The menu is big for a HK style afternoon tea cafe.  Unfortunately, the food is a hit or miss here.  I've had lunch items which were decent, and some other fried rice which was terrible.

Their lunch items come with a soup (asian style or borscht) and a drink with the usual +$ for cold drinks.  There is a button to push for service but it's better to just wave the waitresses down  Portions are very standard and even a tad bit larger than Congee Queen, but I would say the quality does not match Congee Queen or Golden Pheonix up the street."
2,The lo-los at the airport is not the same as the remote location. The waffles were not the same and the chicken sort of tasted like chicken from a knock off version. It had no seasoning and I was not happy with the meal at all.
2,"I think the vegtables are frozen, not fresh.  I would add a few bucks to each item and use fresh and the quality goes up.

Nothing special.  I work nearby and I have been once (April 2013).

I would go back with co-workers if someone picks it for lunch, but I would not pick it.

It does have a great low-carb menu and the service is fine."
2,"Oh Kitchen M... Food wise this place is mediocre and there is Phoenix just up a bit farther on McCowan.

I've been here twice now and both times, the service we received is pretty bad. It seems almost all the staff are grumpy or have some sort of attitude. I will say though, that there is one server who is sassy but entertaining because of how blunt she is.

The restaurant itself is decently furnished. As a fan of Hot Toys, the owner here has a decent display of various Iron Man figures. 

Go at your own risk!"
2,"Here you will find all your favorite American-Chinese hits in a pleasant environment. We stopped in for lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. It definitely feels more like a sit down restaurant than a Chinese to-go spot. The service was kind despite me flipping out when they informed me it would be $3 per person for brown rice, and I am still flipping out about that one. 

The lunch specials were nicely priced, but I was not impressed with the serving portion.  I ordered the garden tofu, and the flavor was okay. However, there wasn't a bounty of vegetables in this garden, which left me a little disappointed. The egg and corn soup that came with the lunch special was pretty un-spectacular. Even I could make a more flavorful version of this simple broth, and sadly, my crowning culinary achievement is toast. 

If I were hungry and in this shopping center, I wouldn't rule out stopping back in, but I think there are spots in down that do what they do a bit better."
2,"I used to love this place because hot pot places are typically less nice looking, but the quality and service has really gone down.

Heads up: if you want a big table (like 15 people), you have to book their ""room"" and spend a minimum of $500 or something crazy. You might as well reserve two tables side by side to avoid this minimum spend. You'll probably get better service with it anyways.

I also believe they're stopping their points system now. So use up those rewards before they expire the program. 

The spicy soup bases are really numbing here (even the if you pick the 1 pepper bases)! What I normally do is order a more plain soup base, while my dad gets the spicy one, and transfer some of his soup over to mix it myself. 

There are lots of food to choose from, but you have to order it more than once to get it to come out... or to get more than 4 pieces of each. As I said, the quality has changed, so nothing really stands out about this place for me anymore."
2,"Come on, Yelp -- this place is a 2 at best. I was totally suckered into this mediocre dinner by reviews that are way too high for the actual quality of the place. What a waste. Weird service, salty-as-hell sides, tough steak ... wish I could get a redo on this particular dinner choice. Just because you live in the sticks doesn't mean you rate something a 5 for simply existing in your town."
2,"This an average tasting, smaller portion and higher price chinese place.  Disappointed as it is in a nice location and we really don't have very good chinese places in the area but the search continues."
2,"Don't get me wrong, the restaurant offered a wonderful selection of fresh and good quality food... What made me give this place 2 stars was the service. We came during lunch time on a weekend and paid $28 + the price of the soup base per person. Definitely on the pricier side for lunch so I had  pretty high expectations. We ordered our food and nothing came out for 40 mins. We awkwardly waited at out tables and politely asked them about our order, 0 apologies from our server and still nothing came out. This was incredibly infuriating because you can only eat for 2 hours. Considering the lunch price is the same as the dinner price, I expected them to be fully stocked. We left hungry and disappointed, definitely won't be coming back."
2,"Not the best place, everything is greasy and the service is terrible. If you want to wait an hour and a half to be seated, this is the place for you. They even managed to make my salad disgusting once."
2,"We are a family of 4, love Chinese food, so decided to this place a whirl on a Sat eve at 8 pm. 
Service was very poor, the minute we stepped in. The hostess told us there was a wait but couldn't tell us how long ""I don't know""! She kept us waiting for 20 mins  and then took us in. We would've gladly waited longer if we were given an approximate wait time. 
Even after we were seated, we felt largely ignored. The restaurant had several empty tables. 
The food was absolutely mediocre. We ordered pot stickers for appetizer, Governors pork, chicken with vegetables, steamed Chinese broccoli, pan fried Noodles with chicken and brown rice. 
Except for the Governor's pork which we highly recommend, everything else was ho-hum, bland and forgettable. Wouldn't be returning!!"
2,"Don't let the newly refurbished decor fool you. The food here is substandard at best. Even for ""American"" Chinese food its pretty bad. Go to Panda express instead. 
The sauce in their Beef with Green Beans was gloppy and gross, it reminded me of mucus. Even the western chinese stand by, honey walnut prawns was covered in a thick hard batter!
I will give them a break. They have very attentive service, and are really nice people. Stick to the dishes with fresh veggies lightly prepared. 
But next time, I'll just drive down the street to Spring Mountain."
2,"While it was busy and the food was okay, I'm giving it 3 stars because of the quality of the service. I had called in advance to see if I could reserve a table (knowing it would be busy on a Friday but was told that they don't reserve for tables of 5 people and should just drop in. It's not a big deal but the girl on the phone wasn't very pleasant to talk to. Despite having bad service on the phone, we came anyway to try out luck and waited for over 45 minutes. When we were finally seated, the servers rushed us to order the food. We barely had time to crack open the menu before we were asked to order. 

The quality of the food was fairly good. The sauces came out quickly except for soy sauce. We had asked them to get us soy sauce 4 times but they always forgot to bring it. Finally, we had to just order soy sauce with no menu items to make sure we could get that sauce. 

At the end of the meal, we got ice cream! Each person at the table is able to have 1 soft serve each. :) The ice cream at the end was definitely the highlight of my meal. If you're looking for a hot pot place, this one is good for groups for more than 5 since you can reserve and have a table readily available. Be prepared for the servers to be lacking in presence BUT! If you just want simple hot pot, Morals Village is exactly that -- hot pot without the extra frills."

2,"I walked out of this place $30 lighter and wound up eating maybe $5 worth of the food. Just ugh. The Sesame Inn doesn't have lo mein on the menu - WTF kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't have lo mein? - but the hostess (I was ordering takeout) recommended chow mein instead. The noodles were spaghetti noodles, not Chinese noodles. The sesame chicken was nothing more than a fried, sliced chicken breast with some kind of watery soy sauce on the side to pour over the top, absolutely no chili paste or thick sticky sauce. Egg rolls were doughy and had little flavor. I've had way better meals from cheapy Chinese places in NY that charge $5 a plate. I can't believe I wasted $30 on this crap. It gets two stars instead of one because the restaurant itself, from what I saw, was clean, quiet and nicely lit and the staff was nice.

I don't understand why it is so freaking impossible to find good Chinese food in the Valley that's not from a chain like Pei Wei. In the last several years we've managed to get good pizza places here - can we import some East Coast Chinese? Of course, I realized last night that if I thought the last six or so Chinese places I've eaten at were terrible, maybe the problem isn't them, maybe I just don't like Chinese anymore!

Nah. It's totally them."
2,"To start was a really nice setting and I was very pleased with the look of the house Julep drink which I ordered from the bar. Was well made and served quickly. We sat, however, and when we weren't ready to order in the first two minutes were waiting for about 15 minutes until we grabbed a waiters attention to place our orders for drinks and starters. Waited another 10 minutes for our server to show up with drinks.

The menu looked interesting and we found some things we were not expecting. Mole tamales, fried chicken, shrimp and grits. The prices however were not commensurate with the product. $6 for cast iron skillet corn bread and it was okay. Not great, not bad, but for $6 we expected something more. 

The rest of the food we got was more of the same, okay, but nothing special and more than we would spend. If everything was 20%-30% cheaper this place could maybe get three stars. The tamale, however, is worth noting was horrible. The mole was nothing like mole's I have had in Mexico, and the creative license taken is not welcome. In short, Julep is not worth the money, particularly with cheaper tastier options within blocks."
2,"Good:  Naan, Paratha.  
Average:  Mutton Sukka Masala
Poor:  Muttar Paneer, Chicken Biryani

Way over priced for quality of food you get.. I have had some authentic Biryanis, this one did not even get close to tasty, was spicy, but rice itself was not even well made.  Sad butter chicken.. Mutter paneer.. was a serious Meh.. these are standards and should have been made very well but were not.. on bright side, they made amazing  Naan, and Paratha, too bad couldnt enjoy it with same caliber for other dishes I got.  Place was really busy.. now i don't understand why.."
2,"A decent place. Good prices on drinks and the food is above average here. But service here is horrible. Seriously, whoever owns this place should find better help.

Mostly the night bartenders are great, but the bartender that works during the day, is HORRIBLE. Only two patrons in the place at noon, and she was rarely at the bar....was hanging out in the kitchen most of the time. And it would take easily, 10 minutes to get another drink from her. 

I couldn't believe my eyes but I actually saw the other patron reach behind the bar and pour himself a drink because nobody was around. LOL. I just hope that person worked there."
2,"If you want a place that will remind you of dorm life, here's the place for you.  If you actually want a place where you can relax in peace and quiet, go elsewhere.  The physical facilities are fine, and the people are nice, but it's not a place to live if you want somewhere peaceful."
2,"I haven't had chinese food in a while and don't know why I would bother coming up this far north to get it.  I got the lunch special which is way more expensive than other places and the food was 'meh'.  For Chinese food I would go anywhere else.  

They lose 3 stars for mediocre food and high price tag to go along with it.

i do have to say, they have very nice service and the fortune cookies were surprisingly fresh."
2,"Okay, so really I give Dumpling House 2.5 stars, but closer to the 2 side than the 3 side.  

We ordered the Pork, Chive, Egg & Shrimp Dumpling as well as the Wonton Noodles.  After having read the various reviews about avoiding the Korean dishes, I decided to listen to my fellow Yelpers and we skipped that.

The wonton soup base might as well have been water because it was so tasteless and bland.  The noodles were a udon-like noodle which was the first surprise of this dish as it is not the traditional noodle used in wonton noodle soup.  The second surprise of the evening with this dish was that the wontons didn't have a shrimp filling!  It had a pork filling.  I didn't care too much for the layer-thick wrapper, but the filling itself was quite savory.

Now onto their supposed specialty, dumplings!  The dumpling wrapper is the thinnest and best I've had thus far in Toronto.  The filling would've gone quite well with that bland wonton soup base because it was just as blah.  

I think that if the filling from the wontons and the wrappers from the dumplings were an item, it would've been wonderful... but unfortunately, the dumpling genie failed to grant that wish!

A good place to go if you want to fill up fast.  Our bills came to $12.41 for 2 people and the serving sizes were generous."
2,"What a crushing experience.
 My son was in town and when he is here we like to visit and spoil ourselves to a splurge of a dinner outing. This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.
Ok..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.
After the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.

Appetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...

My forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.
More importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.
What arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!

As the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server
 We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. Not a total loss I guess.Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated."
2,"For US customers: they don't accept US debit card, US dollar, and any type of credit card! Although we paid with credit card twice with no problem in last three weeks, this time they just didn't accept it. They didn't even accept US dollars. If you don't have enough cash with you and don't want to bother using the paid ATM outside, don't go!
Food was okay. Can't complain for service. But I'm sure there're tons of nice hot pot restaurants who would accept credit card, which makes life much easier!"
2,"Service was great, in and out for lunch in less than 30 minutes.  The food was not great got the Philly cheese steak.  The sandwich was so salty I thought I would have a heart attack before I go to my car.  I normally do a good job at cleaning my plate not on this one.  I will be spending the remainder of the day hydrating to flush my system."
2,I love fried chicken and fried okra an collards. The food here was not so good. The chicken was smothered in a very very salty gravy with spicy sausage in it. I will not eat here again and cannot recommend this place.
2,"We have been visiting Imperial Garden for over 30 years and have always found it to have the best Chinese food in Madison, or regionally for that matter.  The Midwest remains pretty much a wasteland in the Chinese food category.  Imperial was always our oasis.  However, lately they have fallen out of bed.  On both occasions that we have been there within the last six months, the food has lost its character and flavor.  Also, on both occasions our food was served barely warm, so it had been sitting around awhile before it ever got to us.  Disappointing.

Giving Imperial Garden three stars would be overly generous at this point, as the food really was disappointing, and was definitely not A-OK.  We usually order way more than we can eat and take away the rest for reheating at home another day.  In this case even the leftovers, which I always enjoy almost as much as the first time around, were pretty dismal.  I won't get into the details of which dishes, but across the board that we have sampled, it appears that the chef has changed, and not for the better."
2,"We made a reservation by phone for a table for 7 people at 6:00 pm.  Upon arrival, the host stated that they had no record of it.  We had to wait for about 10 minutes, while staff rearranged tables to seat our party.  When our drink order was taken, everyone received their drinks except me.  I had ordered coffee, and it didn't arrive for more than 15 minutes.  Later, I ordered a refill after dinner, and it didn't arrive for another 15 minutes, and this time, it was cold.  Apparently, they order each cup from AOK Coffee at least 50 feet away from the restaurant.  While the food is excellent, the coffee system is beyond rediculous!  I won't be back!"
2,"Located in an old plaza across from Markville Mall, Kitchen M takes this notoriously oft-changing restaurant spot. I don't know whether it's the fact that this location doesn't get a lot of traffic because it's rather disconnected from anything else you might want to drop by for (the only other storefronts in this plaza are basically a Baskin Robbins & a private driving school) or because this place is somehow just cursed, but restaurants don't seem to stay in this spot for any longer than a year or two. 

Kitchen M serves a mishmash of dim sum, Cantonese a la carte dishes, and some HK-style cafe items.  The food's OK.  Some of the dim sum dishes are quite large, so you get some bang for your buck.  The one standout item for me would be the deep fried milk egg custard buns. Otherwise, in perfect honesty I feel that everything else is take it or leave it.  Will Kitchen M succumb to the 1-2 year curse?"
2,"CONCERN FOR LACK OF SECURITY:

*Forgive the lengthy review but you MUST READ.* 

Updating my review because I am 6 months into my lease and realized how sucky security is here. I know it's located in the ghettos and that being on the first floor makes it an easy target for robbery and theft. However, I feel that there should be at least a security guard on duty during dark hours. I have seen none so far this winter break, and since it is advertised as a student living apartment complex, then we are at high risk of break-ins during the holidays and school breaks. The decrease in lights, residence on property, and cars in the parking lot gives away the fact that not a lot of residence are home during these times.

I've heard of my fellow residents being robbed during finals week, during christmas, and during the new years week (not just into their apartments but in their storage spaces as well, which are located in the hallways of every floor). Obviously nothing has been done thus far. May I also add that I woke up to 2 male suspects breaking my window screen and trying to lift my window open at 3am in the morning 2 days ago. Luckily I have personally secured it as best as I can and turned on my light to scare them off. Later that morning I found that a lot of the first floor window screens located on the back of the buildings were damaged and bent just as mine was. There really should be more light posts installed in the darker areas of the property.

One of my roomates called the office about the incident and all the guy had to say was to file a police report. How about comforting us that you will work out a better security plan?

Even during the school year when there is a security guard on duty, you can find him or her inside of the lounge area going on the computer or taking extended breaks. They walk around sometimes, and sometimes they're nowhere to be found. So I hope that management can straighten them out or hire more qualified security guards and/or installing motion sensored recording cameras on property.

I have contacted management with my concerns/suggestions and now awaiting for a reply and (hopefully) their plan of action to prevent future break ins. If not, I'm definitely updating my review again. 

Security is a number one priority in my books when it comes to living in any house or apartment. So this is the brutal truth as of right now and I hope that I, nor any other resident, wakes up to a burglar trying to break in or come home to find precious valuables missing.

------------------------------------------

Update: Never got a reply from management, however I do see security more often on the property during dark hours. Props to them for staying in this cold weather. Several window screens are still dented/damaged, mines included. But I dont see strangers or robberies happening on the property. I believe it has to do a little with the on-duty security and the fact that everyone recently just came back from winter break. Hopefully this keeps up!"
2,"Perhaps it is because I recently had an amazing dinner at Haveli full of delicious spices, but my dinner at Imperial Garden was bland bland bland. I requested cashew shrimp ""as spicy as they can make it."" Aside from a couple pepper flakes, no spice. Calamari was bland rubber bands. Appetizer of shrimp Rangoon? You guessed it: boring. I will say the shrimp was cooked well, so there was that. Plus the cocktail (bourbon, ginger, bitter) was tasty, otherwise we'd be looking at one star. Not sure what has happened to this place, but Madison's Best no longer."
2,"Having always driven by this place and seeing how during some evenings the parking lot is full, my daughter and I decided to celebrate her birthday here. As we were walking in, I jokingly told my daughter, ""Watch they put us way back in some corner, away from everyone else."" Lo and behold, we were! I'm not sure if it was coincidence or the way we looked (dressed pretty casual..maybe it was ""us"").
We waited about 10 minutes for our waiter and water to come. Then another 5 to order. We were pressed for time, having another appointment to go to. I thought budgeting a time of 1 hr would be enough, but not at that pace!
Our food, a dish of chow fun subgum and shrimp fried rice, took about 15 minutes to be served. The chow fun noodles looked like they had been sitting out for a while and were starting to congeal. There were little strips of carrots in the dish, something I've never had with this dish before. I was expecting something like stir-fried chinese broccoli. Skimping on veggies aren't we?! The shrimp fried rice was the better tasting dish. Plenty of shrimp and so-so flavor. Both dishes came to a total around $22.
I kept on saying to my daughter, ""You know, this other restaurant (which is only carryout) is so much better than this.""  I think I repeated it three times to her throughout our meal. 
By the time we were done, I quickly told the waiter we simply had to go somewhere else and needed the check asap and boxes for our food. He was prompt and delivered. 
I asked my daughter how many stars she would give. She said 3 1/2 because the restaurant was decorated nicely and the furniture was comfy. I still say 2 stars for food though cuz there's this one place (which is carryout only) that is so much better."
2,"40minute wait for food, the restaurant only had 5 tables full.

Service was not very good.

Dumplings were alright but not amazing"
2,"Generally this restaurant is really good with service and food but today they dropped the ball. Was seated with my wife, we waited for someone to get our drink order.... and waited and waited.... After 15 minutes of watching wait staff zoom around us to other tables, we left. Sadly we will not be back to this location."
2,"I went here once for their buffet as a kid and wasn't a fan but thought I would give it another chance now. 

Price Range (Not Including Tax & Tip) : $8-$15 per entree. For a Tamil/Indian place I would see it's a bit pricer than I expected. 

Food Quality (Taste, Portion, Menu) - 2/5 
We had the Paper Dosa, Veggie Kothu Roti, Mango Lassi and Garlic Naan. I wasn't a fan of the food at all besides the Mutter Paneer and Naan. The Kothu Roti had no flavour and didn't have many roti pieces. I found the dosa to be too grainy compared to other places I've had it at. The dosa was more of a novelty as it was huge!  I liked the Naan a lot and found the paneer alright. I loved the Mango Lassi, this was the best part of the meal. They have a pretty big menu, a lot of options both veggie and meat. The portions for weren't as big as I expected, I'd say it was on the smaller side. 

Atmosphere - 4/5
It has an Indian palace vibe which I really liked. The places was well decorated and it looked very picturesque.  They have a lot of seats as it is a fairly big place, so it works well for any size of group. They have their own parking lot so it's really easy to find a parking spot. 

Service - 5/5
The staff was really nice and courteous. They were very prompt in taking our order, checking that the meal was okay and refilling our water. The food came out pretty quick and came out together as well.

Would I go again?
Maybe 1 more try? For the most part I don't think I would go again. Theres a bunch of other places that I prefer. 

Lash's Recommendations 
Mango Lassi - The consistency and flavour is amazing. It's pretty filling too! 

Garlic Naan - Perfect compliment for any of the curry dishes."
2,"First, a curious note.  The restaurant seems to refrigerate its dishes;  hot tea was served in icy teapots that promptly rendered the tea insipid.  Delicious hot spring rolls cooled off immediately.  Very odd.

My wife vouches for their excellent entrees;  I can't.  The wait staff were so chaotic that I could only watch her eat while they ran crashing around the restaurant.  We flagged them down repeatedly, but amid frenzied prepping to-go orders and serving other table guests, they never got my order out

I cancelled my order when she'd finished her meal, and we left.  There was much hilarious wringing of hands over my cancellation, but we simply could not wait longer.

We hope the staff there gets adequate rest, and stops mimicking the Keystone Kops. If the restaurant ever organizes itself, it will likely be a winner."
2,"This was my first time trying an AYCE hotpot place. Got here around 5pm on a weekday and it was already full! Good thing my friend made a reservation. All of the servers there spoke mandarin and barely English. The server kept telling us that we had to place our order soon as there's a time limit to the buffet. I found that quite annoying. I don't speak any mandarin and I kept trying to tell him that we were waiting for another friend. I don't think he understood. Finally, my friend came and we ordered all at once. 

There's lots of choices on the menu but the menu I was given was all in simplified Chinese! Kinda had to guess as I can only read traditional. There's lots of choices for meat, fish balls, vegetables, and noodles! However, the quality of the food isn't the best. The luncheon meat (spam) was very slimy and doesn't really taste like anything. A lot of the fish balls weren't the best. I also ordered the scallops (add-on) and would have expected better for the price I paid. The scallops weren't defrosted. They were all hard and I had to wait for them to defrost until I could put them in the pot. They should be defrosted upon ordering. If cooked frozen, the scallops would be very rough and tough. They were high quality scallops, but not prepared properly for serving. 

Also, the switch on my pot kept switching off. Every time happened I would have to call a server to start it up for me again. That was quite annoying. 

As for the price, almost $40 per person after the soup base price + AYCE price + tax + tips. I think the money could be spent on higher quality food with better service."
2,"We wish we had read Dena S's review before we came here tonight. Like her, we too are frequent diners at China Tango. The servings were huge and the prices low. We should have known as soon as we sat down something had changed. The crispy noodles were not the same nor nearly as good. Even though wine was still one the menu, it was not available (maybe new owners had'nt received their liquor license yet). The serving of Orange Chicken was a third less than it use to be. We always had leftovers that were ear tagged for the next day's lunch, but not this time. We will be making the drive up to China One, about a mile or two up the road, in the future."
2,"The short of the story is - we went here yesterday (Mother's Day) and were there 3 hours! Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .

For years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the ""Chinese Restaurant Gas Station"". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.

The building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. 

Now - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.

This is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. 

Eventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.

Overall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.

Try it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food."
2,Not worth the buffet for 13.99. The buffet refills took so long that we did not eat most of the items. The cook was catering to the people who order off the menu and the buffet was refilled at the end. It took for ever to get even the water. Would avoide buffet. May be food is food if you order off the menu!
2,"The best part about this eatery is the ambience. It's a bit too casual/a bit on the unprofessional side. The woman who poured our drinks was swallowing food every third word. She had a snack in one hand and pouring our water in the other hand. As she left our table she took one big bite out of her snack. I just have never experienced someone eating while working on the restaurant floor. We ordered the shrimp fritters and they were delicious-good flavor and texture. We also ordered the Blue crab cake, Nashville salad, and shrimp & grits. One thought was that the last 3 dishes all had the same taste, nothing stuck out as interesting in a positive way. The 3 dishes had one level to them. The Nashville salad was a bit too sweet. The shrimp & grits was more like soup then real grits-very saucy. Not true southern grits. The blue crab cake tasted very similar to the salad. The small plates and main dish was not flavored or seasoned well, which created a blah taste in the overall experience. We did not do dessert.

Overall, the space and menu is trendy/new, but not solid nor exciting. The staff were kind. The ambience was nice. The price point was too high for the quality of the food. The food was meh-okay. We probably won't be returning nor recommending this place. I hope through some more time they can polish off the service and food."
2,"This review is for the meat-lover's pizza.  Servpro (frozen pizza) crust, doesn't look like much effort went into this.  For $22 retail 16"", it's not worth the expense.  Napoli is just half a block away and at least that's hand-thrown for cheaper.  
Glad I paid $11 for happy hour - I would have been very unhappy at $22.  
F&B- at least a Freshetta or CPK would be an upgrade for about the same wholesale cost."
2,"Crappy 1970s decor, food is decent but grossly overpriced. They don't put any fried noodles on the table...if you want them, they charge you $3.00 ..ridiculous ripoff!"
2,"Meh' I think I went to the wrong location. The airport menu was scarce and they were sold out of everything by the time I got there.  I got a few pieces of chicken and a waffle, there truly isn't anything special about it. It surely isn't Roscoe's chicken and waffles."
2,"Was looking forward to the prime rib,but its only served on weekends.  Had to get another cut of steak instead.  The overall quality was OK for a chain.  The two sides were tasty.  They ran out of the Rolls and Cinnamon Butter or couldn't make it for some unknown reason.  Therefore was never served any :(.  Kinda bad service since server stop refilling water as soon as you pay your bill.  

Recommendation: 
Prepare to wait since this is usually busy."
2,"If I would have written this review a few weeks ago, it would have taken a completely different tone. I was coming here LITERALLY 4-5 times a week for lunch. The value was unparalleled. The food tasted GREAT. The service was quick and everyone was so nice. 

Now??? They have changed management/ownership and it is a 180 turn from what it was!!! The only thing that is the same is the menu and pricing. The recipes are different and the portions are about HALF of what they previously were.  I don't think that any of the changes they made have brought anything positive to the restaurant. I hate the new flavors. A few days ago I tried to come during my lunch. I stood there for TEN minutes of my lunch hour without ANY service and eventually had to leave and just drove through McDonalds. So disappointing. 

I'm really bummed because I was such a loyal customer (I'm the duchess!) and this is RIGHT by both my home and work. Today was their last chance. I will almost certainly not be back."
2,"Had our work lunch here on this fine sunny April Wednesday!  Recommended by our south Indian co-worker.  If you are coming from down from 401, the building is a bit angle to the south on your left side behind a parking lot (try not to miss it =P).  

I had high hopes.  I knew south Indian cuisine would be super Spicy!  But was hoping to have some variety of other non spicy dishes / options.  Unfortunately, even the fried rice where mildly spicy :(  I had the butter chicken, it looks dry and actually over cooked.  Even on the second batch. So sad ... definitely for $12.99/pp I'd have expected more.

Highlight of the visit: 
Co-Worker ordered us a paper dosa each.  It's like a thin crepe made with rice, coconut and etc.  The dipping sauce was yogurt ish and very tasty.   

Food (Taste): 2/5
Food (Presentation): 3/5
Kitchen (Delivery Speed): (N/A)/5 - it's a buffet :) the paper dosa took a few mins.
Service: 1/5 - no one came to grab our dirty / finished plates.  
Ambiance: 4/5 - nice quiet place to have some chats with friends / co-workers
Fun Factor: 2/5"
2,"Meh, typical Chinese fast food resto, with sub par quality in food.  Service is on point though.  Seats are not comfortable, though nice decor.

Chinese rice roll : way too thick"
2,"We had a pretty good experience here. The service was good and the food quality was on point too. Too bad it's only cash or debit only which is a huge minus for me and somewhat pricy for what it is.

Food: 3/5, good quality and a lot of choices. The beef ribeye were good and the veggies but the balls and other smaller items were just ok.  I also wish they had more sauce choices.

Service: 3/5, on point with attentiveness but at the same time, there weren't a lot of people.  

Ambience, 3/5, great seating and large tables, so with a lot of dishes, you can place your items without crowding.

Price: 1/5, the debit or cash only option is ridiculous and it came to about $40 per person which I'm not sure is good for hotpot.  At the end, it's just buffet so I feel that other places around $25 are better for it."
2,"Yesterday, their shop at the red rock casino. I decided to take advantage of their anniversary special on the..Bobbie for $4.... this was a full sandwich..I also purchased a pastrami, full size...Guess What...no signs posted for the special on the Bobbie...I had to ask them to get this..Bobbie... at the special price....Guess What....a few scraps of turkey, compared to the huge amount on the pastrami?????

IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS...WHY NOT SELL ALL YOUR SANDWICHES FOR $4... WITH SCRAPS OF MEAT...DUH..

SHAME ON YOU"
2,"I expected the beef to be more fresh and to have more fatty in the beef (Although this may be a personal preference). 
I think there should be more assortment of vegetables on the menu.

On the positive note, the interior was nice and the place is very clean. 
Service was great, our waiter came back to check on us in good intervals. Since it was AYCE, it was very convenient for us not having to flag someone down all the time."
2,"Went for lunch with my hunny today.  The lady from the back of the room was waiving her arms for us to come and get seated instead of greeting us at the door.  Kinda weird.  We got seated and the lady asked our drink order.  Ten minutes later a guy came to take our drink order....and five minutes later the lady asked us our drink order again because she didnt remember.  (I think there were only a couple people working the tables)

Anyways, ordered the mongolian beef for the BF and seschwan chicken for me.  Served with corn soup and fried noodles.  All the food was good.

Service lacked personality, friendliness, and attention.  I am a big sucker for good service-I will go back for the service if the food is so so but definitely the service was a big fat ONE STAR! ;)  Im also a sucker for ambiance....another big fat ONE STAR.  

Good thing the food was pretty good. 

Food good.
Service NOT good.
Lunch Price great.
Ambiance eh.

If your just looking for a quick meal-go for the food....dont go for good service or great ambiance if that means anything to you."
2,"The hostess was inattentive and working on the computer while we stood there waiting to be seated, restaurant was almost empty so no reason to wait. The apps were very good, the pimento cheese was a highlight. As far as the main dishes went the fried chicken was good. But the grits in the shrimp and grits were undercooked and the pot roast was overcooked. Overall, food was okay, but not worth the price. Too many good restaurants in Madison to go back."
2,"The food was absolutely delicious! The service sucks! The host seems to be very pleasant , but my waitress Celesta was horrible. Celesta literally took 15min to even give me water after being seated , I had to repeatedly ask for things she should have already had with her such as napkins , and straws i mean come on!!!! After speaking with her manager about her lack of service, she had an even worse attitude but i digress."
2,"Did I not review this place???  Geez...it really must have not been very memorable one way or the other.  :p  All kidding aside, I really didn't see what all the fuss was about for their dumplings.  

My husband and I are dumpling lovers and we've gone to our share of dumpling restaurants and this place really is sub-par.  The dumplings were just okay and their noodle soup which resembled Kal-Gook-Soo, was just as ""meh"" as the dumplings.  

The confusion as to whether they were serving Chinese or Korean cuisine was settled almost immediately when we tried their banchan.  Yup, there was nothing Korean about their flavours.  Nor were the dumplings distinctively Chinese.  

I'm really not sure how I feel about this ""fusion"" Chinese-Korean food but I doubt that I'll be making my way back here again.  If I wanted Chinese style dumplings, there are far better places to go (try the northern Chinese resto in Metro Square by IBM) and for Korean food, I'd rather swing by In-Chon house which is just around the corner."
2,"I went here with my heart set on a veggie cheesesteak and you were out.  I was told by the sandwich jockey that it is ""a very popular sandwich.""  Well, if you are aware of this, then why not order/stock more?  It is either in refrigerated or frozen vacuum-sealed packs (yes, I have seen you prepare it before), so that tells me that it has a decent shelf life... so keep it in stock!

My second choice was an eggplant parm sandwich, until you told me the marinara sauce has meatballs in it... what?  Please consider the vegetarians and don't have the meat in the red sauce.  It is extremely easy to keep meatballs separate from marinara sauce, and just sauce the meatballs as needed.

I am so disappointed in Capriotti's Red Rock!!!!"
2,"I suppose we could have had a worse experience so I gave 2 stars. Our salesperson was very intense - putting me off instantly. Since it was my husband's purchase and he thought she was 'okay', we proceeded. I wish we had walked away. They had us return 3 times and use up two days of my husband's 3 days off for no reason. 7 hours and 2 trips the first day and 4 hours the next day. We said we wanted to run the financing by our credit union but they acted like they didn't hear us and pushed their own finance institution through. We now have to redo all the paperwork to get the much better rate with our own credit union. We specifically stated NO TEXTS and we are getting them regularly. No one was rude - they just didn't seem to value our time or wishes. A very harrowing and unsatisfactory experience. They seem to be more interested in selling cars than in their customers."
2,"I really wanted to like this place as a neighborhood bar since I live so close that I could walk to it. My review is based off a few visits and all have been negative. 2 stars for the food, which was ok, but the service SUCKS! I've sat at the bar with my fiance on a date night and we were ignored by the female bartender to the point where another bartender would see that our drinks are empty and ask if we would like another round. It was so ridiculous! The bar wasn't even busy and this bartender would see that our drinks are empty and ignore us and stay at the other end if the bar. We each had 2 drinks and decided that the crappy service wasn't worth our business and left! We won't be back!

If you are a bartender that works at Sierra Gold and wonder why you have ever gotten a bad tip: it's because you gave horrible service! Acknowledge all your customers - it's your job to represent Sierra Gold and make sure people feel welcome. If you are not smart enough to figure out that this is how you make money in tips and don't care then just quit because you are hurting the business that you work for!"
2,"I really wanted Lo Lo's to do well at the airport. It's refreshing to see the corporate places out and local business in. I was severely disappointed. I got my food as soon as they called my name and I started to dig in to some tough chicken and some really limp waffles. The flavors were there, but none of the magic like the Central location."
2,"Delivered the wrong food, and didn't pick up the phone when we tried to raise the alarm.  Whatever the food was they delivered was 2-star quality, which is why I didn't 1-star them.  

Very nice on the phone, very nice delivery, but the food borders on really bad.  The potstickers are a must-avoid, and the lo mein had very old chicken.  This place should be better, but it's just not."
2,Nice place to go to have a beer and gamble if you're into that but do yourself a big favor and stay away from the breakfast menu the food is greasy and tastes terrible I had the chicken fried steak and eggs the chicken fried steak tasted like it was cooked in oil that had been in the deep fryer for a week I couldn't hardly touch it the staff is very friendly but I'll take my dining experience elsewhere
2,"Disappointed...

Ordered a Lil Amadhi w/ 2 pcs of thigh.  

My golden waffle was soggy, not crispy.  

As for the thighs, one pc was acceptable and juicy.  

Other pc was previously fried chicken refried so it was old, dry, and tough..."
2,I liked my dosa. But I was influenced by my family. Dosa arrived 2 min after ordering.  Before our drinks. Red wine poured back into bottle.
2,"I was so glad that there's a Lo-lo's at the airport. It's located on the third floor before heading to the gates for security check-in. The food is delicious! I ordered a side of fries, and they were not stingy about it - plenty of fries to share with other people. We got the Lo-lo's Special with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I recommend dipping the chicken in the hot sauce that is provided. The waffles also taste so much better when you add on the butter and syrup. I love getting the Kool-Aid; the amount of sweetness is spot on. My favorite is the fruit punch.

I would have given this place 3 stars for great food and convenient location. However, the service was terrible. The server did a subpar job. She couldn't remember our order. When our order was ready, she was stressed out that we were asking for extra hot sauce. There was only 2 other people waiting in line - nothing to be flustered about. She finally gave us our food, but forgot to give us our Kool Aid. We immediately informed her of our missing drink. Instead of correcting her mistake, she made us wait for her to ring up two more customers before giving us our Kool Aid. We were just awkwardly waiting at the pickup counter. Seriously, it does not take long to fill up a drink and give it to the customer. Our food was cold by the time we could get to it. Very disappointed in the decision-making process of this worker. I took away one star for bad service."
2,"Chettinad Chicken masala the sauce is good but chicken little pieces bones they cut the chicken tight into 4 not good for the value $12.99  rate poor
Boneless chicken biriyani was excellent. 

Fish Fry was not fresh very fishy."
2,"Food was disappointing. I am a huge Chinese food lover , and being my first time here, I was extremely dissatisfied. After reading about all the good awards this restaurant had gotten, I had high hopes. The flavors were bland, no authentic taste. The items on the menu were limited. Am underwhelming experience overall."
2,"Extremely mediocre in all senses.

DRINKS
-took over 20 mins to get a rye and diet and when we followed up they said the bar was really busy...
-they mistakenly brought Rye and gingers instead

FOOD
- the food came out before the drinks which was not a good start 
- the chips and guac were very tasty, would have paid 7$ for this not $15
- the Tostada was just a giant chip loaded with guac, under it i may have found a tiny bite of chicken 
- flank steak with chimmichurri was not warm 
- the tamale was a giant corn cake that tasted like cardboard, very dense and completely under seasoned also couldn't taste any chicken in it

Overall the decor and atmosphere were good but compare the prices and food to other great restaurants in king west I would not return or recommend to anyone. The food severely lacked seasoning and service was sub par."
2,"We are locals who have always loved this place.  However, today was a different story.  I ordered a glass of wine.  It was about half the size I had been served in the past.  When I questioned our waitress, I was told that the new management had reduced the amt. served.  Keep in mind, this is not a strip property; a neighborhood bar.  I next ordered the cajun ahi tuna salad which I have probably order at least 10 times.  In the past, the tuna was, lightly seared, still pink, & put into the salad.  Today, the tuna was ice cold & apparently seared in advance & refrigerated.  A totally different & less appealing meal.  I reported this to our waitress who said she spoke with the kitchen staff.  They maintained the tuna had just been seared.  Not true.  We won't be going back.  The PTs corporation is growing by leaps & bounds.  Unfortunately they are forgetting about the locals who supported their efforts."
2,"The food and service were good, and it helped that we were there on a snowy weeknight; when it's less busy it's easier to get a server's nearly undivided attention. One point of disappointment: The fresh-squeezed lemonade. Fresh-squeezed lemonade is very hard to find, least of all at a non-breakfast place, and because of that I specifically asked whether it was indeed freshly squeezed in-house (they said it was),  whether it was unsweetened (they said it was), and whether it was essentially lemon juice mixed with water (they said it was). Delighted, I ordered one. What arrived certainly didn't taste like fresh-squeezed lemonade. I asked again what was in it, because it tasted sweet to me, and they said it was fresh-squeezed lemonade with Country Time lemonade powder added to it (that's like ordering a glass of champagne and getting a champagne mixed with Sprite). It's sad that I wasn't told the truth before I ordered (and paid for) it, especially after the exhaustive number of questions I had asked. A little integrity goes a long way."
2,"I did carry out here because I really wanted to try their salt and pepper wings. I also ordered some chow mien and fried rice. The wings had a weird after taste to them. They were not that crispy either. The taste kind of turned me off . The chow mien was decent .
 The fried rice was generic tasting. I typically rate fried rice based on if it would taste better than how I would make it. I would have been better off making my own. I 'm glad the rice came with my order for free due to their coupon. Their rice is comparable to Panda Express. I expected more from China Tango because they are not considered to be a fast food chain so  I set my expectations higher. 

The food didn't leave me wanting more it made me lose my craving for wings. The sides were fine but the chicken really threw me for a loop that left me queasy!"
2,"OK... another HK fast food Rest., well this is not my first time here however this time was the worst service ever.  Walked in, standing there for 10 mins, no one came to greet us (party of 2), mind you, there are empty tables, finally got a table.  Ordered food and drinks, I have ordered a lemon iced tea without sugar, but it came super sweet, I asked one of the server to change it, which I got an attitude person, anyways asked to change my drink.  5 mins or so my drink came back, I was like wait a min, the straw have the same lipstick colour as what I was wearing, so they have given me the same cup that I returned... yup of course it is super sweet...wow, unbelievable...! I did not expect super service when I know I am eating at a Chinese fast food rest... but still how can you give the same cup, same drink to a customer that was returned? Wow....."
2,"* Chicken was fried to heck and back then to heck and back again.

* Waffles were spongie

* Syrup was watery

* Not only is a bun a sandwich option... it's the only option... cmon guys.

* No need to discern the Lemonade from the Kool-aid amd it's just lemon flavored Kool-aid"
2,"+: Food is decent. Pho (rare beef pho) is not too oily compared to some other Vietnamese restaurants. 

-: Service is not good. Waitresses are rude. Place is fairly dirty in general. Small space, so very crowded at times."
2,"Southern means big portions, juicy, and ""mama's cooking"". When you charge $23 for chicken with 4 pieces of veggies...how the hell is that comfort food. Don't make Southern food hipster...that's just not ok.

Great bar though and friendly staff...."
2,"It's perhaps the closest you can get to authetic Chinese food in a place like Madison, particularly after China Palace closed. The food is alright, it's been embellished in a way to appeal to an American audience, but at least the some of the menu choices are pretty real. 

My real problem with this place is the service: The menu was misinforming and didn't specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish. I politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager. The manager only ended up refunding me 50% off the item ordered and began telling me how you wouldn't refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant!

In the end, I paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress, but I will never visit this place again. I'm not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because I was a young college student or what, but her management skills leave much to be desired."
2,"A couple of weeks ago we took a friend to dinner at Julep for her birthday. We sat on the patio/courtyard near the stone wall in the back. I had noticed an odor immediately upon being seated but said nothing because of the occasion. Well, after dinner I walked back through the opening in the rock wall to confirm my suspicion and indeed the restaurant's dumpsters are stored on the other side. I thought of saying something to the hostess at the time, but didn't.  Instead I took the time to write a letter, a real letter, to the owners alerting them to the problem. I wrote in the interest of the success of the restaurant, not seeking anything in return. What is most shocking about this experience is that I received no reply at all, not a thank you for alerting them, nor an apology. As far as the food goes, it was just OK. None of us, including especially our friend whose birthday it was and is from Georgia, was especially pleased with our menu choices. Needless to say we won't be returning anytime soon."
2,The food was expensive but tasted bland. Spicy with no true flavour. Service was not the best. They just dumped plates and we had to lay them out.
2,"I am disappointed. 

I recently came back to my once beloved dumpling hub with a few friends.  Most of us are returning customers who have had positive experiences here. Also, note that Dumpling Restaurant was at the core of my gastric adventures during university and my Yelp friends also liked the dumplings when I invited them here just a few months back. 

I am not sure what happened, but something seemed amiss last weekend.  We ordered the bok choy dumplings, the pork and fennel dumplings, the lamb dumplings, and the pickled vegetable and meat noodle soup. With the exception of the soup, which was flavourful yet light, I was taken back by the dumplings. The dumplings felt a little different. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it seemed like there was less filling and broth inside the wrappers and the bamboo steamers they came in seemed to waft with a funky  scent. Sanitization was never the restaurant's strong point, but I just couldn't let the smell slip my mind. I lost my appetite and I am too wary to return."
2,"I was excited to try this place. So excited in fact that I walked out of the terminal knowing that I'd have to go back through security again to get back on my plane. The best thing I can say about this place was that the cashier was upbeat, helpful and friendly. Otherwise this could be the most overpriced chicken and waffles I've ever had in my life. I was pretty disappointed although the sweet tea was way better than anything else I'd expect to find in Phoenix.

When I ordered three boneless chicken tenders with a waffle they told me it was going to take 12 minutes to cook and it did. I was more than happy to wait and had plenty of time. I figured having paid $16 for the meal it was going to be darn good. Unfortunately that wasn't the case period

I I grabbed my meal walked 20 feet and sat down at a table to try it out. The waffle was soaking wet and not even close to being done. This is an epic fail for a place that advertises Chicken and Waffles. If you're going to pride yourself on a meal like this the waffle better be crispy and have flavor period this had neither. The chicken was very average but no better than something offered at chains like Raising Cane's for a quarter of the price. What was most disappointing was there was absolutely no flavor to the chicken tender at all. Sure, it was fairly juicy but if you didn't dip it in the ranch you might as well drink water because it was tasteless. I ate the chicken tenders just because I paid so much for him and left the waffle after trying it. 

Another thing to consider if you are going to charge us as much as you do please take into consideration that everyone has to use a fork and knife to eat the waffle. That means when you place the waffle on foil and you try to cut through it the foil breaks apart and embeds itself in the waffle. Unfortunately foil doesn't taste well.  Even a paper plate would be much better. Again what a disappointment."
2,"I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for. 

For starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.

The staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.

Imperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons."
2,"My sister and I went here for dinner last night. We started with  shrimp rangoon. Under stuffed and flavor was OK for fried anything.  I got the sea bass with mixed vegetables and it came floating in a sauce and a few small veggies...super skimpy for a $22 dish.  My sister ordered a shrimp dish and it was meh. This place used to rock, and best Chinese food in Madison. What happened?  The table we were at was rocky and the dry wall cracked. ALL of the beautiful wood pieces on the walls were covered in thick dust.  I was thinking I go to an Asian Bistro near me for WAY LESS, and it's SO much better.  Plus they know I love the veggies and lay them on me. Don't call a dish, Sea Bass with mixed veggies and call a few sliced onions carrots and green onions so thinly sliced they were barely recognizable with mixed anything...  Who give this place 4 or 5 stars apparently also eat at fast food places and think it's a good meal. I set my standards much higher, and this place has failed in a big way.  Maybe some constructive criticism will help, rather than hinder the place. I will say our server was excellent, kind and very attentive. The table clothes were a huge plus as well.  Service was excellent, food was simply not memorable at all."
2,We have always enjoyed eating here and food had always been great... however we ate there yesterday and my husband ordered a hamburger that was to be cooked medium well. It was raw. Cold in the middle it was mooing  GROSS.
2,"Chris sold us the car and ""Mamma"" did our financing. Both were friendly and helpful. The business has a very cool atmosphere and we got to experience employee/customer appreciation day, which was awesome. Why the bad review then? Well, buying a new car from them is probably a safe bet, but we bought used. We bought a 2008 Ford Escape w/ 75k miles. Car drove great and Chris assured us it had a ""120 point inspection, was in tip top shape, and had service records to prove it"". I should've asked for the records. Upon further inspection a few days later though, i discovered the vehicle still had the original plugs and the gap was twice what it should've been. No biggie, $30 and it's done. Then while pulling the plugs I discovered the last spark plug well was filled, 1-2"", with oil! So the valve cover gasket was obviously shot as well. And the shocks/struts were also original, and should've been replaced at about 50k. I really didn't think I'd have to bring a tool set just to get a decent used vehicle from a respected dealership, guess I was wrong. So I attempted to contact the sales manager as well as the general manager via email...no response. All I was hoping for was for them to make things right and fix the gasket so I didn't have to. I would eat the cost of everything else. Apparently once you have bought one of their vehicles with a sham inspection though, they have no need to help you out any longer. So I thought, maybe their emails aren't working? So to test this, I emailed the same addresses but from my other email, inquiring about a vehicle... Got a response within a single day! How sad a Christian dealership deals with customers this way. So I spent about $300 and a few hours and replaced the stuff and all is well, vehicles is in tip top shape. Problem is I paid excellent KBB price from a dealership, plus all the other taxes and fees, when I could've just bought from craigslist if I wanted a vehicle that needed work, and I would've saved tons of $$. The vehicle was supposed to be in tip top shape when I bought it. Long story short...don't buy, especially used, from Cardinale Way Mazda Mesa. Nice enough people but they're basically buying vehicles from auction, giving them an oil change and a wash and calling it a ""120 point inspection"". Just another car dealer looking to make a quick $, and even worse, using a Christian label to do it...but without the Christian values."
2,"Ugh...why didn't I just check Yelp first? Clearly I'm exhausted and my filter was lowered. In this vulnerable state I found myself wandering over to Lolo's and it's just not good. Very simple, plain, flavorless food. I've had chicken and waffles in about 10 states and never had it this poorly seasoned. The only reason they got two stars is because I appreciate that they cook to order and the collards are decent and the chicken is juicy, but you know what so is water and it pretty much tastes the same. 

Who knows maybe the non-airport version of Lolo's is better"
2,"Well, I fell for it, just like a Chinese finger trap.  When I saw the menu's written description of the striped bass served in a broth with minced vegetables, my imagination took me to a version of the dish that is likely available on either coast.  But this is Madison, so I should have known that $20 will only buy you a version of the dish that is just under the size of two decks of cards set lengthwise.  The described vegetables (maybe two tablespoons worth) were more of an accessory, which were served on top of the fish, rather than an actual ""side"".  The fish itself was flavorful, but after only 3 or 4 bites total, my memory may be a little sketchy.  The shared egg drop soup had a watery and bland taste, which even the most remedial takeout place could have surpassed."
2,"Very busy hot pot restaurant! They were warning us about the 2 hour limit from the beginning but luckily they weren't hounding us about it near the end (we had some late arrivals). 

Firstly, nice decor inside and food was not bad, but for a price of $40 (Friday dinner), it didn't live up to its price tag. I wouldn't return here because they didn't have anything special on their menu that was particularly delicious. 

Secondly, the special kaka dessert is just ice cream. There's only vanilla and green tea, which is fine by me since I was really stuffed at this point anyway. I was very surprised when they insisted that you could only have ONE serving of ice cream. Like seriously?!?! You're an ayce hot pot place but you're being stingy on the ice cream?! The portion size was very small too and it wasn't anything extraordinary. Very disappointing :(

Only upside was or server. He was great! Very friendly and helpful. Always took our food orders with a smile and gave recommendations :)"
2,"My husband, son and I go to Texas Roadhouse on occasion as it's usually good and affordable. Today, we drive home from Philadelphia and only stopped once for gas and the restrooms.  We decided to go to TR because we hadn't eaten all day...but we would have been better off not doing that. My husband and son wouldn't finish their burgers,  they said the rolls were stale and the beef was mushy. My 17 year old son was given 6 french fries so we asked for a side order, which they charged us for (the fries were good). I ordered the salad with chicken but it was so overwhelmed with cheese that I could only eat about a third because you couldn't taste the egg, tomato, lettuce etc. I told our waitress and her reply was a giggle and a ""yeah, I thought they put too much cheese on it too.""  And there you have it...$37 bucks and we all left with food on our plates. Thankfully we had hotdogs in the house because that's what's for dinner."
2,"Affordable and convenient for UNLV students especially if you are moving from out of state. Mandy and the other front desk staff are nice, attentive and respond to emails promptly.

The manager is extremely rude. For example, they close the office early on a regular basis when they post on the door they're open until 6. One day a group of five of us were waiting at the door at 5:15 when they close at 6 and Sandy just sat in her office even after we knocked. She turned around and saw us and then just looked right back at her computer like we were interrupting her personal time.

I haven't had any direct issues with security but I have seen many other residents have this problem.

They also don't clean the units before you move in, if they say they do they are surely lying.

All in all, the convenience of roommate matching, pricing and their student friendly amenities make it livable, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who makes a decent living. In other words, I can deal w the annoyances until I complete my degree but once I graduate I'm out of here."
2,"I really really really wanted to like this place. Having lived in the South, I am always searching for the comfort food I have come to love. My partner and I arrived on a Friday night, without a reservation, at 8:00pm to a half-full restaurant. It took a significant amount of time to even get the attention of a host to put our name down. Host explains some tables are turning over and that we will be seated soon. 

We grab drinks at the bar, and continue to see tables emptying and left uncleared. 40 minutes later we check in with the host stand, and are told the same: turning tables and will be seated soon. Another 15 minutes and we are finally seated. 55 minutes of staring at empty tables while we waited. The rest of the experience was fine, the food we ordered (Farro Risotto, Mac & Cheese) was fine - nothing mind blowing. The service was very slow and lackluster.

The space is about the same as any new/trendy space coming into Madison. I hope to check out the courtyard in the summer, but have zero intention of returning for any other purpose.

While I have understanding for the logistics of restaurant operations, Friday nights should be staffed at full capacity especially for a brand new, highly anticipated spot. At the very least, the communication between guests and staff could be improved."
2,"I work really close to this place so I tried it a few times, it's kinda hit or miss. I do really like they're spicy eggplant, but not the Orange chicken. They have good lunch specials and portion sizes."
2,"Beautiful photos on Instagram. That's what gets me out of the house and trying out new restaurants! Baro, just opened a few months ago, has been all over my news feed, I just had to try it out. 

Accurately depicted in the photos, the decor is unique and grungy with a splash of class. We were seated right away although the place was already pretty packed on a Thursday night. 

I understand that the restaurant is still quite new and they're learning to perfect everything, but here is a list of what they need improvement on:

1. There is a constant cold draft if you're seated near the bar. I was freezing my butt off the entire night. 

2. The servers are not trained properly - Our waitress didn't know that certain drinks came without alcohol until I pointed out the fine print on the menu (which she didn't even read) and she thought that all tables came with chips & guacamole, when in fact, they were not free. She also did not make helpful recommendations on menu items - When asked, EVERYTHING was delicious.. so it didn't really help me make up my mind. 

3. The Ceviche Flight ($32) was underwhelming - 5 tiny bite sized samples of all their ceviche options. I think my favorite one was the Tiradito. 

4. ROPA NUEVA ($32) - The server said the beef was braised for 24 hours so I thought this would be a winner. Unfortunately, it tasted like it was braised in soy sauce, and the meat was not tender, but instead extremely dry. The yuca gratin was delicious though! 

Overall, Baro is overpriced for what you get. I would suggest skipping the food and just coming for a social drink, unless they massively improve on the flavor and consistency of their food items."
2,"I'd probably pass, nowhere near as good as other Lo Los in the area.  Damp waffle, overly salty chicken."
2,"I've loved fried chicken for 50 years. Yes, 50 years. Never have I had fried chicken that had absolutely no flavor. Until now. I was utterly amazed to find a place with ""chicken"" in its name that didn't know how to fry a good chicken. Not even salt and pepper. I ate my greasy pieces in wonderment. Is this really possible? Did they do this on purpose? Do they have a new cook who forgot the most crucial step? Do they think that Phoenix has so many seniors with dead taste buds that no one would notice? Somebody enlighten me! In the meantime, I say no no to Lo Lo."
2,"I can't count the number of times I've gone this restaurant but it's been since they opened.
During those times, I would say I pretty much never really had any issues. The food is awesome which is what kept me coming back. I knew what to expect in Asian places in Toronto...you won't get good service but most of the time, the food is great.
Today was particularly bad and I felt so bad for my husband who is normally a very easy-going guy and very loyal. He's Vietnamese and today, he felt that his people let him down.
This would only be the 3rd or 4th time I've taken my husband here in 10 years-ish. Things were good for the most part from the moment we walked through the door. Food was quick...mine not so pretty tho. There were little bits of raw beef on the edges of the bowl. The food is too good so I ignored it.
When we were trying to pay was when it all went to shit. The lady serving us was done with her shift apparently. She was throwing her sweater on and grabbing her stuff behind the register while talking loudly to her coworkers in Vietnamese. My husband was standing there for a good 10-15 min and she completely ignored him. He understood every word and heard her tell another lady to deal with him.
When we walked out, he told me they are AWFUL. I totally agreed. This was the worst experience I had there."
2,"First time at China Tango, I ordered Singapore noodles for lunch. Dry and super salty, just the way I don't like it. It's close to my workplace so I decided to give this place another shot. On the plus side, restaurant is new, clean and modern. Although the food is pretty average, the lunch specials are a really good value."
2,"Decided to try this new place out. When we got there we were greeted by the staff. The restaurant is well lit and clean. When we were looking over the menu,  the waitress was standing close by and often asked us if we were ready to order (wish she could have given us our space). I ordered the wonton soup and my wife ordered the steak with rice. Her steak came with soup, salad, bun and a drink. Her steak was big but there was a lot of fat. My wonton soup was good but I had better. They gave us tofu desert, but it was not that great. Will I go back?  Probably not since I can get better quality HK food nearby."
2,"Food is okay... Actually not really..

For the price they charge, the food is just so so...

I would rather go elsewhere and pay less for the same food.. Service wasn't that great either..

But I see these rich Asian kids pulling up in exotic Cars all the time with a few girls and they all seem to think the food is amazing lol

Place did a good job marketing! All my wealthy Asian friends seems to want to check his place out and they always suggest this place for hot pot..

In my opinion, home-made hot pot is the best, unless if a restaurant has something unique and/or special, which this place doesn't.."
2,"I visited here with my dad for lunch.  Frankly, I thought it was terrible.  However, the beer was nice and cold - so gotta love that.  My dad seemed to kind-of enjoy his meal, which makes me wonder if I ordered poorly.  But the thing is....I can't even remember what I ordered.  I know the egg drop soup was just god awful.  I tried pouring in about a gallon of soy sauce, but no dice.  It was a meal that I hardly ate and 30 minutes that I will never get back.  I don't think I'll go here again when I am down visiting my dad.

But, they get two stars because my dad said his meal was, ""fine.""  And, again, cold beer."
2,"Just an update so don't expect a whole tapestry.

Food was okay so it could've been 3* but was the service ever horrible. I don't know what was in the water that made these ladies snappy and rude but that day, they were very rude when getting the bill for us.

I know I don't usually incorporate service into Chinese places but there IS a minimum, and the minimum is human decency and basic respect. 

I don't appreciate the cut-eyes, ???"
2,"I hope this was unusual for this place as I have note had this messed up service before. Waitress took exceptionally long to get to table after we were seated, we requested a table and I have to admit that we received one, however it was so small that with the peanut buckets, menus, and all the advertising, condiments, etc there really was no room for food one the drinks were brought.

Order was taken, salads brought were not only not as ordered but wrong dressing on both. Sent waitress for correct dressing, before she returned 2 more salads brought out by different server, which were correct. Finished salad only to have yet another server bring out 2 entrees that we didn't order. Correct order finally arrives with no place on table to put them as the tiny table had not been cleared of salad plates. Food was as expected, typical of a chain. Steaks were actually cooked perfect to order.

I believe if they had only one person waiting a table the mix ups would not occur. We had at least 4 different servers and I do not believe any of them were communicating with each other which is why so many mix ups occurred. I would give 1 1/2 stars if possible only gave 2 because when correct order finally arrived it was well cooked and tasted good. Service needs serious help."
2,"Went in for Dinner with my Girlfriend and her Mom on Saturday night. We were the only table dining-in so I was a little bit leary but it was still early (5pm) and we were all hungry. After about 20 minutes anotherly elderly couple came to dine-in. So only 2 tables going in the entire place. I must admit the food was good, very fresh ingriedients and nicely presented. HOWEVER the dam waitress wouldn't stop texting on her cell phone the entire time in the dining room in plain view of the  5 customers that were in there. So we were sitting there with empty glasses and could not get our drinks refilled and when we did manage to finally get her attention she seemed pissed and discombobulated that we interupted her Texting session. When trying to get the check we actually had to go up front to the manager cause miss Texty wouldnt look up from her phone. Ironically the Manager was sitting up front on her laptop searching for Christmas sale items. I was always under the impression that the Customer was supposed to be #1 not the Cell Phone/Computer. So if you want to go and recieve awful service from a 16 year old waitress texting while she's supposed to be servicing customers this is the place to go. I only gave 2 stars cause the food was actually pretty decent. We will never return due to the EXTREME lack of customer service knowledge on managements part and front line staff."
2,"Service was horrible the last time I went. The last two times I went, it was okay but last time was horrible. The food is okay, nothing really special! Price is average. Ordered a pitcher of watermelon juice that was supposed to be shared between 3-4 people......not sure how much 3-4 people would get as it was just a tall cup that they called a 'pitcher'. I would say it was for 2 people to share. Would probably go again a few months later."
2,"Frankly, this is some of the priciest Chinese food I've ever had. Got takeout the other day for 3 adults. Spent nearly $75 and it simply wasn't worth it. Our order had 4 appetizers and 3 entrees. 

There were supposed to be 4 potstickers but there were only 3. At $5.25, those 3 dumplings were pricey. Apparently somebody in the kitchen has trouble counting because our $4.50 order of crab puffs was also missing one (ie, it had 4 instead of 5). The Teriyaki beef skewers (you get 4 of them) were dry, dry dry. They were like eating beef jerky on a stick, only these were tasteless. They were tough and way overcooked or maybe they had just been sitting around for a few days. Definitely not worth $2 a piece. 

The honey dipped ribs (4 of them) were a nice size but a little tough. The bbq sauce covering the ribs was tomato-based and I expected it to be a little sweet (it is called HONEY DIPPED ribs, after all) but it was pretty bland. I did not taste sweet on those ribs. The portion was a good size for an appetizer, though. 

The Walnut Shrimp was probably the smallest portion of the entrees and way overpriced. I could count on 4 fingers the number of average size shrimp in there. They were stingy with the walnuts and veggies as well. The portion appeared to be child-sized or maybe a half portion but it was most definitely NOT worth almost $16. 

The Beef and Broccoli was supposed to be prepared in a garlic brown sauce (according to the menu). The sauce had a light reddish tinge (maybe from some tomato sauce?) and there was no garlic flavor in this sauce. There was very little flavor of any kind. I expected to taste soy sauce, ginger, even pepper but nothing. I've had Beef and Broccoli at other restaurants before and I've also made it at home and this was the blandest by far. The broccoli was fresh and had a nice crunch and color to it and the beef was tender but cut into miniscule pieces, as if by cutting them so small and spreading them around, it'll look like you have a lot more beef than you actually do. At $13.50, the portion size was adequate for one person even though there seemed to be more broccoli and very little beef. 

Finally, the House Fried Rice was the only dish that actually had some flavor to speak of. The aroma and color of the entree was appetizing. But, there was maybe 3 small shrimp, some chicken and pork and plenty of veggies. The portion was large so for almost $10 you get enough fried rice for maybe a couple of meals. 

Additionally, I wasn't given (or offered) any packets of soy sauce (or any other sauce) or chopsticks. I suppose you just have to know to ask for what you want before you walk out. I also had to wait an additional 15 minutes longer than the ""20 to 30 minutes"" I was told it would take on the phone. 

I wouldn't order takeout from this place again much less actually go and eat there. The food is overpriced, mediocre and flavorless. They're also stingy with their main ingredients, particularly the shrimp and beef. If you like overpaying for mediocre chinese food, this is the place to go."
2,"Maybe 1 1/2 stars. I stopped in to watch Sunday Night Football. There are lots of TV screens throughout the establishment, but almost all were less than 40"" so its worse than watching at home. I sat down and was greeted nicely, my drink order filled, menu delivered. That's where the service stopped. No one came back to take a food order. No one stopped by to see how I was doing. My drink sat empty for almost 15 minutes before someone noticed. At that time I chose to settle my tab and go elsewhere. Don't think I will come back."
2,"Really hate to do this, but this was my favorite bar to eat at until now! I didn't realize they switched to No One Under 21 till I walked in with my kids for dinner and was told that we had to leave! No sign posted anywhere! They have great food here and I'll never go back because the obvious didn't care about local families when the decided to allow smoking! What's wrong with the patio if you want to smoke?"
2,Good food but service leaves something to be desired.... This is the only restaurant that tells you where you must sit..
2,"Very disappointing service. 

Food: 4/5 Good selection, terrible ordering. 
Service: 1/5 Rude, Slow.
Environment: 4/5 Nice, unless you got a folding chair.  
Washrooms: 4/5 Fine. 
Worth it?: 2/5 Service was terrible. 

After an hour wait we finally got in. We promptly made our first order. They started bring them out putting them anywhere they could without a word. They quickly rush out before you can ask them anything. 

We we're missing a few things like soy sauce and spring rolls. We let service know and they said they would bring it. It still  didn't come. We nicely asked for it again and again and still they never came. We didn't have any dipping sauce yet food was still come out. We ate any ways and asked again for soy sauce with out next order. 

Food continued to come out and we had to firmly ask one of the services if they could make sure we get the soy sauce before he does anything. Else for us because we had asked 7 times before this. 

It finally came but I am still missing my spring rolls and red sausage. 

Service is rather rude and don't really care about helping you out. I don't think I will be coming back."
2,"The list of wines by the bottle is really outstanding for a typical tavern. I've been here several times for take out and just recently dined in for the first time--each time the service has been great but the food just mediocre at best.  Not horrible, but just not something that would bring me back."
2,"The only nice thing about this place is the ambiance. Unfortunately the quality of the food is quite low. The rice, for instance, was the worst I have ever eaten. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are much better Chinese restaurants in Madison and they are cheaper!"
2,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now because of the glorious reviews on yelp. We got here at 9:30 pm. The parking lot was dark and empty, and there was only one table about to leave as we entered the store. I guess it didn't help that it was raining that night. Anyhow, I was surprised at how dead this place was as the sign on the door said it closes at 11pm. Just to make sure, we asked what time they closed to plan ahead when to leave accordingly and they told us 10:30 pm. I remember coming here when it was a Chinese restaurant back then and it was pretty lively especially at night.

So the inside of the restaurant, the tables, floors and dishes were honestly kind of dirty. The tea came along with the order sheet to fill out but it came wet covered in the tea the server spilled. I took a look at the prices and they are honestly not all that cheap like what the other reviewers claimed, considering I've tried other places for about the same price and overall experience was much better. We ordered a steam pork and chives dumpling (14pcs) $5.99, fried onion pancake $2.99, beef noodle soup $6.99, and we wanted to try the Korean pork bone soup $7.99. The food came in decent time one after another. The beef noodle soup came in a pretty large bowl (could feed 2) but noodles had a very mild chlorine taste and soup was too merky for my liking, not to mention that there were only 5 small pieces of beef on top. Along came the Korean pork bone soup, and I must say I was pretty disappointed as I had pretty high hopes for this one. The price is the same as authentic Korean restaurants, so it wasn't cheap for something that was so flavourless, and presentation was just awful. Not to mention, we didn't get any Korean side dishes. The soup was not flavourful, the bean sprouts were literally all over the place making the dish super messy and the pork bones were not marinated through as it didn't have a strong spicy taste. Yes, they give you a lot of pieces of meat but it was just a huge mess, very hard to eat, and not authentic whatsoever. The dumplings came after and I hoped it was better but it did not taste good either. The meat had a very weird (rough) texture with a strange flavour. The onion pancake was probably the better of the dishes considering the price and the quantity.

The overall food quality, taste and experience was very disappointing to me. We managed to finish everything super fast as we were the only customers there and took whatever was left with us. And the moment we left the store, the owners closed all the lights and didn't even clean our table - probably left it for clean up tomorrow. Although we weren't like rushed or anything, don't expect any sort of customer service here. I don't suggest coming here for their Korean pork bone soup AT ALL either because it does not taste authentic as the owners are mandarin. Neither should you really come here for dinner because the workers just want to leave and close their store - which I think they should change their business hours. All in all, we have no plans to come back to this place as there are far better dumpling and Korean restaurants in close proximity."
2,"Meh.

The good:  The drinks.  Both were superb.  A gin and grapefruit juice concoction...boy howdy would that be good on a Summer day..But good as the snow flies too.  The rye drink (RyDy) with sorghum and ginger...also stellar (word of caution:  the two don't go well together ;) )

The cornbread appetizer was great, maybe not enough for the price, but crispy top and bottom with a hint of sweetness.  Left me wanting more.

The needs improvement: 

The wife had catfish.  A slab of fried fish on a big white plate with two meager tablespoons of coleslaw and four hush puppies.  It looked unappealing.  I liked the hush puppies, the wife was lukewarm to them, and the fish had not much flavor, although cooked well.

The bordering on laughably bad:

The oyster appetizer that came on a bed of wood chips (borrowed from a nearby playground?). AND THEY WERE ON FIRE!  I felt like blowing on them to see if the smolder would ignite more and set off the smoke detectors.  Seriously, who serves something on smoky smoldering wood chips??  Not an appealing presentation.

The waiter took our drinks away without asking if we were finished.  (No, we weren't).  Idiot.  Waiter also proclaimed something we ordered as ""My favorite"". (Like I care). I want the wait staff to be better trained.

Pie crust?  Super tough.  Someone overworked the dough.

We stopped at Trader Joes on the way home to get food.  Says something."
2,"Ordered fish fry, mutton sukka and coffee. Mutton was on tougher side, and fish was alright. The coffee was the only saving grace here."
2,"Worst service ever! Waitress was blunt, no smiles, unresponsive, does not acknowledge. Might as well be 6 feet under, right? 
Broth is mediocre and SALTY!!! Can't even serve proper authentic Vietnamese noodles.
Just don't go...I don't think I need say more."
2,Might be the slowest service Ive ever encountered. Ordered 1 waffle sandwich. Still standing here 20 minutes later. Only one person ahead of me...
2,"Made a reservation for several ladies and myself to enjoy a weeknight dinner at Julep. We were warmly greeted by the staff who was happy to accommodate our large group and the extra people who showed up. The building is cute and there is ample street parking off of East Washington. However, since this is a mixed used building it's a little odd walking by the coffee shop to get into the restaurant space. Unfortunately it was too cold for us to sit outside but the interior is equally beautiful. Julep is a lovely and well thought out space and I wish the menu lived up to the decor and staff. 

Since this was a few months ago, I forgot what I had ordered to drink but recall that it was tasty and that I had several! The biscuit was bland and I didn't finish it. I should have known to stop there but I didn't and ended up ordering the crab cake. This was my fatal mistake! The cake was presented well and the cucumber salad (if I recall correctly) that accompanied it was tasty and light. The crab cake however was extremely under cooked and in all honesty I should have sent it back but I did not. The next morning I woke up extremely I'll and spent the next 24-36 hours on what felt like my death bed. Do I know if Julep's bland under cooked crab cake caused me to get sick? No. But I do know that because of what happened shortly after dining there that  I won't be going back.  

Julep tries to do a nice dinner service but the food is lacking on many different levels. If you are looking for a southern meal save yourself the time and money and learn how to make yourself some biscuits."
2,"Good food but WAY WAY over priced. Small on portions, big on price! Nice staff, old worn out/tired decor. If I want to spend lots of money there are NICE and updated restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from. Being located in Cave Creek/Carefree does not give license to overcharge their patrons. Likely won't be back."
2,"We got a flyer in the mail so decided to try this place. We did do delivery. They said it would take 45 minutes (which did not bother us) but it took almost 2 hours.
We would have picked it up otherwise but was looking forward to a night in our jammies watching a movie with some Chinese.
The Chow Mein was dry and horrible.
I ordered Orange Chicken and Lemon that was just dark meat and grizzly.
The Spring Rolls were just dripping with grease.
I do not recommend this place to even try to anyone!
I think there is a reason they offer freebie coupons on the flyer even though they are not worth it.
Our total with delivery and free order of Spring Rolls was $$30."
2,"Well, the amount of food served for the money is very small. There are lot's of other indian places that will serve better quality and quantity for less than what these guys are charging. ---Just 7 or 8 small cubes of chicken in a butter chicken dish costing 12.99.
-a small bowl of steamed rice costs 5 bucks!

I am not coming back for sure, to me Indian restaurants should not be this expensive as it is nowhere near fine dining experience."
2,"Food is good, service in the carry out area is terrible! It wasn't busy at all and the girl doing carry out was Messing up orders left and right."
2,If you like your steak medium order rare if you like your steak medium well order medium because they always overlook your steak I like mine medium well and it's always more than well done
2,"The food at this place has definitely dipped in taste. Everything looked great, but didn't taste very authentic or good. The chutney, sambhar etc that came with it was quite bland. There are far better places. Even the thali (meal) was average at best. Unless there's no better place to go, I'd give it a miss."
2,"The best thing about this place is a cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. The worst thing is the food. I tried this restaurant for a takeout dinner for my family, so I ordered several of the dishes and I sat in the restaurant while they were being prepared. We usually get takeout at Jade Palace, and I was hoping to find Chinese food at a more reasonable price and preferably less greasy. This place is just as expensive if not more so. The food I brought home was terrible. All of it was bland, beige, and soupy, some vegetables probably came out of a can, and all of the vegetables were over cooked to mushiness. The whole family was very disappointed."
2,"A few issues with this place.

from the outside, the place looks modern and clean. 

First, they do not cater to those who do not read chinese. 

We were seated with an english menu and every price on the menu was scratched out, nor do they bother to explain anything..like oh i dunno, how much per person it is, that broths are extra charges (those might be important to the average diner). I had to inquire about this, and the server told us that's the old menu, and the new menu is only in chinese. So my first question is, why can't they update both menus and why are the old menus still circulating?

i also had to get another server to explain all the new items on the chinese menu that were not indicated on our old menu...which might have seemed a little tedious, but i felt like it was not fair since i didn't read chinese.

The service was not that great. I would say about 60% of our orders showed up properly if they even showed up at all. Not sure if it was a language barrier, or missed on the back end, but we had to re-order things 3 times before they came....and some just never came.

I prefer mixing my own sauces, and don't like having to order each sauce individually. The food quality was not bad, but i would much prefer Little Sheep to this place."
2,This is a hawker food stall labeled a restaurant.  Food is below average but prices are high.  My wife ordered idly and it was like s rock.  The corn soup tasted like sugary strap.  They sprinkle a lot of black pepper and call it Chettinad.  Please do not insult Chettinad food.  No more Karaikudi.
2,"Their food is standard I've noticed with other pho restaurants, they were good but not mind blowing.
What really knocked off the stars for them, is the waitresses here clearly don't care for getting anything you ask. We asked for water like 8 times, each of us trying that waitress. She would look at us and say yes. But never would she come back with the mystical cup of water. So can't really give them more than 2 stars for the anti social waitress that served...erhm or didn't serve us."
2,"The Capistrami is my favorite sub sandwich. I get it every time I go to Capriotti's. I was a little disheartened at the meat portion, were smaller than I normally accustomed to seeing at some of the other retail locations:
- Sahara&Durango, Las Vegas, Nevada
- Irvine Blvd &  jamboree, marketplace, Irvine California
- MacArthur & Dove, Irvine, California
- Tustin marketplace, Tustin, California.

After writing this review I went to Capriotti's website and they have closed all the Capriotti's retail locations in orange county. Bummer :("
2,"Ok fried chicken. Spongy, thin waffle. Nothing like the true Lo Lo's. Two legs and a waffle with drink for 12.00+ ? Was going to try a side of greens but not for 6.00.
First and last time at sky harbor"
2,"Came here on a few different occasions and my latest was for an NBA game. A friend and I sat at a table that had a nice view of the TV's. we were greeted within minutes by our server. She got us our drinks and put in a food order and came to the table several times to ask if we needed refills or more food but we were ok. Because we were not ordering something every few minutes it took longer to actually find our server when we needed her. The place wasn't very busy and I'm not surprised. With the bad service plus mediocre bar food, there are too many better places to hang out with friends."
2,"I love winter because that means it's hot pot season! I'm giving two stars to Morals for their variety of options - my favorite was their handmade balls and sliced meat. Their sliced beef was marbled-just-enough despite it not being the premium option. They also offer handmade shrimp balls and octopus balls, yum. 

Service was a tad bit slow and limited to mostly mandarin. Some of the challenges that our group had: 
- Food items: The english and chinese menus were different and there were more items on the chinese
- Alcohol: Once we were seated, our group ordered beers that were forgotten, twice 
- Soup base: The default soup is the individual, there's a surcharge to order the larger pots for sharing. As a fan of spicy ""ma lat/??"" soups, I found that the soups here were more on the numbing side than spicy

What I did really enjoy about the place was their seating! Typically, many hot pot places are more cramped. I found that Morals was more comfortable and overall, cleaner. 

Parking is usually a pain in this plaza - Go underground to the tnt parking instead
And definitely make a reservation!"
2,"It was difficult to rate Morals because I have very mixed feelings.  There is quite a bit of potential here but horrible service and high prices pull it down.

Pros:
The decor was the first thing that you notice when you walk in and it's gorgeous.  Very modern and looks very expensive to put together.  Definitely great atmosphere when you walk in.

The food was good and presented very nicely.  I was very satisfied with the freshness of everything that we ordered and it tasted great.  I haven't been to any hot pot restaurant in Canada before but I'm told the quality of the food was probably about average.  In any case, I was happy with it.

Cons:
Service.  Going in, I read the service wasn't great but I didn't think it would have affected me so much.  Our server looked annoyed (and I'm not saying this lightly) when we ordered.  So much so that he would sigh and look away as we're trying to remember what we wanted.  In all my dealing with him I always got a sense that I was annoying him and that he did not want any part of serving us.  It was also very difficult to grab someone (anyone!) to order or even get more water.

This place was too pricey for my liking.  If I recall correctly it was $27, plus $2 for weekends, plus $3-8 for any of the non-standard soup bases (which are simply labeled mild, medium, or hot).  You can also choose to add their premium angus beef for another $3 per person.  While the meal was good, I didn't think it was worth $32 plus tax and tip.

Finally, I was upset that they limit you on dessert.  One dessert per person and I think it varies per day/week.  When I went they gave me a choice of vanilla or mango ice cream.  It was a spoonful (not even a scoop) of half-melted ice cream.  I was mortified that they would limit you to ice cream at an AYCE restaurant.

Overall, the food was good but I can't justify paying so much for lousy service and a small portion of dessert.  I'll continue my search for a good hot pot restaurant."
2,The food is delicious and they don't cheap out on the protein portions. But I never see them smile. Then yesterday while I was eating a cockroach crawled across the table. I called the woman over and she used a kleenex to grab and squish it. Yeah. Left the rest of my soup on the table and went home.
2,"I love Capriotti's and I will always order my veggie cheesesteak but it was my first time at this location & it was a little disappointing. The sandwiches came out quick and the cashier was friendly but I noticed a young man stocking the tomato bin back up. The bin was nasty looking, with at least three other things that were contaminating it and the gentleman didn't take the older tomatoes out first to put them on top (to be used next/first). Gross. That's all I was able to visually see but who else knows what's going on back there....."
2,"Went there with a group for a friend's bday. The atmosphere is cozy and it has a cool king street vibe 
The drinks are tasty the food was sub par. We had a big group so we did everything family style. The dishes were basic. Putting things in cute containers does not mask that the recipes were the most simplistic available and still lacked flavour and the ingredients were run of the mill.

And then the bills comes. Everyone knows that when u have a big group there are often mistakes with your bill. This however was a disaster. And to make matters worse, the way the bills are divided (decimal points) made it extremely difficult to understand and clear things up. The amounts some people ended up paying were ridiculous. We tried to deal with the situation but did not want to make a scene at our friend's birthday. The issues were not dealt with in a timely or professional matter. It was horrible !"
2,While fixing one problem on my vehicle Kinkade's inadvertently caused another and refused responsibility even after the owner stated in writing and several times on the phone he would reimburse $250. He refuses to respond to calls and emails and I still have not received an explanation for not sending the check as promised. That's just rude!
2,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

I went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. 

I know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless. 

The service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.

I won't be going back."
2,"Size was pretty good as we ordered 20"" but it was too messy when we got it... didn't seem like much time was spent preparing it.  Burn it tasted really great and love having some good fast food options at the red rock casino."
2,"Was getting late on a Wednesday Jan 6th 2016 around 630pm, so my wife and I decided to head over to Texas Roadhouse.  Got there about 7pm, checked in, and received the buzzer.  30 to 40 min wait, I guess.  Around 7:30 I was starting to wonder if the hostess forgot about us, because we kept seeing couples come in, and in 15min were getting seated.  My Wife calmed me by saying...""perhaps they did call ahead seating"".  Okay so another 10 min rolled on, and a few more couples getting seated that weren't there when we arrived, and tables and booths were looking pretty vacant!  Quick decision....should we leave or find out what was going on.  Took my buzzer up, and asked if perhaps my buzzer was malfunctioning.  Hostess that took my name looked at me like she had no idea who I was, looked at the buzzer, then to her screen, and without saying a word to me called over someone to seat us.

Got to the seat....no bread.   Waited 10 min for the waiter...who took our drink orders only to come back after another 5min to tell me my beer wasn't available.  No beer.  

Ordered Fried pickles for appetizer.   Pickles were good till the bottom, then got very soggy. Bread finally arrived, then another order of bread. 

Finally got to order our food....8:10pm.   I got the 1/2 Chicken and 6 OZ steak, with Chilly.  Wife ordered pulled pork dinner.         8:45pm got food.   Had to send back Chilly which was Cold.  Pulled pork dinner.... cold.  Break that came with pulled pork...soggy.    Steak... Luke warm, but by this time I was starving.  Packed up the chicken, and the pulled pork, tossed the bread and got out of there.

Lesson for us:
Don't go on a Wednesday unless you have kids, and you want to experience the Chucky Cheese atmosphere.....cause it's kids night!. Lots of balloons, and party atmosphere, but still need to pay attention to service and food quality.

It will be a while before we go back....and it won't be on a Wednesday."
2,"My friends and I came for lunch before heading out to our festivities for the day. We ordered
- bun bo hue
- special pho
- beef and beef ball pho
- rice
- cha gio
- three cafe su da
The food was definitely a disappointment. The cha gio was so over fried it turned white and it had so much taro as filler - that's literally what we tasted. My bbh was made with what tasted like pre-made soup base with not enough flavours (the red was concentrated on one side of my bowl). Although the portion was decently sized, I felt that the quality isn't there. Probably will not be returning."
2,"This place always finds an excuse to not cook anything the last 30 minutes it is open. I've gotten ""my cook quit"", ""the grill broke"" and ""we ran out of bread (this one was last night, Oct 7)"" the last three times I have tried to order something between 10:30p and 10:45p in the past few months. Their sign says they close at 11pm on weeknights. Start closing at 10:30 if that is when you are going to stop taking orders.

When they actually take my order, the food is good, just as it is at other locations."
2,"Service is sketchy. Happy Hour prices require their gaming club card which is bogus. The pizza used to be delicious and now its not so much. Since the quality of food has decreased, the prices should decrease accordingly. Happy Hour drink prices are pretty good."
2,"The living experience is great here, however, there are some flaws. I've had packages delivered to the office but the office failed to call me to pick it up (this happened on two occasions). Also they don't give warnings to when they will be doing fire alarms for buildings or high water power cleaning outside of our doors. When they did the water power cleaning, the water seeped through our door, getting our shoes wet. Besides those flaws, the people in the office are nice and friendly. Especially Nikki and Chelsea-  They are approachable. They provide free wifi, a $25 electric credit, shuttle to and from UNLV which is great!"
2,"I've been to Baro and Escobar a few times and I've always enjoyed it so I decided to celebrate my birthday at Escobar. I reached out a month prior to ensure a smooth night, however your bar manager Dirk made me feel like more of an inconvenience than a paying customer. I booked a booth through him and he met myself and my party of girls at the door and looked miserable. He made me feel like I was wasting his time. I initially decided to get 4 bottles and was thinking about getting another 2 but I quickly changed my mind when I realized that my business was not appreciated at this establishment. I told him I had another 4 guests that were arriving a little later (the rest of us arrived at 1030) and he told me to tell them not to come because they won't get in. Unbelievable. I get that there's a max capacity but the way he spoke to me was so rude. Its unfortunate because I really like Baro but I don't think I will come back again. I would rather go to a place where I feel like my business is appreciated."
2,"Still on a search to find good, authentic Chinese food in No. Scottsdale, we decided to give Sesame Inn a try.  Bottom line is ... we are still searching.  First clue that it wasn't going to go well ... no chopsticks on the table and we were never offered any.  Second clue ... after ordering, the waitress said, ""That comes with white rice.""  To say that to a Chinese couple is like a slap in the face.  Of course it should come with white rice!  The food is edible, but I wouldn't rave about it .  I could make the same dishes at home for a fraction of the price. The previous review by Flippitti is right on.  It's certainly not worth the prices.  In fact, the size of the portions you are served make it a complete ripoff.  We had the chicken with string beans and the salt and pepper shrimp.  I am 5'1"" and 105 lbs. and could have eaten both orders by myself.  Needless to say, we left hungry and $36 poorer.  The salt and pepper shrimp is traditionally made with the shell still on and at some Chinese restaurants with the head on.  Their version (we assume to cater to American tastes) is made without the shells.  In order to accomplish this, they coat the shrimp with a dry, cardboard tasting flour mixture.  Then to disguise the fact that for $17, they are only serving you 8 small/medium size (not even large) shrimp, they pile them on top of a bed chopped green onions and cilantro.  By the way, the order of white rice that they so generously gave us with the entrees, was larger than the 2 entrees combined!  What was more amazing is that people kept coming in.  We couldn't understand it . Don't people get that they are paying out the nose for mediocre, pseudo Asian/Chinese food?  Would rather make the drive to Nee House in PV or even Chandler/Phoenix to get our Chinese food fix."
2,"I am usually a huge Texas Roadhouse fan!  Since I was in college, I've loved their sweet bread and cinnamon-y butter, fresh caeser salad and their delicious steaks.  When I was meeting up with a friend for dinner yesterday, I suggested Texas Roadhouse for old times sake.

I was please to be seated immediately upon arrival, something that does not always occur often since the restaurant is always busy.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  

I was excited to get my usual, the ceaser salad with chicken critters (breaded, fried chicken).  When the salad arrived, it was very disappointing.  The romaine hearts were bitter and left a terrible taste in my mouth.  The salad had very little dressing, cheese or croutons.  The most disappointing thing about my salad was the chicken.  It was dry, overcooked and a very small portion.  This was not the usual salad that I'm accustomed to.

While I'm usually a huge fan of the Texas Roadhouse, yesterday's experience was very disappointing.  While the service was great, the food was not.  I'm sad to say that I'm not sure I plan on going back any time soon."
2,"TLDR; brunch food is passable overall, but expensive. Order 1 pancake, not the stack of 3 because it is huge and deathly sweet.

I came for 11:30 Saturday brunch with a couple of friends. We made reservations but the restaurant was very empty. Even by the time we were done, there were plenty of seats. Service was kind of slow, especially for the number of people there (there was maybe one other table when we sat down).

I order the Ranchero and we ordered one pancake to share. This is kind of off-menu, as the menu pancakes come in a stack of 3. I would definitely NOT order the full stack. We split the one pancake, which is huge and includes all the same toppings, between 3 people but couldn't even finish it because it was so sweet. The Ranchero was fine.. honestly a pretty plain breakfast, just with a Latin twist.. The rice was not good. It was plain white rice, which was so bland. The chorizo and the bacon on the other hand were very salty. The eggs on the tostada were kind of strange... I was completely not a fan of the beans. Overall, it was a good portion of food, but for a price tag of $23, I was not impressed."
2,"Only the dumplings (both pan fried and steamed) at this hole in the wall were good. All the other dishes (fried noodles, ja ja mein, fried eggplant, sweet and sour pork, beef with onion, and string beans with minced pork) we tried were bland and super greasy. Feel gross after eating at this joint. Service is ok but place feels dirty."
2,The appetizers were good. Dinner was not even close to good.. far from good. Shockingly bad may be another way to put it.. The shock was the heavy contrast between the appetizers and the actual food. I honestly don't know how they managed it.
2,"First off $550 for a room in a four bedroom apartment is ridiculous. You'd think they'd take into consideration how much other apartments cost in this area and lower the rent. A lot more people would stay after their lease was up if rent wasn't so ridiculous.  Also, having to pay for parking at the place you live is unacceptable. Definitely feel like they're trying to make rent seem lower so they can trick people into living here. Have you seen this area? I deserve free parking. I really don't want to move next year, I want to stay... but this area isn't worth the price I'm paying."
2,"Often rumored to have the best Chinese food in the Madison area, this restaurant is a major disappointment. My spicy tofu and vegetables dish was not in the least spicy and the tofu was only fried and would have been better marinated. The entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par. The service was very quick and the food served very quickly, maybe too much so. Madison has great Southast Asian restaurants, but I definitely won't be eating more Chinese food  anywhere here."
2,"I was so excited to see a Lo Lo's after I got off the plane. However I was super disappointed it didn't taste like the original at all. The lemonade has always been a favorite at Lo-Lo's but it was so watered down - didn't taste good at all. The chicken salad had basically 2 handfuls of salad mix with couple pieces of chicken. It was definitely not worth the price.  The mac and cheese was dried up and stuck together. 
The only part of the order I liked was the corn bread even though it was cold. If you are expecting to come here for the experience, you are in for a disappointment! Service was slow and took 20 minutes and they  even forgot my waffle. 

I'm sad because Lo-Lo's would have been great to showcase what Arizona has to offer for tourists at the airport but this particular store def does do not do that!"
2,"When my boyfriend and I were looking for a little fun car to bop around time in we searched online. We found exactly what we wanted at this dealership. Since we weren't concerned about financing options or anything, the sell was a snap and didn't really involve a lot. Over time, however, this dealership has really shown it's true colors.

When we first got it, we noticed little peculiar things like the trunk light didn't turn on and the trunk release wouldn't open the car. Turns out both were disabled for some weird reason, but a quick search online allowed us to fix it.

The second key that was given to us, never worked unless you pulled out the keyless remote shield and used the actual key. Even after replacing it with a new battery, it STILL wouldn't work. (This was after was had to ask for a second key which we were told we would get but never received.)

I know these seem like minor irritants and nothing worth mentioning but it sets the precedent of downhill experiences you don't expect from buying a car from a reputable dealership. The car wasn't ready on time, so they had extra time to work on these minute issues. I don't care if the car is $9,000 or $90,000. I want the same service in each transaction or I'm not going to repeat my business there or recommend someone to go there.

Next, the car started not to hold a charge. We had to charge it overnight to make sure that we wouldn't be stuck anywhere. We did everything that we could think of. We took it to a mechanic. It got a full tune up as well as a new battery. It worked for a month but then it just started with the same issue. We connected it to an OBD2 reader to see if there were any codes so we could see where we should take it to and it activated the disarming system in the car and now it won't start. 

Frustrated, I called and spoke with Justin, an agent, because according to the Mazda website (and after troubleshooting because YES we know a little about cars too), they said that the car keys need recoding, and I asked if he could do it. He said that he was just in sales but that he would leave a message for the Service department to call first thing the next day, at 9am. NOON the next day they STILL hadn't called so we called them and left a message. Hours later they said to tow the car in and it would be $140.00 an hour just to look at the car. 

I do not like my calls not being returned. I do not like the lackluster attitude to the problem at hand (which has been constant), and the solution wasn't exactly financially friendly. But who cares right? They are an agency and they can do whatever they want to you and get away with it, right? No. 

If you want someone to care about how you spend your time and money, I would recommend you go elsewhere to purchase a vehicle. If something happens or you need guidance, this is not their main interest. I feel like we were only figurative dollar signs."
2,"Shopped Online, found a car we wanted to take a look at. Prearranged financing. Visited dealership. Sales rep was very kind and pleasant. Knowledgeable of the car. This particular car had 24000 miles on it (2015)  model. 

I had guaranteed internet pricing (plus TTL) and pre approved financing.
Wife and I decided to purchase the vehicle. When docs came back, there was a $1390.00 ""re-conditioning fee"" added. I told the gentleman I was not paying that. He went to his ""boss"" and they stood firm. We shook hands with the sales rep, no hard feelings and left.

It shows that even in todays age, people still get taken advantage of at car dealerships. 9 out of 10 people probably fall for that (and other) ridiculous, arbitrary add on fees that are complete garbage. Just another way to make the dealership $$$

Negotiated or guarantee price of car, plus TTL. Thats all you should ever pay. Never let anyone associated with a dealership try to tell you differently. Buy smart, take a stand. Do not be afraid to walk out. Eventually they will learn their lesson and change their ways.

We will keep looking, eventually we will find the car that is right for us.
It will work out, it always does."
2,"Good steak salad, but I can get over the smoke.  To bad there's not a non-smoking section."
2,"Imperial Garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years. The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.

But none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.

I did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead."
2,"Uninspired Chinese food and poor service (with the exception of the friendly young hostess, who doubled with bussing duties that the wait staff neglected!) We were a group of 10 the evening before Thanksgiving--plates came out late and haphazardly, then were not removed from the table when finished. We had a diverse set of dishes: it's not worth comparing in detail the sesame beef vs thai panang chicken vs other stuff, as all were bland and not distinctive. A Mayonaisse Chicken dish, to our chagrin, was no more than that: chicken in what appeared to be clumps of Hellmann's mayo or something. Decor was fine but a bit odd. Only reason this doesn't get 1 star was that I did not come with high expectations for Chinese food in this neighborhood anyhow."
2,"Food is as you would expect, typical bar and grill food. The salads are good, but the ""cheeto"" french fries are just weird and sort of gross. The regular fries taste like KFC fries (Lawrys seasoning) and the chicken wings are okay. 

The reason for two stars is first the price... $20 for a pizza, $13 for salad, $11 for a burger.. this place is a locals place, but I'm not sure how the locals are affording it. I even bought into the club  card-- not that it will ever pay off because I won't be back.

The second reason is service.. our waitress whom we rarely saw was almost rude, slaming things down on the table, no smile, and never came back after bringing the food. We literally had to hunt her down for our check and when the check came it was another 15 minutes before my husband had to get up and go and find her. 

On another note, the biker uniform tops should go! These waitresses are old and look like they are washed up from the strip. Just a hint, while I'm eating my food I do not want to see your freckly boobs or ceasarean scar!"
2,"The pho and seafood congee is good (the only items I order), but they completely lack customer service. There have been several times where I've experienced this. The most recent one being that I went here with my family after my graduation since it was the closest restaurant near my house that was still open at 10:20pm. They completely rushed us, which is understandable because their kitchen closes at 10:30, but they rushed our food which ended up being too watery (congee) and lacked its usual delicious flavour (pho). Also one of the workers was sweeping the area right beside our table where the broom could disperse all the dust onto our food that has accumulated throughout the entire day.
Another negative experience was when me and my friends went to grub here during our lunch break. One of my friends I went with also had bad customer service experiences with the SAME worker that treated us like we were unimportant customers. She doesn't smile AT ALL even when we say thank you and she has this smug face almost all the time, except when she serves several other customers (which I've observed). I felt that she treated us like random, unimportant customers because we were obviously students, and that she regards the elderly with more respect. I may be wrong, but that was the vibe I received from her. Bottom line, I like their food, but they definitely have a lot of room for customer service improvement."
2,"This place is overpriced, because there are no other Asian restaurants nearby. Ordered Singapore noodles and pad Thai. They are over $15(!) at dinner time (and came with half a box of white rice--why? I don't know!), and almost $10 at lunch (with yummy salad). The pad Thai did not come with a lime wedge and was thin. Although fresh tasting, it was bland and tasted like Chinese stir fry."
2,"I don't mind spending more when the food is exceptionally good but the prices here just don't match the food quality. We were there on a Sunday night and maybe the regular Chef was off, I hope so.The Farro Risotto was exquisite and the highlight of the evening but a small portion for $17. The pork dish was so ordinary and not that tasty. The Cast Iron Cornbread was so blah and a small portion for $6! We splurged on a dessert and regretted that move. It was some kind of Blueberry cobbler and unfortunately we could taste the additives which gave us the impression the fruit came out of a can. Needless to say the dinner didn't end on a good note with that one and the bill didn't help. I doubt we would ever try it again.I had such high hopes for this place since we live close by!"
2,"Wanted to love this place and came in with high hopes, but was disappointed.  The outdoor dining space is lovely and the service is really nice.  But I didn't think much of the food.  The cornbread, which we shared at the table, was weirdly bouncy, not the densely delicious Southern cornbread I was expecting.  The fried chicken entree came highly recommended by my server, but I found it overfried and undersalted.  It was very dark and intensely crunchy, but not delicious.  And it arrived sitting in a wet pool of collard greens.  The greens were tasty but the crispy chicken sitting and getting soggy in a pool of the liquor from the greens was weirdly unappetizing.  Maybe the fryer was too busy with fish fry (which was good, from the tastes I got from others at my table).  But I'm not really tempted to go back."
2,Took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed. The chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet. We got a barbecue pork dish and some beef dish that both had a bland gravy. A huge platter of pot stickers that got everyone excited but ended up being ... bland. Even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce. The calamari was not tough. I'll give them that. If this is the best Chinese food around... I'm sorry.
2,"I was super disappointed with this place... My boyfriend really wanted to go here so we decided to swap Jason's deli (which is right across the street )for this place. that was a bad idea, the service was horrible they made us wait so long and charged us for things without letting us know first this is the second time I've gone to a PT's run Company... Even our first experience at PT's was absolutely horrible...  The servers acted like we were a nuisance and they didn't even want us there it took a long time to get our food and the even messed up on the order And still charged full price for it. But on a lighter note the food was actually very good my boyfriend got a steak salad and I got a hamburger and it was very very good so my suggestion to you is to call it in and pick it up and enjoy you are meal somewhere else. I really wanted to enjoy this place but I guess the hunt for a good pub and eatery is still on in full force!"
2,Disappointed in my Waffle. After my third cup of coffee my waffle arrived. It was obviously sitting under some sort of warmer while they made my wife's food. I waited so long for my waffle I didn't have time to send it back. I ate less than half and didn't want to eat any more cold waffle. The waitress finally came by and asked if I wanted a box. I told her no because the waffle was cold out of gate. She didn't offer a resolution. She actually said if she had made it it would have been perfect! The place wasn't overly busy. Plenty of tables. Not sure why my food was cold. Will not be going back.
2,"TLDR: Average food, less than average service

Firstly, let me start by saying the waiters are very nice and friendly. Unfortunately, that doesn't explain the numerous mistakes over the two nights in a row I was there. For example, our orders were forgotten or mixed up. The first night the waiter completely forgot my friend's milkshake. The second night, I ordered the banderis burger and was brought a beliveau. When he brought the lettuce bun I knew it was mine so I waved indicated it was mine. However, I didn't hear him say the name, but my friends did which is why when he asked who ordered it they didn't point it to my direction. When I pointed out it was the wrong burger, the waiter questioned if I was sure I ordered the correct burger. Fortunately, as previously mentioned, my entire group had heard that I ordered the banderis. I would have eaten the burger if it didn't contain two food items I dislike very much: guacamole and mango salsa.
It was also difficult to get a refill of water.

It is rare for me to give such a low rating, but the just a-ok food and all the mistakes means I will not be coming back unless I have to.

I will say that I do appreciate the various bun options and the option to replace your fries with a salad.

If you want mediocre food in a fun environment with great milkshakes this place is for you."
2,"This place looks amazing when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's diner. Then the longer you spend there the less amazing it became. The service is terrible and it took forever to get our food. I made my own burger but found the burger meat has no seasoning at all, just meat made into a patty and cooked. The fries were not bad but the mac and cheese was not good at all,  one bite was enough for me. The dessert looked good but i am sure it was like most of the stuff in this place. Looks great but leaves a bad taste in your mouth."
2,"Not a big fan of this place. Brought my vehicle for service and they said the vehicle will be completed in an 1.5 hours. 2 1/2 hours later, not only vehicle was not finish, they advised me they put the wrong part and they had to call another branch near by to get this particular part delivered ASAP. Almost 3 hours later, my vehicle was finally completed. I was pissed but they provided me 2 complementary oil changes for their goof. This would have been a one star review if they did not give me the oil changes."
2,"Since the West Island lacks a great deal of good places to enjoy a great burger, aside from the typical fast food chains. Over the years I've eaten at Jukebox, since it's been about a year or two I haven't eaten there I've noticed one big thing that changed. Their quality! It has drastically deteriorated. 
On the bright side, the retro decor is bang on in sticking to a classic retro style. Comfy tables, with comfy banquets. 

Now details about the food. 

Just a few days ago my friend and I decided to go to Jukebox, we were craving a good burger. Sadly, I couldn't think of anywhere else to do. We've ordered two different burgers, one with regular fries and the other with curly fries. As for the drinks.. Both had Sprite. Bonus points for Jukebox since they carry the entire like of Coca Cola, including orange Fanta! Sadly, their soft drinks tasted quite flat and watery. 

My friend ordered the Dean Cheese, 1/2lb of meat with the choice of cheese. You can choose the cheese of your choice. *Some have an additional cost. The burger was by no means 1/2lb of meat. It was a little pancake that felt dry and overcooked.  All the burgers come all dressed. Pickles, onions, lettuce, and a minuscule amount of mayo. No Ketchup. 
The buger was very good in size and a beyond generous amount of curly fries. Sadly, they were clearly not cooked to order and had been sitting under a heating lamp for quite sometime. They felt soggy and dry. 

I had the Franky burger, which is an all dressed regular 1/4lb meat burger.  The bun was pale white, overly light and fluffy. The meat patty was dry as well and it lacked warmth. Basically it was warm--ish. 
As for my regular fries... GREASY! Wow.. For each fry that I've picked up with my fingers, I was shinning of greasy. They also felt quite soggy and overly greasy with a unpleasant  batter or greasy batter to them. I didn't enjoy them.
Since the fries were served on a huge pile on top of each other, they've managed to get very soggy. A bonus point for not being salty! 

As for the service.. It was just ""OK"" I find many of their employees lack the interest of working there, and it shows. When I politely asked for mayo, I was given a plastic bottle of Hellman's  mayo that you purchase at the supermarket. Hmmmm..  When I politely mentioned that my Fanta lacked bubbles, our waiter said.. ""Ok, what do you want then?"" I politely asked for a Sprite. Another bonus point, you have one free refill. Only on fountain drinks. If you order drinks by the bottle, be ready to pay a lot more. Overpriced if you ask me. 

As for their desserts. They lack flavour everywhere. Their ice cream is fluffy, light, with a terrible vanilla after taste. Their brownies.. Clearly filled with dark food colouring since the taste of chocolate simply was not there. 

For two people who ate only one burger each and two drinks at the price of $37.00 It was far too overpriced! There are many other burger joints who do have a stronger focus on their quality, customers, and value. I will be steering away from Jukebox and driving further to Chez Tousignant in Little Italy which is far better quality, great customer service and a better value for the quality. Their soft serve ice cream is outstanding!!!"
2,"This is a mixed review. I really wanted to like the food as everyone else at my table did - but my chicken and cornbread were terribly dry. So dry the cornbread crumbled and the chicken was hard to swallow. The flavor was great but the texture and dryness made the food hard to enjoy. 

My Fresca drink was delicious and refreshing - tart but not too much. The nachos were enjoyable with the fresh chips and pulled pork. I tried a bite of the short ribs - good. The coleslaw with toasted pecans was delicious. 

The ambiance is homey with a rustic look.

On Saturday night there was a fun 
entertaining band - just be ready for it to be loud."
2,"On a Monday morning at 9:30, one would expect that the service would be fast and friendly; However, this is not what my experience was. The waitress was extremely slow and ignored my table a few times. It was very busy, but the waitress made my boyfriend and me feel like a burden. Sitting next to the door, I watched as people piled in without being greeted or seated for more than 15 minutes. I would like to add that there were multiple tables available. 

I ordered the Berry waffles and my boyfriend ordered Chicken and Waffles. The visual aspect of the food was wonderful (check pictures below). The taste, was disappointing though. The fruit was not fresh and the strawberry syrup overpowered the whole waffle. My boyfriend liked the chicken and waffles, but then later sat weird with him. I could tell the kitchen was in a rush when preparing the food too. 

Overall, I am disappointed with my experience. However, I am going to attribute the poor service and taste with the restaurant being under staffed. I will try to go back one more time before I make my final judgement. Hopefully, the staff will be plentiful with smiles on their faces- even during a rush."
2,Good food but service is very slow. Need more staff. Cooks shouldn't be serving the food too... has great potential but not with current situation.
2,"Typical Discount Tire, everybody is hustling and working hard, tires are a decent deal with the rotations and warranties.
I have bought several sets of tires here, but on my last purchase they put a 3 to 4"" long and pretty deep scratch on all 4 of my factory Tacoma rims, right where they removed the weights. I showed the managers twice asking for them to have the paint repaired and they refused to do anything for me at all. The marks were blatantly theirs as the grudge from the previous weights were centered at each scratch, both managers even acknowledged that they did it. One even made the statement, "" What are we supposed to do? There is nothing that can be done for this."" I told him that they needed to be refinished, his response? ""Never gonna happen"". So, yes we acknowledge that we damaged the rims, and no we aren't going to do anything to make it right. This was back in 2007, I haven't returned since.
The scratches looked so bad I ended up buying another set of factory wheels that matched them, DISCOUNT TIRE WOULDN'T EVEN DO THE SWAP FOR ME!!!!! So I paid to have it done elsewhere, total cost was about a $300 hit all in and several hours of my time.
I believe I have bought 7 or 8 sets of tires with Discount over the years for myself and probably 70 sets as a Fleet/Procurement Manager (at a different Discount Tire location). I have bought another 7 sets of tires since then at other places between my SUV, my project cars and my wife's car, and 3 sets of wheels, business they have lost along with countless tires at work since then (maybe 600 tires?) I even informed the other Discount Tire as to why they had lost my work business, more short sightedness, they also did nothing to help me, lol....
I plan to not do business with any Discount Tire ever again if I can avoid it, due to this installer's error but mainly the management's bad judgement and their callus attitudes.
I wish I had pictures of the wheels and scratches to post here, they were pretty bad, all the way to the metal, not sure what the tire jockey was thinking as he damaged them.
Oh well, life gives you lessons sometimes, sometimes the lessons cost you money, sometimes they end up rewarding the mom & pop shops with my tire business :)
I would not recommend this place, but I'm sure that they have changed managers between now and back then, 9 years ago.
My advice, take before pictures of your rims with a time and date stamp prior to ANY shop changing tires for you, could possibly save you money and head aches, if and when they are damaged. The same thing happened at Big O Tire since then, at least Big O accepted fault and stepped up and repaired the rims.....
Side note, I have never bought a warranty on any tire since I bought tires at Discount and have never needed one. Food for thought, save your cash if you are OK with doing your own rotations and paying for a balance once before the tires wear out.
At least I don't damage my own stuff.
You might not have the bad deal that I got here, either way, Good luck!!!!!"
2,"I'm from Southern California, so I have had plenty of experience eating at taco/burrito shops.  I demand not only good quality, but good value.

I placed an order for a carnitas burrito with rice added (for $1 extra).  I wanted it like they do in SoCal -- rice, meat and beans.  I also ordered a tamale, which I normally do when I visit a new Mexican food restaurant to gauge their quality.  If they make excellent tamales, that's a sign that they care about quality.  Well, the good news is that the tamale tasted great -- very authentic, the bad news is that it was tiny... maybe 4 oz. at best?  They give you this huge takeout box, which lends to the disappointment when you open it to discover a half-anemic tamale.  The carnitas burrito with rice?  What rice?  In fact, I want to know what happened to the burrito -- it was the size of something I would find at Taco Bell.  Mind you, this was a $5.50 burrito, and for that much I wanted more than a small Taco-Bell-style burrito (that I can get for $2.00).  So no only was the burrito tiny, but it was missing the extra rice.  Overall, for the $7.50 I paid I was very disappointed.  Not worth the money.

I sensed  an order error might happen when I heard the cashier call-out the order to the cook.  When ANY restaurant uses the word-of-mouth system to place orders in the kitchen, there is a huge possibility for error (as happened in my case).  This is unacceptable and their order system should be changed to a computerized system.

Pros:  authentic taste, fast friendly service, fresh home-made tamales

Cons:  Small, anemic servings, poor order taking, slow cleaning of tables"
2,"The word that was in my head was ""meh"" and that's the description of a two star.  Nothing was bad but nothing to write home about.  The servers were attentive and friendly, but they didn't really change anything from the previous Mexican restaurant.  I got my standard Chile Relleno and something fried.  Both were OK, but kind of bland.  Really just kind of a non-event.  Don't know that we'll be back with much better Mexican options nearby on Central."
2,"I am giving this place a 2 star because of lack of care of my wheel . I was on dire need of flat tire repair on flat run tire on my corvette Z06 . Instead going to my usual branch at chandler Blvd and Pennington, I went to this branch. They were able to get my tire in next day but they  did not carefully install the tire on my beautiful wheel . I have a bend the wheel rim and 3 scratches that are not repairable . I was disappointed and wished that I went back to my regular branch ."
2,"I got my first Loubi's here several years ago. The service up in the shoe department is great! But the handbag department is rude as hell, If you are dressed down, they automatically think you arent going to spend money, they dont even bother to help.They just look at you with an all high and mighty attitude and then turn the other way and try to avoid eye contact when you try to ask for help. LOL, funny considering you are just working a low paying job. Anyway, I ended up having my SA up in the shoe department help me in the handbag section and purchased 5 luxury handbags. The lady working at the handbag section noticed and immediately approached and tried talking to me in a kiss a$$ kind of way. Hmm, BIG mistake, you should treat ALL customers equally and not judge customers by appearance. You just lost a big sale."
2,"We've been here twice as a family. The first time we came, it was a ""meh"" experience, but decided to come back a couple of months later in hopes that it was a one-off bad experience.
Unfortunately, the food is bland - nothing appears to have salt in it. Mashed potatoes contained absolutely no seasoning whatsoever, the fries were seriously undercooked (borderline raw) and for what you get, it seems very overpriced. Burgers were fine, but definitely nothing to rave about.
I truly wish this place had better food, because even if service was a bit spotty, I would be willing to pay extra for decent comfort food and for the fun 1950's diner ambience. Unfortunately, our experience at Jukebox left a little something to be desired."
2,"This was my second time at Waffles INCaffeinated and i was highly disappointed this time considering my first experience here was great. I came with my friend and her husband, and we had asked for a larger end table, since my friend and I are immunosuppressed. While the hostess (brown/red hair and freckles) couldn't have guessed that, the eye rolling and annoyed attitude should not have been present. Once we were seated, it took forever for our waitress to appear to take our drink order, at least 20 minutes. While we were eating, we could see and hear our initial hostess and another waitress badmouthing one of their customers and laughing about it. The food was great, but the waffles have significantly reduced in size, and the lack of service  (my friend's husband never did get his water) made me realize that this place is not worth visiting again. Maybe another location."
2,This Chick Fil A is awful. The last 3 times I have been here I have gotten soggy fries that are undercooked. How do you consistently mess up fries?? I love chick fil A but this location sucks. I've learned my lesson and I just have to drive up to North Scottsdale to get my fix.
2,"Waffles were mushy,,coffee was cold ,ordered blueberry topping the waffles came out with a drip of sauce over it.asked for more sauce charged me extra for it.my grandkids had French toast ,came out with no syrup.the total meal was $32.00 extremely overpriced. Will not return. Waiter was nice though."
2,"The only reason I give this chickfila on Tatum 2 stars is because chickfila's food is so good. BUT this chickfila is so poorly run! If you go through the drive thru expect to wait at least 10 min. Do not go when you are in a hurry. It is so slow. Also they rarely get your order correct and you MUST check your order, including your drink, before pulling away. This chickfila needs some help with speed and accuracy, it is not run like all the other chickfila's that I have visited through the years"
2,"First impressions are everything....


The establishment is cold feeling. Cool blue walls might be fine in summer but not fall and winter. Noise, hard floors, loud music and bright spot lights on customers equal a non inviting environment 

Harsh kitchen smells, tiny coffee cups . They aren't insulated either, our coffee was never hot .

I know too much about the hospitality industry and I spot flaws 

The chairs were very uncomfortable 

The menu is different than many. 3 eggs instead of 2 . The continental breakfast doesn't have an add waffle option. The oj was watered down, not fresh
They brush your waffle with butter, I'd rather do it myself 

The food is presented nicely, very nicely.

.? Why is the vanilla maple syrup clear?

Why on. Earth is the maple syrup, all3 of them so watery? To cut costs?"
2,"A little birdie told me this place had a great taco Tuesday with $1 authentic tacos...of course I was excited and had to visit. 

First let me say the entrance to this place is not clear at all. Having parked on the side road next door, I assumed the entrance was in the front. I walked around and straight into their kitchen. Ok note to self not the entrance. The told me the next door over, at this point the only other door I see is for a burger place, confused as all get out, I walk in. Awkward and confused, I think ok maybe it is some weird fusion concept. Finally I am directed through their shared entry way to la unica. I'm sorry, but there is no reason for such confusion with the entry way! Put up a sign or something! I had avoided the parking lot behind the place because of other reviews stating how precarious the driving situation could be back there, so I didn't see the patios til after the fact. 

Ordered a frozen margarita and made it a point to ask for it to be less sweet and with salt. Came out tasting like diabetes and with sugar on the rim. To make matters worse, the tacos were atrocious. Ordered two barbacoa, one carnitas, and one lengua. Specifically inquired how the lengua was cut before hand was told it was thinly sliced and of course it came out diced -.-. Barbacoa had no flavor other than oil it definitely needed seasoning. The carnitas was flavourful, but the neat to tortilla ratio was off. Waited almost an hour for our credit card to be returned because they were out of receipt paper? Entered at 6:30 and was waiting to leave til 9:00. Kinda crazy for 4 tacos and a drink! 

Overall there are better places in the area with better food. Skip La Unica and head up Central towards Albamarle Rd for authentic tacos at a better price and higher? quality."
2,"Like any restaurant there are strengths & weaknesses. The sandwiches are made on a press and my vegan Philly was good and easily can be better with just a bit more veggies. Also, their coffee drinks seem to be good.

However, finding a clean table was a bit of a challenge. Overall, cleanliness is a big challenge for this place. The community water jug wasn't flowing so I opened it hoping it was fruit or something, I was surprised to see hair inside the jug & what looked like pieces of napkin in it. 
Personally, I don't think that is sanitary. 

What's worse when I let the person working there know she first just made sure there was water in the container and it doesn't appear to get checked in the inside. When I let her know what was inside she took the water away, but it was not replaced and I didn't get to drink any water with my meal. 

Since my sandwich was good and the vegan blue cheese dressing was also good (for my side salad) they avoid a 1 star rating from me, but if cleanliness is that big of a challenge it is unsettling to think of the rest of the ""kitchen"""
2,"This place has switched up things a few times since they've opened.  They started with offering a variety of fancy grilled cheese sandwiches. I have never liked cheese, not even vegan cheese, so this option didn't appeal to me.  Then they began offering a sandwich of the month (which had some great features), but soon stopped.  Karaoke Fridays with a special flavor of vegan wings were a thing for a while, and I was really excited for this, but this too was over before I knew it.   

Soul Food Saturdays is another thing of the past.  They had fried ""chicken"", greens, and red beans & rice. The fried ""chicken"" is not at all what I expected; it was more like chicken nuggets.  The greens were not southern greens, but they gave it a nice try.  The red beans & rice were pretty decent. 

I had a delicious strawberry lemonade cupcake here. It was sweet and very moist.  I never see them advertising cupcakes on their social media pages anymore, so I am not sure what happened.  

When I was there on Soul Food Saturday, there was a man singing and playing his guitar live. He had an amazing voice and it was the perfect background accompaniment to my dine-in lunch. I don't know if they still offer this lovely entertainment. 

They offer vegan donuts, courtesy of Welcome Chicken & Donuts.  They also offer bagel sandwiches for breakfast, which I have never tried.  

The employees were very pleasant, but the owner was unfriendly and cold. 

I don't drink coffee, not a bagel fan, and I don't eat cheese, so unfortunately, there is nothing to draw me here any longer."
2,"Barneys has always been the department store that I marvelled at. Everyone has a Bloomingdales, a Nordstrom, a Neiman's. There's just something about Barneys. 

Unfortunately, the Las Vegas location did not live up to the customer service standards that I always experienced with the flagship location. In fact, the only reason I'm giving it that second star is because the sales associates in women's clothing weren't rude. They also never acknowledged me, but not nearly as bad as the firs floor beauty area. 

As I walked in to the first floor, I was greeted by rows of gorgeous bags, and saw the perfume and beauty in the back. Making my way over, no one said hello, which was fine as I had earbuds in. 

Once I got to the perfume counter, I zeroed in on some Barneys exclusives I had wanted to smell for quite a while. As I begin to look at the bottles, an associate comes over and says hello. I took my earphones out, greeted her, and let her know I was just browsing. She informed me about the fragrances and I put my earphones back in. 

Normally if someone sees you with headphones, they kind of respect that you don't want to be bothered. Unfortunately that was not the case here. I made my way to Byredo, one of my favourite fragrance houses. As I start to look at some, the lady and another associate start to talk to me. ""Are you familiar with Byredo?"" Yes I am! ""Well look at this, this is better, this is more unique"". 

While I appreciate the suggestion, I was trying to browse at my leisure. However I took her recommendation and stepped to the counter - with my earphones back in my ear. Again, one of the sales lady starts trying to talk to me. At this point I'm getting extremely frustrated, as I have my headphones in, and have mentioned about three times that I am just simply browsing. I listen to what she has to say, put my headphones back on, and start smelling some of the fragrance houses perfumes. 

I actually found a perfume that I liked, and decided to pull it up on their website so I could read about the notes that the fragrance had. The sales lady again interrupts me, asks me what I'm doing, and then informs me that she knows all the notes and can just tell me. I let her know it's easier for me to read it than to hear it. She got an attitude and then told me again if I need assistance or ""am actually interested in purchasing"" to let her know. 


At this point, I am beyond frustrated, so I let her know that I do not need any assistance and actually walk away from the counter. What sucks is I would have purchased a fragrance. There is a difference between customer service, and just plain rude. These associates definitely need to learn that."
2,"Relatively bad. Pretzels themselves are drab and overly salted, and remarkably tough, but the service is always extremely pleasant."
2,"If you are in the mood for a good waffle then by all means try this place. However, the ventilation, or lack off, would ruin even the best food. The place has an over-powering smell of fried food. The smell is so strong that you are reminded of your meal throughout the day; the smell becomes immersed in hair and clothing. The server was very pleasant and prompt. The place is known for waffles, which I suggest you stick to. The $12 omelet was just okay and somewhat lackluster."
2,"My friend took me here last night because he was in the mood for tacos. I was hesitant since I can be pretty picky, but I carried on. I ordered the asada, barbacoa, and lengua tacos. All the meat in the tacos were lacking flavor, very bland. It was served on flour tortillas, when we specifically asked for corn.  The barbacoa taco was soak and continued to drop fatty oils until a bowl of soup appeared. The best part of the taco was the cheese they used, it was delicious! The service was good and the atmosphere was good; I don't think I will be returning though."
2,"To say I was unimpressed would be an understatement. This establishments saving grace was our second waitress.

We walk in and ask for a table of 3, the hostess takes us to a booth and we ask to be seated elsewhere. She instead lowers the blind so we aren't blinded by the sun. After a  five minutes of the sun beating the back of my husbands head and no waiter coming to see us we flag down the hostess as she seats someone else. We ask for another table and we are told they will clean on for us and then we will be reseated. Only then does our waiter come over. We tell him we are moving and he leaves.

We get our new seats and out waitress is quick. She takes our drink order and leaves us with the menu. After a few minutes she comes back empty handed and informs is the bar is back logged and would be a few minutes for our drinks (soft drinks and a juice). She asks if we would like to place our order and we do. She's very well informed about the menu and sides etc.

It didn't take long for us to get our food but upon inspection of my fries (my inspection I literally mean looking at them) you could see that the fries which were supposed to be ""curly"" are limp, cold, and undercooked.

By the time the waitress came back to see us and I told her of the problem I had eaten half my burger. They sent out replacement fries (straight) on the house while they made a new batch of curly. By the time the curly fries came I had finished the burger. The thought from the kitchen/manager to send free fries was nice but does it matter when my fries come after I'm done eating? 

The burger was above average but below epic. My husband wasn't too impressed with his food either but his thoughts on the dipping sauces with the fries was ""store bought"" and the onion rings tasted frozen. 

I will not be back."
2,"Everything looked good but was just very bland..The iced tea was very good but if you are looking for any kind of non surger sweetener you'll need to bring your own, they don't offer it.."
2,"Bigger doesn't always mean better. Don't get me wrong: the burgers were not bad. Not by a long shot. We don't need a burger, however, that casts a shadow over your dinner guest.....or do we??? I found the ambiance fun bordering on cheesy. The burger itself was good - not great. I did, however really enjoy the desserts. They have May-West or Joe-Louis ice cream sandwiches amongst other things. I chose the latter and was happy I did. In the end, the place is OK. Not worth going out of your way for. It tastes dangerously close to a chain restaurant that you might find in small town Ontario or in the States somewhere. Its lacking something..."
2,"We made several attempts to come here,  only managed to actually come once. The hours aren't accurate on yelp or maybe they vary. When we finally had a chance to check it out it was underwhelming and slightly uncomfortable. We were really wanting to find a coffee shop we could frequent and volstead was close and seemed really cool but I doubt we'd be back. We walked in and contemplated the menu...asked what a toddy was and was very put off by the response... like we were dumb for not knowing...the cashier/barista wasn't very welcoming and didn't seem to want us there...we persisted...or tried...we waited for our coffee and tea, sat down in the couched area but left soon after we got our drinks. Never a word from the cashier/barista. The space seemed nice enough, imagine it could be comfortable, just not this time, not for us. The coffee wasn't spectacular, not good enough to brace the awkwardness."
2,"My fiancé, who's been a loyal customer at this location for years, came here today because we had a nail in the tire of our new Explorer. We were told that it would take 2 hours to repair because they were a little busy. We left and returned 2 hours later and our SUV was still sitting, yet to even be seen. My fiancé waited an additional hour and a half and they told him that the tire was unrepairable and that we would have to purchase another tire but they didn't have any in stock. They put the spare on and my fiancé went to Big 'O Tires, to see if they had a tire in stock. Big 'O Tires explained that the hole had already been repaired and they checked to make sure it wasn't leaking. It wasn't. So, Discount Tire lied, told us the tire was unrepairable (even though they repaired it) and tried to sell us a tire for no reason when we have all new tires. We will never return to this location!"
2,"Le nom le décrit bien c'est un restaurant de style Diner avec un look retro. Jukebox, déco retro, milkshake et burger. C'est un restaurant familial.  

Les choix sont variés pour un repas burger, frites, poutines, hot dog et toutes ces bonnes choses pour la santé. La nourriture était bonne. Les serveurs très gentils. 

Par compte, la propreté du restaurant laissait grandement à désirer. La route vers les toilettes n'était pas agréable, des chaises en rangées devant les toilettes (???) des céramiques qui tombent au bas du mur. Arrivé aux toilettes c'était pire, odeur, sale, bref, çà m'a coupé l'appétit. Pourtant le restaurant était presque vide. 

Décevant car la nourriture n'est pas mauvaise, mais un restaurant est bien plus que seulement de la bonne bouffe, c'est un ensemble. 

Je ne sais pas si j'y retournerais."
2,"The tacos here are street style, which means that they are muy tiny.  I have been here around 4 or 5 times and they are always overloaded with cilantro.  Customer service is very good however."
2,"I came into the restaurant to catch the live music and shared two dinners with my son on a Friday night.  The décor is great and so was the music.  The wait staff was a bit young and inexperienced, when I contacted the owner he really took the time to find out about my dining experience.  Any independent restaurant such as Wheel Fish is competing against 'Goliath' in my opinion.  I will always choose the small guy, Wheel Fish has my vote for innovative smoked dinners and great music.  Thank you."
2,"We love Chick-fil-A food but we'll go back to the other location we frequent next time we want some. I spoke with who ever the ""manager"" was at this location more than 5 years ago about a large ladder being stored on top of the area small children play in and apparently it is still not a safety concern to this restaurant."
2,"Nah, all the positive reviews here are probably bogus.  Just contacted them and they did not seem interested in me at all. Guess I didn't get to Michelle lmao!!!"
2,"Wanted to try this place for a while. Nothing special. The menu is huge which I guess is a good thing, but it's a bit much. You can get almost anything on a waffle. I had bananas. It was ok. They have different syrups to try. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Been there done that. Don't think we'd be back any time soon unfortunately."
2,"The food is wonderful but no matter if the place is empty or full, it should not take 45 mins to cook and serve breakfast fare.  Either they send staff home earlier than they should while they can not handle the workload full staff, or they have managed to make waffles into a 45 min item.  Either way I feel like they push slow to new levels and make me question my future patronage"
2,"I know that I'm in the minority... but I really do not like The Pretzel Shop. My co-workers often pick up pretzels from here for birthdays or other office events, and everyone spends the morning raving about how delicious the pretzels are and how they cannot stop eating them. Am I missing something? I just sit quietly at my desk and raise an eyebrow at all this chatter. I've had them at least 5-8 times and cannot say that I've ever enjoyed them. The regular pretzels are either over or under salted (not sure if that is a preference the customer can select or if it's just random), and the cinnamon sugar just taste strange. They often taste very soggy, too, like they were bagged when still too warm. Occasionally, co-workers pick-up the ""cheese"" sauce. This stuff looks like a melted yellow crayon. I love all types of cheese, but this looks and tastes terrible. Yes, I'm being blasphemous towards a Pittsburgh tradition, I know, but I'm sorry, I'd much rather get a pretzel from Hofbrauhaus or even Auntie Anne's in the mall."
2,"I came to check this place out because it had four stars on yelp and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican food. I ordered the green chili plate and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and we shared the menudo. I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food, it was bland and not very tasteful. We felt like we could have just gone to Filerberto and got better food. The only thing good about this place was our food came out fast and the person who took our order was nice. Other then that, I will not be coming back to eat here. We left very unsatisfied!"
2,"Oh where do I start? First, I want to say the food was actually really good. I had the super chimichangas and we shared some nachos. Salsa was nice and spicy. My lovely meal was spoiled by a crappy manager and sub par service.
 My nephew wanted a salad with bacon and cheese, that's it. We receive a full taco salad instead.  We send it back to get our correct item. They bring out the salad again and it's still wrong!! My nephew decides to eat it because he's starving. When we get the bill, I'm being charged damn near $8!! When I ask for the manager, he never comes to the table and he refuses to change the amount. As a matter of fact, he tells my server he's not going to change it and I don't have to pay for my food!! It's mind boggling!! I sat there for at least 30 minutes waiting for this damn manager! He never shows up and then relays an idiotic statement!! Order takeout; don't dine in!"
2,"My wife and I went to Waffles INC this morning for breakfast.  I ordered eggs over easy, bacon, home fries and toast.  The eggs arrived slimy and floating in a pool of water (literally).  The bacon was flavorless.  The ""house specialty"" home fries were dry and had no seasoning. 

This place is noisy and chaotic.  If you go, check in with their app or you will sit there and watch many customers get seated before you.

This place is highly over rated and over priced and is proof of the dearth of good brunch venues in the North Hills."
2,"Dude was too cool to even acknowledge us. 

I wanted to like this place so much, I'd been wanting to try it out, finally made it here on a Sunday (btw, it'd behoove the owners to keep their current hours posted accurately across all forums), but the barista/dude behind the counter, who was the sole employee afaik, was so silent I felt uncomfortable even ordering. Asked for a cup for water and was given a cup...I guess I wait for water? 

We ordered the grilled cheese special & SW bagel. SW bagel was awesome- nothing mind blowing, but tasty! My grilled cheese was underwhelming and barely melted cheese. 

Biggest takeaway was the uncomfortable feeling from the employee. I work in a similar job, I don't want someone up my ass or being fake or too intrusive-- but this was the extreme opposite. I felt unwelcome."
2,"The classic chicken sandwich with cheese is fantastic for a quick lunch.

But I have stopped going altogether because the woman who works the dining room during lunch insists on having 3 different interactions while I am trying to chew my food.

First time she asks if everything's ok.  Next time she asks if she can refill my untouched soda.  And the third time she asks if she can take my tray. I recognize that probably follows her training guidelines. But it is not working for this guy.

All I want is 20 minutes of peace while I eat.  I am more than capable of expressing any unmet needs."
2,"The one on Camelback is so much better. The grilled nuggets taste better, the service is better, they actually give me the sauce I ask for...it's honestly gotten worse over the past few months. They almost always give me the wrong sauce but the last time I went I didn't get ONE of the correct sauces I asked for. I feel like they are just lazy teenagers who don't give a crap. I didn't realize the difference in the food until I recently went to the one on Camelback and the grilled nuggets tasted fresher. Take some notes from that location!"
2,"I went to Waffles INCaffeinated yesterday (Sunday) for brunch. My party included four adults, and two toddlers (in high chairs).  We used the ""no wait"" app to put our name in around 10:25am and received a table at about 11:10am. The app makes the whole process easier, however if you show up early, or don't use it at all, there is NO WHERE to wait inside.  Plan to wait in your car, or outside.   We waited several minutes for our drink order to be placed and about 15 more minutes to place our food order. We finally received our food around 12:30pm.  That was entirely too long to wait.  When our order finally arrived, everything was correct, but we were all so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point.  Someone needs to go in and evaluate the whole operation, otherwise they won't be around long. Also, small minor side note - the ""kids menu"" is not served in a kid friendly way. They don't have kids cups or plates.  Imagine toddlers trying to use ceramic dishes and coffee cups for their beverage."
2,"It really pains me to give a mediocre review as this was my third time trying the restaurant!  

We waited forever for service today, after being seated. We opted for the AYCE option. The server took our full order. 

The items started trickling to our table very slowly - sloppily thrown together rolls that were falling apart. We noticed that some of the more ""expensive"" items on the AYCE menu never arrived - seaweed salad, salmon rolls, taro tempura....but the cucumber and avocado rolls kept arriving. 

The server finally came back and asked us if we were done. We were still waiting for some those other items to arrive!  I think this was deliberate on their part. Food never arrived even though we asked for it three times. 

But the last bit is what really irks me. The menu we ordered from showed the price of AYCE as $16.99 for adults and $7.99 for kids. We were with our kids and decided it would be worthwhile to go for the AYCE options based on some quick math. 

Imagine my surprise when the bill came, and we were charged $12 for each of the kids!  Turns out that our menu had an outdated (lower) price on it. Instead of honouring the price because it was the restaurant's mistake, the server told us that we simply had to pay the additional amount. That's it, that's all. 

Graceful Vegetarian restaurant all the way when I'm in Markham. Done with Tenon."
2,2 stars for a very sparse sandwich. I mean real sparse. Basically bread and sauce. Have to try again next time so I can hopefully give a place that serves vegan food a better rating. If I was one of those meat munchers this sandwich sure wouldn't convince me to convert to veganism.
2,"Disappointing barbecue honestly. Meat was tough and not particularly flavorful. The corn bread was dry. The veggies were fine but nothing special. Tried the pork and brisket and was very disappointed. To be fair, we lived in Texas briefly and nothing compares to Franklins."
2,"Really kind of disappointed. 

Food is not prepare in a dilicate way, sushi even loosing. Eel is nothing like eel, just a piece of been curd. 

Service is not good, it's hard to get attention, we try to get a piece of paper to write down and get refused.

Price are too expensive, we went for a all you can eat dinner, it's 24 but not even have sashimi, sushi is only rolls. Many things in their menu are not included. Very limited choice.

Not suggest."
2,I don't know if I'm the only one but for me they didn't season the RICE at all. There was no taste of the usual rice vinegar taste to the sushi rice that's usually in normal sushi. Did anyone else experience that or is it just me?
2,"This place definitely has a new, cool vibe and I can easily see how it would be popular before a show. 
-
But if you want a hipster, posh atmosphere; complete with a lackadaisical attitude, this is definitely a spot for you. We came in on a Sunday at 1:00 in the afternoon. One person sitting down and one waiting on their drink. We weren't greeted for 13 minutes. That's after I timed it. 
-
After finally getting a ""hey"" I asked how the guy was doing. ""Busy"" was my only reply. So hipster they don't even want you here!
-
Who knows people? Give this place a try if you want something new, it definitely has a good vibe and cool scenery. Just not great on the service."
2,"Tried out the new La Unica as a taco tuesday replacement since it is in the former Loco Lime location. Bland, tasteless, is the only way I can describe it. Maybe you can get more from something other than $1 tacos, but it seems a step down from the restaurant it replaces."
2,"I used to be a huge advocate for this place.  I literally have only bought my tires from this location since it opened because of their professionalism and demeanor.  Approx 10 sets of tires over 15 years.  Today, their demeanor and professionalism sucked.  I was informed the exact same tires that I previously had on my car that lasted 49K miles, are currently at their last possible rotation after less than 25K miles. I got no explanation, other than, ""yea, you'll need to replace them soon.""  Next, as I hand the guy my keys, he says it will be two hours to rotate my tires.  If you told me this up front, you could have saved us both some time.  Don't assume your customers have 2 hours to spare for tire rotation, it isn't logical.  If it will take more than an hour, just tell us up front and we'll stop by when you aren't so busy.  At the end, I'm waiting for my car to be pulled out of the garage.  While I'm sure the loud Rap music is fun for guys working on cars it just annoys me.  Next, the guy pulling out my car drives right past me standing 5 feet from him, and parks at the far end of the lot.  So, I wait for him to get back inside the building, where it's just me and two employees.  One guy is bitching about how an employee failed to get the make and model of a car on his paperwork, and what an idiot he is.  Guess what?   I don't give a sh*t about your internal dirty laundry!  Keep that sh*t to yourself when customers are in the building!  What happened to your professionalism?  Or was it just because Joe wasn't working today?  Anyway,  the cherry on top of this shitty experience, was as I drove off the lot I had to pull over because they didn't close the hood. Appears you have managed to let greed replace your previous business model of customer service and integrity.  Now you are the same as every other tire shop...    What's next?  Charging for tire repairs?  Charging for rotations?  No more discounts?  Hmmmm... guess we'll see."
2,"I can verify what many others have stated about the mac and cheese. It is incredibly bland. I don't mean it taste like artificial cheese or that it had a bad flavor. It has absolutely no flavor. 

Also, we ordered a salad to only find out that the olives still had the pits in them. That seems like a quite dangerous oversight for a salad.

On a funnier note, I just watched another guest receive their mac and cheese... her face was priceless. She is not happy... lol"
2,"Just makes me want to say no no no no no
La Unica was a big disappointment unfortunately. I was expecting a lot more from their $1 taco Tuesday night. The only thing that was actually decent was the chicken taco with lettuce, tomato and sour cream for a slight up-charge.

The meat was subpar to what I was expecting with flavorless taste. I would not recommend this place to eat on Taco Tuesday or just in general if the quality of the food that I received that night is any indication of what this restaurant has to offer.

I've been to many Mexican restaurants because it's one of my favorite categories of food to eat and this is by far one of the worst. They are the bad generic brand of Mexican food. Pay a little extra for something better. 

If you like plain food and bare minimum service than come to this place. The only thing that was better than the chicken taco was the free chips and salsa. It was actually really good.

This place honestly feels like they are a barely making it by and trying to pass off quality food with cheap prices but it doesn't work. You pay for what you get here in terms of quality. 

I am not rush to come back but if daring to go give it a try at least get the chips and salsa with drinks."
2,"Much prefer Three Amigos down the street. Both orders were incorrectly prepared and communication from the staff was near nonexistent. Even though we live 2 miles away, we probably won't return."
2,"Unimpressed...

Maywest ice cream sandwich had frost burn. Not taste to meat. Bun could have been stale."
2,"Food is not very good.  I will not be going back.  Best mexican restaurant I have found in Charlotte is Aztecas.  1900 Mexican Grill isn't bad, but Aztecas is by far the best!"
2,Been here 3x in the last 2 months. Bad attitude and service is just getting worst terrible. They always make mistakes. Fries were cold and the waiter start to make excuses and then took the meal away. I said to waiter leave the meal and bring new fries and plate you can have the cold ones. He said no and Then he took the hamburger plate and came back 10 mins later but the hamburger was cold. Manager was not interested when we spoke to him. Guess our $100  meal /business is not needed ..
2,"After hearing about this place and reading reviews, we were all excited to grab some dinner and drinks here.  Maybe they were having an off night but only 1 out of the 6 of us had a good experience.

There was only one server for the whole dining area and she was clearly overwhelmed.  The two bartenders and manager weren't interested in helping her.  

Two of us got the pulled pork sandwich which was good but cold.  We didn't realize that we were supposed to have some BBQ sauce with it until after we finished and the  tables around us had the bottles.

Two got the salmon which again wasn't very warm and was served dry without any sauce at all.

One got the brisket quesidilla which literally had about two small chunks of meat on each piece so it was most tortillas with peppers.  That was sent back and exchanged for the pork nachos.  

The beef brisket was reportedly very good.

After a few rounds we asked for the bill and were told that we couldn't split a party of six, after we were told that wouldn't be a problem before the meal.  Why they couldn't ring us up as three parties of two, I do not know. Why they have large tables if they can't split them, I do not know.  Our first bill came and it was for the wrong table.  Our second bill came and the brisket quesidilla was still on it.  We finally got our correct bill which left us with the fun task of figuring out who ate and drank what.

Beer was good, place was cool, and I want to like it so maybe I'll try again in a few months."
2,"I'm not a vegetarian and this was my first time going to a completely vegan restaurant. I had the lunch buffet and I tried most of the sushi rolls which were too bland for my tastes. Guess I'm just not used to imitation meat/seafood. That being said, I think a vegetarian would enjoy this place."
2,"So I came here for lunch with my husband, and wanted to check this place out after hearing they had good Tripa Tacos.  I already had a feeling it wasn't going to be that great, but what the heck, I always pick where we go so I let him have it ;) The dining area is nice! Very clean and well maintained it definitely has that Mexican feel to it with the curios and Spanish tile layout on the walls. The girl working the counter was very friendly!  I ordered a carne asada burrito w/ side of rice and my husband had 2 tripa tacos and 2 chicken tacos. As we waited, we were given chips and salsa! Oh gosh! The tortilla chips tasted like that ""fridge"" taste, when you put something in the fridge and dont cover it up well! *barf* how hard is it for a Mexican place to get a dam tortilla chip to taste right?!!! The salsa however was really good! Chunky but NOT spicy! Not even a kick! I asked the girl if there was a more spicy salsa and said they dont have any!! What the He11!! A mexican place that doesnt serve HOT salsa?? That is just WRONG & UNAUTHENTIC!! We finally got our food, pretty quickly. I looked at my husbands tacos and they just looked so sad and empty. Barely any tripa in the dam taco! Then his chicken tacos had lettuce and tomoatoes!! WTF!! Lettuce and tomato?? Thats some crap you see at Taco Bell! We were expecting cilantro, onions and cabbage! Not this crap! Then my burrito was kinda small, the torilla was really good it tasted homemade and was warm. The carne was super small cut up it looked like lengua. It was upsetting! Right on the menu it says AUTHENTIC. Bullcrap! Your better off going to Filibertos or Los Favs which arent even authentic but better than this!"
2,"Compared to the one in Deer Valley where I work.....this one needs some serious improvements. I know Chick-Fil-A takes it's customer service....food....and store cleanliness very serious. This one however is the exception especially when it comes to cleanliness and organization. This locale is always messy....the condiments are always disorganized....and the lemonade on my last 3 occasions has not been good..... for lack of a better word. I am shocked and appalled really because I have been to several of these establishments and if the managers there could see this store they would be shocked as well. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends.....just not at this Chick-Fil-A."
2,"First, their selection is pretty fantastic. They have all of the brands I love and some others I had not previously heard of before. I found a perfect cashmere sweater by Tory Sport. I didn't realize Tory Burch had an activewear line. I'm not sure I would consider a white cashmere sweater ""activewear"" but it was cute as all heck. I started wandering around with it on the hanger knowing 100% I wanted it and wasn't even going to spend the time trying it on. We smoked a cigar previously and I thought it would be tacky to try on something and possibly ruin the sweater with any cigar odor. 

Did any of the meandering staff who looked utterly bored even ask me if I wanted to try it on, let alone a ""hello,"" no. No they did not. Certainly not for them being busy. 

I went out of my way to find the nicest looking salesman to ring up my purchase to avoid giving it to the other people slothing around. Let's be honest, at the end of the day you work in retail. Not helping customers because you're lazy is super unprofessional and the, ""I'm so cool that I work here"" attitude is obnoxious. This is Vegas, there are a million ultra high end stores within walking distance so it isn't as if shoppers lack options. You were the last stop in of a very long shopping day or I would've looked elsewhere for the sweater. 

Luckily, I somehow found the one nice lady salesperson and she was fantastic. We chatted a bit, she was friendly and knowledgable. She asked me if I wanted to try on the sweater and said she appreciated that I told her why I preferred not to (possible smoke smell). 

Sadly, that was short lived because I was told ""not to take pictures"" while waiting for my cousin to scope out a handbag. First, I hadn't taken a photo in the first place. I was holding the phone so I could read my husband's text after I recently had eye surgery. What the heck is with the unwarranted attitude? I still giggle at the weirdness of that exchange and overly snobby attitude of some sales kid too busy standing talking to his coworker and not helping my cousin. She found the exact same bag at another store and bought it there instead. Perhaps help your customer and not yelling at them for taking a picture, which I hadn't.

The only reason they get anything over one star is because I love their overall selection of products, convenient location, and look of the store. Otherwise, as for customer service, I've seen friendlier people making a wage in a silly outfit literally 30 feet outside of your store. Stay in your lane and leave the nasty attitude at home because those of us shopping don't care that you work there, we just want to buy things. I know this may sound like a lot of scuttle over something seemingly silly, and it would be silly if it were one salesman with a sour attitude and not multiple floors of people standing around not helping anyone until I'm getting accosted by perfume sprays on my way out. Nothing annoys me more than poor customer service and a bad attitude. Sadly, they have both."
2,"The guys there are awesome, the owners seem annoyed every time I order something. Not sure if they are stressed or what, but I sometimes feel sheepish to order something. 

WIFI IS TERRIBLE. NEVER RELIABLE. 

When I ask about it they just tell me to try it again or they say ""sorry"" and that's it. Sad because I always order while I'm here. 

Needs life and energy, and a reliable wifi source."
2,"I am being very generous with my two stars. The ambiance and decor are fun. The service is quick and friendly. The food is horrible. 
The food here used to be good. Now the burgers are dry and even  the buns aren't fresh. Try eating a dry burger in stale bread. Not very appealing.
The cheese nacho and the mac and cheese contain NO real cheese... only some sort of sauce made with powder.
I feel bad writing this review since I have been a customer at this restaurant for many years now. The last 2 times were the last. I don't know what happened..."
2,"Nice looking, cool ambiance american style diner. 

I heard a lot of good things about the place and was quite excited to finally try it. 

I was very disapointed with the food.I took the quarter pounder burger combo with a meat lover mac n cheese. I also tasted the smoked meat poutine and a milk shake.

The burger was quite dry and didn't taste anything special at all,what a disapointment..

Mac and cheese tasted like fake cheese with orange coloring .

Poutine was lacking and wasn't special.

The milk shake was not bad.

I would not recommend this place at all."
2,I didn't know that this was not the same as last time I was there. I will not return because I felt very unwelcome when a young lady started sweeping the floor right in the area I was seated.
2,"2.5 stars. 

I'm not sure what happened but this place wasn't nearly as great as our 1st few times here. Younger girl at register...not very nice, didn't know specifics about ingredients or menu items. Her mom ended up taking our order, just as unfriendly...not mean, just not customer service friendly. 
Food= they use lard, which is pork and gross af. The shredded beef tacos were ick because they add some sauce to the meat. Carne asada tacos are still amazing. 
They didn't have flan but they had it on the menu

Very disappointing visit."
2,"This is a Just an ok sushi vegetarian restaurant. They have lunch sushi buffet for $13.99 but there are very few choices.Nothing extra ordinary, food is on the bland side."
2,"Nice-looking not nice to eat!!
Do not order mac & cheese worst I've ever had. Out of the three meals I've had here only good one was the spicy chicken wrap.
Fries or just okay nothing spectacular."
2,I tried this place for a late lunch today and all I can say it was very bland. The staff was great but the food....well not so much.
2,"On an unusually cool and drizzly day I came in and asked for their ooeyist, gooeyist grilled cheese.  She suggested the Philly.  It was neither ooey or gooey.  The filling had the consistency (at least I think) of cat food.  Okay flavor.  This came with an over $3 partially-filled cup of Earl grey tea.  Expensive meh.  

However, I will note that the sourdough bread was wonderful!

Oh, and I did not get chips or a pickle as I am seeing on the other pics."
2,They need to just stick with their chicken sandwiches and waffle fries.  Their coffee tasted horrible as there's no coffee taste at all.
2,"First visit today and probably won't be back.

Friend and I planned to grab some coffees here and then head over to another eatery for our meals.  I arrived a few minutes before she did as her previous appointment ran late.  No worries, since I wanted to ask my usual questions re food allergies.  Told lone female barista it was my first time here and asked if there were more food offerings besides what I saw in the dessert case, and she said yes and said there were more on menus as she pointed to the small menu sheets next to the cash register.  My eyes gravitated to another mini-blackboard menu titled Seasonal items, and I  instantly wanted to know more about the ""Dreamsicle- Mango Cheesecake"" selection.  I added that I'd like to hear more about these seasonal items, especially that Mango Cheesecake, and she told me ""Oh, they're just something we do here... We serve other items that you find in other coffee shops...""  Hmm...  She didn't seem enthusiastic about them.  I was still curious about what mango cheesecake coffee would taste like, so I asked her what goes into the drink to make it taste like the dessert, to which she responded that the flavors come from the syrups they use... And I looked towards where she turned her head to, and I saw a wall of Torani syrups.  No gusto, no enthusiasm regarding this delicious-sounding drink, so I stopped considering to get one, told her I was waiting for a friend, and took a food menu to read at a table nearby.  I went back after a few minutes of studying the menu to ask about the breads used for their ""Sourdough Toast & Jam"" and the Copper State sandwich.  Both are made with sourdough bread from a shop ""that starts with an ""M,"" so I volunteered ""MJ?,"" and she said ""yes!""  Volstead (or is it The Nile now, since the coffee cups have ""The Nile"" printed on them) uses two types of MJ bread- sourdough and multi-grain, and while she didn't have ingredients lists, she thought that the sourdough wouldn't contain any corn in it.  (Allergy.)  The barista also checked and told me that the boysenberry jam did not contain cornstarch.  I sat back down again, and as I waited for friend to arrive, I checked-in on Yelp.

Friend arrived, and after our greetings, I placed my order.  (I think I may have asked friend if she needed some time to study the menu and she said no...?  Otherwise, I'd have waited.)  A cappuccino with 2% milk- I previously asked if the milk came from a local dairy, and she said ""just primarily Silk and milk you'd find at the grocery store...""- and ""Toast & jam,"" please.  Paid for my order and stepped aside for friend to put in her order.  She asked the barista about the Mango Cheesecake, and the barista gushed about how she loves to craft these drinks on the seasonal menu and that coworkers actually would tease about how she enjoyed making them.  WTH?  Why tell me one thing and feign no interest in the drinks and then speak and act another way to someone else?  I actually said these words to friend in front of the barista, who pretended she couldn't hear me, and friend laughed a little.  OK...

Cup of cappuccino felt half-empty in its small cup when I lifted it from the counter (I decided not to even bother complaining about this), and I had to ask for butter and wait for it while she finished making a third customer's beverage, even though the toast mentioned butter in its description.  Atmosphere was nice (gothic meets hipster), but I didn't appreciate how barista didn't seem too enthusiastic about talking about the Mango cheesecake iced coffee despite my interest in hearing more about it.  I walked in excited about trying a new coffee shop, which I drove for 28 minutes to get to, only to have the barista downsell a seasonal menu to me, while being completely smitten about it to my friend.  

Wish the owners good luck with Volstead/The Nile.  You're going to need it with employees that steer people away from something they were interested in trying, apparently as their moods strike them."
2,"Two notes about this review: 1) I wavered between 2 and 3 stars. 2) I didn't try any food.

Coffeeshops are the lifeblood of a city. Mesa as a city has been floundering for some time, but recently, has tried to revitalize. This coffeeshop is representative of this. 

What I look for in a coffeeshop is: a comfortable workspace, pleasant service, and good coffee. I didn't find what I was looking for in Volstead.  

Ambiance: I didn't like being there. With the huge open area filled with tables, smaller intimate tables near the front window, and the side bench table, there's no lack of space. However, it's dark. The lighting, apart from the area near the front windows, was too dim. You could tell that the patrons who walked preferred the front of the business. In fact, of the 5+ people I notice walk in, all sat at the same 2-3 tables. 

The decorations are strange. I'm not sure what theme they're going for, but I wouldn't have been surprised if I saw the Adams Family sitting by the defunct fireplace. 

Service: Nothing says it better than the 2-star description. Meh. I've experienced better. 
I walked in and nobody said a word. I waited in line, and placed my order. It was like talking to a robot. She did offer me a stamp card though, so I appreciated that. I approached the front to put away my dishes: no words from the chatting baristas. I leave: not a single word. I don't expect too much from coffeeshops, but being treated like perhaps they appreciate my business is the minimum. 

Coffee: My test for a coffeeshop is a cup of their drip coffee. I ordered a small and carried it back to my table. It wasn't hot. It was warm, but not freshly made hot. It also had this bizarre mouthy feel to it. Now I appreciate when drinks have 'body', but this had no flavour aside from an almost acidic taste. It was strangest cup of coffee I've had in a while. I was wary of each sip, but couldn't throw it out because... student. On the bright side, it still contained caffeine. 

I got my work done, and stopped by the bathroom on the way out. It wasn't clean. It was better than a lot of public places, but there were definitely remnants of bodily excrements in the toilet. Perhaps the baristas could take a break from their break and check on their bathroom. 

The good: The Parking was probably the best thing about this place. There's street parking all around, and a private lot at the back. It was also quiet, aside from the pop background music."
2,"We normally buy all our tires from Discount Tire.  We have done so for decades.  We have bought tires for probably about 20 vehicles over the years.  I like discount tire and their products and prices.  But one thing pissed me off this week.  My wife took her car to get air put into her tires since her tire pressure monitoring system said ""low pressure"".  The guy there refused to put air into her tires telling her that her tires were dangerously worn and needed to be replaced immediately!  He said they were so dangerous that he refused to put any air into them.  So she told him she would have me check them.  Well, that guy was BSing her and trying to scare her.  Her tires still had about 1/4 inch of tread on them.  Depending upon what source you use, tires need to be replaced when tire treads get to about 1/8 to 1/16 inch left.  My wife's tires were nowhere close to being dangerously low and did not need replacement at this time.  These types of car guys who try to take advantage of women are bad news!  I just wish they would stop doing this kind of thing since Discount Tire is a pretty good company."
2,"Honestly, the service at this place is horrendous. Mediocre at the absolute best. And this is coming from someone who was a server for YEARS so I'm really lenient on most things.. It's a shame too because the food is actually pretty good. I've had more than one occasion where my order was made incorrectly, ridiculously long wait times for pick up orders, inattentive servers/bartenders, etc. The owner (or at least the head guy in charge) is always really nice and upbeat and does his best to remedy the situation. I've had them comp my food or give me discounts for issues in the past, but it's still discouraging. I completely appreciate the effort being made but I'd rather pay full price for good, quality food and service any day. 

Sadly, this restaurant has moved to the ""last resort"" list. It's one of those places you think to yourself and say ""Why do I keep choosing to spend my money here?"" Lol BUT the food is really good! Can't knock it! Some hospitality and customer service training would easily take this place to a 4/5 star establishment!"
2,This place is overpriced for what you get....the food is okay.  Not very authentic.
2,"The third separate time (on two completely different cars) this place said my lug nuts needed repair. They blamed it on my type of car. I would of believed them if it didn't happen on another car brand. Thinking it is a trend here.. disappointed. Starting to lose my faith here, to include trendy long waits. Lucky to even give this place two stars."
2,"So I was doing the no carb thing for awhile and my very first carb loaded meal was at Chik-Fil-A.  One would think that after not eating carbs for a couple months, anything would taste divine---- WRONG.

Chi-Fil-A used to be in malls when I was younger and they would hand out free samples of the yummy fried deliciousness on little toothpicks when you walked by.  This then would make me turn to my mother and beg, plead, cry to eat at Chik-Fil-A.  It was really good then.  This was my memory when I went to the Tatum location.  What I got was a super fried chicken fillet that needed salt-- gasp!  Who actually adds salt to fried chicken?  Well, this one tasted bland., so I HAD to.  My bun was soggy and my fries were cold.  Is this really the carbs I was craving all this time? No.  I should have gone to have sushi.

the 2 stars are because I WANT it to be more that 1 star. 

I give it another go ahead, a few weeks later-- at this point I have eaten so many carbs my pant buttons are popping off and AGAIN!  cold fries and soggy bun.  WTF??!!  I haven't been back since and since I am on a NEW diet, I won't be heading there anytime soon.  Boooooooo."
2,Staff is rude. Pastries are so dry and hard they may have been sitting there for days. They use daiya cheese slices and yves vegan ham. Disappointed that I paid so much for the exact food I have at home. The only originality was the bread. I also shouldn't have to pay that much for one tiny scoop of ice cream.
2,"You know the rep chik fil a has? They have outstanding customer service right? Nope! Not this location! Each and every time I go here because it's closest to work they have a snotty ghetto attitude. And they love to argue with you about how many sauces they can give you!! I order TWO separate meals and ask for only 3 sauces each. They try to shag me by giving me 2 total! 
Then they argue because they try to charge you extra for sauce!  

Definitely need a make over at this location."
2,"1st off, I do like this joint.  Sunday brunch in my area is non-existent so I came for the buffet.  Waitress was not around to greet me so I took off to get my breakfast, because she didn't greet me I didn't get to find out that becasue of my age I could have gotten my meal for $10.99 instead of $12.99, I'm older than 55.  I should have forgotten to leave her a gratuity.
Sausage, bacon, hash brown bake were good, biscut-gravy and scrambled eggs  not so much.  Over by the omlette station they have waffels, those were a great way to end the meal.  Next time I'll have the chef make me an omlette.
If you can eat both breakfast and lunch at the same time, they offer ribs and mac and cheese."
2,"Ok, food here was good.  Got a Greek Pita, adding on the cheddar cheese and pita. Service was slow. We were seated, I went to the bathroom and came back and no drink orders were taken.  We sat on the patio.  While we were out there, one of my dining companions got bit by what we think was a fire ant.  The bites were not on her arm before we sat down.  

I think I should've took it as a warning when the sign said need managers, servers, cooks, etc."
2,"So ...anxious to try this place as I love a good breakfast spot. Service at first was prompt, we were seared right away 9:30 on a Saturday morning the place was almost full. I ordered eggs Benedict , and biscuits and gravy. My wife got bourbon peach French toast. First off ( in my best Donald Trump voice) the portions were YUGE!!. Sadly the eggs Benedict was a flavorless mess. It was not played well, just kind of slopped all over the plate with a watery absolutely flavorless yellow something I would not even recognize as hollandaise sauce on top. The biscuit gravy was delicious but when brought out had that not so nice under the  heat lamp  too long crust on it. Had our server ever come back around to say, refill our coffee, or ask about our food I would have returned it. The biscuits were obviously store bought mush. My wife's only response was meh. Obviously canned peaches and just okay. One and done."
2,"Food in this place is alright and it is a little overpriced compare to other MiddleEaster eateries.

I ordered Lamb Kebob sandwich. It tasted alright not something I will ever order again. It had only three small  pieces lamb and the rest was vegetable. 

I won't eat here again that is for sure. I rather do the drive and go to Haji Baba"
2,"We went today for Father's Day brunch and had reservations. I have a 2 year old and requested a high hair. Well we got there and had to wait over 10 min and then they didn't have a high chair for my daughter. I think they only have 2 in the whole place. We literally 
stood there for a good 5 min waiting before we finally sat down and our waitress finally came over and asked if we needed anything and I said yes we need a highchair and they were still supposedly looking for one. She brought over another chair and I looked at her and I said my daughter is 2 that is not going to work. She did apologize but offered us no other alternative. We were finally offered coffee and some beverages a good 10 minutes after we got there. Our service overall was subpar. My daughter had to sit on my husband's lap or my lap because we never did get a highchair!!!! After over an hour I did see that I highchair finally became available and they never even offered to see if we needed it at that point! It overall seem like they were overstaffed and completely unprepared for the amount of people although I know that they've had Father's Day and Mother's Day brunch is before so it's not like they didn't know that this amount of people were going to be there! The food was okay I'm just really upset by the customer service."
2,"Same story as last visit. This is more of a cafe than a restaurant at dinner time... pretty empty, lacking specials/promos, and servers are not perky.  My silverware were both dirty, and the tables are kinda small.. barely fit our plates, glasses, condiments. 
Food is tasty though. Wrap w/ chips a bit small for $. 
Oh just remembered they gave me wrong wrap and salad dressing too. 
Seems that they're just going through the motions. :("
2,"I do like this place and would return again but, noticed a few unpleasant things during my visits.  One of the waitresses stood by the waitress station with her hands in her pocket, while the other waitresses were working.  Looked very unprofessional. Then I wanted to switch the meat that came with my food to fruit.  I didn't like the meat that came with the food. The waitress looked at me strange and said ""We don't do substitutions.  I guess I can just switch it out for you"" the place was nice but they need more people skills!"
2,"Tonight's experience (01/28/17) around 8:45pm was interesting! The yogurt and toppings are always great and most of the employees are very friendly. Tonight however, was crazy busy and there were two girls working. One of them, the blonde, was going over and above to help out each customer and was friendly while working and running around. The other girl, a brunette, was almost no where to be found and didn't want to help anyone out. I felt really bad for the blonde girl but truthfully she was great and was such a hard worker."
2,"Mediocre food, slow service... My wife and I went to lunch and it took forever to get a cheeseburger and a salad."
2,I came in to get a nail repair since all of a sudden my nail is cracking when it's a month old set but was told that they only had one nail tech that does acrylic and I'd have to make an appt which was an upset bc a Saturday is the busiest day. So I left to get it repaired from another nail salon and now my other nails are cracking. This is acrylic so I'm beyond confused at why they are cracking in the corners. I love this salon but I don't intend to spend all my off days getting my nails repaired. So now I'm back at square one on the hunt for a new nail salon and I'm super sad about it. I initially gave this salon 4 or 5 stars but the 2 star update is for the inconvenience....
2,"Understaffed leads to horrible service on a busy weekend morning. Good was average, but it's breakfast so tough to screw up. The only thing reminiscent of Iowa is the decorations, the employees and service are a far cry from ""Midwest""."
2,"My husband likes to find what he calls ""quirky"" places to go to for dinner for his birthday. He picked The Iowa Cafe this year, probably because he's from Iowa. He had the all you can eat fish and said the fish was pretty good, fries were terrible. I made the mistake of ordering their turkey sandwich, which, according to the menu, was supposed to be ""special"". It was not. It was turkey lunch meat and the bread was stale. I could only manage to eat 1/2. It would have cost me probably $1.00 to make this at home but it was $8.00 there. And yes, the fries were awful. Tasted like elementary school food. We didn't try the pie, which I hear is very good. I will also say the wait staff was friendly, but a little slow. I doubt we will go there again. And for sure...don't anyone order the turkey sandwich!"
2,"I feel robbed. 42cents an ounce? Did you forget we are in a recession?

There is nothing special about 100,000th frozen yogurt joint that's popped up in north Glendale. You would think that with Yumberi, YogurtPlace, Jujiberri, they would at least try to competitively price their sub-par yogurt. 

I paid over $4 for my less than half full, topping-less fro-yo and I learned my lesson. I've tasted better at Costco's food court (and paid a hell of a lost less)."
2,"Normally, I don't give a business a second chance after reviews similar to what I left for Sanfratello's.  However, I decided to give them a second chance simply because they were closer than my normal Rosati's.

The first thing is that it is not an easy place to find because it is literally buried in the mall. You really need your GPS to find the place.  But it is in the same lot as the Albertson's but closer to Warner than Lindsay.  Once you get there, you notice how small the place is (looks more designed for a takeout instead of dining in like their parent store in Tinley Park, IL).  You do have outdoor seating but that's even small.

One thing I found interesting is how quick they had a pan pizza ready.  I am accustomed to waiting 45 minutes.  They had my pizza ready in 25-30 minutes.

When I got the pizza, I was kind of taken aback because the container looked kind of small.  In fact, it almost reminded me of a personal pan pizza in physical size.  I even thought it was going to be a square pizza because of the rectangular container.

After taking the first bite, I saw that Sanfratello's uses the patty sausage similar to Pizzeria Uno and Due back in Chicago. With some of the crumbled sausage I have had, you do taste the seasonings through the meat.  In this case, I did not.  It did not have the full-bodied flavor I am accustomed to when eating a Chicago pizza.  

The second thing I noticed was the crust itself.  I have to admit I was skeptical that it would be cooked thoroughly because of the short time.  However, that concern was squelched.  However, I am also accustomed to a buttery crust.  This crust was not buttery and even the tops were burned in spots.  

Third was the tomato sauce. The sauce, like the sausage, was missing critical seasonings that provide the usual flavor explosions I am accustomed to with Chicago pizza.  Additionally, I did detect a bit of sweetness with the sauce which is abnormal.

All in all, I would say it's not a bad pizza but this former Chicagoan says it needs a few things that will turn it into a serious Rosati's competitor."
2,Well pretty disappointing as the pizza was just ok and way over priced. Please note there is no seating and no beer or wine. Did not expect take out only based on reviews in Arizona Republic.  Doubt that it will last very long at $35-45 per pie! Try it before it closes.
2,"Garbage.

I went to this place a few years ago and really enjoyed it.  The food was excellent diner food and I was especially fond of their homemade corned beef hash.  If I would have reviewed it a year ago it would have been 4 stars.... but something has changed.  I visited again a week ago with a serious craving for corned beef hash.  Unfortunately, everything was different, and in a bad way.  It wasn't even the same recipes.  My dining partner's omelet wasn't anything to brag about either.  We will not be returning."
2,"2.5 stars.

We love eating our chicago food. We kept wanting to try this joint. We ordered over the phone for carry out. We were told 30 mins. We ordered a small pan which is what they call a deep dish pie. Cost for 10"" cheese was $14.29 enough for two adults. The best part of this place was their service. Pizza was ready 30 mins after placing order.

The pizza was okay. The better part was the crust, although their try to be cute angled pizza boxes smashed a slice. Small boxes only good for thin crust.

The sauce had a hint of tasting and reminding us of Campbell's Tomato Soup. The firmness of the crust was spot on. It seemed odd the deep dish pizza was cut like a thin pizza (thin pizza squares are normal for Chicago). Deep dish should have big angled slices where every slice has crossed with it. That is how the majority authentic Chicago places cut theirs ie, (Gino's East, lou malnatis, UNOs, & Giordano's).

A deep dish style pizza inherently means it should have a lot of cheese. Well they don't give you much! See picture. In the end i would not get the deep dish ""pan"" pizza again. Not sure if i would even go back to try the thin. So far Buddyz in Queen Creek or Rosati's has been our fav for deep dish."
2,We had been looking forward to trying this place because of all the hype and well because we enjoy pizza! We try to support our Gilbert businesses.  Ordered over the phone and picked up the pizza. Interesting box  ordered thin crust pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni    First impression looks like canned mushrooms and tastes like it. Pepperoni was decent. Now the make or break moment - the crust. Blech. Tastes like frozen pizza crust  bummer. Sauce needs seasoning. Expensive  pizza that just doesn't cut it. Too bad
2,"No vegetarian soup selection?  Water was awful...unfiltered Berea water.  Undrinkable.  Hot chocolate served in a cheapie styrofoam cup worthy of McDonalds.  Quesidillas was good, but need a soup or something...oh, no vegetarian soups. Popular place...service a bit slow. Baker was served on a plate way to small...tasted good.  Meh, I've experienced better."
2,Not the best pizza I've had.  Definitely not worth the price. Be sure to ask what your total cost will be for the entire pizza with toppings included.  I was really hoping it would be better.
2,"The flavors were okay, tasted like any other yogurt shop I've had. 
It was clean but not as clean as everyone was bragging on here. The thing that I didn't like about the place is the girls that working their weren't really friendly, they act like they didn't like their job. When my boyfriend and I walked in to the shop, the girl was getting her own yogurt. And acted like it was so rude of us to interupt her. None of the girls had uniforms on, nor aprons on so it was hard to tell who was, and wasn't working. Anyhoo, when we cashed out, I just couldn't believe that it was almost 11 dollars. .42 cents per ounce is kind of a lot. When we were about to leave another girl asked me if I was ready to be rang up and I said we already paid for it. And she kept on insicting that we didn't pay for it. So I had to argue with her about it until she asked another employee if we were telling the truth. Its kind of irritating when I had the recipet in my hand too, about to show her.
I'm definitely not going there ever again."
2,"First time guest and was looking forward to good Chicago style pizza. Ordered take-out with a half cheese, have Hawaiian thin crust. Good price.  The crust was excellent and spot on. I didn't see any sauce and the pizza was flavorless. It seemed like it was painted on with a brush. We'll give it another try but will order the deep dish Papa Joe's specialty pizza next time."
2,"I thought I would give this place a try regardless of the reviews I have read,  I live right around the corner from this spot and I will say there are a bunch of great breakfast spots in the area so you really need to step it up to compete.

The service was good,  and when you walk in you get a nice mid west diner vibe.   But aside from that I didn't really enjoy anything.  One of my pet peeves is not brewing your own ice tea,  ice tea from a fountain is terrible, which is what I got from here.   I ordered the country fried steak with eggs and country fries (crispy).  The country fried steak seemed to be pre frozen and the gravy was so salty I wasn't able to eat it.  I don't think food is made from scratch at all.   The potatoes were just sliced and deep fried which were fine but not crispy like I ordered.  

Overall they need to really work on the food,  unless I hear they do a overhaul on the menu I don't think I would come back which is too bad because the atmosphere is somewhere I could definitely see myself hanging out for a bit in the morning to do some work."
2,"FIrst, no seating? Didn't know that from the AZ Republic. Going in it was confusing. No one, customers or two girls behind the counter knew what was up. Finally was asked what I wanted and the cashier immediately turns around and talks to another employee then turns back and asks again what I wanted. How rude. Pizza was ok, no more. There are many places in Gilbert that are better, and some worse, to be sure. It was way over-priced. Opening jitters I can accept, and I might try them again - but the service had better really improve. 
I don't know why everyone thinks everything from Chicago is so great. It's not. It's a filthy crime-ridden city. There are some fine restaurants, but so what? There are a number of places in town that seem to think that the only way to compete is to claim it's a Chicago tradition: Barro's, Salerno's, Nello's and now this. Besides, Geno's NY style is just as good and a heck of a lot cheaper."
2,"This review will most likely echo the thoughts of the other reviews for this place. Overall, good food, lousy service.

Saturday mornings are always busy at diners and brunch places, but Perk-Cup felt empty of staff to clear tables and seat patrons. This was an overall theme to the dining experience which was filled with long waits for food, and to pick up the check (i was given my check mid meal...and am still waiting currently to be cashed out...almost 7 minutes now). The Garden Vegetable Baker was a good size portion of eggs, veggies, cheese, and hash brown with a side of toast.

If you're work on your patience, please visit. I certainly had plenty of time to practice my mindfulness of waiting, as well as check emails and social media. Speed up the service and this place will be great."
2,"I know that when meeting with doctors you should not expect to be seen at appointment time. I get it. Things come up. However waiting 1.5-2 hours is a bit much. This is consistent with any appointment made after the first appointment in the morning. It would not be bad, if they would call and let you know before you sit there for that long, but this is not the case. I see Dr. Wolfe who is brilliant and really cares for her patients, but the other things are just concerning. I had a prescription for a new glucose meter with new strips. I assumed it was called in, since they went out of the way to find out who was my pharmacy. Then I never got a call from the pharmacy. I checked the pharmacy nothing called in. Called the office. Got the run around. FINALLY was able to get the glucose meter called in. NO STRIPS. After 2 more calls I was able to get that ordered. Should not be this difficult. I asked for a change in metformin, again Dr. Wolfe took all the notes and told me it would be done. Still has not changed. I am at the point I will look for another doctor. Shame because she is just right there, but this is too much work for me."
2,"We've eaten here several times, mostly because it's like five minutes away.  The food is pretty much average, though I do like the Farmer's Market English muffin sandwich.  After today, we will probably not be going back.  Though it really wasn't that busy, it took just over half an hour to get served.  Dishes were coming out of the kitchen about eight minutes apart, and when ours was finally brought out, we asked the waitress if there was only one cook in the kitchen, and she said, no, there were two, but one of them was new.  Poor planning on their part means we were sitting there hungry for way too long.  It is very clean and bright, but very wide open and not very cozy.  The food is passable, so if you don't mind mediocre food and slow service, this is the place for you.  Also, they only offer a limited menu on Sunday mornings, since they have the breakfast buffet then, so we haven't gone back there on a Sunday since we found that out........and now we won't be going back there at all."
2,Ordered a small and large pizza and it was 44.00. The pizza was salty with very little meat or pineapple or flavor.  We were hopping for awesome pizza and were very disappointed. Will not recommend nor will we be back. Staff was nice though.
2,"First time trying this place. Just picked up a large thin crust pizza. My kids wanted different toppings so we asked to split up so we wouldn't have to pay for 6 toppings. Our ""large"" thin crust pizza started at $19 and added up to $29 when we paid the bill. Even if it had been half the price, the pizza was no better than a Tombstone. I wish I had been there to pick up instead of my husband - even if it was good - I would have told them to keep it for $27+tax. 
Never going back"
2,"Have been going to the Iowa Café both old & new location since we bought our little house in Mesa a few years ago. Being a homegrown Iowa girl I knew I would love the things on their menu. Of course I gravitated immediately to the loose meat sandwiches and the pork tenderloin.  We stopped in today and were seated at a booth. It appeared as if the old saying of ""when the cats away the mice will play"" was in effect this afternoon. There appeared to be a lot of Horsing around, kidding around, and not much waiting on the customers.  Had to ask for silverware for our table. When my husband and I both placed an order for a loose meat and french fries and a tenderloin to share, I got mine but he did not get his & the waitress said she misunderstood and hadn't put an order in for him.  Had to flag down the waitress multiple times to get a refill on our drinks. The big disappointment though was the loose meat sandwich it was so dry that it was almost not edible and in fact my husband and I both left half of it. I also felt the tenderloin was somewhat overcooked but it was edible. Very disappointed in my Iowa Café as I have always considered it a Little home away from home but this is actually the second time I have felt that their food was not up to par."
2,"This is the 2nd time I've been to this place. The first time was in their old location and we had a pretty bad experience and then we went again since they've moved and not much else has changed.

Welcome to death's waiting room ladies and gentleman! (hold for trumpets)

First of all this place is always packed so prepare to wait to sit.  Once seated expect to continue to wait forever for your food. We decided to sit at the breakfast bar where you have full access to the kitchen window, this was probably the best part of our experience - talk about entertainment. The waitresses are constantly stressed and do they bitch and moan- totally unprofessional.   After about 30 min. of watching ""the kitchen window movie"" we realized that we still hadn't gotten our food (we ordered simple dishes: 2 egg/hashbrowns  and I got a side of cinnamon bun french toast).  

The person sitting next to us who came in long after was already eating.  When I asked what the deal was she said his meal was super simple that's why he got his before us. ""You two ordered omeletes right?"" Umm no we didn't...oh and  wait, stop, hold up...let me get this straight so people who order biscuits and gravy and french toast get to eat before people who order eggs and french toast? Well ok I'll make sure to get that next time then! Now that we know the secret our experience should be much better.

We finally got our food after 40 min and it was wrong.  (boo! I'm starving!)   After going through all of that the food was just ok. The homefries are good but the rest was sub par.  The ""homemade"" cinnamon roll they used for the french toast was chewy and dry and the ham my husband ordered looked a lot like spam meat to me.  After all the waiting and drama this place just isn't worth it.  

I should note that our waitress was very nice and did a pretty good job even though she was slammed but I bet it was b/c we were literally  sitting in her face at the breakfast bar and even in that location we never got a refill on our waters or coffee...ok so never mind she wasn't good either.  She did comp some of my meal which was a nice gesture though I would have demanded that if she didn't offer anyway.

Additional Tip: For all you omelete eaters out there, they cook them then microwave them before they're served. I'm really not a fan of microwaved eggs so I thought I'd pass that nugget along.  Sitting in front of the Kitchen window can certainly be enlightening...and gross."
2,"Sorry guys, this place was a significant letdown for us.

My wife and i went a few weeks back, to celebrate her birthday.  We were in the mood for appetizers and wings and had heard good things about the place.  In addition to a few drinks, we ordered three menu items: potato twisters, salad, wings.

A server had passed us by with a couple of Long Island Ice Tea's that looked good, so we decided to give them a try.  Alcohol content was fine, but there were super, syrupy sweet making it hard to find them refreshing.

The potato twisters are kind of like a nacho platter made with a base of curly potatoes (not really fries exactly) covered with cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, etc.  The potatoes had a burnt oil taste making them less than appealing.

The salad we split was quite good, covered in a tangy (almost zippy) gorgonzola vinaigrette dressing and a nice selection of veggies.

Lastly was the wings, which we ordered buffalo style.  Two issues there...not enough sauce, and some of the wings were so large that they were underdone in the center.

Not the meal we were hoping for, maybe it was just an off night?"
2,"I have been seeing one of their massage therapists. He is great. These are not soft relaxing fall asleep massages. They are going your sore muscles and break apart the fluids eye watering kind. I always hurt the next day but feel amazing after. So I am sorry to have leave a less than kind review. 

Their front desk is horrid. I have never seen a group of people less welcoming. Even though there was 3 of them behind the desk and I was only the second person there they just ignore you. No hello. No nothing. You sign in and they just act like you don't exist. The last couple times two ladies were having an argument with each other. It is just weird. Your front desk sets the mood for the whole appointment and the mood they set seems to me ""sit down, shut up and we will deal with you when we want to."""
2,"The food was OK. Definitely reasonable, cheap prices and large portions. I ordered an omelette and a pancake which were both decent. Unfortunately, the service was not so good. I was greeted by someone who was hesitant to seat me. She informed me that their credit card machine was broken so I had to pay in cash.. No big deal. My server Jen was terrible though. She looked miserable and was sitting down at a table most of the time. She dropped my water off and didn't come back to take my food order. I waited for almost 10 minutes before waving down another server to take my order. Instead of that server coming over, she yelled to someone else ""isn't that Jen's table?"" And I had to wait until they could get Jen to come back to my table. After I completed my meal, I asked Jen for my check to which she replied ""I don't know what I can do about that, our computers are down so I don't know how to get you your check."" I waited for over 30 minutes and still had yet to receive my check. Jen hadn't come back to my table since to keep my updated. She has horrible service, horrible personality and a terrible attitude. 

Don't waste your time here. You can get a better breakfast experience at almost any other breakfast spot."
2,"Pizza quality is just okay. There is something weird tasting about the thin crust, it taste almost store bought. Mozzarella sticks were microwaved and almost inedible. Whoever it was on the phone that took my order didn't really know what he was doing. The kid that delivered the pizza handed me the food and the receipt at the same time expecting me to sign the receipt with no hands... He forgot his pen... Had to go get one of my own pens. All in all... for one large pizza and mozzarella sticks for 40 bucks... naahhh."
2,"Ordered large pan cheese ""deep dish"" & cheese raviolis.  Was told there would be a 25 min. wait so I went back home.  When I returned there were at least 8 people crowded inside waiting for their orders.  Took another 5 minutes to get someone to tbe counter to get my name & then waited 10 more minutes for anyone to come back.  While I was waiting I witnessed a customer complaining that his order came w/sausage rather than pepperoni.  Young staff had no idea how to desl w/it & kept running back to a manager that was trying to sort out a delivery problem.  Also witnessed another young employee hang up on a phone order the manager was taking.  Employee didn't know how to work the phone.  Bottom line...pizza was good, but overpriced; service was lackluster except for an overworked unsupported manager;  need better trained employees at counter & phone with customer service skills."
2,"This place is quite close to my house and very convenient for me.  The couple of times I've been there, the service has been great.  Unfortunately I can't say much good about the food I've had from Sanfratello's.  First thing I got there was the chicken parm sandwich for lunch.  At best it was OK.. Mostly bread with nuclear hot chicken and sauce.  Not sure if it was microwaved, but thought it was just hot and bland.  

2nd time I went there was months later.. Thought I'd give the pizza a try.  I had considered it for quite a long time, but always shy'd away as it is considerably more expensive than most other places around here.  Ordered over phone for pickup.. The girl who answered was very nice and energetic.  Picked up in 25 minutes.  First impressions were good.. Smelled good.. Toppings seemed fresh.  Thin crust was actually a bit thicker than most Chicago style pizzas I'd enjoyed before, but it was still crispy and delicious.. Just a bit thicker.  Overall it was the pizza was just OK, but there was just something funky about the taste of the pizza to me.  Not sure if its a cheese I'm not used to or of the sauce was different than what I like.  

I won't say that it wasn't good.. Just not for my taste.  Other people seem to really like it.. I'd say give it a try and judge for yourself.  I will say that it is super expensive relative to other places in the area.  I got a medium thin crust with 2 toppings for over $20 for pickup.  Had I gotten a large it would have been closer to $30 or more.    

I can't agree with the people who say that papa johns or pizza hut is better quality.. But the value for those places are for sure.. Apples and oranges in this case.  

I also don't agree with the reviewer that this isn't a safe place because someone posted a photo in their review with a gun.  First of all.. the receipt clearly says **PICK UP**.  So I highly doubt the person had their gun out on the counter in the restaurant.  Also.. This is Arizona.  People open carry firearms here all the time.. People conceal carry even more as you don't even need a permit here.  With that said..  I also certainly don't agree with the other reviewer's choice in flashing their gun around on a Yelp review of a pizza parlor though either."
2,"Given the esteem I have for Lebanese Cuisine this place was a real disappointment . I got a beef shawerma which in typical Lebanese style was fashioned more like a grilled burrito instead of the typical pita bread fare that many of us are use too. I am not averse to this style of shawerma but given the reviews I was expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. 

Were it not for the appetizers I would have probably given this place at least three stars. I tried the kibbeh, hummus, pickled turnips, and grape leaves. All were fairly mediocre. However, the grape leaves were the nail in their coffin. They told us they made the grape leaves themselves but as it turned out they had come straight from their canned goods aisle. I know this because over the years I have had the opportunity to eat both fresh and canned grape leaves and trust me the stuff on our plate had come from a can. I don't have a problem with canned grape leaves but at least be honest as to their origins before making me pay top dollar for them.

In summary, the next time you go shopping at Baiz, after the checkout head for the parking lot."
2,"I tried this joint again. Food is highly subjective thing. Their sauce is hard to describe, but I do tend to agree with others that say it tastes a little like Campbell's tomato soup. I threw out most of my order tonight (pizza and chicken parm), it just wasn't for me. I feel like these folks do achieve a decent level of quality, but whether or not you like the recipes - you'll have to decide for yourself. Prices are too high for what you get. Delivery charge was $4 - rather high too."
2,"Wife is from Chicago and loves deep dish so we thought we'd try it out. We ordered a large pan pizza (their version of deep dish) with sausage. Sausage patty covered the inside pieces of the pizza but the outer pieces not so much. Tasted good but honestly, Rosati's deep dish has them beat hands down. We were disappointed and won't be going back."
2,The billing department does not seem to be adequate. They keep resubmitting the same claims over and over to the insurance company a year later! They have already been paid!

This grocery-slash-eatery reminds me more of Cafe Istanbul in terms of its lighter traffic than that of Haji-Baba's eatery and market.  Some of the items on the shelves had a light blanket of dust...
Ordered the beef kabob (2 pcs.) platter, with lettuce, onions, hummus, and two pitas.  The kabobs were tasty, even though they were slightly overdone in temperature.  Liked the pitas, disliked the hummus.  I couldn't taste any flavors from the chickpeas, tahini, or spices.  Just that of an oil I couldn't even place its origin.  As I was finishing up the kabobs and pita, I spied two young men enjoying their beef shawarmas, so I ordered one to-go.  Got into my car and couldn't wait to have a bite...  I should've gone with my first choice (of beef shawarma)- this was a very tasty selection.  I'd come back to order it again.

I also enjoyed a Lebanese baked dessert, almost cake-like, with two distinct layers- slightly sweet cheese, reminiscent of dried-out ricotta and cream cheese, on the bottom and golden-orange wheat (semolina?), topped with crushed pistachios.  A side sauce dish of simple syrup accompanied the dessert.  I had asked the woman behind the counter two times what the dish was called, and she didn't sound too confident in telling me that she knew it as ""shmeer.""  (It's the closest thing I could decipher.  Perhaps ""shmeed"" might be a better word... can anyone help me?)  The ff. is the closest image I found to what I think I had.  (If so, then my dessert was missing the ashtar topping, a type of clotted cream, pictured below.)  The dessert I bought doesn't even come close to approaching the wow factor of this link's image... Kanefe/Knefeh.

2,Good food but took an hour and half just to get seated and eat breakfast. Service was slow and they were understaffed.
2,"I've been here many times for breakfast. I will not go back. They don't sell newspapers. I ask for one every time I go there.... they don't get the hint. Also, I want real butter with my toast and they don't have it. And they act 'put out' when I ask for it. Tired of being treated like a villain when show I in interest in ingredients. Also servers have to many nose rings and tatoos to stimulate my appetite. Sorry but I'll go to a chain restaurant next time. At least I can expect bad, unhealthy food there."
2,"I came here based on the Yelp reviews and was not impressed. My cleaning was great but then after waiting for the dentist who I assumed was Dr Dee, another female dentist came in and proceeded to tell me I needed $2600 in dental work. 
It took me by surprise since after my last cleaning at a different dentist I didn't need any work. The dentist that had seen me popped in from a different room where she was doing a procedure, she seemed very rushed and it definitely wasn't a great first impression. 
I'm making an appointment elsewhere for a second opinion and can tell you I won't be coming back here."
2,"I decided to try this place for the first time this morning with a friend. 
Got seated right away great... Water and coffee right after great. Ordered and food served quickly, Awesome, then it all goes downhill from there as the restaurant starts to fill up. 
My friends food was served without the bread so we asked for the bread which was delivered when she basically finished her meal, no apology for that, never was our coffee or water refilled. Tables were all getting seated and not getting any attention, people sitting and waiting as they keep seating and filling up the restaurant. 
Saw a table sit and wait and finally walked out. Some tables were waiting for 15 minutes till coffee was even offered. 
Just a few suggestions. 
1. Having two waitresses on a busy Sunday morning not a smart choice. 
2. Waitresses may want to have a more friendly attitude. 

The food was great just a big disappointment in service. I used to waitress and I know it's not easy but you know Sunday's get busy so have another server on. Would make a huge difference. 
Not sure if I will go back at this point honestly. 

Disappointed customer"
2,"Worst service for any type of business. I didn't get a chance to get my pizza !! I called in an order and the teen taking the call didn't give me a time. Okay. I show up 45 min later and I thought I was at a concert. No organization and people everywhere. After 15 minutes waiting is a cluttered lobby and making no head way to the counter I decided to go outside and call. Call went to voicemail 3 times. They decided to answer on the 4 call. I was very polite and didn't let my frustration show. I simply asked when my pizza would be ready. The teen hung up on me.  Real nice. Took my family elsewhere. Gave this place 2 stars because the pizza smelled good :-))
I was there January 23 @ 6 pm.  Joel and last 4 phone #1665."
2,"What friendly happy people....Love the customer service.

The food was not great, matter of fact it was a bit disappointing.  However times are tough and these people are doing what they can to provide cheap filling food.

I had the breaded pork special and it was average.  Pies were well received and the smiles kept coming all night.   I will try this place again but I will stick with the breakfast menu that is served all day."
2,Very mediocre and overpriced. I'm not getting all the rave reviews at all. My husband did carry out and was totally annoyed and the bad service.
2,"First Time here  because of great review and my friend recommended me the place . Now I just received my pedicure and this is the worst pedicure I still got dead skin on my feet .  From NOT scrubbing well enough . I don't like to complain much so I didn't say much .  This is my first and last time coming here. Waste of my money and driving 45 min 

The decor and inside are fabulous . The product they use are great product . Overall everything was good beside my pedicure and customer service .

Just because it did not worked out for me does not mean it will not work out for other customer . Try it yourself and see .

I would give it a second chance but not after the way I was treated . 



...UPDATE...... I came in for a full set and pedicure . The price are good prices not bad at all . Now I talk to a sir . I'm not sure about his name or if he is an owner but he asked me to leave because of the review  and telling me he is not comfortable doing my full set based on what I said .  Now as an owner the first thing you do is asked to see the problem , take criticism and try to resolve the issue and make the service Great. I though that was what a business and customer service was about .He failed to do that but he did explain well to me about a few things I didn't know ( which I appreciate and understand . I was raised well so of course I left with no fuss . Bad experience for me . Who knows . maybe I was too Black to be service and not worth fixing the problem . I do hope in the future you do a better a job at helping your customer . Oh and after I left I went and sat in the lobby .... i heard them talking about me with other customers ( not good customer  service .. just rude ) it didn't bother me but it was rude . I was so excited to finally have a place I can come to and get good service with good product ."
2,"This place could be better if they improved their sauce and made some other minor improvements. We got a thin crust with onions, mushrooms, sausage and green peppers. At first I thought their were artichokes on the pizza since the mushrooms were yellow. They use canned mushrooms, yuck. The peppers were very soft so I'm guessing they pre-cook them. The onions were non-existent until I dug around and found a few of them. The cheese and crust were good. So if they would use fresh veggies and add some seasoning to the sauce and kick up
the sausage  the pizza would be a lot better. We also had a pan pizza which my husband said was ok but again the sauce has no flavor and there wasn't enough cheese. We also had the wings. They were too spicy for my taste but my husband thought they were great."
2,"For those who do not know South Side of Chicago means New York (thin crust) style pizza. I am very disappointed that this place pushed thin crusted pizza as their staple on the menu. Chicago is known for deep pan pizza and this is disappointing that they cannot carry on the tradition. Arizona has too many New York pizza options and to have another one with Chicago on the name is disappointing. 

The sauce is fantastic but that is the only thing I was pleased with. I can understand the issues with the help but yet you boast that you have been in business since 1969 so one would think you would know how to start in a new location. 

Nello's is as close to Chicago style pizza in Arizona so I guess they will have to do until I can make trips back to Chi-town and if I want New York pizza (which is rare) I will go to NYPD since they are closer to the house. 

Sorry guys but unless things change I won't be back soon."
2,"Best not to go close to closing. We arrived 1/2 hour before closing and were the only patrons. They rushed us through ordering & eating. The turkey sandwich was unremarkable.  No garnish,  looked naked on the large plate all by itself. The website's hours aren't correct."
2,The spaghetti with meat sauce I had was reminiscent of something you got from a supermarket deli.The sauce tasted blander than bland! And there was not nearly enough of it on the pasta. It was on the dry side. I tried one of their pizzas but was not too thrilled with it. Then again I'm a big fan of New York style versus Chicago.
2,"I used to come here when it first opened and the service was great! Always someone to help with samples and cleaning the toppings bar. Now it's as though no one works there when I go in. Last time I was in was around 6pm on a Thursday so it was fairly busy and the cashier Kim was too busy in the back to help with samples (obviously they have to serve them and it's not add serve for samples) and this Kim woman only came out to ring me up say my total and rush to the back. Worst customer service. I have been disappointed the past few times and when I go in she's always working and always is moping around and provides horrible customer service.

Love the yogurt and toppings but I'll go somewhere else next time and drive out of my way so I can get better customer service (:"
2,"We had high hope's for this, but were disappointed. The service was good,the deep dish dough/crust was great but the sauce was TERRIBLE!! The sauce ruined a good pizza. We could tell the sauce was a canned base. For the price we were not expecting a sauce that taste like preservatives and a can tomato soup flavor. We also ordered hot wings and they had no real kick for a hot wing and they were soggy. We ordered them extra crispy but still came out soggy and mild.  I hate giving a bad review but for the price we can get better pizza and wings."
2,"I like to try new pizza places and usually just about everything I order is pretty tasty..However,when I made my online order with Sanfratello's, the order was pretty accurate except for not getting the extra sauce I paid for..my order was a large ham and pinapple thin crust pizza, a caesar salad and fried zucchini......the salad was fresh enough but not at all cold and the zucchini and pizza, honestly tasted like it was more than a day old and reheated...I also was given a free desert if my order amount came to $30 or more..the desert was sugar fritz with chocolate sause, also tasted very old....very disappointed and won't be ordering from this restaurant again..."
2,"The service is typically great and my pedicures are always on point. My last pedicure I decided to get my SnS aka dip service done here. It hasn't been a full week and my nails are starting to separate, my middle finger popped up and my nail is green. I've been getting my nails done since I was a kid and have never had my nails have any issue. I'm almost anxious to take the remaining nails off. I'm really disappointed as I liked this place a lot, but I can't have my nails changing color."
2,"I want to rate this place higher, but can't bring myself to do it. I really like the bar, the big screens, good beer selection (but no PBR), very clean. The service sucks. Went on a Tues nite about 7. Waited longer than I should have to order a beer, the barmaid was busy b.s.ing with a waitress, and the bartender was busy. -1. They have Keno. Bar owners may say it doesn't take away from business, but iot does. -2. The food. They were out of the $4 tacos, so I ordered the $8 Tiujuanna(?) tacos. Basically chicken tacos, cold, overpriced. -3. Finally got my bill and he saw me put up my card. Waited almost 10 min. before the barmaid finally took it. Almost dined n dashed. Didn't leave much of tip (I'm one of those people who tip based on service, not obligation or guilt)."
2,"Good food and atmosphere, but make sure allow for a long meal. They screwed up our name on the wait list, wait time was not what we were told, excessive wait time to place order, had to ask for ordered drinks 2 times, excessive wait time for food (25 mins), then it took another 20-25 mins to pay the bill.  Breakfast was good, but not worth all the screw ups and no apologies!"
2,"Waited over an hour for my small pizza to be delivered, only to be disappointed.  The ingredients seemed pretty fresh, but kinda reminded me of trying to make pizza at home that just tastes completely ""off"" from any of your favorite pizza places.  I get that this is a Chicago place, but even still, I've had Chicago-style that I thought was much better from other spots.  Combine all of that with the high price for what I got and I'll choose someplace else next time (even Papa J's, etc)."
2,"Perk Cup Cafe recently opened its doors (about 3 months now) in a tucked away newly opened strip of shops in Berea, OH.   Their offering is primarily the breakfast, brunch, & lunch crowd.  The interior is very well planned out, spacious, complete with rearrangable tables as well as a fireplace with a nook for more cozy seating.    Check out the pictures I uploaded. They even boast a drive-through, which does not yet seem to be open.

Although touting to be a breakfast stop, Perk Cup Cafe by no means is a grab-and-go place.  The service is relatively slow, although not impolite.  The slowness is clearly evident from the ordering process through the table service.  So my conclusion of Perk Cup is to either go for a sit-down breakfast, brunch or lunch time.  Due to its recent opening, lunch time is not very busy during the weekdays.

Food menu at Perk Cup, offers breakfast sandwiches, other standard breakfast items like Granola, Yoghurt.  the coffee selection are the standard 4 or 5 flavors for a breakfast stop.  For lunch crowd the items choices include Salads to light standard cold or panini sandwiches.  The food items and quality are nothing to 'write home about', they are the standard tasting.  Perk Cup does not seem to offer any niche or specialty items when it comes to food. 

If you are located in or visiting Berea,  and need a spacious and un-crowded place for a breakfast or lunch meeting, Perk Cup might just be a good consideration."
2,"Extremely racist. If you're not white, mostly middle age, or have kids, they can be a little rude, Rarely smile, and act like they hate their lives for serving you a scoop! and the manager does not listen to any kind of complain- that's if he's there."
2,"Quite honestly their selection is disappointing and their loyalty system has been out of commission for going on two months. When I have asked 2 different cashiers when it was coming back (the sign on the cash register put up in January says their system is backed up and they need to restore it) I was told they didn't know. Between this and the lack of selection, I will be driving to Yogurtini in NorTerra."
2,"The first 3 times I came here they were great. Pooh really did an amazing job helping me start my journey of healthy nails by taking her time and removing my acrylic etc...
This last time was hoooorrible! I started with a pedi and wanted white tips. The woman started and I could tell she was struggling (I had to ask her multiple times to fix the white tip)  so I asked her to remove this polish and just paint one solid color, I didn't want to continue telling her how to do her job. Anyways, my toe nails were in great condition from previous jobs (by Pooh) but after she was done I was literally almost about to cry because they were completely messed up. They looked atrocious. (See pictures) To top it off, the woman rushed my manicure and even had another lady help do one hand. Therefore I received a different mani for each hand. And received NO cuticle oil. 
I expressed how I felt to the receptionist (not Becky) and she showed no sympathy. Her customer service skills needs improvement.
Overall, I might try again due to the previous times but I'm definitely not happy with my service. And at this moment would not recommend."
2,"We came here because this is the only breakfast place within 10 minutes of the airport, where our friend was staying. I was expecting an empty place, but surprisingly, a lot of people there on a Sunday morning at 9:45am. 

Food wise, it is your standard breakfast fare. Lunch was also served in the early morning as well. My bf got the chicken salad - had a bite, our clinic cafeteria made better chicken salad sandwiches with more flavor. It came with a side of chips. Nothing special, not worth paying $8 for it. I ordered the Sweet and Savory platter. Three small slices of bacon - on the plus side, they were not very greasy. Two eggs over easy - eggs were well done, but they are just eggs... Didn't appreciate the french toast and the eggs on the same plate, since it just made the egg yolk run over to the french toast, ketchup mixed with maple syrup, etc. Had the extra blackberry brandy sauce on the side for the french toast. I think the maple syrup tasted better. The sauce was on the sour side, not what I was expecting... 

Service... now this is where they get bumped from 3 stars down to 2. The whole place was full, so it was fine waiting 10-15 minutes for a table. However, when we got down to ordering, we ended up waiting almost 30 min for our food. This is very very simple and standard food. I cannot comprehend how 2 dishes of 2 eggs, bacon, french toast, and a chicken salad wrap could have taken that long... even if there was a whole dining room full. Should still have not taken that long. We did not get checked on once during our meal, except for like 1 minute after we got the food, before we even started eating, the waitress came by to ask us how we liked the food. After that, it took us 10 minutes to get a waitress to bring us our checks, and then another 10 minutes for them to bring the credit cards back. Overall, what should have been a 1 hour long breakfast got extended out to 2 hours. Ridiculous."
2,"Store is clean and toppings look yummy, BUT

The Tart flavor taste so bad , I've visited twice and both times it taste sour.

Please throw away bad yogurt."
2,"It's been about a year and a half since going to this dentist and finally decided to write a review. 

I'll start off with the positive, the dental hygienist is awesome, super thorough and friendly. The receptionists are also nice. The office is well kept and there is high tech equipment through out. This is where it ends....

If you like to feel like your going on a high pressure sales pitch for invisalign, teeth whitening and being told that you have way more issues than you really have then I recommend going here. Obviously this company gets some kick backs on invisalign, peridex, and their special anti-cavity tooth paste. 

I went and I got suckered into buying the anti-cavity toothpaste and the chlorhexidine rinse. When I asked if insurance covered it I was told no and don't worry I can get in right then and there because they sell it in office (how convenient). Fast forward to next week. My husband went in for a treatment and guess what spiel he received? That's right! He came home with alllll the goodies I received even after they knew he was my husband and I JUST received the same product the previous week (nice upsell). So now $60 each here we are. Luckily, he called and they allowed him to bring the products back with a full refund. However, this was the last straw because I was onto their tactics and knew they only cared about money and upselling any way possible. All trust was lost. 

We decided to move on and find another dentist. I called and let them know. For the past year I have been receiving calls weekly even after I told them to stop. I had to block their number on my phone! I'm still dodging the emails and snail mail though. 

Now here's the best part! I went to the dentist and this so called ""oral rinse"" that is not covered by insurance....it is! I just picked it up today....I paid $2.83 opposed to the 30-40ish they charged me in office! Hence, why I finally decided to write this review. I couldn't believe it. 

This company is here to swindle and con you into thinking you NEED products that are in office and not covered by insurance. They will harass you until no end through any means possible about coming in for your ""next appoint"" even when you yell them you have found another dentist. They WILL tell you that you need more work done than you need. They quoted me almost 2,500 after my insurance vs alllll my work completed and covered for only $600 out the door. 

Take my word, shop around, and don't fall for it. Your wallet will thank me later!"
2,"They advertise for their Sunday breakfast all the time so I tried it. The food was good once it got to us, which took long enough. However, the service was horrible and no one really seemed to care. 

The patio is very nice, however; so, my review may be different when I visit Rival's again in the evening."
2,"I was looking forward to some good Middle Eastern food when I went to Al-Hana and did not have a good experience.  Maybe the food used to be better, but it was not good when I went.

I ordered the Chicken Shawerma, and it was not good at all.  The chicken was over cooked and cut into little tiny pieces (mistake number one chef).  It was over salted and was not seasoned well at all (lot's of cury).  The rice was very very greasy???  Why would you want your rice to be greasy and your chicken dry?  The pita was fine, but that was out of a bag.

I didn't come here for the ambiance, and this in no way is reflective of my review, as I almost exclusively review on food quality and service standards.  But, there was a guy sitting next to me who kicked off his shoes and sat indian style with the bottoms of his gross dirty feet staring up at me.  When his food arrives he starts ripping apart his chicken legs with his hands and mixing them with his rice and lettuce and whatever else was on his plate.  Then he starts eating with his hands, shoveling the meat and rice mixture in his mouth a handful at a time.  Witnessing this did nothing to help my experience; but again, this is just what I experienced and not a reason for my rating of this restaurant.

I love Middle Eastern food and I hope this establishment can turn it around, as I want everyone to succeed if they work hard at something.  However, currently I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
2,"The ""new & improved"" Iowa Cafe leaves a lot to be desired.  The restaurant has moved from it's former location into an old vacant fast food drive-thru establishment (I believe it used to be an Arby's).  My husband and I have been on & off again customers over the years and have never had any major complaints about the wait times, food or service levels. After driving through the area a few weeks back, we noticed the new signage, ""Iowa Cafe,"" and we're both thinking, ""Cool, they're moving"" and we were excited to come back.  Well, with much disappointment I must say, our experience was sub-par at best, which is NOT at all what we were expecting.  We arrived, placed our name on the waiting list, which in all we maybe waited 10 mins (if that), so that was a thumbs up.  Then we were seated at a 2-top by the exit door, which looked like the space would best serve a newspaper rack and a couple of gum ball machines, rather than a spot to enjoy a meal (thumbs down).  We were seated by the owner and quickly greeted by the waitress who filled our drink order (2 coffees).  When she returned, we quickly ordered; my husband a 2 meat omelet and I ordered 1 pancake, 2 sausage links with 1 scrambled egg, nothing too complicated, right?  Wrong!  After finishing up our 2nd cup of coffee having waited over 20 minutes we began to wonder where our food was, just then an older couple was seated across from us in an equally poor spot.  (On a side note, when we were seated a young couple with a baby in a highchair were sitting in this spot, when the owner came by and moved them to another table stating that it is a fire hazard to seat anyone there). About 15 minutes later, the couple who was sat across from us received their food.  The older man quickly said, ""Have you folks received your food yet?""  We smiled and politely said, ""no, not yet.""  Then he said, "" you know we've been going to the Iowa cafe for over 30 years!""  And after a few minutes of chit-chat, we settled back into our tables.  Now, finishing our 4th cup of coffee, our wait time had surged to over 40 minutes.  We had a vet appointment for our dog at 1:45pm, it was now 1:05pm, not able to wait any longer and seeing no signs of our food, watching table after table receiving theirs, we finally flagged down our waitress and said, ""we never received our food, we've been waiting 45 mins!""  The waitress looked shocked (however, keep in mind she was filling our coffee cups the whole time and serving others around us whom she helped AFTER us)..  The waitress did do the right thing, she comped our coffees and didn't charge us for the food we never received.  At that point, we up and left even more hungry than we had come, but now had nothing in our tummies to offset our extreme coffee buzz.  This may have been an oversight, but having said nothing is worse than keeping us informed or admitting a mistake was made.  We will not be back."
2,"My Parents and I have been coming to this place for years. Especially before they changed their location (near/on McKellips Rd. & Recker). Today was the first worst service that my friend and I have received. Maybe the girl/hostess didn't intentionally try to give me and attitude, but I feel like there's a certain way to greet and speak to people when they enter a restaurant.

First off, I arrived before my friend got there. Since My Parents and I have always went there to eat breakfast, I talked up the place; saying it was one of the best places to have brunch. I got excited for him to try the food (since he's always down to try new hole-in-the-wall restaurants. He took an Uber from Tempe to this location; I told him he would not be sorry.

So when I arrived, the hostess/waitress with a good sized tattoo on her arm didn't really greet me. Only said ""One of you?"" I responded with ""Yeah, and there will be another person arriving."" She said ""Okay"" and walked away. I saw a few empty tables and wondered if I should have sat myself down, but I really didn't want to disregard the ""Please wait to be seated"" sign. So I kept my eyes on her to see if she would wave me over. 

She continued to assist customers that we already seated and I really didn't mind waiting. I just wished she would have said ""Please wait a minute"" or ""I'll seat you in just a second."" Then I wouldn't be left waiting or disappointed (I hate being brushed off). So I waited, watching her run herself around the restaurant.

She went back behind the counter and then walked out and rudely walked across in front of me with no ""Excuse me."" If we were vehicles and she ran a red light, I would have T-boned her. She was that close to me reaching for menus next to the counter that I was standing next to. I shook my head at her like ""Geez. I could have moved if you said 'Excuse me.'"" 

So she grabbed the menus and walked to a table booth area without saying anything. So I stood there watching her put the menus on the table, with her looking back at me like 'Duh, follow me.' At this point, I'm wondering if it's that hard to politely ask the customer to follow you to the next available table? I sat down with her saying nothing to me of course. 

I knew right then that if she was in fact going to be my waitress, I would request another one. So while I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I drank my first beverage brought by another waitress which I hoped would be better, but it seemed like she was being very forgetful. She forgot/lost the ticket that belong to the couple that were seated next to me. Then, I didn't pay it no mind.

When my friend arrived, we looked over the menu, and then our waitress arrived. She took down our beverages (including my second beverage) and order, we chatted for a good while until we both noticed that we never received our beverages. We would have flagged her down but she never came around our area until she brought our meals, including our missing beverages. It's not too big of a deal. We just noticed that we never got our beverages while we waited.

Overall, the food was good as always; my friend would agree. He didn't experience the rudeness upon my arrival, which is good because, he'd probably would never want to return if he got there before me. 

If they were new waitresses, they'd get a pass. But if you've been in the restaurant business for a couple weeks or months, please be a lot more polite, aware and acknowledge your customers. And also, communicate. Don't just walk off and ignore, but at the same time expect us people to catch on. You have to speak up and let us know what's going on. We don't run the place.

Next time, I expect better."
2,Good place to go when visiting your grandparents from the midwest.  grandma and grandpa will love it because the waitress knows exactly how grandpa likes his oatmeal!  You'll tolerate it because you see the waitress being nice to your grandparents.  Cinnamon rolls were pretty good!
2,"SLOW!!!! Kitchen was super slow. Waited 45 minutes for overpriced mediocre food. If you want to go somewhere and just sit there and forget what you're even doing, this is the place!"
2,Boooo to not letting me get my own samples. I was followed around the store as if I was going to steal something. I actually felt intimidated at a yogurt shop! I will not be returning.
2,"So disappointed. I stopped here with my mom while walking around the square. We came in from out of town to visit, but used used to hear so many great things about HoH when I lived in the area. Unfortunately those things were either a fluke or things have gone downhill. 

The decor is great. Very contemporary and the space is small but doesn't feel cramped. 

We each ordered a drink, both of which were tasty. I'd give compliments to the bartender or whomever was making drinks that day at lunchtime. The Medina Mule was definitely a repeat if I could bring myself to order more food there. 

Now we ordered a few rolls and sashimi. The rolls' names don't matter because the key here is none of the fish tasted fresh. I think the tuna sashimi was the only one that was decent. The rest of the food tasted just old. Also our server would have been notified but she didn't seem interested. We barely saw her and when we did she was gone as quickly as she arrived. 

Overall, I'd never recommend sushi here. Didn't have any of the entrees, but if the sushi is an indication of the pride in their work, I'd rather not. I probably won't return."
2,"I'd heard so much about the meatball sub that I was pretty excited to give it a go. Unfortunately it just ended up being this gargantuan salty deal that just didn't really bring anything to the table besides lots of salt. Maybe I was there on an off day but I wasn't impressed. The portion, as mentioned before, was redic. So, if you're feeding a high school football team or something maybe it's worth a stop."
2,"This place could be a 4 star experience if you like sushi and catch them on the right day.

It has the usual grub (I call it grub because it is quantity of mediocre mainstream Chinese food), also the fried chicken, french fries, and pizza.

What makes this place stand out is that they have a decent variety of seafood, especially the sashimi and sushi.  Warning: I have been twice and the quality and quantity of the sushi has varied immensely.  On the weekend you can find sashimi if you are lucky - I never saw any sashimi during the lunch on a weekday.

I agree with the other review on Yelp that your best bet is to buy sashimi by the pound and go home and make sushi.  That is a bit too intense for most people but my real point is that this place doesn't beat RuSan's when it comes to sushi, but RuSan's has no sashimi offered on the buffet.  You also rarely get yellowtail at RuSan's on the buffet.  Here the yellowtail can very widely in quality - one day I went and it was awful.  Another day I went and it was better than ok.

My review is so low for two reasons:
1) Inconsistency of quality of the food;
2) Inconsistency of availability of the food;

If you want to eat a lot of food and aren't picky then this place is fine, but you probably just want the absolute cheapest place to go.  I prefer the flavor of Indian buffet and mainly eat sushi at Chinese/Japanese/Random buffets.

I never tried the pizza and I never intend to.  I did make a concession and try the garlic toast - ok flavor but mushy and gross on the inside and dried hard on the edges.  It was cooked like a hot pocket: all wrong."
2,"Have been a long time happy customer of Hunan in Medina. In past they've been simply incredible but the new management team need some massive improvement to get them back to where they used to be.  There's a new guy that's supposedly the manager that follows the staff around looking for areas to correct their weaknesses instead of pitching in to help. I'm now waiting for my take out order placed over 40 minutes ago on way back from airport that was supposed to be ready in 15-20 minutes.  

I observed the manager reprimanding the very courteous hostess at the front counter saying she should quote at least 30 minutes for take out orders making it look like it was her fault.    They have a decent crowd but sushi bar was empty.   I'm really hoping the get back to where they were on the management team since they have usually been very good on putting together small orders in 15-20 minutes regardless of how busy they were. 


Edited portion - Once I arrived home and opened the sushi container, wasabi was nowhere to be found so adding to disappointment."
2,"Food was bland, but okay. Nothing wrong with it, just not great. There's no way they're using real maple syrup (or it's been really watered down).

 The real problem was the service. Just comically bad. Just sitting there waiting for coffee. Towards the end our waitress notices we're done and then disappears for 20 min. I really don't get it. 

Will never come back."
2,"Unfortunately I cannot contribute to the positive reviews this place has. 

To start positive, the atmosphere is very nice and set up well for an intimate meal or a place to meet with a group. In addition, everyone was pleasant that we interacted with. 

However, the looks and pleasantness are all a facade for a sub-par meal. I admit I am not a sushi eater so if that is what you are looking for then you should read other reviews. That being said, we did have an order of California rolls. While CA rolls is not the most flavorful dish (the avocado mutes them) these had no flavor and all you could taste was the seaweed wrap.

For our meals I had Mongolian Beef and my wife had the Happy Paradise (steak and scampi). The Mongolian beef was bad. While I am all for tender meat, this was mush. In addition, the sauce had an odd taste and tasted like it was stale (how is that possible?). Both my wife's steak and scampi were chewy (steak ordered medium).

For the prices of our meals, we expected so much more. I could have gotten better Mongolian beef at the take out place down the street and a better steak at Applebees for a third of the price."
2,"Good and Bad.  On a positive the food was excellent.  The negative, the greeting staff is horrible.  Upon entering we gave our last name which apparently was the wrong thing to do.  The gentlemen corrected us by telling us he needed a 1st name.  Really?  For a buzzer  a last name is not sufficient.  The young lady who then lead us to our table DID NOT speak one word!   We assumed when she started walking away with the menus that we were to follow her.  After seating us and still not speaking she basically shoved the menus 6 inches from our faces and walked away. A real charmer that gal."
2,"How are people saying this is the best pizza in Charlotte??? This restaurant is vastly overrated. I ordered a Hawaiian pizza, ad it came out with unbrowned chewy mozzarella, tasteless sauce, and forgettable crust. Not to mention the cook didn't core the pineapple. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the service wasn't bad. The pizza however... You might as well go to a cafeteria"
2,"You might be surprised to find out that I'm a fan of the dueling piano bar.  Unfortunately, not so much when it comes to Howl at the Moon.  Before I get to that, I will say that they have some sweet offers if you're into looking for them.

Currently on Yelp you can get two people in the door for free by showing the coupon (hint: use it).  If you use Foursquare, you can check in outside the door and get in for free (hint: if you forgot the Yelp coupon, use it).  If you're the mayor of the place, you can score a free drink (hint: if you can, use it).

With the economy the way it is, being able to get anything for free is awesome, and on that front, you have to like being able to get anything for free.  And throwing alcohol into the mix?  Definitely a bonus.

It's just a shame that the good news stops at the door.  Or the bar.

What is generally so entertaining about the dueling pianos falls completely flat here.  If you've ever been to a similar establishment (say Crocodile Rocks in Myrtle Beach), you have likely seen a couple of really talented performers who go for hours on their pianos - technically keyboards wedged into piano frames - and keep you going all night.

At Howl at the Moon you get something else entirely.  It's a couple of marginally talented musicians on generally the same keyboard concept, but there are other musicians as well (a drummer and guitarist), but no one can sing particularly well, none of them had much charisma and rather than keeping the energy going with singalongs that everyone knew (think Piano Man) they launched into songs that nearly no one could understand because of the volume of the music and after a couple of songs they would take a little break and do a dance like something from Coyote Ugly - even the bartenders and servers.  So you can't even get a drink to take away the pain.

That all means that instead of an intimate night spent hanging out and singing drinking songs with a hundred of your best buddies, you get something else entirely.

Probably the worst part of it was that the best tables in the house - those in the front - were all taken up by bachelorette parties.  Now I get that they are a business, and I'm sure those ladies spent loads of money, so I completely understand.  And it isn't that I have anything against bachelorette parties.  But to have six or seven large tables (actually four-tops pushed together to form 8- or 12-tops), taking up the bulk of the room, and relegating everyone else to second-class citizen status?  That's a bit much.

If I ever go back it's to hold _my_ bachelorette party.  Or at least to claim some free drinks so I can actually enjoy the place.  Or maybe both."
2,"disappointment....I was actually driving down McDowell Road looking for a Honduran place that I had heard good things about, saw this place, and decided to give it a go.  I wish I had kept driving.  I am a big fan of tortas, however, and could not resist temptation.  I ordered the torta de aguacate, which is basically an avacado sandwich with mayo/crema.  There are jalapenos and a tomato on it as well. No lettuce.  The bulk of the taste is the mayo/crema, which was so overpowering that I could not finish my meal.  I ordered to go, so I tried to mask the taste at home, adding various ingredients in attempt to improve the flavor by killing the crema.  Morningstar chicken and delicious New Mexican salsa could not save the sandwich unfortunately.  

The place was clean and the bread would have been good without the mayo.  I suspect that the meat tortas are better than the vegetarian one, so others may have a better experience than I.  The elote sounded interesting, roasted corn on the cob with cheese, lime, and chili.  It had the mayo on it too though.  I will not be going back to try it."
2,"The only reason I'm giving you two stars is because of what happened when I finally got a chance to go back after they're reopening...

We had a fairly new waitress I'm not gonna name her name because she was super sweet and fabulous... She didn't have the rhythm down yet but it's understandable. I had ordered chicken Parmesan with white sauce on the pasta... It didn't come out correctly but I said no worries just bring me out some white sauce and I'll pour it on there and mix it it's fine... Got my white sauce thoroughly enjoyed eating catching up with my sister... I have never gotten my salad so I just asked her to put it in a to go box which she did
...My sisters food was incorrect also...She was new so we did not make a big deal of it. Definitely regret not sending our food back 
When it was time to get my check I noticed that they charged me $2.50 for the white sauce that was supposed to be on my pasta. Not a problem I showed her and she said she was going to have It taken off. She never brought back an itemized ticket but she told me she took the offending I am off and that would be the only time they would do that because you cannot substitute sauce... I handed her my card and when she brought back the receipt the bill has gone up rather than down. I asked her for an itemized receipt and they could not produce one. Then they tried to say that they accidentally charged me for my sisters side of sauce... The problem is on my sisters receipt they had charged her for the sides of sauce 
I personally think that they did not take the white sauce off and also added the dollar for a side of meat sauce that my sister got...

It was really really disappointing because I had been looking forward to coming to House of Pizza for so long. I hope they get all the stuff worked out because if it happens again I will definitely not continue my patronage. It might not seem like much but three or four dollars for me might be the difference between me having lunch one day or not...I have to juggle money around when I go out and get something to eat.


I sure hope this does not happen again."
2,Food was good and had really good prices. Service was the worst. We sat for more than 20 minutes at the counter before we even got utensils. The people sitting right next to us got their food ate and left before we were even acknowledged. When we finally got their attention the server was rude and stated with attitude and annoyance as to why we didn't say anything when clearly we were waiting on being served while multiple servers just stared at our empty counter without once offering anything not even to double check if we had already been helped. Because of the service we received I would have rather waited outside for a table at IHOP.
2,Tourist trap and terrible food. If you go here you need to take a long hard look at yourself and ask...why am I even here?
2,"Good place to eat, management could use a few classes in customer service. Food is good thanks to the cooks service is good thanks to the waitresses. Management needs to learn who pays the bills."
2,This is a chainy night spot that caters to the bachelorette or office party type crowd. Hot too many people heading here on a regular basis. This is a piano bar which on occasion has good performers however has not always been consistent compared to others I have been to. Good for groups and stocked liquor bar but a little pricey.
2,"Came in at 11, 8 people on staff, 1 customer in.  Women complaining loudly about whoever was supposed to be on dish pit and what is or isn't their job. Super tacky and uncomfortable.  My waitress took my order, went and called it out to an older lady who was on grill.  This older lady had absolutely no sense of urgency, and I watched my waitress make at least half of my order while other lady was getting confused between my order and the order of one other customer.  I watched other employees leaning hard like they were keeping the walls up.  I kept thinking about how much money waffle house was losing having 8 people on staff on a Thursday 11 am......
The manager and my waitress were the only people I saw doing anything besides ol complainy asking my waitress to get her ice water because she had worked up such a thirst cooking a couple of liquid eggs, hash browns and toast.  
Food was decent, regular breakfast food.  I did not like the kraft single slice on top of my grits.  I asked for cheese but didn't realize that's what they were working with.
Thank you Amber, for taking care of me, and I hope they pay you enough to work there.  I can only imagine what kind of shit show it is when you guys actually get busy.  I would also like to note that I heard Amber politely coaching other girls on how to read tickets or make things."
2,Always loved their munchkins but this location needs to work on providing quick service.
2,Just an update that the spa upped the facial to $100 so that the package now feels like $5 off.
2,"Went for dinner tonight and it was so so. I had a Greek salad. It was good, but nothing special. My daughter had a small cheese pizza. I tried a slice and didn't finish it because it was bland. Everything about it--crust, sauce, cheese--nothing was special. My husband had a large steak sub. It was HUGE and looked good, but I didn't try it. Glad we tried the place, but I wouldn't go back."
2,"Overpriced, inadequate seating, which consisted of a long curved bench with small and uncomfortable metal chairs on the other side offering little privacy from your neighbor, inexperienced staff (no silverware at table, had to ask for it to be brought out both for our salad and for our entree after it was served). Also the Caesar salad we ordered came as an uncut slab from a whole head of lettuce. Not sure where this is traditional but nobody wants to put in work to eat a salad. Highly unrecommended."
2,"Love & hate with this location... Love that it's close to my job, hate that there's always a more than 10 minute wait. I get the same thing everyday & everytime there's something they don't have or they do incorrectly. 

I order a chicken biscuit & everything is fine until I get to the window. ""We're out of biscuits"" okay way to tell me when I order instead of telling me after I've paid & I ask for extra Carmel on my latte but noooooo.... They put extra hazelnut a little too much. 

I hate being a complaining customer I really do. But they need to be more detailed or specific about what they have or don't have. I feel bad for the manager I've had 3 refunds with her & I know she's probably annoyed about it but I can't pay anything that I'm not fully satisfied. She's really nice & I know it's not her fault."
2,"First time here for dinner. Service was slow at first. Took them about 7-8 minutes to have a server come over to our table. There was no explanation of food specials or drink specials. 

Ordered the Crab Rangoon  and edamame for an appetizer. Crab Rangoon had more cheese and very little crab. The edamame came out partially cold. 

For dinner my wife got the Pad Tai and I had the Mongolian Beef. Her Pad Tai was very heavy on the fish sauce. The beef was supposed to be spicy, but I didn't taste any spices. It was also very heavy on the green onion tops. 

All in all, the food was acceptable although my wife couldn't finish her meal due to the fish sauce taste. 

The restaurant was kept up fairly well, however there were noticeable issues. A mixture of lights, upholstery missing buttons and areas needing paint. 

If you are looking for authentic food, skip this one. It ranks up there with airport or shopping mall Asian restaurants in food quality. It was inexpensive though. At $37.00 for two dinners and two appetizers (we drank water) it wasn't bad."
2,"Went there early on a Friday night. Asked the host if I could eat at the bar and was told ""yes"". Upon ordering a glass of wine I asked for a menu and was told I could only order sushi or appetizers at the bar. First, I was annoyed that this wasn't made clear with my initial question and second, it made me try to think of another restaurant that I've been to where they don't let you order off the full menu at the bar?? I'm still thinking.
I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and the threaded shrimp appetizers. They were both disappointing. The spring rolls were soggy and one of them had a decent amount of shrimp and the other didn't have any shrimp!! I'm not sure what is being attempted with the threaded shrimp dish as it has a deep layer of ""threads"" that surround the shrimp, making it hard to eat. I ended up having to break off most of the outside layer just to be able to take a bite. After a bit of work, the shrimp was okay and I enjoyed the dipping sauces.
Service at the bar was good, although I did have to endure one of the servers showing a fellow server the infected cut on one of his fingers that had become swollen. Nice!
I won't be back."
2,Waited thirty minutes for a cold dish that tasted like dog food. Going to Tokyo next time.
2,"Good food and decent service. However, 10 minutes after leaving the restaurant my fiancée realized she forgot her fleece Columbia jacket in her chair. I called the restaurant back to please ask the waitress if she picked it up. I could hear the waitress acting like she didn't know what a jacket was. Good food, but not really a fan of dishonest people. $10 tip and a new fleece Columbia jacket? She must be happy. Won't be coming back"
2,"i mean no ill will. but i got feeling unwell after eating here.

it tasted  very good and was made fresh and the place looked clean, so i feel bad giving it a bad rating but based on how many very fast trips i had to make to the restroom not long after visiting, i cant give it a higher rating at this time... I may actually try it again in the future  after a cooling off period of a few months and get brave and try again and tell myself  that maybe some ingredient was just off or just had a bug in it and my number was up for getting a touch intestinal trouble, but at this moment I'm a little gun shy to go back any time soon. It can happen in the best restaurants, and it looks like a lot of people loved their meals so I'm happy they enjoyed the complete experience, but since this happened to me, i feel a duty to report it. it happened nov of 2013 a few months ago so maybe the problem is contained or just came in a batch of vegetables etc. this is my hope.

otherwise, I liked the staff, i liked the selection, i liked the murals on the wall. it seems like a very large place for the number of folks eating there the evening i did but I'm thinking its a lunch time rush kind of place."
2,The food was okay. Very fresh.......however the customer service and cleanliness was awful. The price is inflated and the add gratuity plus tax to every bill. I reserved the party room which is not private but was very crowded and noisey. There was a $40 charge to hold the room and it is required for large parties over 10. Kun the manager seemed unable to control the large environment. I will not return.....and while several others (whom were not with my party) complained as well........so I know it wasn't just me and my high standards!
2,"Ok so....I've been here a good amount of times. I will say the pasta is great. Pizza...I think could be better. Very flavorless crust which is a bummer. Tonight I went with a friend...our waitress was decent. I will say one BIG thing I dislike about this place...no bread!!! What kind of real Italian place doesn't give you bread?? Kinda cheap to skimp our on...So we asked our waitress for some and she looked at us like we had ten heads, then says I guess I can bring you a ""loaf"", and comes back with the smallest bread loaf I've ever seen. Literally for two people.....it was maybe the size of an English muffin all together. (Look at picture. Picture looks big but it wasn't bigger than half my hand balled up) Then she had the nerve to charge us a dollar for it!!! Oh, and it was burnt. Tasted like pure charcoal. Really ridiculous. And honestly, the pasta I got was overpriced considering there was no meat.

Not sure if I'll be returning. Maybe if they become a little more generous..."
2,This place use to be so good. The serving sizes has drastically declined.. along with the sushi displays. We use to come here all the time... every time we visit.. longer goes between visits. Their cocktails use to taste amazing... they are just cheap and gross now. The Angry dragon use to be presented so beautifully and large.. it's basically just thrown on a plate. This last time we took a fortune cookie out of the jar... and that was soft and stale  yuck all around. I really hope they turn this back around. It was our favorite.
2,"Dropped in here last night during the Noda/Yelp kick-off event.  Gotta say, I'm trying me best to not be a 'Nancy' here but seriously this just isn't my kind of place to hang.  Couple things stood out for me.  

First and foremost, dogs off leashes.  Most were well behaved but some were a bit too playfull and the only thing that kept running through my mind is what kind of liability insurance do the Owners of this place carry?  If a dog bites someone mistakenly or not, I could easily sit a situation brew.  Oh well, that's for others to worry about I suppose.

Secondly, maybe this was an isolated event, but lack of A/C in the bar area.  It was hot as hades in there even at 8:00pm at night.  Dog heat I suppose?

Third and probably most bothersome for me is the pissing of the dogs happening all over the place.  Yes, it's artificial turf but something about being enclosed in 300-400 sqft with 14 dogs and 8 of which have taken turns pissing on the floor, etc. really turns me off.  Call me crazy.  

Bottom line, I love dogs, really, but there's a place for every(one) and thing.  I'm glad dog owners have a place to go if they want.  I just know that I'll probably avoid this place (at least until I get a dog :))"
2,"The foods not consistent. I ate here a few months ago and the food was great but yesterday it wasn't. The koobideh was dry. 

The restaurant is old and needs an update. They took out the nasty booths which was a good move but there is a lot of empty space. 

Ok for take out but eating there is a depressing. That whole strip mall needs to be town down."
2,"This is my 2nd time coming to this place. The first time I had their carne asada tacos and it was about a year ago. It was ok. There happened to be a roach crawling in the restaurant but didn't make it a big deal nor loss my appetite. I went there last night and I ordered a carne asada torta. The torta was very small for the price (almost $7). It barely had any meat. I wasn't impressed for a place that specializes in ""tortas"". I hope they can improve their quality, if not, at least lower the price. A torta, 8 very small carne asada tacos, and two drinks total $28, it's a ripoff. I won't be coming here anymore.  Oh and the place is always dirty. The floors were sticky."
2,"We went for lunch once when they first opened here in Medina, and we only remember being not overly impressed and did not go back. Years later, we were curious, because we have seen good reviews for them. We ordered carryout to give them another chance. The lo mein was bland. The fried dumplings contained a pink meat mixture that was also bland, and the sauce that came with the dumplings was disappointing. We are used to dumpling sauce being gingery, and this was just soy and ?? I don't know what. The Singapore noodles, described on the menu as having a yellow curry, included surprise ingredients that were not included on the otherwise very detailed description, eggs and mushrooms of some sort. I suppose we should always ask about mushrooms since I am averse to them and you never know when a chef will add them to something. Anyway, I don't think we'll try again."
2,"Went here 4 days in a row around 8:30 AM.

Day 1: Ordered the #1 (2 donuts & a coffee) & the lady manager rings up my debit card & hands it back to me. Asks me what donuts I want all the while chatting/splitting her attention w/ the old guy that looks like he is a regular, daily customer.

I finally get a chance to tell her & she tells me the ones I want are 40 cents extra each. I don't mind paying extra but she should have let me tell her what I wanted before swiping my card & handing it back to me. (The two donuts at 40 cents extra equals the total price of the #1 as stated on the menu so I'm not really paying ""extra"" rather saving 80 cents if I get 2 regular donuts)

Day 2: Ordered the #1 again. Girl at counter asks the guy manager if all the donuts costs the same for the #1 & he says yes. I am happy with my donuts, coffee, & the service so I order 50 donut holes to go for my coworkers.

Day 3: Ordered the #1 again but went through the drive thru this time. The guy says he is the seasoned manager & asks me what I would like on my ""ICED"" coffee. I told him I would like 8 Splendas (2 per every 8 ounces plus an extra 1-2 due to the ice)... When I get to the window, he hands me s ""HOT"" coffee (16 oz) & I am already late to work so I just take it & leave. Putting 8 Splendas in 16 oz of hot coffee makes it way too sweet. The coffee sizes differ based on hot or cold (ie: a medium hot coffee is 16 oz while a medium cold iced coffee is 24 oz)

Day 4: Decide to give this place one last chance. I order the #1 again & the young girl at the counter asks her manager if all the donuts are the same price to which he tells her that some are 40 cents extra. I had to repeat myself about what I wanted in my coffee but she looked stressed out so I just gave her a break.

While waiting for my coffee, the two senior citizens in front of me were complaining about their coffee to the manager. The young girl left the register to help with the coffee for the different customers & mixed up some of them. After finally getting my coffe, I left.

All in all, donuts tasted great but their communication & service needs some work. I would still visit this location again but I would make sure to be extremely specific so they do not mess up anything."
2,"We used to like the Medina House of Hunan very much years ago, but not any longer. It seemed to have run its course and has declined in every way. I would not recommend it any more. I ordered the same dish off of the Thai portion of the menu to compare it to my favorite Thai restaurant in Brunswick- Larb. It was so much worse than Larb's version that I couldn't finish it. My wife ordered something else and it looked like something that had washed up on the beach. It looked disgusting and had no flavor. The texture was awful. Good bye House of Hunan."
2,"The pizza had sooooooo much cheese, it was way toooo much.(that we were putting it aside when it slide off the pizza not needing it back on the pizza!!)   The service was okay. I do not like the primitive way they write out tickets you can't read them and it feels like the owner just rings up whatever!!  Not to mention how uncomfortable I was the out dated and sardine can feeling bathrooms!!"
2,"Terrible experience. I understand that it is a buffet and buffets tend to lack quality but if the food is this nasty then the prices should be dropped a bit. ALL of the desserts taste dry. The waiter was nice and checked up on my table several times. I don't recommend coming here if you want quality. 
   When my table recieved our checks we had to walk to the front area to pay for it. One of the nimrods at the register couldn't do math so my buddy ended up paying an extra $5 because the worker was in denial and had a powerful belief that the $5 bill my friend had already handed him was nonexistent. Luckily my friend didn't really argue because it seemed futileso he gave the guy an extra 5 ."
2,"I've always loved this place until they started allowing patrons to reserve tables weeks in advance. My party of 5 showed up at 8, paid the $5 cover and went inside. ALL of the tables & chairs were roped off as reserved!! We asked management how they could charge us a cover when the entire place was reserved? They just shrugged & suggested we complain to corporate. At least they gave us our money back (hence the 2 stars!) and we went elsewhere. If you're looking for a last minute party, this isn't the place for you!"
2,"After a morning of running errands, my hubby and I needed food. We decided Waffle House was a good, nearby option. We hadn't been to one in many, many years. 

Let me tell you we were disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the prices were decent and the establishment fairly clean. We were seated right away and took a few minutes to look over the menu. I thought the menu was very confusing. Why? It was like a kindergarten picture book. (See my photo.) Give me a straight forward list with prices not all this back and forth, look here and there, here are the up sells, type menu. What the heck? I can read, I don't need a picture of a scrambled egg. I know what they look like.

Service was quick and our order came out very quickly. I had a waffle and a side of bacon. My husband had eggs, hash browns, grits, biscuits with gravy,  and a waffle. 

I could not believe the look of my waffle. It was such a sad little waffle. I don't know what I was expecting, but has my husband said, ""It's the WAFFLE House"" meaning we were expecting amazing looking waffles. Ours were overcooked and so, so THIN. I think all I wanted was a pretty waffle for breakfast. Poor me! My bacon was so tiny and overcooked as well. I was good though, cuz bacon is bacon!  The syrup was so so sugary and the ""spread"" (aka butter substitute) was disgusting. It's nothing but hydrogenated oils. I didn't use it.  My husband said his biscuits and gravy tasted like English muffins with gravy on top. They did not look very appetizing at all. 

It wasn't my favorite meal ever and we likely not be back. Just not our kind of place."
2,"Called in for take out because I am on break from work... got there not ready at the time they said it would be. They were neither sorry nor pleasant.  Got my food, back to work ..I noticed they forgot tzaziki sauce on my falafel. .. I called,  again, neither sorry nor pleasant.  Bad service period! 


Food was not the worse. Definitely not good either. Falafel was dry and lacked texture

The pita they boast about is just ok

Also had a gyro salad, lettuce quality was not good. Gyro itself was kinda good. Overall ok dish. Not worth the $13 though.

I dont like this place or management.  I knew this the moment I walked in."
2,"Four years later to celebrate the birthday of the same friend and the experience has deteriorated. Two of the musicians were great but the others were just okay and one was actually awful. I'm sorry, dude, but playing the same three notes on the trumpet ten times in a row is not helping anyone. You completely tortured Roxanne and I think that was the worst Bohemian Rhapsody in ever. And I know, because I've done one and it sucked too.

The place was way too loud, the speaker outside in the smoking area was just as loud and it was a little blown. The beer was expensive. The cover charge was an acceptable $5.

The four stars experience we had the last time that was ""I'm a fan"" has now turned into a ""I've experienced better."" Maybe when we're back in four more years it will have improved again?"
2,"Tolerable. Waffles are good, fruit is fresh and crunchy, egg breakfeast looked good... BUT. Now im not trying to be critical..but i guess i was expecting better... the chocolate sauce they served with wafffles is gross... grainy and clearly overcooked, super watery and tart... they say its real chcocolate and they stand by it but its just plain gross. My husband got pankakes and they were pretty terrible as well. It came with like 5 bluberrys. Maple syrup on the other hand is tasty. They are a bit slow to refill your coffee and to bring the bill. A good variety for the menu. Maybe i got a bad day and usually its ok."
2,Sushi is one of my favorite foods and the thing that I love about this place is how fresh the sushi is! But that's about all I can say about this place is the food is really good. My waitress today was in a very fowl mood when I first arrived. I was glad her mood had improved by the end. Also the presentation of my sushi (which usually isn't a big deal to me) but today was very noticeable that the sushi was made in a rush and looked like it was just tossed on my plate. That's was annoying to me. Although the food is fresh with everything else it is not worth the price point. Very overpriced! Which is why I don't come very often. Maybe not again after today's experience.
2,"Without a doubt hate this place. Was craving doughnuts some warm coffee. There was Dunkin donut's. Told my boyfriend this was perfect. We ordered the pink glazed doughnuts with sprinkles and chocolate custard filling. The chocolate doughnut doesn't even have an even amount of chocolate on top. Looked like something I could of bought at the bakery at a grocery store.they we asked again why we couldn't get the pink sprinkles doughnuts. She said we have the pink without the sprinkles. After asking again why they didn't have sprinkles She finally said she could put them on. Well gee thanks for going out of you're way for something you already sell. It's not like it was closing time or anything. Great customer service...not 
The one thing I could say i liked about this location is there coffee. It was surprisingly good Inexpensive and we'll made.
If I could go back I wouldn't...even turn that way. I would rather go to the grocery store and buy doughnuts ther. Don't waste your money on doughnuts here, the coffee is good though can't say about the customer service."
2,"Large buffet selection, but food is only okay. Waitstaff was friendly and attentive, helpful with refilling drinks & clearing dishes from the table. The buffet is inexpensive, but the food is just so-so. This might be a good option if you are very hungry & on a budget. I'm not a big buffet person, my husband is, however, & agreed with my assessment."
2,"Good food, but prices are driving us to search for other options. Sad to say, but when we ordered from last summer's menu & saw our total go from $65 to $88 we were SHOCKED!!! Good was good, but not good enough for such a HUGE price increase. No wonder the restaurant wasn't busy @ 6:30pm when we picked up our order. Sad..."
2,"Obviously trying to judge a restaurant is a very subjective thing to do. What I think is good, or great for that matter, you may think is terrible! In my 50+ years of life I've had the opportunity to eat at many so called 'Chinese buffets' from the left coast to the right coast and even one in Pittsburgh.

I was very excited when Tokyo Grill opened in the University City area and the first couple of times I ate there I was very pleased, especially with the sushi bar - and I'm picky about my sushi.

On a scale from 1 to 10 as restaurants go, in my mind most Chinese buffets fall somewhere between a 4, 5, or 6, and basically have the same menu items - give or take a few oddball items. Maybe only one or two I can remember in the past would I rate higher, Chen's Bistro when they first opened up was excellent, and Ding Hall back in the 70's (any native Charlotteans left out there remember that one?).

Because of the sushi bar this one always rated a solid 6 or 6.5 in my opinion. Today, after stopping by Tokyo at about 12:45 to eat lunch, I would have to say it has slipped back to a 4. I didn't have the sushi today, but if the overall cleanliness of the restaurant is any indication of the sushi bar I'm glad I passed. And whatever possessed the owners to put carpet in a high traffic flow/high turnover restaurant like this I'll never know. It looks like they haven't bothered to clean it since they opened - yuck! 

This restaurant in my mind is now nothing more than a 'stuff-n-puke', a good place to stuff your pumpkin with mediocre food and leave miserable!

I'm not here to recommend another Chinese buffet, but without mentioning a name there's another one right up the road across the street from the Hilton that is much better, at least for now. But who knows, a year from now it'll probably suck too!"
2,"I came here at the beginning of the summer, and I got a decent facial. I was looking into going back, and I checked on the packages. The Serenity Package, which cost $180, includes two services that each cost $85 individually. Why would ANYONE pay for a package that is $10 more expensive that getting two individual services? (For those troubled by math, $85 x 2 = $170.) Evolve, you might want to fix your pricing."
2,"I've enjoyed dining at House of Hunan several times in the past, but tonight I decided to order carry out for two, and it was a big disappointment. Upon arriving home and emptying the bags, we discovered we were missing the Fried Rice for the Teriyaki Chicken ""soup"". No, they don't actually have Teriyaki Chicken soup on the menu, but the chicken and veggies were swimming in so much liquid, it spilled over the edges of the container when the lid was removed.  It was almost as disappointing as the missing Fried Rice. But still not as disappointing as the bland Eggrolls, and the crabless, cold Crabmeat with Cheese (Rangoons). The Pad Thai wasn't terrible, but not as good as it's been in the past, while dining in the restaurant. The only reason this review gets two stars, is because the Spicy Crab Salad was delicious . . . but still not worth the $50."
2,"I ordered a peach ice tea & my cousin ordered the new chips ahoy iced latte. The peach ice tea tasted too sweet & when I went to the window to pay the cashier read back my order he said iced latte & asked oh is that a chips ahoy latte he said yes but when my cousin drank it, it tasted like regular coffee, they're nice but their drinks suck. I wouldn't go back."
2,"so I went to Ohio last week and my cousin and mom both had me at DD on a daily basis.  Well I was immediately hooked on the Caramel Iced Coffee....OMG Soooo delish.  So I signed up for the card and said ok this will be my new thing instead of Starbucks.  It's definitely a little less expensive and now that there is one on the way to work I'm all in.  I've been to this location once before for donuts when they first opened and the donuts tasted kind of old (I went at 6:45am).  
So I went today for my Caramel Iced Coffee, super excited and to my surprise it was NOT good at all.  You could taste sugar particles (did not have this issue all 7 days I went in Ohio) and there was not a lot of cream in it.  Was just very disappointed and feel like I have $17 left on my card and I'll be transferring it to my mom because I was disappointed.
The location itself is very clean and nice."
2,Stopped in to buy 3 dozen doughnuts for my son's birthday party at school. Everything was fine until I asked for a stack of napkins. One of guys said they couldn't do that because of some bs story about how it cuts into profits and all the doughnuts they sold in a day. I was welcome to pull 36 napkins one at a tine from the dispenser but they wouldn't give it to me in a stack. Really? I just spent over $30 in doughnuts but you won't  give me a stack of napkins? One for each doughnut. What's going to eat into your profits is the fact that I won't ever come here again and I'll not recommend this shop to anyone. Ever. Customer service; it's a thing and a happy customer is well worth a stack of napkins.
2,"We drive by this place often and say ""it looks so sketchy that it must be great!"" Well...it isn't. It isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great. 

Highlights:
- we had great service. Everyone was nice and friendly.
- prices were very reasonable and you got a ton of food for a low price
- the sweet tea was good and they kept it coming
- the house vinaigrette was good. Kinda sweet but pretty good. 

Lowlights can be summed up in one word - FOOD:
- the house salad came with lettuce, onion, green pepper and tomato. I wish there had been croutons or something to mix up the textures. 
- the food in general was just not great. I had the chicken parmesan and the marinara sauce didn't have any robust flavors. The chicken didn't taste fresh. There was (and some people may think I'm crazy) way too much cheese on the chicken. I had to scrape most of it off. I literally had three bites of the meal and was done. Even my garlic bread didn't have a strong garlic taste. My fella had the cheesesteak (which the waitress described as ""awesome"") but the bite I had was bland. In my opinion- the philly cheesesteaks at Jersey Mike's on East Blvd are much, much, MUCH better. 

I've eaten at worse places. But I've definitely eaten at better. If we ever go here again, I'd opt for the pizza and hope for better flavor."
2,"I was given services here as a gift and was hoping for a tranquil and ""special"" experience. I didn't have a great experience, and wouldn't return.  The website gives the impression of this being a higher end but affordable ""spa,"" but the atmosphere and attention to detail were lacking. I had a massage and manicure.  

The masseuse was technically very good and worked on couple of problem areas really well. She was very thorough and responsive, did a great job with the spots I mentioned. On the other hand, it was a hot stone massage and I don't think that was really her ""thing.""  Most of the stones were so hot they had to be removed; this happened numerous times so I was kind of on edge waiting for the next one each time.  I haven't had that experience with a hot stone massage elsewhere.  It also just wasn't very relaxing; the stones felt like an afterthought rather than being integrated into the strokes.  I would schedule with her again for a different type of massage, but not hot stone again. I think a good spa should know the staff's strengths and weaknesses and assign customers accordingly so this doesn't happen. 

I can't think of anything good to say about the manicure.  I sat at a high table in the window on a freezing day as staff chattered at the front desk and people came in and out.  Not relaxing, spa-like, or professional at all, more like the local beauty shop.  The technician was drinking from an open fast food cup while doing my nails and snacking right next to me as my nails dried- not a very hygienic practice. My ""citrus manicure"" was actually a really fast basic manicure with some incredibly strong smelling off brand fruity lotion at the end. I specifically scheduled the citrus because the other manicure option had strong smelling oils and I wanted to avoid that.  The high table and stool were uncomfortable for a manicure, so following my massage I'm sitting there perched on a stool, crammed into a cold corner with my shoulders hunched up around my ears and an overwhelming smell making my head hurt. Just really disappointing overall. One poor woman in a spa robe walked by through the busy waiting and manicure area and you could see right through the robe; I can't believe they had her change and walk through like that. 

All of this is somewhat nitpicky, but created an atmosphere I wouldn't want to return to and I wanted to share the details for others making the same decision.  On the other hand, if you need an every day run of the mill basic service, the prices are decent and it's not a bad place- again just nothing fancy or particularly ""sap like."""
2,Been here twice in the last couple months when I was running late and needed coffee on my way to work. Both times the coffee was so weak!  No good at all. Wonder why as Dunkin Donuts is famous for their coffee and every other place I go in the chain is awesome. Thinking they use too much water.
2,"My friend and I both received mani/pedis at Evolve this morning. Our experience was less than pleasant. We were stationed up front by the entrance where several employees and clients were constantly in and out of the door making it difficult to relax. Although the staff was friendly, the two women doing our nails engaged in conversation about how much other clients tipped them. My friend and I found this to be very awkward and uncomfortable. Most importantly, my nails looked terrible. Not only were there not enough coats applied to my nails, the nail polish was all over my skin. I find it very annoying to drop $65 on a mani/pedi only to get home and have to redo my nails. Good thing I brought my own polish."
2,"I wanted to visit more than once to write my review because this is such a cool idea. Unfortunately it misses the mark. The problem I think is in the choice of flooring. Astroturf is not as hygienic as they make you believe and I've seen several owners simply spray their pets poop with a hose, this only spreads around the feces. Everything below hip level has been peed on and there really is no hand sanitizer except for what you bring. The other problem is mixing alcohol with different types of owners. I see most all of the dogs, big and small, rambunctious and calm get along fine and do their thing but the people are a different story. I've seen near fights with over protective types and meh types. I think if this concept were really going to work, put a bar in a dog park not a dog park in a bar. Needs more space for everyone."
2,"I am totally disappointed at this store. They always run out of merchandise. Sunday afternoon when everyone goes out to eat and they never have what you want, it's fair that they offer you something else but you go exactly there for one reason. I hope the owner takes more care of his store. 
This is just an update as an today Sep-09-18 
I came back to get the Pepihuates that I love and guess what?....Once again they are out of something else, now is Tamarindo....I wonder what day do they have everything they need to make them."
2,"To openly admit my bias, I've never been a fan of piano bars. In a weekend visiting my college roommate in Charlotte for the 2017 Belk Bowl, she recommended our group stop by Howl to start the night since we could order a few of their infamous bucket drinks as we waited for more friends to join. We ended up choosing the Cherry Kool-aid bucket to satisfy a variety of taste personalities. 

I did find Howl to be a fun young atmosphere - the perfect spot for college town grads, but it was the music which I found totally sobering. Listening to the nightly performer sing to current songs sung by piano adaption was cringeworthy. Because of the musical styling, I can only imagine Howl being a place I would start or end my night, but never as a bar I stay for the entire night out. On the plus side, Howl benefits from its location in Epicenter, making the bar almost an inevitable stop."
2,Food is only one part of an experience of eating out and although the food is definitely acceptable the cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. I would suggest the owners and management put some time and consideration into cleaning the washrooms and the general up keep of the restaurant.
2,"Oh man I hate to knock off 3 stars when I truly did love this place but I discovered they changed the name because they got shut down for fixing the food out back on the ground by the dumpster. I never once had a bad experience here. But man I don't even know if we can ever go back knowing this happened and It sucks because their food really is good, see old review below. 

THIS PLACE DID NOT CLOSE DOWN THEY JUST CHANGED THE NAME TO THE RIVER BUFFET. Everything is exactly the same except the sign out front has a new name. See my original review below:


Don't waste your time or $$ going to any other Asian buffets in the Charlotte area. Tokyo Buffet blows them all to smithereens. I've been to sushi only buffets that didn't have the selection this place has. Seriously it is head & shoulders above buffet sushi pretty much anywhere I've ever been aside from perhaps RuSan's (in Atlanta, have never tried RuSan's in Charlotte but I hear they also do sushi buffet lunch). They also have a really big (and separate from the sushi thank God) hibachi build it yourself grill. The actual ""regular"" buffet itself is like 3x bigger than anywhere else. The food is always fresh and turning over because this place is always busy. We went here right before closing one night and it was still packed. Nothing but fresh. It's clean for a buffet, I don't feel sketched out about the quality or origin of what they serve like some places. It is also blessedly not full of MSG. I couldn't eat here if it was. They always have a huge variety of stuff. My husband and I live 45 minutes away but we still would rather go here than anywhere near us because those places suck so much and cost the same or more, we don't want to be disappointed. I wish I could get this place to open another location near us, but it's ok. Be warned though: once you try Tokyo Buffet, everyone else will just be too lame to bother with."
2,"They have sashimi and nigiri style sushi.  You can get salmon (sake), tuna (maguro), and yellowtail (hamachi) in either style.  The bad news is that they are chronically slow at putting this food out, especially the sashimi.  I put up a picture illustrating the problem, I visited the sashimi section twice over the course of 20 minutes and that picture represents what it looked like the entire time.

Another problem is that this is the worst yellowtail I have had anywhere in Charlotte.  It is tough - a hybrid between eating a raw potato and eating actual yellowtail.  The color and flavor are both off as well, the yellowtail is opaque and not a hint of pink.  There are plenty of pieces with bright read streaks are far thicker than they should be because they are cutting the fish to maximize the volume and they overdo it.  I suspect they are using leaner yellowtail caught in the US instead of the heavier fish raised in Japan.

With all those negatives you are in for a treat if you like salmon and you can find any.  They don't mess up he salmon, and the tuna is alright.

All the other items are typical of a Chinese/Mongolian/Japanese buffet (not the three separately, it is typical of any place that offers all three).  You have the ubiquitous and over doughy dumplings and won-ton, multiple varieties of heavily breaded and deep fat fried chicken (pepper, Tso's, sesame), chicken wings, pizza, overcooked prime rib (calling it prime rib is misleading).

This place can probably pass for a 3 or 4 star when they have the good stuff on display but as is typical for these types of places they open strong and then reduce the quality hoping you will keep coming and strapping on the feedbag.

Tokyo Grill & Buffet suffers from the same problem as all its counterparts: it looks the same, it tastes the same, and the flavor / quality is lower on any dish than if you ordered the individual dish at a normal restaurant.

I usually enjoy the variety of a buffet but at this buffet the food all tastes so similar that there is little variety.  Unless you want to indiscriminately shovel food into your face I would skip this place.  In the alternative you could buy 1lbs to go of the sashimi for $4.50 and stick to the salmon and tuna - this way you could make yourself a boat load of sushi at home for very cheap.  I doubt they will keep letting people buy 'sashimi' grade sushi for $4.50/lbs so get it if they have it while they allow it."
2,"I must admit buffets are usually not my first pick. The atmosphere is not the best. The food is, as expected, not the freshest. The restaurant is very crowded and sometimes little kids may not understand sanitary expectations and pick stuff up with their hands and other little things like that. The dessert section is a hotspot for little kids, so personally I avoid it. A lot of the food in itself isn't my favorite. The service is good for a buffet though. Overall it's a good place to take the family on a budget but, not the first pick."
2,"My family comes here for special occasions and holidays so we don't have to worry about cooking. While the food has always been just fine, and the service great, we've noticed the prices seem to be going up.

Today we ordered Pad Thai, sushi. General Tso Chicken, Beef Lo Mein. While General Tso Chicken was fine, the pad Thai was incredibly underwhelming. I'd never call something gross, but his fish was vertically near that. I'm very familiar with Pad Thai and back where I'm from I'm familiar with the flavors. This Pad Thai is something I've never tasted before. It tasted very sweet and had a peculiar flavor to it. It wasn't eh fish sauce but something else. Definitely not worth the price we paid.

The sushi was fine, although one of the tools had seaweed a little more chewy than expected. 

Overall this experience today was very underwhelming."
2,"I had the ""Peking duck"" half. Those ""traditional Chinese pancakes"" were nothing more than tortillas I could of gotten from Walmart. As for the duck, it was okay but nothing worth $17 even after you put everything together. The meat was cooked decently but all together the dish isn't worth what you get. I fear what the $31/whole has to offer honestly."
2,This place has the absolute worst service ever. I've been here multiple times and every time they can't figure out how get an order correct. Is it so hard to make a coffee with out cream and sugar?
2,Came in today for lunch. I've been coming here for about 4 years and never have had a bad meal. The last time I was here was in October and it just wasn't up to par with the last times I've had it:/ but today at lunch was the last straw. I ordered hot and sour soup which is always good and the beef and broccoli lunch special and the sesame seed chicken. When the lunches were both brought to the table one was beef and broccoli and the other Szechwan chicken. I told the waiter that I had gotten sesame chicken but he said this was it and left abruptly. I've had sesame chicken 4 times there and it wasn't. He came back once again and I told him sesame chicken is fried with a sweet sauce and has SESAMES on it! He proceeded to say it doesn't and he was correct it was sesame. When getting the bill too it was listed as Szechwan. The waiter was named Joe or John. But I'm never going back after the waiter was trying to take advantage of me.
2,Food is always consistent and tastes decent. Service is kind of blah. The place is kind of dirty and this includes the appearance of the employees. Eh...but its cheap and you get what you pay for.
2,"Super slow and inattentive service.  Burned spring rolls, very forgettable meal.  The wood floor needed refinishing years ago.  No on sight management the most depressing music on earth . Seems like who ever owns this sad establishment is just milking it for cash. Tried to eat here last weekend when my hand stuck solid to the entrance door handle due to filth, I turned around and left."
2,"Really unimpressive. The ambiance was a little dark and gloomy for a breakfast place. Staff seemed really rushed and not as service oriented. I mean its okay for a restaurant to just provide the bare minimum service for a typical, come order, serve food timely, and give bill timely etc but I guess them being located in a better part of the city I was expecting a little too much. Anyways, I was seated, and ordered the avocado omelette which could have been the most disappointing omelette I have ever had. Period. It was too watery inside, and the sundried tomatoes were all over the palce. The avocados itself just came in chunks leaving the whole flavor meal to go south. The sides, toast and homefries that came were just depressing. t=Too greasy and just not loved enough. I also ordered a chocobanana shake which was another let down. Anyways for a bill of 50 for two wasnt a cherry on top either Price was for the location yes it was expected, but being hopeful for a great brunch and not having it was just a nil situation. Not coming back again. =("
2,"Just gross. Even with the revamp, the pizza is still gross, the food takes forever to come out and my stomach is in KNOTS. My son feels horrible too. Do not waste your money."
2,"I don't say this about just any place I've been unimpressed with, but I actually regret having gone to Tortas Paquime. My to-go order included the torta ahogada and the soup of the day. It takes about 10 minutes, even when not busy, to receive the order. Finally, upon receiving my order, I grab the bag, which is located about a foot to the side of what appears to be a separate order of soup, inspect the bag to make sure I have everything. Seeing a large container in the bag, I grab and head out the door. 
Well, the torta is completely underwhelming. But, what really gets my goat is that the soup was actually the sauce. That soup located impossibly far from my order, was actually mine. And the person who had set the order on the counter and was standing there at the moment, the person whom I thanked for the order, said nothing.
Regrets."
2,"I feel giving a two star is being very generous.  Yes it is the 24 ice festival but the bar area was totally a no go.  No bar tender, no menu, no service.  Not a happy customer"
2,"The waitress was awesome. She was friendly and always refilled our coffee. When she noticed we were English she switched from speaking French to English. I give her 5 stars. 

The problem was that the food took a long time to come. I'm usually very patient, but the restaurant was almost empty. I don't mind waiting if they're in a rush, but I don't understand why it would take so long when there were hardly any orders. 

Also, I found it strange that they don't include coffee with the breakfast when all their competitors do. Especially at the price they are charging. I found that the price was too much for what you got."
2,"Well let me start by saying the renovations were worth the wait. The place looks great!!!!

 We ordered iced tea but didnt realize that it would come with dried out brown lemon slices.

 The service was horrible. The waitress suggested that we try a new menu items fresh made pita bread and greek dip. We waited 20 minutes and when we asked she said it would be a few minutes. That's not the bad part, she tried to hurry and put the order in. I had to tell her that we would rather not wait. 

The pizza was hot and just like I remember from eating here as a child.

So if its good fast service is what you're after you might need to just pick up your order and skip the dine in experience."
2,"Disappointing service, extremely slow. I sat at the order microphone for about 6 minutes before I was asked my order. Then I sat another 15 minutes in the drive thru waiting for my order. When this location first opened they had great fast service, now not so much."
2,"I've been to House of Hunan countless times, and while the food (I mainly go there for the sushi) is typically good, the service is ALWAYS horrible. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years...I know what good customer service is supposed to be. The employees at House of Hunan, however, do not.

The most recent time I went to House of Hunan, I called ahead to see if I could place a reservation.  The man on the phone was unbelievable.  He was rude and unhelpful and somewhat offensive in his tone.

When my friends and I arrived at the restaurant, we were NOT greeted, although there was a middle-aged man (I assumed it was the same man I spoke with on the phone) AND a twenty-something year old girl standing at the hostess desk....doing nothing. They stood there and ignored us until I approached them telling them I had a reservation. After a few moments of them fumbling around and telling me to ""hold on,"" I was informed that they had no record of my reservation. They were not accommodating, they offered no explanation as to why my reservation didn't exist, and told us they had no room for us for ""at least an hour, probably longer.""

Needless to say, we left still hungry, and I vowed to never return."
2,"So, yeah, the food was good enough.  I've had tapas before, that is to say that I've gone to a restaurant and shared a bunch of appetizers with friends - it should be a fun experience.
I'll ignore the somewhat high cost, because for Vegas, it wasn't that overwhelming.  The food really was decent, but it was the service that really tanked.  I mean REALLY tanked.
The waiter was a nice guy.  he was friendly, helpful and kept the drinks refilled.  Had we only ordered drinks, this review would have been better...

He asked if we wanted the food served as it came done (vs. all together) and we said fine.  This is good, because otherwise it would have taken 2 hours to get fed.
The food came in clumsey bursts, separated by exceedingly long periods of nothingness, during which time we stared into the kitchen (we were seated in the back) and watched the chaos ensue.  Three times a waiter/busboy came to our table and laid down a dish that wasn't ours.  Once, the waiter jumped in and said ""no, that's table 23!"", the other two times we took an honest tack and sent the order away.  
Over a period of about 1 1/2 hours we got our dishes, except the pizza.  This as really the only thing that my brother-in-law (a finicky sort) had ordered.  Since he ordered his tomato, mozerrella and olive pizza sans olives, we have a suspicion that his pizza went out twice to the wrong table, as we saw to oliveless pizzas pass by without stopping.  Or maybe the rest of the crowd hates olives too.
They finally wrangled the pizza, which they comp'd after we said we didn't want it at all.
If there were staff issues, etc., going on, we didn't know about it, as no manager fessed up.  They seemed to have plenty of staff, although none of them seemed to know what table they were in charge of.  They also seemed to be running two restaurants out of the kitchen, so you may want to steer clear of Stripburger, too.
Basically, the food was decent, but the service was so chaotic that it was palpable."
2,"Joojeh Kabob!!

Ok so Ive gone to FK before, but this time I was totally saddened by the experience! I went into this place sooo excited, I remember eating it before and it was yummy and sooo savory! This time, NOT THE CASE! I paid 11$ for Joojeh Kabobs meal... imo thats super over-priced! Especially considering the fact I got 1 small pos kabob! It was literally 4 tiny pieces and I was pissed off the entire time I was eating it!

Upon entering FK, totally in a hella sketchy area, you enter a giant place below office buildings. I went to the counter and asked for my beloved chicken breast kabobs. Now last time I had them the meal came with 2... this time it was 1 and the price was 11$!! Normally it was only around 9! I got to work and opened my food box and was like, WTF! The chicken was over cooked and was not seasoned at all! I was soooooo disappointed! The rice also was not great and super plain! The only saving grace was the pita bread! 

I was def not impressed : ("
2,"There aren't a lot of cheap restaurant options in the Old Port, more specifically and in the legal district. Eggspectation is one such option and I happen to love breakfast for lunch or dinner. 

Yet, Eggspectation is far from being the best breakfast restaurant. Service is okay. However, sometimes the waitresses make mistakes on your order (""No I asked for white bread, not whole wheat""). This afternoon, at another location, my friend ordered eggs benedict and instead of English muffins she got whole wheat toasts (?!).

I usually get the same thing when I go to such restaurants: two eggs, potatoes and bacon. Pretty standard and not very difficult. The potatoes are okay, but the eggs are often tepid. The worst is probably the bacon. It's very thin, microwavable bacon. Yuck. 

I once had a burger there. It was not fantastic, but tolerable. The patty was quite dry. McDonald's, which is across the street, makes better burgers. 

The price: $10 (because tea isn't included with breakfast). 

Skip it, unless there is no other option."
2,"Are you kidding me..??
You are not even bussy,
I'm looking at the donuts as we speak, we just want a dicen..!
Will it take MORE THAN 20 min to packe it up..??

NO WONDER YOU HAVE 2 STARS OUT OF 66 COMENTS.!
Never to come back.!"
2,"How to kill a pizza in three easy steps:

Unidentifiable white cheese, unbrowned.
Sauce you can see, but not taste.
Canned mushrooms.

The service was awesome (despite the two women working being a little overwhelmed by the never ending lunch crowd), the prices were decent, and the decor was bad ass... but the pizza, as advertised for on their huge, often-burnt-out neon piece dangling over Central, was pretty bad. Of course, we were the only people ordering it. Everyone else went with the house meat+cheese+white bread sub, served, interestingly, with BJ's-looking potato chips.

So was our tzatziki. Eh. Interesting execution of this Greek dip/sauce: sour creamish yogurt, shredded cuke, raw garlic. No herbs, pepper, salt. Turned out that this was the best part of the meal, and I enjoyed dipping something as weird as crappy chips into it and actually having them improve the taste.

Pluses include: $8 pasta specials that include garlic toast and salad, with a number of veg-friendly options. I might come back to try one of these lasagnas or raviolis or manicottis. But for pizza, I will head 'round the corner to Portofino's. Definitely."
2,"I love chinese food and buffets...this place is not bad, but not great either...the good: pepper steak, hot and sour soup, sushi, bbq ribs, fried sauteed shrimp, fried squid...they may have the best carbonated drinks of all chinese buffets (enough fizz and mix of syrup)...the bad: the fried rice (absolutely no or bland taste)...how hard can it be to get this right...fried crab (just too small, isn't it illegal to catch and sell miniture crabs...doesn't it have to be a certain size...where is PETA on this)...the crawfish (its the sauce that's the problem, too thick, slimey)...the fried chicken was too fried (wasn't moist, just dry)...the servers (some male servers somewhat arrogant)...I must've been there at most five times since it opened...haven't been there in a while...just better choices out there...up the block :)"
2,"Got a deep tissue massage, but it was very light, and I felt slimy from all the oil she used. She also did not massage my abdominals, which too many massage therapists skip."
2,"This tapas restaurant by way of Chicago offers  priced Sangria and an assortment of $3 appetizers in the bar area on weekdays from 4-7PM.  Our waitress also served as bartender so service tended to be on the slow side.  We started off with a carafe of red sangria ($10) and a chicken empanada (3 Stars, $3) served with what tasted like mustard spiked mayonnaise.  Our next round included a tiny portion of seafood salad (1.5 Stars, $3) and a large portion of spicy potatoes with tomato aioli (3 Stars, $3).  Meanwhile we kept working on the Sangria while enjoying the bar scene.  It was at this point that we decided we were not going to be in the mood for a full meal so we asked the waitress/bartender if we could use the Restaurant.com certificate for the Sangria and appetizers.  Not a problem said my now much more efficient waitress. As the bewitching hour of 7PM approached we quickly requested the Serrano ham and tomato bread tapas. (0.5 Stars, $3)  I did a quick calculation using the Dewey Decimal System and determined we were going to have a difficult time reaching the $35 minimum required for use of the Restaurant.com certificate so we ordered the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce tapas (5 Stars, $7).  We were now satiated and ready to quit, but we ordered 2 mini desserts, coconut bread pudding with sorbet and a truffle chocolate cake (2.5 Stars, $4).  Based on my updated calculations we were still nominally short of the requirement, but I asked the waitress for the bill - wow 14 cents to the good."
2,"This is far from being authentic Chinese food. It's just ok for a buffet.
I went with friends - I will never go again for the taste and price to me not worth it. But they were friendly and took good care of us. The taste of the food was just not that great."
2,"Clean and commercialized is how I would describe this place. IT lacks the authentic feel and ambiance I would expect.  But this is not why the score it low, it was the flavor to value ratio.

My avocado tomato and mayo torta was $5 and it was slightly larger than a .99 hamburger. It had a very creamy flavor from the avocado and tomato on the soft bun. Add to that some 1.99 french fries and I had a unfilling meal.

The one highlight of this place is the condiment station, with a great creamy and hot red salsa, avocado dip and fried peppers. 

If you rarely stay away from the big chains and want a torta this is for you, if you like the flavors and fell of local dining look on."
2,"Please get the difficult drive through customers out of the way!  6 cars waiting 10min to process one custome, then the rest of us fly through.

Doesn't matter if the delay is caused by a persnickety customer, Dunkin screwed up, or the customer ordered way too much for the drive through (like those that special order for their entire office)...get them off to the side.

Macdonald's does this, learn from them."
2,"Along with the rest of the Epicentre bars, the bouncers here are always on a power trip.  One of my friends was kicked out for telling an out-of-uniform bouncer to ""chill the f* out"" because the once again, out-of-uniform bouncer was behind a long line of people aggressively pushing his way to the front.  There is little to no space for walkways and the place tends to get very clogged on crowded nights.  This place, and the rest of the Epicentre, is a tourist trap and only for people that don't live in Charlotte."
2,The service was terrible.  The food was okay.  Both me and and my friends credit card numbers were stolen from the waitress.  Be sure to bring cash if you decide to dine here.
2,"Unbelievable. Another DD that can't get a coffee right. Waited in line for the slow moving staff to make a mediocre cup of hazelnut coffee.  You know, consistency, fast service, and service with a smile...no, no, and no."
2,"Super slow and inattentive service.  Burned spring rolls, very forgettable meal.  The wood floor needed refinishing years ago.  No on sight management the most depressing music on earth . Seems like who ever owns this sad establishment is just milking it for cash."
2,"The only reason why I give this place a 2 star is because the place is nice, but the service wasn't good. The girl at the front counter wasn't friendly at all and didn't even offer a smile. She also made me feel uncomfortable and pressured to order from the way she was staring with a very serious face like she just wanted me to hurry up. She even got my order wrong. I didn't bother to say anything because I don't like to make a huge deal and make someone throw product away and start a whole new drink. I simply just won't come back here again."
2,"2.5/5. Everything is just ok. I've heard great things and nothing has impressed me.  Pizza crust is plain and dull with no crisp or unique anything. Cheap cheese and no seasoning on the pizza or sauce. 

On the second visit...tried the meat sauce, again it was bland and reminded me of cafeteria food.  The fried mozzarella is frozen from a box. 

Better pasta can be found at your local h.t."
2,"Yes the food is great, but I want to spend my money where I think it is appreciated. The sister (family owned business) has the worst attitude. I've seen her talk to the employees like crap. Last night, my server quoted me the wrong price. She wouldn't honor what my server stated. Any other time I wouldn't have blinked twice at the lack of training or inconsistency, but how she talked to me was horrible. I informed her that I would no longer be coming back and she replied, "" Fine, ok, don't come back."" Not once did she say, he was wrong. I'm sorry for the confusion. How can I fix this mistake? Bad customer service + bad attitude = one less patron"
2,Had great service here but more often than not I had absolutely horrible service here. Definitely a good place to get breakfast items but not a bad place for a burger as well. Dealing with late-night drunks is always a harsh reality of coming here on the later weeknight hours.
2,"I was disappointed during my trip to WH.  The waffles are just ok...nothing ""oh wow"" factor about it.  This location is small.  The workers although some moved quickly, some were just taking their sweet time...service was spotty.  We sat on at the bar with a good view of the ""kitchen"".  It was cluttered and dirty.  I didn't enjoy listening to the workers complain about each other."
2,"Was craving a torta Tuesday night 7/3, and I knew that my fave was already closed by 830pm (Tortas El Guero). Also had my g/f that night, who'd never had one. She ordered the Paquime, and I had the Cubano w/o beans. I was highly disappointed. Those two sandwhiches are nowhere approaching the same league as my fave, or Tortas Del Rey. Tiny, thin, and so-so on the taste. 

My g/f loved hers, and kept wondering why I was disappointed. On July 4th, I called and found T El G was open, and I promptly took her there. Then, and only then, with close comparison, could she understand the vast chasm of difference between a true TORTA, and those two jokers we had the night before. 

NOW, I want to be clear I'm only disappointd in their sandwhiches. The place is large, clean, friendly and OPEN late. I saw a salad and a plate dish or two coming out of that kitchen for which I WILL RETURN to sample.It's just that when I want a REAL -DEAL TORTA, it won't be there."
2,"I only eat here if I have to.

""Cheese bread"" is basically dinner rolls cut in half with some mozzarella thrown on top and broiled which for some reason takes almost 20 minutes?

The pizza is actually quite good, but since everything else isn't all that great, it deters me from wanting to come eat here. The service could use a few pointers on things like smiling....

So. I call in a pizza every now and then and give them a few extra minutes to prepare it. That way we're all happy!"
2,"I stopped by this new Dunkin on my way to work this morning and ended up waiting to order a coffee in the drive-thru for a solid TEN minutes and there was no one in front of me. I understand they are new and probably trying to work the kinks out, but ten minutes to order an iced latte seems really excessive. On top of that, the latte I ordered had no flavor to it. I hope they improve their drive-thru time and drinks as this place is easily accessible and usually delicious!"
2,"I attended a happy hour party on Friday. The party includes one drink for one dollar and the rest at a discounted four dollar rate. I ordered two stoli o and sodas - but my first was significantly weaker than the second even though it was made by the same bartender. It wasn't a huge deal, but  I feel that drinks should at least be consistent. The happy hour party comes with free appetizers as well. They hand everything out to you most likely to conserve food. I felt overall the temperatures were off  but most of what I tried tasted  pretty good. 

The real reason for the meh review had to do with a bus person (or manager)- I really am not sure who he was. Basically we had two or three tables pushed together because we had a large group. He kept obsessing about our seating arrangement and trying to push our chairs in. It wouldn't have been a huge deal but there were four chairs to a small table-top and we would have been packed in like sardines if we kept the table the way he clearly wanted it. Even when we said we needed a bit more room he stomped around us and was visibly agitated. We were not creating any kind of distraction and the chairs were not a hazard the way we had them, he was compulsive about them, it was really strange.


The instrumentals were good - and the musicians clearly had a wide-range of song knowledge. The vocals were not nearly as good, in fact I hate to say it but they were just kind of bad. 

All in all I don't think id go again, one dollar drink or not..."
2,I have definitely experienced better with this place. My coworkers and I got some breakfast items one morning including coffee and they were made correctly. You cannot very well try some steaming coffee to see if has the mocha swirl. Or you order a large and they give you a small. Hopefully it will get better.
2,"I would not recommend this place for Chinese food or sushi. They are very expensive, & the food is very spicy & salty. For people who are trying to cut back on their sodium, this is not the place to go. My husband got the Gulf of Siam that was very salty. I got a salad along with the meal & the chicken had a big bone in it & I almost broke a tooth on it. The food is also very high in fat grams & carbs. I asked for a substitute for the rice & they did not even give me a choce for a vegetable or anything else. That is not very good way for a person who can't eat rice or that much of it , if you are a diabetic or have high blood pressure. If you want to raise you blood pressure just go there & you will make sure by the time you got out of there it will be up to the sky with all the salt that they use in their food. Their sushi is okay but it is very expensive. Parking is terrible also. They do not have a private parking lot at all. The food is way too expensive for what you order."
2,"Coffee is not included with the breakfast dish: 2 eggs and bacon :O!  Blasphemy!  That was my biggest shock!  What breakfast joint in Montreal does not have coffee included (I know that non-Quebec places typically price coffee seperately)?

Aside from that eye-widening surprise, the eggs turnover, greasy dark bacon, and dried chives on potatoes were OK enough to say you've had a well-balanced breakfast :).

And you'll do just fine with the wait staff - the young lady I had was pleasant.

Oh! Almost forgot to give fellow Yelpers a heads-up about the bathroom - go with courage!  I had breakfast here during the week at 7:30am and so the place was pretty empty. I walked to a door that was seemingly a heavy metal emergency door, that opened to a dank stairwell, which could have been the outside of a building at one point, or the ""VIP"" entrance of a nightclub from the 90's, and make sure you watch where you step to go down the spiral staircase, there's garbage about.  Then found another door to a corridor with flickering lights (I chalk it up to the Halloween effects were just not taken down yet), and when finally found the sign with a stick figure and a triangle, the bathroom was the scene from Basket Ball diaries - you can just feel the creepies happening here.  I really needed to pee so bad but not one toilet was unclogged or with toilet paper, since I touched the handle, wanted to wash my hands, but no soap! or towel!  So needless to say, I didn't use the facilities and just left running...Be sure I Purell my whole body after that!"
2,"I use to go here all the time before they remodeled.   I have heard other people say the food is not as good,  I agree.  Bought a sub and they main ingredient was mayonnaise.   Really disgusting.  I had to take it apart and scrape 1/2 cup of mayo off before I could eat it.   The bread is not as good as it use to be.   High price for a very mediocre sandwich."
2,"*FIRST NOTE* We had a Groupon for this location. We had $20 to use. The owner told us that to use the Groupon, we had to each buy a drink and pay a 15% gratuity on the bill. The Fine Print on Groupon says nothing about having to buy drinks and adding a 15% gratuity. I know this guy was scamming us, but I paid the difference to just get this over with.

We ordered a beef shish kabob and a beef and lamb shwarma. The food took a little while to come out to us. The food was not bad at all. The beef shish kabob was actually pretty tasty. The shwarma had a bit too much gristle. The saffron rice was okay, nothing to write home about. Pita bread and hummus was good, didn't find it too oily, although I have heard complaints on that. The owner did even come by and give us extra pita bread. He also had us try the green sauce which wasn't too bad, it had a nice spice to it (though I had seen it earlier and commented that it looked old). The owner also mentioned that the beef was imported from some country like Australia and said it had no hormones. That I didn't believe, this coming from the owner who had already scammed us into buying drinks and gratuity. 

One good note from the owning scamming us to get drinks was trying the sour cherry iced tea. That was delicious. I'm not normally an iced tea drinker as I prefer more sugary drinks but this was a great blend of flavor and light taste. Definitely the best part of the experience.

Though, the place is only going to get two stars however. The fact that the owner scammed us into spending more money gives insight on how the whole operation is run. It's true, businesses that run Groupons do NOT make money of those. They actually are more likely to lose money in the short term as they are giving away food. The point of this is to increase foot traffic and get people in the door and have a nice experience so they can tell their friends. 

What the owner is doing is alienating the people who do use these deals. This may be acceptable in the short term, but in the long term, they will have very little repeat business.

Plus, this location had been on Dirty Dining only a month previously, where he mentioned that some of the meat is pre cooked (so why would he talk about the importation of great beef if it's imported?) and the green sauce in that episode had been out for 11 days. Just seems like the owner trying to talk his way out of things. 

I can understand where the owner is coming from. The strip mall where this restaurant is located is a dead zone. Nothing really survives in the space. The atmosphere around the location is abysmal and just down right spooky at time at how quiet it is. The inside of the actual restaurant is also like that, with the lack of patrons and the quietness of the music. 

Overall, the food wasn't bad and I would have been up for a return visit, but questionable tactics by ownership has really dampened any chance for that."
2,"Sorry. Wanted to like it but no. Not much to the pizza except the crust, and it was burnt. Even if the pizza had had a more appropriate portion of sauce, toppings to crust I still would have missed the pepperoni."
2,"Good food and decent service. However, 10 minutes after leaving the restaurant my fiancée realized she forgot her fleece Columbia jacket in her chair. I called the restaurant back to please ask the waitress if she picked it up. I could hear the waitress acting like she didn't know what a jacket was. Good food, but not really a fan of dishonest people. $10 tip and a new fleece Columbia jacket? She must be happy. Won't be coming back"
2,"As much as I love the coffee,  and the people are nice but my order is always wrong every single time.   I just can't waste my time driving there to get home and realize once again my order was incorrect again.  It's not a complicated order at all and they still never get right."
2,"Horrible food. I'm not quite sure what taste buds would suggest this was a great place to eat. My entire party was dissatisfied with the overall flavor of the food. It was very much least desirable.
Fried soft shell crab tasted like catfish. The jello had an almost rubbery texture. Ever had sushi that had too much sauce? Hibachi plate was overcooked. Children running around without supervision. Adults not saying ""excuse me"" while serving themselves and bumping into people.

All around an experience that won't be repeated."
2,"I always want this place to be better than what it is. The environment is welcoming and service is pretty good.  I do not like the red sauce at all.  It tastes like chef boyardee.  The pizza is just ""ok"". I have been several times, but it just doesn't get better unfortunately."
2,"We arrived at this location anticipating a delicious, quiet lunch. We were the only people eating. After the waitress took our order multiple times (she just couldn't understand what a grilled ham and cheese is.) After a bit, a few other employees meander in to hang out. They reak of cigarette and marijuana smoke. They're extremely loud, yelling, calling people ""Cracker."" We got our food, the bacon was burnt to a crisp, the waffle took forever. The bathroom was utterly filthy. We used to love coming here right after flying in but we will be looking for a new spot"
2,"No great.  Not horrible, but not really worth the expense.  I had a Signature facial here and a Relaxation massage.  I love my facials and love my massages, and have had plenty.  As someone new to Pittsburgh, I am looking for massage and facial experiences that leave no doubt in my mind as to whether they are worth the $$.  So there you have it.  Evolve is  trying to create a holistic health care environment, but I felt like the whole staff could benefit from going on a team-building retreat together.  The receptionist was lovely, but both the facial and massage practitioners left me feeling like they were going through the motions and were just people who came in, did a job, and went home.  When I go to a spa I like to feel like I am being welcomed into someone's home and being encouraged to totally relax and be pampered, not just coming in for a service.  They said all the right things, but the words felt hollow and the services were rushed and pro-forma."
2,"I'm very familiar with pizza in the style of Naples Italy.  I've eaten at many of Naples Italy's best pizzerias.  There are plenty of places in the states offering well executed versions of traditional Pizza Napoletana.  Novonta is not one of them.  The dough is too dense and doesn't have the proper flavor development.  The tomatoes were good, but dried out.  The handmade mozz was flavorless and I didn't like the way it looked when it melted.  Like burnt marshmallows.
I tried a few different pizzas and found fault with all of them.  On a pizza with Arugula and Prosciutto, we were served a dried out prosciutto that had been sliced too thick.  Another pizza with spicy salami and hot peppers had a decent flavor, but there wasn't enough salami.  Their basic Margherita was too dense, dry, and lacking flavor.
The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful.  Just a bunch of visually appealing textures and surfaces.  With all there is to look at in the space, you'll never be wishing there was a t.v. to stare at.  This is a new place, so maybe they'll dedicate more time to improving the pizza.  As is, I wouldn't recommend."
2,"After my FIRST visit to Flame Kabob, I wouldn't recommend this place. There MUST be some place in Vegas that serves outstanding Mediterranean food at a good value.  In this case, I searched online again and found out about Flame Kabob from Restaurant.com.  I subscribe to their service and wanted to use a $10 coupon.  The plan was to spend the required $15 to use the coupon, which should have covered the check.  

When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the POSTED prices varied from the ACTUAL prices.  The manager defiantly told me he had the right to change his prices anytime he chose.  While I agreed, I submitted he should probably update his menus.

Next, when I placed my order, the manager argued with me when I asked for a combo with NO fries or rice.  I just didn't want the carbs, and I didn't ask for anything ADDITIONAL.  This simple request seemed to be much-too-much, however; it didn't need to turn into a debate.

Afterwards, when I attempted to use my $10 discount certificate, the store manager scoffed at me, complaining how too many people want to use coupons...uh, then WHY do you use them as a marketing tool?!?!?!

Finally, while the food was tasty, the portions were a bit stingy, and I was soured by the whole encounter with the manager."
2,"I go through the drive thru, because of, well, convenience. But who doesn't? I ordered some donut holes and a half dozen donuts. I order 2 Boston Cream, 2 Double Chocolate, and 2 Lemon filled. I get home, and look in the box, and find 2 Boston Cream, 1 Double Chocolate, 1 nasty @$$ crueler, 1 blueberry cake, and 1 pumpkin spice cake. Wtf?! How is that anywhere close to my order? If you were out of $hit, maybe you should tell people!!"
2,"Since our last visit in in September 2006, business has dropped off and most of the dining is now curtained off.  The restaurant specializes in both paella and tapas..  We started off with a salad of apples, almonds, manchego cheese over organic greens (4), baked goat cheese in a rich tomato sauce (3.5) and dates wrapped in bacon (1.5).  We were disappointed by the dates which were overcooked and chewy.  I questioned the waiter and he confirmed that this is the way the dish is prepared.  We also ordered paella; mine was mixed seafood with shrimp, scallops, mussels and green beans.  My wife ordered the evening's special seafood paella with monkfish, beans and squash.  Each was visually unappealing suffering from a heavy hand with the tomato sauce and an absence of saffron (1)"
2,"I've been here once before and really enjoyed it. Huge buffet and good sushi too. Place is always packed so I must not be the only one who agrees. However I went tonight with a group of my friends and someone puked right beside our table. She couldn't even make it to the bathroom. So gross. Staff was apologetic and asked if we would like to move tables but we all decided to leave the restaurant right then and there. Id like to hope that the girl wasn't sick from the food, but not sure what else to think. I don't think I'll be returning."
2,Totally disappointed in this Dunkin Donuts as I purchased my coffee from Dunkin Donuts every single morning on my way to work. But today after a late lunch I decided to go grab a coffee I ordered one large Almond Joy iced coffee weighted at the window for 10 minutes just for someone to come to the window to collect my money after the lady came and collected the money we sat there for another 5 minutes just to get one coffee there was no one there there was no cars in front of us we were the only car why was the wait so long.
2,Absolutely hated the experience. The coffee was old. They forgot half the order so I had to get out of the car and go in. That's after I waited 10 minutes to order and get the food and I was the only person in line!
2,Es una tristeza que este lugar ya no se lo mismo en calidad de comida como ase unos años atrás .... Los precios en los tacos es de macizado caro por una tortilla sola y chica también la milanesa de pollo y de carne fueron un dolor de estomago se nota que usan el mismo aceite de cocina en toda la comida por el sabor de cochambre en la carne y pollo ... Qué lástima no poder dar una buena nota ...
2,"Very loud, very college-y, very crowded.  This is really not my scene, but if you like that kind of atmosphere, then it's perfect.  I'm not really crazy about the music they play on most occasions.  The drinks are just ok, nothing special.  There are many people who enjoy themselves here.

The staff always seems to help you pretty quickly and have always been friendly."
2,"I hate writing bad reviews. I actually never do but awhile back I was double charged for my services. I payed cash and then was charged on my card. My husband caught it just in time so I wasn't overdrawn in my account. 
That's a pretty big mistake. There was no apologies just "" oh she made a mistake "".  They did offer me 15% off my next service but after all that I had a bad experience so I didn't want to go back. I got refunded after a couple of phone calls.
Then I just received a GC for my birthday and since that incident .I called and explained what happened ( silence on the other end. ). I also said I wasn't coming back to the establishment.  You think being a higher end Spa their customer service would be better. Unfortunately this is not the case."
2,"I am totally disappointed at this store. They always run out of merchandise. Sunday afternoon when everyone goes out to eat and they never have what you want, it's fair that they offer you something else but you go exactly there for one reason. I hope the owner takes more care of his stores."
2,The bathroom was gross and not clean at all. There was trash and hair all over the sink. The staff working was rude and not timely with their delivery of the actual coffee. There only seems to be two staff working here and only one of them was actually working and serving customers. But the coffee was still really good.
2,"for starters..I almost fell on my rear entering. seated a little slow. waitress acted like we were inconveniencing her. bathrooms were disgusting. food was average. for filet of beef for $13, I expected more. tasted more like a food court meal. manager acknowledged the front door problem and brushed it off as a tile problem. not a solution. I didn't feel welcome and probably will never go back."
2,We waited a long time to give order ... and croissants which we ordered are over cooked and there black things on it ...and hash browns are too oily ...May be they are lack of staff ...
2,"Maybe I do not like Napolitan pizza. Second time we've tried them and seems to me overpriced, over garlicky, and skimpy toppings or flavor.  Why bother to choose a pizza? We tried 2 kinds...all meat and one with ham, artichokes, etc. there wasn't much of anything on either. I stumbled onto two very thin slices of ham and just hits of mushroom and artichoke.  The two pizzas tasted the alike. Two pizzas, no drinks or salads $35! Not worth it in my opinion."
2,"My girlfriend and I went with high Eggspecations, instead we left with our plates half full. Also my waitress was very insistant about giving her a tip, even though her service was very average."
2,"Sorry guys ,but dosnt matter how drunk you are ,food taste like sh... I like orange chicken but here disaster"
2,"Having stayed in hundreds of hotels around the world, this was sub par. The rooms have terrible lighting for reading. I had to ask 3 times for a floor lamp to be brought to my room. And the lamp had a black shade! Sometimes too edgy doesn't work! Also, there are no taxis waiting at the hotel, so they  encourage a private car which is much more expensive. Maybe try UBER. The mini bar is the one that if you lift up anything, you will be charged. There are not many people working the lobby desk, so there may be a wait. I don't know about the other hotels, but the Ritz would be my choice."
2,For this to be a raw bar it takes them forever to get your food! I have here for 45 minutes and I still haven't received my food
2,"wow, well lets just say it makes Panda express look like a fancy gourmet dinner.

I was starving and i wasn't craving anything while i was walking down Downtown Las Vegas. Actually me and my girlfriend couldn't decide what to eat so basically we ended up here. We saw the chinese food and it looked alright and took a chance anyway. We also saw the .99 cent shrimp cocktails so we got one of those too.

The chinese food was terrible, probably because it had been sitting on the heater for a while. The shrimp cocktail wasn't too bad and better than the chinese food."
2,"I know this will be the unpopular opinion. But get your bottles elsewhere and save yourself a trip.

Beer- great. No complaints. It's what got the review any stars at all.

Atmosphere- hipster. If that's your thing.

Service- GOODNESS. Terrible! We came here for the first time tonight after wanting to make it all the way out here forever. We got one beer from the bartender and that's the last time she spoke to us until screaming ""LAST NAAAME?!?!"" when we asked for our check. Not even a ""thanks for coming in"" or ""how was everything"" when she slid the check at us. Silence.

We got a burger since we have a long drive home and since their tacos were sold out. The burger comes, it's average, and there's no silverware or napkins. I ask for just a napkin, and the bartender says ""they're over there"" and points to a closed window. I walk clear across the bar and there's nothing. He's got to go in the back and get them. Clearly off-putting.

I know there's people out there that hear me when I say this place is frequented because it's popular right now. The flavor of the month. Ill continue to drink the beers, but I'll never come back to this unsafe neighborhood to drink beers in a garage with a bunch of pretentious, unwelcoming service people."
2,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 weeks.
Chris at the front desk was so nice and helpful. He always had smile on his face and was very accommodating.  Also, the person that help you carry your bags to your rooms (I think his name was Damian?) was super nice, too.
On the other hand, the other front desk guy (I didn't even bother to remember his name) was so rude and nasty. One time, I asked him to break $20 bill because of the valet, he didn't say anything (not even ""OK"" or ""Sure""), went in the back, came back and just threw the change on the desk. I didn't even hear one word from him. I never saw him with a smile in that 4 long weeks. As this hotel is Marriott group, don't they tell front desk employees to put fake smiles on their face even bad days??!!!
On Fridays and Saturdays, some party people check in to have parties in the rooms. Sometimes I heard screams and loud noises at 2 in the morning. So if you are thinking about staying here with your kids on a weekend, I would cancel it and stay in another hotel. 

No coffee machine in the room. Either room service or 1st floor lobby coffee service from 5am to 9am."
2,"Not too good, either food or value.  ""Deuces""  eggs and potatoes not cooked very well.  Sausage patties loaded with filler.  By comparison, coffee outrageous in price, with no refills!
Imagine a breakfast for $3.99 and non refillable coffee for $1.99.  Definitely not a good deal for cafeteria food."
2,"I blocked 20 rooms at the 9 for my wedding weekend.  My guests booked all 20 rooms, many of which stayed Friday and Saturday night. My now wife and I also stayed Friday and Saturday night. 

I'll start with the positives: 
- The hotel is in a good location
- the restaurants and bars at the hotel are pretty cool places to go to  but there is a huge caveat to that which will be detailed in the negatives
- the rooms are all suites which is nice

And now to the negatives....

Customer service was pretty rough.  It seems as if the Metropolitan focuses on telling you what you can't do versus what a hotel should be saying ""what can I do for you""  which is what the hospitality business is supposed to do.  

After our rehearsal dinner on Friday night the entire group that was staying at the hotel decided to go back to the rooftop bar for a drink.  There were about 20 of us.  We told the hotel staff we wanted to go up and they first said we needed to go get wrist bands from someone else.  That person gave us wristbands and then a staff members walked us over to some elevator to take us up to the bar.  We got to the bar and the door men told us we can't come in because one of the guests was wearing casual shoes.  They literally made 20 of us who were guests at their hotel turn around and go back down the elevator because one person was wearing Vans shoes.  The GM, Ahmed, ended up correcting the situation thankfully once we got downstairs and some back and forth was said between me and the hotel staff.  BTW - all of the staff said ""too bad"" until Ahmed jumped in and fixed the situation.  I thank him for that, but it is unfortunate that It took me escalating all the way to the GM for them to recognize they should take care of their customers who have 20 rooms occupied in their hotel.  
(my wife and I stayed at two other Marriott Autograph Collection hotels during our honeymoon after the wedding.  One in Venice, Italy and one in Milan, Italy.  Both of them upgraded our rooms because we were on our honeymoon.  And the one in Milan even sent up Prosecco and fresh fruit as a gift after we checked in.  When we checked in to the Metropolitan they didn't even acknowledge that it was our wedding.  No congratulations.  No upgrade and definitely no special treatment.)  

- Elevators - they are using some new age elevator system that is next to impossible to master in a weekend. It's honestly an extremely inefficient system that seems to be in there just to seem cool and different.  You have to choose your floor when you hit the elevator button (no up/down option). It then tells you which elevator to get on. Then if that elevator is missed or full you have to start all over again.  Everyone I saw at the elevators was having trouble with this system

-In room refrigerator - it's great to have a mini bar when you want to use it but it's also nice to have a refrigerator in your room. In these rooms you can't have both. If you move anything in the fridge you get charged for it.  There are sensors on all things in the fridge and if you so much as move a red bull from one place to another you will be charged for it.  Even if you don't consume it."
2,Its a nice place and I have been there couple of times before but I was disappoitnted with them last week.  It seems like they were way overbooked with Christmas parties and couldnt handle the crowd very well.  It seems like its not the best place to be during holidays as this place is too overwelmed.
2,Absolutely terrible service. Don't know how the staff got hired they are rude and slow and clearly don't care about what they're doing. Ignore customer orders all the while complaining about the challenges they face. Phil specifically was a huge downer with a negative attitude.
2,"Disappointing.  

Food: Flavors are extreme- seaweed salad was so salty and they re- dished it but still quite salty...we asked what it was dressed in thinking maybe overuse of aminos but our server was unsure.   Ate the 5 small pieces of hamachi that came with my small yuzu hamachi bowl and the spiraled cucumbers and long strips of carrots and left the rest because it was so acidic.  I LOVE acidic foods (hence why I ordered yuzu) but balance is needed in this dish. My partner ordered sliders (which didn't come on Hawaiian rolls as stated on menu) and the rainbow bowl and agreed that we will give them some time to work it out before maybe trying it again. (He was a little stuck on being served canned oranges though so not sure how soon that will be)

Service: Good. Our server seemed to be the only one so refills on water took a bit which is understandable but she was quick to try to help rectify the salad being overly salty and removed from check.

Ambiance: cute place but staff yelling across restaurant about the corn being cooked wrong then cleaning grill an hour before closing left a poor impression.  

In short, I am waiting on my room service now."
2,"$0.99 shrimp cocktail. Ever heard the phrase: you get what you pay for? Yuck. Just yuck. Too much shrimp sauce, too much celery, not enough shrimp for the insane amount of cocktail sauce in the cup. The presentation is beautiful, but I would have just preferred a few shrimp in a cup with a side of sauce.

Never again will I fall for any kind of seafood that's under $1.00."
2,Good service. Lots of parking. Good menu choices. EXTREMELY over priced.  Small portions.
2,"So my girlfriends and I wandered back to MGM and sat in Centrifuge, which was okay. It's expensive for an inner casino bar - trying to be cool and classy and hip. I ordered something fruity, argued with Mr. Harris about past transgressions. 

I'm not a fan of an actual bar within a casino - I prefer just the bar itself snaked against the wall, or drinking and gambling at the tables. Have something separate, with walls, and I'll be happier. Centrifuge had an attitude that I can't really put my finger on it - maybe it was the bartender wanting to go home, or having a judgment on us because we were drinking still. 

But...isn't that the point...? Don't you want us to drink...more?"
2,"I looked on the shelf and the place seemed well stocked, so I ordered a manhattan, a pretty safe drink I figured. What the bar tender brought over was a mashed up cherry with soda water and a teeny bit of whisky on top.  I mean, if he didn't know how to make a Manhattan he could have told me and given me a shot of something instead.  If you want a drink and relaxing evening, hang out at the water fountain in the lobby and you'll get a better drink."
2,"One of the most overrated hotels I've ever been too. The hotel is undoubtedly amazing in its architecture and decor. 

But the staff is atrocious. They all look totally amazeballs in their outfits, all the right ratio of hipster chic - but they weren't actually helpful when asked a question.

They dropped the ball on lots of things during our visit. They just opened, and maybe they need to work out their kinks, but at nearly $300 a night there were too many things missing. I would not recommend."
2,"I wanted to like this place; especially since it's down the street from my house- but I can't. As soon as a pulled-in I knew I wanted a mid-level wash but no sooner than I put in my request the attendant tried to upsell me like crazy. I went inside to pay for and wait for my car to be finished; little did I know that it would be nearly 40 minutes before I got my car back! UGH!!! Once my car was finally ready, as soon as I jumped in I noticed they did a half butt job on the vacuuming (for Pete sakes I could still easily see a French fry stuck between the seats-smh!). I'm willing to give this place another try only because I just got a coupon in a Money Mailer  but they better be faster or at least thoroughly clean my car if it is going to take that long."
2,"This review is long overdue but I used to go to meineke for an oil change. 

Which if you're not in a rush, and know you just need an oil change, they're ok.

But for auto repair work, I don't trust this location.

The last time I went here (2016), they lied about what needed to be fixed & tried to sell me on repairs I didn't need.

My gas tank had a hole/was leaking. They didn't even mention it. And also quoted me some ridiculous price for repairs.

It wasn't until I went to another auto shop that I found honest mechanics. 

Never coming back & I do not recommend getting repairs here. Reason for 2 stars is that I did get an oil change before with no issues & they can do basic stuff but buyer beware!"
2,"I had a great time at the Yelp Elite event Wednesday night, however, my experience at the bar prior to the event-and I truly feel bad for saying this since the event was amazing-involved some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I know Jake said he reads yelp reviews, which is why I'm writing this so he can take note of my personal experience and hopefully correct this so no one else has the same experience. Even my mom, who came with me to the event, said she felt bad for how I was being ignored repeatedly in favor of guests who came up to the bar long after me to order drinks. Basically, I walked up to the bar with money in hand, was looking at the beer list briefly, and quickly determined what I wanted. One particular bar tender (I'm choosing not to physically describe him but would be happy to if asked) made eye contact with me multiple times and never asked if I needed anything BUT asked the guys sitting next to where I was standing at the bar if they needed anything, then he walked right by me to a couple that JUST walked up to the bar when I had been standing there for AT LEAST 5-7 minutes not being served. He was more than friendly with them! This bartender was even doing a little cleaning behind the bar rather than coming to see if I needed anything as a (trying to be) paying customer! There was another bar tender who also never asked if I needed anything (meanwhile, I'm standing with the beer list in hand), but since he momentarily paused in front of me, I said (and after waiting 10 minutes, yes, I was a bit frustrated), ""Can I get a couple of drinks when someone gets a chance?"" I worked in the service industry previously for 10 years and I have learned to treat EVERYONE equally. I feel that I was being ignored, for whatever reason I'm not sure. Coincidentally, when my mom went up to the bar herself to get a drink prior to the event, both bartenders IMMEDIATELY came over to her. It just makes me wonder. ....... Good thing this was a Yelp event because if this was my only interaction/experience at this Voodoo location, I guarantee I would not be back, regardless of good beer or not."
2,"I've been there a few times - early in their ""just opened"" days and months later.  It still lacks atmosphere and seems to be resting on the quality of their beer; which, seems hit or miss as they play with recipes.  The idea for food from various food trucks that park outside is interesting.  Voodoo can make a go of it but need to craft their brewery's atmosphere a bit more."
2,"I came here on a previous trip to Vegas and thought the food was ok. I decided to give it a second try, but was once again disappointed. The teriyaki chicken had little flavor and was very fatty, the orange chicken did not convince either. The only acceptable item was the chow mein. 
The only reason this place deserves 2 stars is for its friendly personnel and the low prices."
2,At any point during my stay at this property I felt like some serious stuff was about to go down.  If you are into that pseudo gangsta vibe - stay here.
2,"I think for a place to eat it suffices, it's not horrible, but nothing so spectacular as to write home about either.. 

It's unapologetically bland, in service, taste, and decor. I had the oxtail soup, because I was having joint pain, and the gristle is supposed to be like natural glucosamine and chrondroitin.. Anyway, I digress.. it was barely fall off the bone. Not tender, maybe I had the first of a new pot. It was a lot of work and sticky afterwards. Tired from being up all night I think most people would not be up for it. I was in for some work. Paid $10 for it too.. Maybe should have had it at the California Casino instead.. I don't recommend it unless you need to eat immediately to get back to your table or game. Maybe any of the egg combos would fare better. They made a girl an omelet of some sort while I was there. The breakfast combo I thought was a bit steep. It's not cheap, but not expensive. The days of deals in Vegas seem to be gone.."
2,"I never would have given this place a second thought but my mother and brother saw the $0.99 shrimp cocktail. So we had to go in. It's this weird little food court looking place inside the Freemont Hotel and Casino. 

Customer service was pretty decent. I had no complaints there. The woman working wasn't terribly social, but she wasn't the stereotypical Angry Asian Lady either. She was pretty nice, actually. So was the woman cleaning tables. 

My mother and brother ordered the shrimp cocktail after seeing the sign outside. It's shrimp for $0.99. Somehow I wouldn't expect spectacular. They didn't get spectacular either. I don't eat seafood, so I have no opinion on how it tasted. But they got it, and mixed the sauce and whatever shredded up green stuff was in there in too. Big complaint was it was too spicy for both of them. 

They asked one employee there if they could rinse the shrimp off and get that horrible sauce off, not wanting to waste food/product. The waitress, I suppose you could call her, looked at us strangely. Like she had no idea what a strainer was or even how to rinse something off. Some people can burn water, and I would presume she is one of those. Anyway, instead of rinsing the yucky sauce off, she just got them two new shrimp cocktails and they didn't mix it into the sauce again. 

Customer service was good, I had no complaints there. Food was so-so. I looked at everything they had out on the line, and nothing looked exciting. I'm not a big fan of Chinese food though either. 

Would I return? No. It's not a place that screams anything special to me. Like I said, had we not noticed the sign and my family wanted to try it, I would've walked right by it and kept going. 

Review 74 of 2017."
2,"I love the hotdogs i get it all the time, but the rest of the menue its bogus. I mean i tried the  two item combo and had the dried noodles and over done beef broccoli. Was sad to taste that but ohhh well you live and learn i guess."
2,"I was so excited to try Hi Tide after seeing their Lobster Fest event advertised on multiple Charlotte Foodie instagrams. When we arrived it was busy, but not crazy. We ordered a lobster roll and poke bowl and were given a playing card as a number (which seemed to be very confusing for the food runners - they had to come close to every table just to see the specific card). We waited...we waited some more...people came, ate, and left and we still were not fed. After 45 minutes of becoming increasingly hungry and impatient I asked the female food-runner to confirm that our food was coming. She looked very flustered and said ""I'll check hold on...I don't get paid enough for this"". She checked and let us know she told the manager as she continued to bustle around complaining to different diners about how little she was being paid which was odd. After another 10-15 minutes the manager came over and let us know that the ticket didn't make it to the kitchen for whatever reason and kept saying he had no idea what happened (assuring...a manager who has no idea what happened or how to handle it). After another few minutes he put the food in front of us and instead of offering a concession or making any real effort to mitigate our inconvenience he said ""here's a cookie to smooth you over"" and walked away. ""To smooth you over""...really? Maybe I am a little more conscious of customer service and hospitality having worked in hospitality and property management, but I was pretty shocked. 

The redeeming factor for Hi Tide is that their food was pretty good. Not the best Poke I've ever had but possibly near-best in Charlotte. I just don't know if I will feel right patronizing a restaurant with such poor customer service. I'm disappointed for sure...I still posted pictures of the food on @KenzieAteWhat because it looked nice (hence the 2 stars)."
2,"Offering everything from Chinese food to pizza to burgers, this eatery is good if you need something in a hurry and don't have high expectations.
Quite frankly, I haven't dared try the Chinese food.  I did have a cheeseburger and shrimp cocktail recently.  The shrimp cocktail, at 99 cents, is a bargain and is much improved over the one I had here years ago.  The burger was over cooked, and I had a fairly long wait to be served with my burger."
2,Compared to other jack astors that i have been to throughout the city my experience in this location wasnt that good. I have been here twice and got my usual appetizer the cheesy bread and my medium new york steak. Start of with the bread. I could tell it wasnt as fresh as i would expect due to my previous experience at other locations. It tasted like it was heated up in the microwave. Now for the steak it wasnt that hot when i got it and it was cooked at the wrong temperature. I got it medium rare rather than medium. Service wasnt special too. Would try not to go there anymore.
2,I really liked the job they did when I first came here about a year ago... They have gone down hill since then.  I did speak to the manager because the inside of my car hadn't even looked like it was touched. He did take it back and vacuum it.  Not sure I will come back at $25 a visit.
2,"I ordered a round of drinks and left my tab open at the bar.  When I came back to close it, one of the bartenders acted like he didn't see my credit card.  I even saw it and told him that was mine but he still didn't want to give me back my credit card after giving him my ID.  Poor service!"
2,"Not the worst food that I've ever had, but quite far from the best. It was greasy and my broccoli was cold. Mushrooms had an odd texture. I wouldn't eat there again if I had a choice. The orange chicken and fried rice were good, but I wouldn't recommend the noodles. They offer sushi. It looked like it has been there for days. They do have food other than the Chinese food."
2,"It breaks my heart to review one of my once favorite places with a low star review. I am just extremely disappointed with the service and food quality the last few times I have visited HiTide. 

I order takeout pretty often and I feel that I always get a smaller portion, items are often forgotten on my build your own bowls and just not as much love given to my dish. 

This week we decided to go sit down and see if the quality of the food was better. My fiancé just had knee surgery so he is on crutches, when we arrived the place was VERY busy. (Side note: it doesn't take much for it to be very busy because the place is way too small) Either way I came in to hunt for a low chair for my fiancé because he can't sit at the high tops or stand for long. I saw a table in the far corner that only had one chair and wasn't being used. My fiancé sat down and we were approached by a server and told they were on a wait. I explain my fiancé's knee, we weren't trying to cut the line but it was obvious that this table wasn't being used since they didn't have enough chairs to go around. We were treated quiet rudely. No one every returned to our table to put us on the wait, I approached the counter and said we can just place a togo order since my fiancé can't stand and y'all are on a wait. I was told no it's ok y'all sit there and we will be with you shortly. 

Eventually our sever came over. He seemed flustered by the ""lobster roll special"" rush. We explained that we would do oysters to start, they were out of several on the board but we order 2 of each for a sampler. My server told us ""we really needed to go ahead and put our food in because it will take awhile"". We ordered our poke bowls as well and then next thing you know our bowls are on the table without or oyster app. I asked if he had forgotten to ring it in and they said oysters take a long time to prepare. (Mhm really? Shucking 8 oysters doesn't take long but ok) My fiancés bowl was wrong, it was suppose to be half portions of two fishes and it wasn't plus a few ingredients left off. Then a few minutes later we were basically done with our dinner and the app of oysters shows up. The, what I believe was the manager, sat them down and walked off. She didn't tell me which oysters were which or tell me about the sauces or anything. Eventually our server comes back and we ask him. He didn't know either and had to go ask. Then I said ""I don't see any horseradish, May I please have some?"" The server points at a ramekin of ice ""it's right there"" like I am stupid or something. Apparently it was horseradish ice but how was I to know that??? Overall it was an awful experience and my fiancé has sworn that we won't ""waste our money here again"". 

I personally haven't sworn it off completely but I think they are really losing the spark they had upon opening! Poke places are opening all over these days... the competition's hot on their tails!"
2,"*WARNING* Scammer waitress! - I'll get into the actual food review in a minute but felt I had to address this in the beginning. I'm also really not one to complain about service since I like to give people the benefit of a doubt or cut them some slack but this waitress was just shady af. 

Just got back from a night out with a group of friends and a waitress by the name of Vikki K. approached our table. Her attitude right away rubbed me the wrong way as she had asked in a rather irritable tone ""Are you guys going to dine in or have drinks or order sporadically?"". So we had told her probably the latter as we were expecting more people. Then she said after sighing ""OK... Good to know."" First of all, if you're not mentally prepared to wait on two tables for a group, then either trade with someone or ask for help, but don't give your customers that type of attitude. Or maybe even DON'T BE A WAITRESS! We are a group of friends in the hospitality field for a luxury hotel chain so we know what and how customer service should be. 

Anyway, the night went on and people came in at various times. Kitchen staff were great and the food came pretty quick. I had the Hold the Beef burger which is a vegetarian burger and the quality at this location wasn't as good as when I had it at Scarborough Town Centre location. Still I enjoyed it a bit so I'd give that a 3/5.

Now comes the bill. Although we were considered a large group, not everyone ate and also everyone had individual bills. How the bill was to be divided up, was never discussed with Vikki K, but it is pretty common that bills are split individually, so they were. Here's the shady part: she added service charge to every single bill. This was only noticed later on when we had already paid our bills. Before the realization, though, I did notice that she was hovering over my shoulder when I was paying my bills on the debit machine. As soon as they were paid, she dipped pretty quickly and pretty much disappeared after. 

It's just such a shame that someone would go to such level in order to ""make a living"". If her service and attitude were outstanding from the beginning, then I have no problem giving a bigger tip. But she basically robbed our entire group. The only time she was really being extremely nice was when she was pretty much eyeing my friend's man. He pretty much got the best service. 

If you do go here with a group, be sure to check your bills twice and have someone else serve you.

_________________________________________________________________

Update: I had spoken with the Bar Manager the following day and he was most apologetic.  He listened intently and to extend his apologies, he had sent some vouchers right away.  Receiving vouchers was never my intention however he insisted that he send some.  I personally feel that the original review written above should remain posted just so costumers are completely aware of this.  It has been a few weeks so who knows if the waitress is still around."
2,"I got my car washed here about 3 months ago and for being about twice the price of most of the car washes in the area they did a  pretty sloppy job. Thought maybe they had a bad day so I decided to give them a second chance today (9/21/13). Today was even worse than the last time. My car was already pretty clean just dusty from not being washed for a couple of weeks. When they said it was ready I looked inside and they had forgot to wipe down the inside of the car. Dash still had dust, interior door panels not wiped down and the cup holders hadn't been touched. I had already tipped the employee who had cleaned and he went on to another car. I asked another employee if they had a clean rag so I could wipe down the interior. As I'm doing this the Manager, a younger white guy with a buzz cut comes to me and says I have to: ""get my car out of there"". I told him they didn't wipe down the inside of the car and he gives me this dirty pissed off look, closes my door and just walks off.  Won't be back a third time, too many other choices out there. Don't know if the owner or upper management reads these reviews but you might want to pass on to your management on the line to check the employees work and not be rude to customers who pay $22.00 dollars to get a pretty substandard car wash."
2,"We went shopping at Shops at Don Mills. Come lunch time, we walked towards Jack Astor where there are no construction. Can't stand the dust and noise whatever they are building near Bier Market and Joe's.  So here we are at Jack Astor's. I asked if their coffee is good. Yes! They only serve Starbucks. Five star for that. But my order of a grilled chicken quesadillas came in soggy. Very disappointing. The Brie burger is grilled perfect. No complaints on that. The sweet potato fries are extra charge. Overall, not bad. But may not come back here for awhile."
2,"I don't usually give one star, and I won't because the music is good. Seriously $19.50 for 2 beers while we are gambling at your bar? Come On guys, clearly we will head out to another casino as soon as these beers are done. Don't recommend if you want to spend an evening chilling at the bar, but hey if you want to give your money away, come on over!"
2,"Heard a great deal about this place. Had some friends in town and wanted to treat them to someplace a little fancy. It's right in Cleveland and seems like a nice spot. 
When I first walked in on a Saturday at 7pm, I was kind of surprised it wasn't that busy. We had reservations but apparently they weren't needed. The bar looked a bit small and had 1 couple sitting there. The ambiance was plain and seemed a bit old and worn. 
Menu was small and the service was slow! Considering nobody was there you would think they would be faster. I'm guessing the staff was sluggish that night because when we walked in there were dirty tables and they stayed dirty for most of the evening. Seemed like two managers were there and obviously didn't care. But the most surprising thing about this spot was the price! The food was good and the drinks were okay but not for the price. This place is overpriced for the service you get. Not sure I'll be back. You're better off having dinner and drinks on East 4th street if you're heading to the city. Go to Lola's, blows this joint away!"
2,"They could use some more healthy options, but they do have a fruit platter, in a pinch its one of the few healthy things you can eat on fremont street. 

However I go here usually to grab a spam musubi, or a graveyard special. Careful, the spam musubi is thrown into the microwave inside plastic wrap so its super hot when you get it. steam can burn!   
 
I like their chinese food too but unless you get the combo, its kind of expensive. 

footlong hot dog and coke is a good deal though. and after midnight specials."
2,"Really bad dry stale bland food. Cornbread comes out cold. Hot dogs look contaminated. For the quality of food here everything should be $3.99 or less, especially the tired ""Chinese food"".  One good thing - which makes it 2 stars instead of 1 was the chicken wings. Sure, they were deep fried from frozen but even that and the hot sauce they provide was better than the chinese food which is part of their namesake. Also nice honest employees who agree the hot dogs look bad."
2,"Overpriced and service is lackluster. 
I mean, the only wait staff we had checked in with us once then went on break for 2 rounds. Seriously? Maybe it was an ""off"" night for Centrifuge, but I certainly wont be visiting again."
2,"Not ideal for business travelers - no desk and reeks of swingers club feel.  Art work is all of naked women, room is dark and what's worse - DIRTY.  My trash can had a woman's makeup debris; I found a hair on the edge of the bed.  The room itself just looks ""rough"", chipped furniture, dirty cracks, oh and the patched wall in the entry!  

Room service - the bottle of Tabasco sauce was OPEN.  Sadly, I didn't notice this until I had already picked through the breakfast.  Also, the English muffin is more of a dense bread - not light and fluffy if that's what you are expecting.  Also, expect an additional $5 delivery fee, plus tip included.  So your $15 omelette me coffee just became a $42 breakfast.  

I would not recommend this place unless you are coming to get laid or party."
2,"""You Get What You Pay For""

My previous review was a little over the top for this cafeteria. This time we had egg roll and saimin. The saimin is overpriced, and tasteless, even with added soy sauce. The egg roll, average. We would think twice about going back, even though the location is convenient for us."
2,"I had the 2 choice meal with chow mein.

The orange chicken was just alright and the beef broccoli was bland.  The noodles were also pretty tasteless. 

Tables were plentiful and clean.  Service was polite, friendly and quick.

Even buying the meal with player club points seemed like a waste.  There are better deals and food within walking distance.

Do yourself a favor an don't be lazy.. find a meal worth your time. :)"
2,"It just wasn't good.
 
I've been here once before and enjoyed it.  It's gone downhill since. They really seem to have cut corners and cut quality. 

I'll start with the one good thing - the oysters. They tasted to be of high quality and were well cleaned.

There is nothing else positive to say.  

The service was horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  Not rude, just inept.  We were there Forever.  We had to ask about our food several times.  We had to go to the counter to pay.  It was So bad. 

The poke bowl:  It tasted like fast food quality poke. The quality was much better last time.  There wasn't much fish, mostly filler.  And the fish that was there was decidedly ""meh"".  

We also ordered the poke nachos as an appetizer.  It came out 30 minutes after the poke bowl.  Yeah, 30 minutes.  The people across the table had come in well after us, eaten, paid, and left before this dish of suck showed up.

Here's were things get really Taco Bell.... the ""nachos"" were among the greasiest, fattiest, piles of excrement that I have come across.  Obviously, I'm not thinking ""healthy"" when I order anything that has the term ""nachos"" in it. But the polar opposite of the clean cuisine I'm looking for when I go out for seafood.  

We just wanted to get out of there after we tasted the grease bomb nachos.  Alas... no server was present after waiting for 20 minutes."
2,"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     28/100

I've been here a few times while at the Fremont Casino, it's bleh. I've had better. 

One great thing about this place is the fast service and convenience if you're at the Fremont. 

What we ordered last night: 
- Sweet and Sour Chicken (sauce on the side) - I did not like the taste and it looked weird. 
- Spam Musubi - Basic spam musubi that no one finished. 
- Shrimp cocktail - small shrimp, in a small cup -- but it made my drunk uncle so happy. haha 

Everything was freshly fried. There wasn't a long wait and the drunks were happy."
2,"I don't know how to give a star rating on this location, I was in between 2-3 stars but since more then half of the times I have gone to this location are horrific, I think a 2 star is being generous.

I did however experience one of the best steaks here, on a busy weekend night, go figure! So when I decided to go back on a Monday night you would think the same meal could be duplicated, ummm think again!

Absolutely everything came out wrong, so backwards you would not believe and the place was barely busy..

Asked for the mushrooms on the side, of course they came ON the steak and the fried onions were put on the side instead. I personally would not have got the mushrooms at all but the boyfriend likes them and ordered the same steak so he  wanted my mushrooms, no problem for me as long as they are nowhere near my food!

Now for his steak, he ordered the bigger size (10oz) medium-well and it came out blood pink! umm, no thinks I think I will pass and don't even bother getting it put back on the grill because it will still come out wrong!

Now back to my steak that was re-made. I usually never want to get my food re-made because it will always be cooked rushed, even when you tell them not to rush it because you just want it right, like it should have been the first time. Of course the steak came out like a hockey pock the second time around and we ended up not having dinner and just cutting our loses...

You can take your chance, but 9 times out of 10 it will be wrong..

Oh hey, they are coming out with yet another menu change on the 20th of this month (October 2015) and are removing more of the popular items like the steak fajita after finally switching back to flank steak from sirloin (who wants a sirloin fajita?) I am so looking forward to the change, ummm yeah, right...."
2,"All sizzle, little steak.

Having just received my bill for an event I ran at The 9 (with a less than stellar experience), I thought I'd check out the reviews.  It's funny to see how they lay down - either ""OMG - Best hotel ever"", or ""Worst night of my life"".  I think that's the way it is with The 9 and your experience comes down to what your expectations are.

Full disclosure - I didn't stay at the hotel, but I did run an upscale event.  Couple months of planning, close to 100 guests, bar and food catering and interactions with multiple hotel representatives during the planning process.

Bottom line - if you're in it for the look and the hype, The 9 is a good choice.  It's a gorgeous hotel, with multiple high priced bars and restaurants, including the very cool Vault nightclub in the basement. 

Peel back the cover and things aren't so great.  Cold catered food (not good when it's a slider bar) delivered 1/2 hour early, total miscommunication (maybe no communication) between staff you interact with.  I'm guessing their back office is either underfunded or not important to them.  I showed up at my space (the private theater, lobby area and three conference rooms), and there were two people hanging art on the wall.  While my guests were showing up!  They said no one at the hotel told them there was an event going on and weren't going to move.  The two hotel employees that said they would be around all night and available to help resolve issues were nowhere to be found.

Add in no signage keeping random guests from wandering into our event and it all left a sour taste in my mouth.  Luckily the hotel looks great and since my guests weren't eating or staying there they gave high marks overall.  Oh - except for the TWENTY dollar valet charges.  The hotel is very over-priced.  I get they are trying to set themselves up as a premium location, but you also have to be sensitive to what is appropriate locally.  I travel all over the country and this place is definitely over-priced.  If they delivered on their promise, I might feel different.  Comparing them to high end places in downtown Chicago, I get better service, better food, higher overall quality for less cost.  

Sorry to sound so negative - it really is a gorgeous hotel and I hope it isn't a victim of all these issues.  But when you spend $10K for an afternoon meeting, you get to see a different side of the hotel and the side I saw needed a lot of work."
2,"I went there for the first time today.  Not knowing what to expect I just wanted an outside wash to see how well they did with the idea if it was good I would be back.  I have a crew cab Chevrolet Dually which is one reason I brought it here since they can do dually's.  Well they had a special and $10 off the top of the line service so I thought why not.  It took about 30-45 min which would have been fine but when I wen out I had to have them wipe down the running boards as they were still dirty.  My mistake was giving them the tip before looking it over more.  The retailer walked away as I walked around the front and found a bumper full of water spots of which I wiped off.  Upon further inspection they only put armorall on only in spots on the door leaving all sorts of sand and dirt behind.  The dash is still dirty, and water spots all over the chrome on the back bumper.  Road crime is still on the wheels etc. for a $49.99 wash I would have expected much more.  They asked if I had a fifth wheel trailer and said they would be glad to wash and wax it for about $240 I said we will see how this goes.
Do you want to guess what the probability is that I will be doing $240 worth of business with this car wash again?
I could have gone to one of their sister washes that is closer to the house and hand a hand wash for the same amount but guess there is still no guarantee it would be any better. No one seems to take pride in what they do anymore."
2,"High school cafeteria food quality to match the abundant number of waitresses dressed in school girl kilts.  My hamburger was tasteless.  Likeaphenomena liked her Asian Chicken Salad and the Little K managed to slurp down half her beer and cheddar soup.  

Entertainment was provided by the antics in the kitchen.  My chair pointed directly into the path of the kitchen entrance  and before long I was transfixed by my own personal viewing of Kitchen Confidential. The chef was fortified by a can of Red Bull and an assistant helped himself to fries waiting for pick-up.  Perhaps that's why half my portion cup of fries was empty?  And who knew that you could wipe out a dirty plate with a serviette and use it again?  Sorry, but no.  The Little K, who has official kitchen restaurant experience, told me that I should relax and enjoy the exposure to extra germs.  A bonus: the night's experience might help me develop new antibodies for the next super-bug to come along."
2,"Disappointed!  Had an appointment for an oil change at 1100. I arrived at 1030 and completed all necessary paperwork which took about 5 minutes. I was told it would be done in about an hour. I walked over to one of the many fast food places and had a bite to eat. I returned back to the shop about 1115 and my vehicle was still in the parking lot. So I waited and waited. At 1145 I asked how much longer my vehicle would before it would get the oil change?  I was told that they were going to to it right away that they were busy and lost track of time. When asked how long it was going to take I was told 30-45 minutes more to complete.  I was unable to wait that long, so I retrieved my keys and left. I wish to add that the employees were nice and were not rude in any way and apologized for the unnecessary long wait"
2,"I heard about their sale on Lobster Rolls (must have been after all the great news about Cousins Lobster in Charlotte because the price is now slightly less) so my wife and I went in. 
3 tables and rest long high tops which is fine but for such a small restaurant they allowed people waiting on take out orders to sit at the tables. That made no sense at all.
I love Poke and I'm sorry to say that this was not good. I would stay with CO, Poke Cafe, or Cowfish.
The place was pretty but the vibe unfortunately was not good and neither was the food."
2,"food is not great here , usually cold / luke warm at this location
in general Astors food has been getting worst 
too bad"
2,"Returned here last night for a quick dinner.
The table we had by the door was right under the a/c and it was freezing. We asked the waitress 2 times and the manager once and it still was freezing. Thanks for the cold environment. It also made our food cold.
I had the steak fajitas , and it is getting smaller and the price is getting smaller.
The whole restaurant was not busy so they could have provided better service and comfort. We had to go to another table for our plates and the waitress didn't ask for water refills .
Meh:("
2,"Do you remember that chinese place at the mall from wherever you come from?? This probably doesn't match up to it.  Located in the Fremont Casino, this is the perfect stop if you are too tired to walk across the street."
2,nice staff..disgusting food. I had an upset stomach after eating that crap.
2,"My girlfriend and I came late one evening and found that the service was lacking. 
I had asked for no onions in my food which was okey by the waitress and as my food arrived it had onions but replaced 20 mins later. 
My girlfriends pop was flat two times but was replaced again taking up 15 mins. 
Her hand-burger was cold and we were a little angry at sending stuff back so she ate it cold and in her her words 
(it was cold but yummy)
The waitress was more than helping and always had a smile which brought the experience up for us. This was my second Jack Astros ive been two.

Id give it 2 1/2 stars but it does not allow it ."
2,"The bar is dead !! And for good reason, the bartender is a royal prick. Rude to everyone. Even though your paying $23 for a beer and a vodka on the rocks. 
The Mgr did put our game of choice on. 
When all the other bars are packed you gotta wonder why this one is dead."
2,"Just stayed here for a two day conference from May 20-22.  Overall, my experience was... meh--just ok.  After seeing all of the positive reviews and high ratings I had high expectations about the Metro at the 9, but in reality my stay here was nothing special.  

Pros: 
-the valet guys were very nice and customer service oriented along with the bellhop (guy in fedora) and the Romanian concierge with the beard.  
-although the elevator system is very modern and a lot of people complain about it in their reviews, I did enjoy it and it seemed to significantly reduce wait time for elevators even when there is a large crowd heading toward them.  
-beds are nice and firm.
-two tvs in a standard double queen room.
-quick room service delivery.

Cons:
-No coffee or hot water kettle in the rooms. 
-No room in the mini fridge for guests to use. 
-My room on the 11th floor was apparently immediately below the roof top bar that was blasting music which made for a not so stellar evening when I was trying to relax after an all day conference. 
-My room also had a connecting door to the next unit which translated to hearing the couple next door bickering. 
-Housekeeping was slow.
-The food at the 2nd floor lounge bar was mediocre. 

Overall, I'm not certain that I would stay here again."
2,"The food is okay, but honestly for the amount you're spending you're way better off going somewhere else. The portions are pretty sad."
2,"In two years I have been there two times. First time the wash was ok, but took over an hour.
Went there yesterday. The salesperson greeted me with ""What's Up"". Asked if I wanted a wash or detail, I said wash, what do you recommend, he said the ultimate package.  When I went to ask him how much and what it included he had already went and imputed the order. I looked up and saw it was $50.00 and backed out. AS I was leaving he looked at me as if, ""What's up"".'
To sum it up overly aggressive, rude sales person, long wait time and mediocre wash."
2,"Ok place to hang out for a quick drink but if you actually want to get comped drinks for playing video blackjack/poker, forget it after one. We played for quite a while but even with putting more $20's into the machine (I was losing, boo!), the waitresses seemed to make a point of ignoring us. So no, not really a favorite place to hang in Vegas."
2,"Exploring microbreweries today; the Voodoo Brewery was our first stop.   Taps not working properly and staff seemed a bit baffled. Multiple other customers waited on before us.   Finally after a sleepy looking 2nd bartender appeared, we had to request that he wait on us as he was standing behind the bar unfocused.  Fortunately when we were served, the beer met our expectations."
2,So here is my view and I rarely stay at places that disappoint. While the hotel is nice and people are friendly my point of view is based on the fact that a simple situation happened that shouldn't have occurred. It's all about house keeping. For some reason they decided to ignore our room if we chose to have breakfast at 10:00. This happened 2 days in a row. So yes a do not disturb sign was out till then. The hotel read that as an all day sign. When we would return to our room at 6:00 pm our room still didn't have housekeeping service. While this may not be a big deal for some it is not something we were used to in this type of hotel. We wanted to return to our room for a rest with no thought which is the point of a vacation. Me and my wife aren't divas so if that is their way of operating just let us know up front and we will pick another place. They did try to appease use but it was with 2 $10 drink tickets. Each drink we are willing to pay for cost $18 so we owed money on that. The other remedy was points attached to the hotel...SERIOUSLY??
2,"Been bringing my Toyota here for some time. Came here today & asked for the $19.99 oil change.   The guy shoots back that I HAD to have a $65 synthetic oil change.  Ummm, no I don't.   Just cause I have boobs doesn't mean you get to upsell me.  Some boob owners happen to be mechanics who only come here because they're not allowed to do oil changes at their apartment complex.  But, hey, my rent just went up $88, so guess I'll do it there anyway.  You can keep the $45 upsell."
2,"I had a lobster roll to go.  It was a very small portion of lobster and was not mixed with the other ingredients. The roll itself was small and didn't seem to have been buttered or heated. The container was filled with lots of potato chips to make up for small lobster roll.
The price was extremely high for the portion size.
If I go again I would try something else."
2,"Last time I was there my wife, son and I waited forever for someone to take our order. Then, the food (all of it) was either made incorrectly or ice cold. The place was not busy. They did a few things to try to resolve the issues but by this point, we had already been there for hours and just wanted to leave. They did apologize and remove SOME of the food from the bill. Still, I paid lots of money and left hungry and annoyed. If you ask me.... you want a beer while watching the game... this is your place. Want to eat with your family... go somewhere else."
2,"After attending the second day of LIB (Life if Beautiful festival) we were starving
the three of us didn't quite know what to eat since almost every restaurant on Fremont Street was either packed to the walls or there was a long wait to get a table. On the suggestion of Minh's finding, we decided to try this joint out. Walking through Fremont Hotel, you really get to see just what kind of people downtown Vegas attracts after midnight (bleh). We arrived at our dinner destination. A) It was not to busy. B) there were a lot of seniors, local folks and some sketchy people either in line to order or already seated and enjoying a hearty meal of congealed slop. 

We looked over the menu and then at the hot plates of hopefully editable food. Prices are definitely budget friendly. After saying a quick prayer to the food gods, we grabbed a table then got in line to place our order!

The lady behind the counter reminded me of an ex cafeteria worker as it was her business to get the order and slop whatever it was onto a plate then send you on your way to the cashier!

Taking my chances, I ordered Orange Chicken and some Eggrolls. She handed me my plate and said you can pay at the register. 

The orange chicken had a funny taste (as it was old or reheated) the sauce was super thick and sticky. I still ate it and was sort full after six big pieces. Now the eggrolls looked pretty inviting but sadly, they fell short of taste. To me the roll tasted like an old shoe mixed with off brand spices. People of yelp, whatever you do... do not get the sauce! 

The only thing I can report about our little adventure is that the three of us did not get food poisoning! 

If you are hungry, skip this place and just order a dozen donuts from dunkin donuts, which is next door to them!"
2,"classic car spa was my favorite car wash till now, it is now cobblestone.. which i hate...i had to have guy redo and wipe down all things that were left filthy, for 29.00 car wash this should never happen......i will not come here ever again... no cobblestone... they do very crappy job..."
2,"I went in for a oil change on my truck the light was on and they told me the code was po430,I looked at me paper work it's said all was great ,and so was the engine itself,when I looked up the code it said it was the o2 sensor, they told me they could repair it all I had to do was make an appointment and they would give me an estimate.  But wouldn't you know my light is off now because I got the oil changed. They try a get you everytime,this will be the last time I use them."
2,Run of the mill cheap Chinese fast food and other poor quality fast food grade food.
2,"I had heard about the 99 cent shrimp cocktails at this place for a long time now but had never gone to try it. Well this time we made it a point to give it a try. Hubby and I both got one while lil guy was fixated on the foot long hot dog and the spam musubi.

The foot long hot dog was a great deal. For about $2.50 you get the dog plus a drink. The spam musubi was also pretty tasty although the nori was chewy because the lady warmed it up, but the flavor was good.

The shrimp cocktail had way too much sauce on it. The shrimp was so overpowered by the sauce I couldn't even taste the shrimp. There is some chopped up lettuce, onions, celery at the bottom to give it flavor, but again, TOO much sauce. If you plan to go, ask the woman NOT to add more sauce to the already sauced cocktail. Otherwise, your shrimps will be drowning and crying out for help. The other thing is, these shrimps are so damn small you can barely taste them. Go to Costco and get their shrimp cocktail for $10 and eat to your heart's content!

This place also serves saimin and oxtail soup for those of you craving Hawaiian fare. Otherwise, they are a Chinese fast food place -- I wouldn't eat the Chinese here -- and it's only okay to just grab a snack. Don't plan on having a meal, you'll be disappointed."
2,"We were excited to hear of a Poke Bowl restaurant opening. Our experience was less than exciting. I ordered the Spicy Ahi and my husband had the Chile Yuzu Hamachi bowl. I received just the regular Ahi bowl that was bland and missing 2 ingredients, but fortunately they include extra bottles of sauces at the table. Unfortunately the sauces lacked flavor. My husband's bowl was missing 3 of the key ingredients including the sauce so he needed to add sauce at the table as well. His Hamachi was also still partially frozen.

It was very busy as it was lunch time on a Saturday, however the servers were not attentive: we were not asked how our meal was, tables were not cleared while new customers wandered around looking for seats; all the while the server stood at the counter folding napkins with her back to the restaurant. 

The music was also very loud and we were unable to talk except between songs."
2,"3 and a half stars? seriously? The patio looked appetizing so we decided to try it against my many misgivings.  
I was dying for a nice plate of fajitas but they came non-sizzling with the (5 small strips of) chicken simultaneously overcooked and not warm-- how is that even possible?  My wife's tuna rice bowl had the sauce painted on the side of the bowl but every component was off, the tuna under-seasoned, the rice under-cooked, a bunch of sliced ginger and quinoa to imitate an Asian dish but the worst was painter had forgotten to add sauce to the bowl.  Presumably a teenager in the kitchen being paid the new minimum wage?   And the draft beers arrived both stale and lukewarm.  Maybe Painter's General Manager turned up the heat on the keg cooler to save money?  As well, the calorie counts seemed a bit over-optimistically ridiculous (e.g. 1260 for the chicken fajitas) given the small portion sizes, though admittedly, with half left uneaten, the counts are bound to be way off.  Probably they don't factor that in with the menu's calorie counts.  A positive aspect I suppose.
Well, you live and learn when you randomly try restaurants, but in general, ""Shops on don mills"" is a wasteland for decent food (meaning edible)-- for good reason, since it's a tourist trap in the summer, and a nonexistence trap in the winter-- with possibly the exception of the Joeys which is up and down... 
But who are the people here who gave this 4 stars? Painter, was it you?"
2,Horrible expensive precooked microwaved food .. this location is my worst JA experience ever .. stick with the beer nothing else
2,"Second time to the Foodoo truck, second time I've been disappointed. Today I had the roast beef wrap. It was a huge wrap with a good amount of lettuce, tomato, cheese & horseradish, but only 1 thin, dried out piece of roast beef.  Last time I ordered the pierogies, they were good but there was a half of one, I thought it was mistake, but now I  don't know. I won't be giving them any more of my money."
2,"I had to wait for awhile before someone came and helped me, I almost left. The drink was ok but super expensive."
2,"Late night dining - 

After a night of casino hopping we ended up here, its in the Fremont Hotel & casino. Small little place, with only a couple of tables to sit at. I went with the Breakfast plate - rice, portuguese sausage, eggs, and a biscuit all for like $5 and they give a lot of portuguese sausage. The food was ehhh - the eggs were cold, the rice was cold - I'm sure we could've found a better place to eat at. 

The Fremont hotel does have a Dunkin Donuts there - so I was pretty stoked. But I would skip this place."
2,"Wow, what happened to Chico's Tacos, or Chico's Grill as it's now referred to as? I used to love this place, now I can't get this look of disdain off of my face. Lousy, lousy, lousy. Another former favorite of mine off the list. The carne asado was fatty and grisley (sp?), the chicken was the highlight of the meal, which is not saying much. Oh well."
2,It's ok but they are overcharging parents. $3 for a juice box?! 3.5 for a kids hot Chocolate? It's sad when you have to push prices this high.
2,"Food: 2.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Overall experience: 3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

After seeing pictures my friends took of a monstrocity of a poutine i just had to check out Big Cheese. Once you walk in, a small walkway guides you to the front where a giant menu board hangs over an open kitchen. After placing your order you can wait in their small dining area which could probably hold 10-15 people. There is more room in their back patio if you decide to stay and eat.

There are two sizes, small or large with about $2 difference. There portions are fairly large so I suggest getting a small if you want to avoid food coma for the rest of the day. The prices range from $7 - $10 and a choice between traditional, pork, chicken or beef products on top of the poutine. We went on the weekend so our fries came out pretty fast. We didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes.

My bf ordered a small Traditional Poutine ($5.49 - Quebec cheese curds and poutine sauce) and I had the small Porky Pig ($7.99) with double smoked bacon, italian sausage, sauteed mushrooms and carmalized onions.

The fries were crispy, covered with a decent amount of dime sized curds, and then heavily drenched with a flavourless gravy. My Porky Pig poutine was overly salty and looked like a mess. Instead of layering the toppings and curds within the fries, they just plopped it on top of the fries without combining all the toppings together. 

Overall, the Big Cheese is nothing to get overly excited for. I enjoy the novelty of having a wide variety of poutines, but the overall poutine lacked flavour and flare. I definitely had better!"
2,"Greasy, low quality, disgusting food. 

It's getting 2 stars because the waitress was friendly and the menu doesn't pull any punches: the pictures look exactly like what you get. But what you get is pretty bad. 

A friend ordered breakfast patties, they were maybe slightly larger than quarters. The hash browns had the consistency of greasy noodles. The signature waffle was just ok, but nowhere near good. 

How these chains are all over the country I have no idea. Sorry, America."
2,Over an hour for basic oil change and wash. There was only one vehicle in front of me for the oil change. Will not return.
2,"Had to wait one hour for our table and then another twenty minutes for our food.. Ridiculous wait.. And our drinks came half full, really disappointed"
2,"I agree with other reviews that the fries were under cooked and a little to firm. The gravy also did not have much flavour. For me the gravy either makes or breaks a poutine and this was a let-down. 

I purchased a large and it was very filling. I didn't finish the box but that may have also been partially due to the under cooked fries and lack of flavour in the gravy. 

I had the chipotle pulled pork (hog heaven) and the pork was delicious. I loved that pork. If I could get that chipotle pulled pork on a sandwich it would make for a great lunch. 

I may try it out again but I won't go out of my way to get this stuff. 

Hopefully they can improve on the key ingredients to have a superior product.

Service was great and quite quick but it wasn't too busy."
2,"My husband made this reservation. The hotel was under construction which didn't bother me too much except the fitness room wasn't available. But not a big deal. The room was really nice and clean. Had an issue with the AC vent in the actual room. It wasn't blowing into the room. We just adjusted the temperature to the lowest possible setting so that it eventually cooled the room. Breakfast was very good. The staff at the restaurant was very nice and friendly. Here's why I am giving it two stars. My husband had a meeting but before leaving asked if I could have a late check-out. The staff said that it was fine, and I was to check out at 1pm. Around 11:30 a.m. someone called my room I tried to answer but whoever was calling  hung up after one ring and when I finally caught the phone they hung up in my ear.  A few minutes later someone knocked on my door and rattled the door handle, I screamed from the inside of the room that someone was still in the room. I did this about three times. But the person insisted and finally opened my door. I wasnt fully dressed and there was a privacy sign on the door. Plus my husband arranged late check out, so I am not sure why someone would try to get into my room! It was a man, and when I screamed hard enough he closed the door. I couldn't even run to the door to keep it closed because I wasn't dressed! I called the front desk and they told me that it was probably the engineer trying to fix the phone. Why would he even be messing with rooms that were occupied, I had a privacy sign on the door and worse of all, I was screaming from inside to not open door! Ugh I was so mad! I called my husband and he got with the front desk to recount what happened. Apologies were given but they didn't even try to make the situation better or compensate me. Hence, two stars."
2,"NPL is very close to home and I have come here with my family for a quick dinner or to meet the girls for a drink and some appetizers. The food is typical bar food, fair to middlin' in taste and quality. The service has gotten worse and worse and today had to be the worst of the worst. We waited for over 5 minutes to place our order although we expressed that we were ready when we sat down. The sliders were overcooked and the buns were burnt. The soup we ordered was runny, oily and although it was wedding soup, it only had three pebble sized meatballs. To top off the visit, the server placed dirty dishes from another table on our table when we were getting ready to leave. Having been a server and bartender in the past, I would NEVER think to leave dirty dishes on a table, especially dishes from another table. Unbelievable."
2,"I generally like the Embassy Suites, but the staff were much unprofessional. When I entered there was an older African American woman joking with some customers which is cool, but she was LOUUD as ever. She told us ""sorry ma'am I'm usually not like this but they got me worked up tonight"". The customers were laughing, but I was just waiting to get away from that desk as I had a headache and her playfully yelling was making it worse. 2nd thing is we had an event that night and as I was waiting downstairs there was a commotion going on between the guests and staff about a rule that people under 21 can't be  in the lobby by themselves after a certain time, which  is a rule I agreed with. The issue was one of the staffed walked away from the commotion so another staff member yelled out where are you going?! The short African American lady with short hair responded, ""I'm not going to sit here and argue with people about their fu**ing children!"" Talk about unprofessional? Hotel was nice, rooms were clean, STAFF needs some work. 

Note: This review has been sitting in my draft folder. I meant to post this back when I stayed there in May 2018"
2,"Not far from the house I really wanted to try LD after seeing a flier.  So I popped in with the GF after seeing a movie thinking we could eat and chat about it..

With a few missed turn offs we finally located the place as it truly is tucked away and off the beaten path.  After walking in we were greeted but not in a warm and welcoming sort of way but rather in a stoic way.

I ordered up some Pad Thai and the GF ordered the Sesame Chicken.  The came out quickly and we began to eat.  The Pad Thai was fine but i did not really care for my GF's chicken.

I really wanted to like this place but instead I realized that maybe I don't live as close to it as I thought."
2,"I thought this place was kind of a ripoff and the food was mediocre at best.  I got the arroz con pollo and a large drink for just over ten bucks which I personally thought was a lot, but I got a couple salsa cups and took a seat.  The salsas were okay I guess, one is called casera and it sure tasted like the Herdez Salsa Casera you get at the grocery store.
My lunch arrived and it wasn't quite the arroz con pollo I'm used to.  The rice was completely devoid of flavor, the chicken was a very small portion of thigh meat simply grilled which tasted okay but certainly nothing to write home about."
2,"Fast, friendly, but flavorless. Beef and broccoli was tender but had the flavor of water"
2,"Used to order from here a lot! Then, the pizzas started getting delivered soggy and drowning in grease. Finally decided to give them another try, so I ordered thin crust, hoping to avoid the sogginess. Totally disappointed.  Sog City.           They're also really inconsistent with their wings. Sometimes they're drenched in sauce, and sometimes bone dry. Not worth $40 for pizza and wings, delivery and tip. I'm done."
2,"Usually a HUGE fan of chicos. New chef? New management? but the food coming out of this place is different now. Especially the chicken. Which seems to be roasted chicken, RATHER than the grilled and fresh chicken I've always been used to. I guess I have to find that elsewhere now. I still will go for the breakfast burritos. Good place. Just seem to be changing"
2,"Overall, the cleanliness of the hotel was good. We started off as a bit of a challenge upon check-in. Customer service needs a lot of work. The conflict resolution of the property manager would be equivalent of a motel 6. I expected more from this level of property. This Embassy property could learn a great deal by reading and implementing the Hiltons Value, Vision and Mission statements.

HOSPITALITY - We're passionate about delivering exceptional guest experiences. Nothing exceptional here, but an exceptionally meh experience.

OWNERSHIP - We're the owners of our actions and decisions. And as far as ownership... it was pass the buck and blame 'corporate'. It's our corporate policy... 

I don't blame the employees. They are the boots on the ground... My recommendation is to empower your employees to make good decisions that are in the best interest of your company and corporate brand. And the WiFi is horrible. If you are a business traveler, you'd better have a good hotspot..."
2,"For a place open 24 hours it was a welcome site. Remembering a couple of years ago staying at the Hilton Garden Inn that was across from this place. We had arrived to late to find some decent place in Scottsdale and even the hotel seemed like it wouldn't do. 

We arrived and sat down at the counter looking over the menu. It was front and back and there was a variety of items to eat. It was strange eating breakfast at night, but then again there's always Denny's right? Well we sat down and started to stare at the menu trying to decide. 

I ended up ordering a grill chicken sandwich and that being the only thing I ate as a true meal it was decent. I did want to try the waffles to compare it to Country Waffles, but I didn't want to feel really full. 

It was decent and made to order which was nice. However, sitting where I was sitting I knew most of the items on the menu were prepared before hand. The salads were done and placed into bowls ready to be served on a plate. The orange juice was in a machine that keeps running to make sure it's not sitting still was scary. It looked like one of those machines you see at Orange Julius. The orange juice was in buckets ready to be refilled. 

Overall, I thought it was a little creepy and disturbing in the restaurant. If I had a choice I'd make sure that the airlines would have informed us that the luggage was already set a side. I wished that we'd got back into town to eat at a real restaurant before everything closed. Good for a snack, but not a place I'd want to return to unless desperate."
2,"This was a huge disappointment. There's nothing more satisfying than deep fried potatoes smothered in cheese and dark brown deliciousness, but I left the Big Cheese feeling like crap. It could have been because I ordered the vegetarian nacho poutine and not the traditional like I should have. Who came up with the bright idea to mix guacamole with beef gravy? In my defense, I didn't know they were going to add the gravy to it. For some reason I was imagining it was going to be similar to The Works from New York Fries, but it was so far from it. This is probably the only time I would ever pick a food court meal over something more ""gourmet.""

Despite my gross poutine, I would give the Big Cheese another chance because there are probably better ones I could have chosen. The fries were decent, and the prices are on par for your average urban poutinerie. I find the menu to be overloaded with strangely elaborate toppings and I'm more of a simple creature. It's your potato equivalent to Tubby Dog - you either love it all, or you can only handle so much of it."
2,"chicken ""works"" giant burrito. lots of beans but not enough chicken. hochata is decent."
2,The food was tasty and fully stocked. Restaurant was clean. The bathrooms were disgusting. The toilets and urinals weren't sealed to the floor and the two out of the three woman's rooms were clogged.
2,"Five stars for the great coffee - very important for a cafe
two stars for the food
two stars for the value
ZERO stars for the service

Want to clear your own table so you can sit down? Lazy Daisy's is the place for you. Take your choice of half of the tables in the place - all the empty ones were all covered in other people's dishes when we walked in.

The quality of the food is fine, but the preparation leaves much to be desired. At $15 for the 'Big Breakfast' I expect to be impressed. But my 'over-easy' eggs were hard, my little ramekin of beans was refrigerator cold, and the 'baked' tomato and 'fried' mushroom slices clearly hadn't spent long enough in the microwave.

The toast was actually warm, though.

My advice? Enjoy the good coffee, but don't eat here."
2,"I went here a couple weeks back after heading over to the Food Truck Fridays, I had a catfish poboy sandwich and got a catfish plate for my coworker...it was great, crispy, fresh fish, excellent seasonings, just really hit the spot. Went over today after my coworker bugged me the entire week and simply got catfish filets for the both of us and a side of texas toast.

I don't know if it was bad fish, bad cooking or a combination of both but I ended up throwing my food away, the fish seemed undercooked, but greasy at the same time and the toast was extremely greasy. I even tried to eat it by dousing it in hot sauce and that couldn't save it either. I received 4 pieces of fish (instead of 2 filets as expected) and my coworker received 3 pieces instead of 4..all for the same price. My coworker even complained about her food, kind of turned off by this experience so I won't be back. There's another place over there with catfish I guess the next time I'm in the mood I'll give them a try."
2,"Maybe it was an off day, but I thought the food today was not very good at all. The BF and I each got a 'k sadilla,' I got the steak and he got the chicken. Maybe this item isn't the best thing to get here... I don't know. It was soggy and had waaaay too much cheese. The steak was chewy and flavorless despite being labelled as 'cajun.' The k sadilla had cabbage in it.... but the cabbage wasn't cut at all... there were huge pieces of it in this thing. Overall, the flavor was off putting (and I like Cajun food), it was greasy, and the whole thing fell apart while trying to eat it. I would not get this again, not when there are 3 other very good choices in the same parking lot (the bbq, the hot dogs, and the grilled cheese)."
2,"After a night of reveling and beer consumption on 17th Ave, my friends and I decided to sample some of The Big Cheese's poutines... Kudos to the Big Cheese for staying open late on the weekend.

I love poutine: It would be my last meal if I was about to die.... But it wouldn't be a Big Cheese poutine. Although the Big Cheese has a great selection of unique toppings and combinations (i.e. carolina pulled pork, sausage, sour cream, beef), their fries aren't anything special and their gravy is extremely bland. I had bites of the Notorious P.I.G., Hogzilla and Veggie Nacho. All of them had bland gravy, over-cooked meat and stale fries.

For a bigger serving, a lower price and a more traditional Quebecoise poutine, Alberta King of Subs is worth the drive to the NE. For a unique, gourmet-type poutine, try Brava Bistro's lobster poutine."
2,"This place used to be OK, but now it's not even worth the effort.  The fried rice was mushy and flavorless."
2,"Definitely a good bang for your buck. For the food you get to how much it costs, I would give that around a 3.5 - 4 star. 

In terms of straight up quality, I would give it a two. There really is nothing special about the food that they provide. I'm not saying it's bad, rather, there's nothing that really makes you say ""wow, that's really good."" It doesn't really make you have this urge to come back the next day and have another. 

If you're in the area and need something quick to eat, then Banh Mi Boys is great. If you're looking to experience asian fusion at a higher level, then there are other places that do it better."
2,"Giving 2 stars for ""below average"" service on Express package (I never tried their detailing).  I still visit this car wash occasionally but I would not recommend it to my friends or family member.

I have been visiting this place for more than 4 years and it started out great.  I usually get the $7 Express package that includes bug prep and drying.

So what went wrong?

1. Bug Prep - Bug prep isn't always there, even if you paid for it.  It really depends who you get to set you up the machine

2. Car wash machine - It doesn't always work, I got stuck in there for at least  3 times already.  And even if it works, some wash cycle might be out of order occasionally, so you will notice the soap is not spreading out like it should be.  Those are the things you won't notice if you get a detailing package because someone else will take your car through the machine.

3. Drying - They don't dry cars like they used to.  They spend less than 15-20 seconds each car for the Express service.  Now, I understand $7 package isn't their bread and butter but there are 2 more car wash places in the corner that would offer the same service without drying for $5 (Northern/91st, both Shell and Mobil offers car wash as well).  I did tip the drying rep. $2-$3 a few times but that doesn't really change anything.  Again, it wasn't like this 2 years ago.  I am not asking for a spot-free drying but at least get the major area covered?

4. Business hour - They don't necessary open till 6pm during weekdays like they advertised.  Time to time, this car wash place is closed at 5:45pm. So for those who work far away, make sure you think twice before your get the car wash membership.  Again, this wasn't an issue until this year.

I look forward to seeing improvements because I believe this business has the potential to bring in more customers by keeping up the standard."
2,"Saw the plastic chickens in the window and was like, ""Whaaa????"" So we went in and ate.  Had no clue it was so huge in there-there's a huge bar, and a huge pool table area and even a video game area too.  

The menu=Wild Wings menu the 100 flavours etc.  We were so convinced we even asked the waitress if they were owned by Wild Wings.  The waitress said no - in no ways were they affiliated with Wild Wings.  

Anyhoo-after we ordered the waitress told us our meal would take at least 30 mins because the kitchen was behind.  Ended up being more like 45 minutes, but they were really packed.  

ASIDE:  My hubby was mad that he married me that night because I hate beer.  You see, all the other tables had this huge beer dispenser thingie that looked like fun-but of course party time Angela that night decided on a Shirley Temple instead. :p 

Overall, the wings were pretty good, sauced and spiced pretty true to description.  The size of the wing itself seemed quite large, and after 5 of them I was pretty full.  (Weak, I know, but after 2 Shirley Temples waiting for 45 minutes-you get the picture).  

Probably wouldn't go back because of the wait.  But I can definitely see groups of people going there for wings/beer/pool for a Friday night or something when you've got lots of time to linger."
2,"First off, my family travels a lot and visits many hotels.  This is the first time we have stayed in a hotel where the front desk personnel do not look up or greet you as you come in the door.  You would think they would want to be more aware of their surroundings & people coming & going.

Secondly, the room was in dire need of renovation (especially the bathroom) and the cleaning was subpar at best.  Trash under the bathroom vanity remained there throughout our stay.  The same for soap scum on the shower door, toothpaste on the mirror and debris on the bathroom floor.

On a positive note, the sheets were clean and the complimentary breakfast was good."
2,"Like a previous writer said, used to be much better under previous ownership.  I'm a regular here (4 times a month on average) and i've noticed the service and quality isn't what it used to be.  I usually order the hot & spicy chicken.  The order i had last night wasn't good and their was nothing spicy about it.  To make matters worse, I always order and pay online through Eat 24.  Last night I went to pick up my order and was charged again for my food.  When I explained I already paid online, the guy insisted I had not.  Their was a language barrier so I did not want to argue with the guy so I paid for the food again.  Then had to go home and spend 20 minutes on the phone with eat 24 to get my charges reversed.  Looks like i will be looking for a new place in Henderson for Thai food.  Too bad cause I really liked this place."
2,"Not  Bad 

I pass by Chico's Tacos daily but seldom stop in. Today, I was in a bit of a rush and decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat. I was pleasantly surprised at the large menu Chico's offered.

You place your order at the counter and your number is called when your order is ready bring. The service is good, the restaurant is clean,  and the atmosphere is pleasant.

Chico's offers a ""salsa bar"" where you can indulge yourself with various types of salsas, chopped onions, chopped tomatoes with onions, peppers, and cilantro. On this visit I choose the grilled chicken and steak tacos.  I really enjoy with the grilled steak taco.  The steak was flavorful, tender, and season well. However,  I  did not care for the chicken taco.  The chicken was somewhat dry and lacked flavor.

Chico's offers a clean environment, good service, and inexpensive entrée's. Depending on what you order the food can be from average to not so good."
2,"First of all, unlike some of the reviews which do nothing but savage TNT, let me try to offer my observations as a positive contribution on how TNT can do so much better.  First, let me offer kudos to TNT for offering vets a ten percent discount.  That helps those of us who live on fixed income pensions.  Okay, here's what I observed during my visit this morning.  I pulled up to the car wash aisle at 7:58, two minutes earlier than their posted opening.  Cones blocked the aisles.  That's okay, I was two minutes early.  Except no one was around for a little while.  Why would any business not be fully manned and ready to offer a service right at opening?  A few minutes after eight, one gent exited the store and went around to the wash rack tunnel.  Then a second, older gent in walk short, the fellow who would eventually write up my ticket, went in, cranked up some loud music for the outside speakers, walked past me twice without a wave, or a smile, then five minutes later came over and, again without smile or greeting said ""what do you want?""  I then specified Premium Wash and he began pushing ""armor all"" dash service (no armor all for Premium Package?"") I declined.  After writing my ticket the gent began pushing floor mat cleaning.  Again I declined.  (I don't blame him for this....but you really must figure anyone that unfriendly at first greeting ain't gonna get me to sign up for extras).  The service was a bit slow....30 minutes with me being first in line for the total wash.  The wash job was okay...nothing above and beyond what other full service washes provide.  I tipped $5 dollars and left.....wishing the owner (or manager) had a better feel for how his crew presents itself to the customer."
2,"not impressed!  Bread was partially burnt around outside to start. ordered the cheese and meat board. the meats and cheese were very good however the toasted bread that accompanied was burnt and left a horrible burnt taste in your mouth. The steak. filet mignon. excellent quality meat. poor choice on seasoning. tasted a little like it was cooked on a dirty grill. the peppercorn sauce, well it just plain wasnt good. The food is brought to your table on a push cart. A push cart!  not classy at all. very high priced for the poor taste. wont be going back there again and i would recommend you save your money."
2,"The Battleship is an excellent value and feeds quite a few! 
My tip best to call ahead with your order especially on Steeler Sunday's.
If I had a wish list for the triangle, I'd add a place order here line and a pay here line. 

6-10-18 update-called our order in we were given a 30-35 minuet wait time.
Prior to hanging up the gentleman told us 45 minuets...ok...
We arrived to pick up our order we were told it would be ready soon...25 minuets later we left.
NO Organization what's so ever."
2,"I can't see how this place has as many stars as it does. Maybe I came on a bad night.

A night where I wanted to order a chicken wrap and found that if I wanted lettuce or tomatoes then I would be charged extra. When the girl came back and asked if I wanted tomatoes on my salad I asked ""are you going to charge me extra for them?""

A night where the salad dressing packet was covered in some other type of dressing. 

A night where I saw a fly land on the chefs towel and where he proceeded to wipe his spatula with said towel. 

A night where I saw a patron at the bar area holding his hand roughly three feet off the bar. Curious to why he was doing that, my questions were answered when he slammed his hand down on a fly (unconfirmed if it was the same fly who rested earlier on the towel) and then lightly brushed the stunned yet permanently disabled insect over the counter. 

The saving grace was music over the speakers playing Micheal Jackson. Most likely will not return unless I'm in Phoenix and for some reasons they are the only place on the planet that has waffle mix."
2,"Used to come here for wings on Wednesdays for all you can eat wings

The food is alright, i like the fries too, but the service is terrible

it's always busy here. The last time we came for takeout was on superbowl night because it was packed, couldn't get a table. They told us it'd be around 30-45 min so we waited. It ended up being ONE AND A HALF HOURS! We kept asking them and they kept telling us 10 more minutes. We saw people that came after us get their food first. It was pretty annoying, since by the time we got our food it was cold too!

Also, the waitresses are REALLY disorganized. Came here 3 times, they gave us the bill, and we didn't even pay and they're like ""Thanks! Come back again!"" They didn't even KNOW we didn't pay! We had call them over and be like... uh we didn't pay yet. The second time AND third time, they did the exact same thing! You would think they can keep track?!?!?"
2,"Chico's Tacos is kind of the queenly sister of the chain Mexican restaurants peppered around Phoenix like so many grains of sand in your swimsuit. It is clearly several steps up from your local generic Mexican drive through, but it's still just not tasty.

This fact does not dissuade me from visiting Chico's on a semi-kinda-regular basis - it is close to my work, and the wait is generally minimal.  Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical ""lunch rush"" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.

A quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called. 

If you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.

I have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican ""grilled"" platter, or the entree includes ""grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual ""crunch""? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.

The rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!

The inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles. Something about the inside of the building makes it very loud inside at lunchtime - not a spot to sit and bring a book and contemplate the mysteries of and the reality of your newly found adulthood...not that I've, you know, tried that...or anything..."
2,"Don't go on ayce night. Not worth the wait. Terrible customer service.

If you love spicy, try ""devil's inferno"". In fact go with cluster of friends and make each person try. You'll laugh at and with who can handle it. Personally it was just okay. If you want real spicy wings, I'd recommend you going to Duff's or Wingporium."
2,"Hmmmm...I like that they cut the potatoes & fry them fresh.  The gravy was good, but I don't quite understand the curds.  They add texture, but zero flavor.  It was almost impossible to eat a small due to the texture & one dimensional flavor.  We were searching for fries that had a little bit of crispness to break up the mushiness.  I would definitely recommend asking for the fries well done/extra crispy."
2,"I was quite surprised when strolling down 17th and stumbled upon this little restaurant. I've been looking everywhere for my beloved viande fumée poutine in Calgary for quite sometime. Unfortunately, they didn't seem to hit it right and seem to skimp out on the necessary ingredients, they don't use enough cheese curds, gravy, fries and smoke meat. Too bad, I guess I'm just going to stick to making poutine at home 

It's a very small place maybe seats less than 20 people and can get crowded on weekends and nights."
2,"So I have had a hate-hate relationship with Big Cheese ever since it opened. I had tried them a number of times, just on the fly as well as post drinks, and honestly they never came anywhere close to making me happy. 

Friends really wanted to stop in on Saturday night and I acquiesced to their request. Got a large classic to share between 4 of us. More than enough food for sure. For the first time they managed not to over cook the fries so they didn't taste slightly burned, or maybe they just have a new batch of oil on. Plus the gravy was actually thick and just salty. MASSIVE improvement on the last time I was in there.

They did ok on Saturday night, but honestly not sure I will ever go again myself based on previous experiences which were all mediocare at best.

Shout out to the 2 ladies working the cash register who were polite, friendly and chatty while we waited. Was great to see some smiling faces come midnight when you stop for food."
2,"Even by the low standards of sports bars and wing joints, Wacky Wings reaches impressive depths. I love to grab some greasy food and watch a game as much as the next person, but, people, we must demand better! We must have some self respect!

The neverending, oppressive blaring of music videos from days that are best forgotten; the stale, unmoving air; the fluorescent lights and windowless walls; this is an ambiance with a maximum dose of around an hour. The food is gruel. The beer selection is the same old garbage. A shot of Jameson will set you back $10.75. The servers gamely do their best, but the deck seems stacked against them by poor processes and general confusion, and so it is likely you will not even receive your expensive and mildly gross order in a timely fashion.

There is one piece of good news amid the horrors: the pool tables are plentiful and in excellent condition. They are oddly packed in, without enough clearance between tables, but otherwise things are not too bad! It's just a shame that they have to be contained within this depressing testament to just how much unpleasantness we, as a people, will endure for the privilege of a plate of mediocre wings and a light beer. 

Feel free to take this review with a grain of salt. This place is often crowded, and many of the customers seem to be having a good time. All I can offer is my personal experience: I have had to go to Wacky Wings a few times in my life, and every time I leave feeling tired, sad, and mildly ill. There are good ways to do wings, beer, and the big game. This is not on that list."
2,Was unlucky to have been here during March madness. The basketball team and their fans infiltrated this hotel for a few days.  Hated being woken up at midnight to their band playing songs for 30 minutes outside.  It felt like all other non Kansas fans were a pain for staying their. Even this Diamond member for no respect. Maybe I'll try again during a slow time.  2- stars because at least the bartenders were great!
2,"Ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken for a pickup order.

 Both left much to be desired. The fried rice was good but the chicken was rubbery and chewy. Almost gristly. I pushed the majority of it to the side.... 

Got two free eggrolls for an over $10 order.... they were better than the ""chicken""....

I asked the hubby if he'd order from them again and he said no. I have to say I agree. There's better elsewhere."
2,"Nice restaurant and the food was really good, but the service was horrible! Our waitress was rude, and forgot part of our order after she took forever to bring our food out"
2,"Stopped at this place on the way to PHX airport.  Looked like a local joint but got inside and realized it is probably a chain.  The salsa is accessible and acceptable.  I got my tacos to go.  No lengua or barbacoa and that clued me in that it must be a chain and sanitized to some degree.  Plus the fact that some non-hispanics were working behind the counter.  Got the airport and looked at the tacos and realized that the chicken was overcooked and the chunks too large for a taco.  Anyway, not the great Mexican food I have grown accustomed to when traveling in AZ."
2,Today I found out the are charging 50¢ more a slice for meat trio.  I doubt I will be coming here on Thursdays any more.
2,"Very disappointing! I went here because they have options for gluten free vegetarians. I ordered the small. The gravy was fine and the cheese curds were OK, but the box was half empty! For more than $7 for fries, some gravy and a few cheese curds, I would expect to at least get the serving I paid for!! The customer service was also terrible!"
2,"Well, when you have a little too much alcohol in Vegas, you don't think about checking the Yelp reviews before picking a place for ""a last drink""...

Two friends and I stopped by for a bottle of water, a Dos Equis and a Mojito... $34. Well good job, you really helped us make it our last drink. It was a Monday around 1.30am, the place was nearly empty, the bartender barely acknowledged us, the bouncer was flirting with a server and the Mojito was watered down...

The place gets three stars instead of two because we received our bill right after the first round which saved us the embarrassment of paying 120+ dollars for three rounds of drinks.

I wont be back unless i get some kind of 2 for 1 deal..."
2,"We are new to Vegas and are searching for a good Chinese restaurant. Little Dumpling was not what we are looking for. The Lo Mein noodles were mushy, the Mongolian beef was almost flavorless. The real surprise when I crunched into egg shells when I bit not the Egg Pho Yong. Yuck! Plus, there was no gravy.  The Moo Goo Gah Pan was good  as was the rice. But good is a long way from great. We'll keep up our search for a great Chinese restaurant. Little Dumpling was not what we were searching for."
2,"Some friends and I checked Jamburritos out at First Friday in downtown Phoenix.

The people working the truck were pleasant. The Cat Fish Po'Boy was pretty good, my friend from Louisiana said that it was a valiant effort. The special of the day, a Pineapple Pork Po'Boy, was not very good. They ruined it when they put ""nacho cheese"" on it. Same with the nachos. I get it, nacho cheese is nacho cheese (belongs on nachos...), but that is like the shitty cheese you get at a baseball game, ya know what I'm saying? Put some real nice cheese on there. $8 sandwiches should not have $0.08 cents worth of shit cheese on them. Nor should nachos from a good food truck!

I might try them again, but would be hard-pressed to get anything besides the Cat Fish Po'Boy. 

Maybe they were having an off night..."
2,"Two stars for customer service.  After rushing to our room to get some rest before heading to dinner, it became obvious that the bathroom had not been cleaned from the previous guest.  This is the worst embassy suites that I have been in. Can you say bathroom renovation ?, this place is in need of one.  Mold and mildew throughout the bathroom and dated furniture from the late 60s."
2,"TL;DR: restaurant served a lower grade of meat for the steak than what was ordered (received USDA choice, ordered Wagyu). Everything else was pretty nice. 

Was down in Vegas for one of the big pool tournaments and stayed at the Westgate. Decided to try the Edge steakhouse as it had so many positive reviews. They were running a special for the pool players so I took advantage (3 course meal for $40). 

I ordered a locally brewed pale ale and it was tasty (although my 2nd glass of it came with a fruit fly drowning in it).
I ordered spicy shrimp for the appetizer and it was also good.
No choice for dessert, got the creme brulee and it was just perfect.

I went out of order because I want to focus on the entree, I ordered a Wagyu top sirloin cap. Now, I'm not an expert but, I've taken a few BBQ and cooking classes and my favorite thing to cook is steak. I've cooked all kinds of steak and all kinds of grades (select, mostly choice as that's what the grocery stores have around here but I do manage to get prime from Costco from time to time). What I received was NOT Wagyu grade beef. It was regular, run of the mill USDA choice (if even that). It was cooked to a medium rare (how I ordered it) and for all intents and purposes it was seasoned well and done to my liking. It was also VERY chewy and that's how I know it wasn't Wagyu. A perfectly cooked, medium rare Wagyu steak should fall apart in your mouth it should be so tender. I've cooked my USDA prime steaks to medium and they are just amazingly juicy and tender. The steak I got from Edge was not that. 

Finally, the ambience was very nice and the service excellent. That's the only reason why I'm giving more than one star. I detest being cheated by restaurants that think they are pulling the wool over the customers eyes. 

Beware the quality of steak you get here. Everything else is pretty nice but, for the regular prices they're charging, I won't come back."
2,First time here and Not a fan. This place has been here forever. There must be something good here if they are still open. Well to be honest I will not be back. . Hope you continue stay open for many more years. :)
2,"The good.  It was a nice looking hotel with a nice waterfall thing near the dining area.  Food was good, your typical eggs, sausage, bacon, and grits.

The bad.  Our room had an AC leak. The wood floor looked bowed and the carpet was wet.  Not a great feeling when you are barefooted.

We told the front desk and she said, thanks for letting us know.  Okay than, thanks for asking about how my stay was in the wet room."
2,"Negative review is primarily based on their pricing issues. They advertise .99 cent taco's on Tuesday but they are actually $1.29 ea. Not a huge difference and still a good deal; but it becomes a bigger issue when you find this out after placing an order for the office and, upon arriving to pick it up, the price is on average $2 more per person. Reading previous reviews seems to show I'm not the only one who has had issues with the prices listed on their website not being honored when you actually go to pay. Taco's were fair for the Tuesday price, (wouldn't ever recommend them at the $3 they normally are) dry and a bit bland, no pico but the salsa is good."
2,"It's nice. But they use the cheapest meats they can find and you can taste it.
Also, If you are going to call it and Italian. Use Pepperoni."
2,"Well they can do celiac safe poutine which is great; however, the staff didn't seem entirely confident in that which made me uneasy.  I would say that if you have had real poutine in QC this is not comparable.  Too much gravy, and not very good gravy.  Not enough fries or cheese.  It was basically fry soup.  Disappointing.  I guess no one makes poutine like Chez Ashton, if only there was one in Calgary."
2,"Not the best Embassy Suites I've stayed at but not the worst either.  Maybe the second worst?  The employees were super friendly and answered the few questions I had without pause.  The breakfast was on par with their other properties.  The guest room I was given is where they lost the stars.

The place is in need of some serious updating.  The room I stayed in had definitely seen better days.  The carpet, the light switches, the paint - everything looked tired and just about worn out.  Also, the smell of too-much carpet freshener seriously overpowered the senses.  I thought it would dissipate if I switched the fan selector to ""on"" instead of ""auto"" but I was mistaken.  I'm not sure what odor they were trying to cover up but I don't really want to know at this point.  Next time I'm in Charlotte I will stay somewhere else...and hopefully get a better night's sleep."
2,Great to have a place to satisfy the late night munchies.  But the service is slow and cheese curds were cold.  Sure you've got a slew of toppings but you've got to bet better organized there.
2,"TNT formerly Peoria Crossing, still provides the same abysmal wash services.  Mosh pit crew routinely use dirty rags, forget to vacuum trunks, miss door jambs, do not apply dressing to tires, dash, etc when paid,  do not shake out mats, leave dirt and oil on lower parts of rocker panels that the brushes miss, and generally have to be asked to provide the services for which one paid. Management is almost non-existent, and when a supervisor is found, show complete disinterest in problem resolution beyond hollering at the nearest guy with a rag and pointing at a spot.  Services are overpriced.  Detail services are marginally better.  Had a van, a sedan, and a BMW convertible detailed there over the years, each time after an ownership change.  At least once a vehicle was not buffed as agreed upon and paid for, and another time a vehicle was not hand waxed.  Management sheepishly admitted to ""saving time"" and apologized.

Why do I continue to go there?  As a gift, I received 20 car washes.  When my car gets really bad, I take it to a good detailer."
2,"Small, probably a good place to get a drink before dinner, but definitely not for a big group. Also, they serve their own Hennessy special, it comes in a chilled glass looking like ginger ale."
2,"I really hate to give this review, but I was really disappointed in my visit to the downtown location. I absolutely love the other locations so I was excited to check out the DT location after the game. The reason I am giving this review is due to the service. We sat at the bar and the bartender was just leaning over the edge of the bar not even paying attention to us. After awhile, I had to flag him down to get his attention. He did let us sample a few beers after I asked, but he didn't seem to like his job as he wasn't very engaging. We ordered our drinks and didn't hear from him after that. We were trying to close our tab and asked the female bartender if we could get our bill. She said you'll have to get it from him, as she was doing nothing herself.  I asked her if she could help us get his attention and she did at that point. Let me just add that the place was not packed and the staff looked bored. I mean they had time to drink beer so I would expect they have time to give to their customers. The other locations are known for the fun ambiance and excellent customer service.  Maybe I caught them on an off night, but this was a bit disappointing"
2,The food is good but every single time we place phone orders my burrito is fucked up! Done with this place!
2,"The thing about The Big Cheese Poutinerie is that the cheese is squeeky.
Like, alright poutine, but so damn squeeky. 
If you don't know what I mean, check out the Big Cheese Poutinerie and find out for yourself...if you dare."
2,"I was surprizes to see so many 4 stars for this place and I fail to see why. I'm not giving a 1 star because I don't want to be an a#@$.
Came in a weekday morning for brunch. No brunches on weekdays! We were told to pick from a breakfast menu and when receiving our order, we were given a plate with a sandwich made of 2 pieces of toast and unseasoned egg with avocato and tomato. On the side, the fruit was a slice of orange and a sliver of melon. Come on!
2 plates and 2 lattes cost 40 bucks! Sorry but if the server wasn't so nice I would told them off. This place is a rip-off. To AVOID!"
2,"This place started out well when it opened.. But they start doing what all other new buffett places do, by starting to ""cut back"" by not preparing fresh food as often, and restocking less often, especially for their ""costlier"" items.  

Lin's down the street, on the other hand, do a great job of keep their standards up!  Hence the lines out the door whenever you drive by!"
2,"I usually come here for the chicken salad, which I really enjoy.  The idea of a good salad in a Mexican establishment is great and I would still return to have one, however, I strayed last night and had a carne asada burrito.  Sadly, the meat was really bad. No taste and the pieces were way too big and full of stringy gristle. I had to throw the meat out of my burrito. Other than that, the rest of the ingredients were good, and of course their salsa station is really good.  So my advice: have something other than the carne asada here, and you should be ok. The staff is always nice and other than the carne issue, thumbs up!"
2,"I personally have not eaten at Chico's Tacos, but my co-worker, who sits right next me, just did.
She managed to take three bites of the taco salad before dubbing it 'weird tasting' and that was the beginning of the end. One hour later, the office got blasted with an uncontrollable rip by the eatee. The stench was so heinous, the box fan by my desk could barely hold it at bay. My other co-worker did not fare nearly as well. We'll be holding the wake on Wednesday. Rest her soul.
Yeah, with what I've experienced, and just second hand, I don't think I'll be taking my business there anytime soon."
2,"This review is for a takeout.

I live super close to this chinese joint and because I was super hungry, decided on the pad see ewe.  I called in the order and got there w/in 2 mins.  The lady that helped me was nice.  My food was ready within 10 mins.  When I got home, I was surprise that there was a small bag of fried wontons and a small container of sweet and sour sauce.  Didn't know it came w/it like a typical fortune cookie would be.  

Well anyways, I enjoyed the wontons.  Then when I opened my contained with the pad sew ewe...Holy Moly, that's a lot of food!  However, quantity does not justify for the quality.  The big pieces of beef was kind of...eh...rubbery.  Very odd.  So odd, that I barely ate any of them.  The flat thick noodles were drenched with oil, as how chinese take out would be.  It doesn't taste like the other pad sew ewe that I have at other Thai restaurant.  Oh but wait, this is more of a Chinese take out, not Thai...

Hmm...I probably won't be coming back."
2,"It was crowded as expected on a Friday night.  We were seated in a booth with a huge tear in the seat.  I wasn't expecting much from a bar/restaurant, but was hoping for a better meal. We ordered the fried zucchini  appetizer and was very disappointed when the plate arrived with 4 tiny strips.  The rest of our food came quickly and was just ok.  Probably won't return because of the disappointing experience."
2,"Went on a Saturday night for some wings. There were many selections of Wings. Salads, and other dishes.

Overall, not very impressed.
The wings came super quick. Not sure if that's a good thing. I think they were pre-cooked, then sauced and heated to order. All wings were kinda chewy."
2,"Used to be that when I moved to a new place the first thing I would do is order Chinese food. 3 years ago I moved to Spokane and that ended with some of the worst food ever. Fast forward 3 years to Henderson. Decided to try Little Dumpling, as gun shy of Chinese food as I am. General Tso's and Sweet & Sour Chicken were both drier than the surrounding desert. Pork Fried Rice was fair. Strike 1 Henderson Chinese food!"
2,Never have we had this problem. When we got our pizza tonight it wasn't cut. Frustrated. ?
2,"It was just OK.  If you do go here, just order the small portion - the large is massive and can feed two adults easily (even big guys).  Poutine is really a Montreal thing / don't think they have it down in Calgary like they do in Montreal.  There are a lot of other good restaurants on 17 Ave though..."
2,Meh. Used to eat here years ago and it was much better. BBQ pork fried rice had an off taste. Beef (from beef and broccoli) was chewy. Egg roll was good I guess. Won't be ordering again.
2,"Don't let the fancy-shmancy atrium distract you!

Room had ROACHES!!!

Flat screen in the room was _tiny_!

In door pool was also _small_, and always crammed full of kids.  Seeing that many kids in there, I opted not even to dip my toe in--you know how kids are in swimming pools!

On-site steakhouse was disappointing.

Location was in the middle of a seedy-looking area!"
2,"I got my car detailed over the weekend and the cleaning was good, I will explain why I'm giving it two stars. I purchased a mini detail which is interior and exterior cleaning, and something else that was listed was ""upholstery/leather treatment"". I would have thought this meant the seats, but apparently it didn't, it meant the dashboard and the display console area (steering wheel also) pretty much the dashboard the of car. My feedback to the owner is this can be a little deceptive because upholstery and leather treatment sounds like the seats. So none of my seats were clean and the door also had some oily fingerprints on it, they didn't clean the door. This was ok because I told them and they did an awesome job of cleaning. A couple other things is nobody seemed like they were on the same page, I asked the lady in side what the leather treatment meant and she said ""I don't know, ask the guy out there"" then I asked if there was a menu for a description and she said no. I really feel like some description for the services would be helpful to customers. Again to the owner - bump up your review status! If your customers aren't happy, make up for it! We have the ability to update our review. If you were to bring people back that didn't feel satisfied and you made up for it, they would rate you higher and you would also have a higher retention rate."
2,Interesting little neighbourhood restaurant fit for a very casual meal out. I found my overall experience mediocre.
2,The food is always delicious but I was there last night for dinner and I was surprised at how terrible the service was. We got seated and then patiently waited for someone to take our order and no one came so we had to ask to order. That continued the whole night. No one asked us if we would like another drink or brought more water when we were out. We had to ask to order dessert and then again for the bill. The place was busy but being a small restaurant not unmanageable. I was very disappointed  and surprised by the whole experience.
2,The food's not terrible but the problem is when you order a meat dish such as Mongolian Beef you get about 5 pieces of beef and then they mask the rest of it with the onions and bell pepper so you think you're getting a big meal.  I've gotten other beef dishes there and it's the same thing.  If you like more veggies than meat then this is your place!
2,"Interesting to see other Yelpers with similar experiences to ours. When we walked in we got a pool table right away, but it took us fifteen minutes for someone to take my beer order, and twenty five minutes before I got my beer. That's only because I walked up and found her chatting to a customer with my beer in her hand (close to her face might I add. Girl, do you have any idea how much invisible spit must have gone into my drink by the time I got it?). Also by the time I got my beer it had no head on it--criminal. 

Even after having to come find her to get my beer the first time, she NEVER returned to see if I wanted another drink. I also barely saw another server after that so I just went to the bar myself. She also never returned to see if we wanted food, even though we had asked for menus. Idiot. I can't believe my boyfriend tipped her.

After that, we went and sat at a table. After five minutes with no service we were going to leave and eat somewhere else, but we managed to get a server who was really good/quick and that made the experience a touch more positive. (Blonde girl, smart and friendly.) 

Management was either off that night, or they need to seriously kick some ass, if mine is not the only comment on here about the disastrously non-existent service.

Our food was crappy too but I blame ourselves 'cause we made the mistake of getting three fried things on the appetizer platter. Next time will definitely try the wings the place is known for. 

Meanwhile, love the decor and pool tables. Love the atmosphere too. And decent prices. I would love to make this place a regular date night venue for us and come back, eat wings, play pool, and the beer is really nice and cold! But judging by our own experience of the appalling service as well as the remarks I've read here, I'm hesitant."
2,"Pretty average. Quality falls short, and indiscernible from places like Wild Wing and Allstar's. Wouldn't bother returning."
2,"Of course while visiting Canada we wanted to try some poutine so we decided to check this place out. They had tons of different options. We chose the ""Notorious P.I.G."" We got a small size which was pretty big! My husband and I shared it and was to go try another place after this so didn't want to be too full (but we ended up pretty full anyways lol). The food was just alright to me. Granted I don't know what real Canadian poutine tastes like, but I've had poutine elsewhere which was much better. Maybe it was the one we chose, but it was recommended to us by the staff and were told it was one of the most popular. Overall, I would probably try another type of poutine here, but would probably look for other options/restaurants first..."
2,"Buffet used to be our favorite chinese spot on our side of town that was until we came on a Monday night.  The service is good and the options and selection is good.  This place has Mongolian BBQ, Sushi, and all the typical Chinese Buffett fair.  It is pretty clean for the most part.  They do not replace items as much as I think they should so I find that some of the food taste lets just say not so fresh.  If you go here go on the weekend and use a coupon.  They have pretty cheap beer so I suggest getting one of those too.  I would also suggest only going on the weekend or when they are busy because they do not replace the food at all on the weekdays when its not busy.  They let it sit there until it gets eaten."
2,Low quality and boring food.   I will not be back.
2,"Meh. Shared a traditional poutine with my bf. The fries were a bit overdone, or cooked in old oil. The gravy was über-salty, and the cheese was okay. I dislike the disposable take-away containers they serve in. Too much waste. They may have been made out of recyclable material, but I'd rather a plate or platter. Call me old fashioned, or environmentally conscious...

What really turned me off on this particular visit was a fellow patron that smelled so much like stale weed and b.o., we actually had to move to another table, so as to regain our appetite. There was also two music stations being played simultaneously, one in the kitchen, one in the restaurant, that just annoyed me.

Might be back to try some other poutine, but won't be soon, and won't be often."
2,"You're joking right? 
Went here for Taco Tuesday and I have to say; Worst Taco Tuesday EVER!!! 
Don't be lured in by the $1.29 Tacos, go somewhere else. 
The Chips were very basic, and the salsa bored me. My 3 Tacos came out and I didn't quite know what I was looking at. 
Are they hard shell or soft shell? Why did they put lettuce and cheese on them? 
The Shells were OK, but the meat was a poor attempt. The Shredded Beef was mushy, no flavor. Chicken texture was ok, but no flavor. Ground Beef? What is this stuff? Mushy as hell, no flavor at all....."
2,"Yikes!

For those that love poutine do yourself a favour and do not eat here. But, let me clarify.

They have an amazing selection, great toppings (piled high!), reasonable prices, and friendly staff.

BUT... in reality poutine shops only have one thing to do. (its not hard to deep fry potatoes and order curds in from Quebec) And that is to make a great gravy and wow do they ever miss. It is so so bland. Need I say more.... ruined my experience.

My friend tried one with the peppercorn gravy which was also - not so good.

I was stoked to go, but won't go back."
2,"This isn't the best waffle house in the area. We went there to try a different one. We sat at the counter and felt uncomfortable the whole time. The manager, I'm assuming, was yelling and barking orders at the staff the whole time. We felt bad for the other cook working with her. When we got our food it wasn't comparable to other waffle house restaurants. We got our food really spread out too. My friend got her hash  browns first (which weren't as good as other locations) then 5 minutes later I got my biscuits and gravy. As we were finishing those we remembered we had ordered waffles. We got those like 10 minutes after all the other food. Mine was like half over done. It was Medioric. Overall, mehh.  We wouldn't go to this one again."
2,"Came in today and was sad to see that there was seemingly only one employee working both the counter and dining area. All the tables were dirty, napkins and straws were all empty, and the poor girl was overwhelmed. I give her a lot of credit for remaining friendly and engaging despite being overwhelmed."
2,I usually go to the cheap car washes to avoid getting harassed by the glass company guys and also to avoid anybody dampering with my vehicle during a car wash... and especially to avoid getting out of my car. So if you want any of those things do not come here. Today when I arrived I approached the pay station and was quickly approached by a glass guy who hit on me and made me feel uncomfortable. And then of course I paid for my car wash after shooing him off and did not receive a receipt. When I approached the line to go into the car wash the gentleman asked me to roll down my window and he confirmed what I purchased (a five dollar car wash which he should've already known) and then proceeded to push in my mirrors. I have had my car for many years and I never pushed in my mirrors anytime I've ever had a car wash and I think that he should've asked for permission before he went and pushing my mirrors. So the car wash looks good and I go to leave the car wash facility and guess who has to get out of the car to push in their own mirrors? Yep me. Let's just say I won't be going back.
2,"I came here as part of the Indie Coffee Passport 2012 (ICP)
I was looking forward to this visit as the place looked nice. Unfortunately I had not read the poor service experience someone else had also encountered beforehand.
So lets get the cappuccino review out of the way first. 
Espresso: Medium
Crema': decent
Milk: OK
Latte Art: OK (on the first drink 2nd drink was just piled in) 
2.5 Stars
The cappuccino is OK and the setup is nice. 
The service is a show stopper for me here.
Maybe it was my grungy look that put them off, but this is not the way to treat a customer. I asked whether I can get my drink in a cup for here and take it outside for a smoke. Flat out no and as the cashier said I can give it to you in to go cup. Never mind I asked it for here and waited for my drink. The barista started to make my drink and used a disposable cup I asked here my cappuccino is for here and without looking up she made my drink, the latte art looked OK on that drink. I asked her I want my drink for here and she just plopped it a ceramic cup. I asked her again can you make it again for me and she started to give me a dirty look like I had committed treason and sighed. 
The next drink was made without an effort and the milk was just dumped in the mug, and just put the drink on the counter and walked away. Hmm very poor attitude here but what do they expect characters out of Disney movies! or clients that should belt out songs! I will not be back. I wanted to give them the whole customer is always right speech but alas it would be lost here as I am not their customer and I am sure there are plenty of places that will take my money. 
1.5 star if I factor in the poor service."
2,"Salt / garlic / flavor would be nice. This is your usual run of the mill  tasteless  Mexican food  meant to please the masses . I absolutely can't stand that plastic bagged lettuce smell. It turns my stomach. But if you want quick random food, knock yourself out."
2,Extreme wash car still dirt and they couldn't put the antenna back on.
2,"When did woody Woodchuck close down?!

Remember when the only place you could get wings was a bar or pizza joint. 
This changed about a year ago when we got flooded with Wing places.

This is another place with the word ""wing"" in it's name.

This place really loses 2 stars on service
- Slow!!!!
- Unorganized

Went for wings one night, ordered the Sampler with fries.

The fries were OK kind of MC Donald s look and taste.
I tried the Inferno wings or what ever wacky name they call them... All i have to say is EHHH.... they should send some of the staff that is good at standing around to BurritoBoyz to find how HOT! is made. 

We waited for this mediocre food about 45min.... 

They do make a comeback with the restaurants set up 
Food to the right -------
Billiards/Bar to the left -----

They also have a small arcade with tokens you can win.


I will give this place another try with the Billiard/Bar area."
2,"Finally tried this place for lunch as I've passed by it a few times, and it seems busy.  Got there, placed my order (Tres Tacos, nothing else), and waited. And waited.  And waited some more.  Finally after about 25 minutes of waiting, I asked one of the girls behind the counter what was going on, and she never gave me a clear answer - just mumbled something to the cooks and all of a sudden my food magically appeared. All I got was a mumbled ""Sorry"".  By that point I was already over my 30 minute lunch break.  If I hadn't opened my mouth, I'd probably still be waiting for my food.  After all that, they weren't even anything major to write home about - the soft taco shells tasted a little raw, and the fillings were decent, but again, nothing to brag about. I'm sure it's like every other taco shop on McDowell.

It didn't seem that they were short staffed, but with such a fast and busy lunch crowd, I expected better.  Don't think I'd go out of my way to come back anytime soon."
2,"I'm sorry to say that it wasn't all I'd hoped for. The decor was confusing, the tables cramped, and unfortunately the food had way too much salt. On the flip side, the staff were very nice, though service was a bit slow. And the bread? It's in a bin (think old-fashioned bathtub), and I watched a staff member put a clipboard ON the bread. Not cool."
2,"Echo the other poster's thoughts on the chili. Not only that, for a dish that listed beef as the first or second ingredient, there was none. Also avoid weekday lunchtime unless you enjoy having lunch in a daycare.

But I am more than willing to try them again due to the lovely pastries and the smiles. They have great potential."
2,Went to Friday food trucks in downtown Phx to get the nachos which i had before and were pretty good.  Asked for vegetarian nachos...no meat.  Walk back to my car on a very hot day and I am disabled to its hard to walk and then see they gave me meat.  No problem I thought just take them back and he will make it right.  Wrong.  He argued with me and insisted the red on the nachos were tomatoes.  I know what tomatoes are.  Again very hot day and he wants me to stand there leaning on my cane in 105 degrees and pick out the meat to show him.  I asked for my money back which he did reluctantly.  Not very nice.
2,I've had the wings before here and thought they were good so I got carry out and ordered them again. Nobody likes dry wings... Right? Therefore wings that have a lot of sauce of them should be good... Right? What I got was 12 wings sitting in 2 inches of sauce... I literally had to fish out every wing from being totally submerged. On top of that they took my celery (2 pieces) and threw it in a brown paper bag with a packet of ranch. Just what everyone wants from their vegetables... Floating around in a brown paper bag with a plastic Ranch container that has touched God knows what. I think that they mean well but in the end it just makes the wings almost offensive to eat. I suggest you ask for light sauce and if you want more just get some on the side.
2,"We tried this place based on the reviews my husband read on Google. Boy, were we disappointed. Either those reviews are fake or those diners have really low expectations. The sushi was okay, but not exceptional. A few things on the hot bar were fairly tasty, but nothing to write home about. When we asked if they had any shrimp sauce, they pointed us to cocktail sauce. No shrimp sauce on a sushi bar? Unacceptable! 
Then there's the cost....dinner was over $24 for my husband and myself, and we didn't even have drinks, just water. That's a little pricey for food that was average (I'm being kind) tasting and barely warm. We won't be back."
2,This is just simply a bad place to get your car washed I had been going there since it first opened and a kept hoping ever time I went back the experience would be better. It never has and based on that experience alone will never be a good place for a car wash. What happened to places where you know when you go there to get your car washed they will actually do a consistently good job
2,"I haven't had poutine in well over fifteen years, so I decided that I should order the traditional poutine rather than venture outside of the box on my first visit.  The small order is plenty of food but unfortunately, it was nothing to brag about.  It was hot and the cheese curds somewhat melted, but I thought the fries were overdone, the gravy was pretty flavorless and it was too salty as a whole.  If I ever go back, I'll try something else.

It was busy at 10:30pm on a Saturday and mostly full of twenty-somethings.  My spouse and I enjoyed watching the old school He-Man cartoon playing on the flat screen for all to see."
2,"Coming from Portland just a few weeks ago, it was a surprise to hear of Phoenix's entry into the Food Cart/Truck arena. We received an email telling us of a close location (Whole Foods, Scottsdale) that we could experience the things we have come to enjoy and love. Quick, gourmet plates of saucy goodness with just the right amount of spice and flavor that would make us talk about the trucks for weeks, counting the days until they rolled onto that welcoming asphalt off Raintree Drive again. Being a lover of the tastes and smells of New Orleans, I opted to try Jamburritos Cajun Grille Express. Note now that the temperature was 106, high noon, standing on black asphalt. 

I ordered the hush puppies and a Chicken Jamburrito. Wash it down with a tasty beverage and I would have been set. The ""Express"" part of the name in my opinion should be dropped. Many of us waited over 30 minutes to get our food, some people just getting a simple Chicken K-Taco plate. As I waited, to my horror, I saw a prepackaged frozen bag of hush puppies heading to some vat. Maybe they have a hush-puppy machine at home? I was expecting hand rolled pup's like mom used to make. Instead, over fried golf balls. By the time I got my The Jambirrito, it was soft, oozy and a little cold. The flavors that I expected to explode my senses tasted like they took a little McCormick Cajun Seasoning and kicked it up a bit with some cayenne pepper. I really wasn't tasting anything that I would associate with jambalaya, and thought the chicken may have been a little undercooked. The cheese was simple melted pepper jack, and the lettuce wilted. Waiting in the hot Arizona sun for 30 minutes only added to the disaster we called lunch. Had it been the best damn meal I had all week, I would have instantly forgotten the wait.  I give Jamburrito's 3 stars for trying something new and being on the forefront of the Phoenix Food Truck scene, but am giving them a single star for efficiency and taste."
2,"It was my hubby's decision to try this buffet.  They remodeled the Big Fat Greek Restaurant, ok.  My hubby has been sick after eating here.  And 4 days and counting.  =(  The only thing he tried that I would not was the clams.  Seafood at a buffet place has always been a no no in my book.  

The rest of the chicken, beef, pork, etc dishes were ok.  Nothing special.  Some steaming trays were left empty, they did not refill food.  

The service was outstanding (that is why 2 stars).  Try at your own risk!  Steer clear of the clams."
2,"Good atmosphere.
I had the Wild Salmon and it was a 9 out of 10.
But my wife had the 10 oz Filet mignon and it was too salty that tasted bitter!!!
Final verdict: not going back."
2,"Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.

A co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.

I got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.

I won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road."
2,"Cheese curds were still solid   *sad face*


I needed my poutine fix.  It only comes one a year, so I had to take care of my annual craving ASAP.  So, here's My Big Cheese Poutinerie within a walking distance of my accommodations.

Atmosphere:  It is small, and quite dark.  One thing I don't like about dark places, unless it is at night in a romantic restaurant, is that it is difficult to see your food properly, especially if you would like to be able to see it if it is cooked properly, or if the kitchen crew may have personally customized your food without your knowledge.

Food:  I had originally ordered the Smoked Meat poutine, but no smoked meat was available.  Hmm...  Montreal flavour will have to be met another day.  So I had ordered the Maple Bacon poutine.  The large portion was great, it was good for two people.  The fries and gravy was not hot though, so my cheese curds didn't even warm through, let alone melt.  Chunky.  The maple bacon bits were in good portion, plenty of it scattering all over the top of the poutine.  Other than the non-melted curds, the maple was too strong in sweetness, the salty gravy couldn't even properly balance the two out into a savoury/sweet dish.  Darn.  All drinks are either bottled or canned.  

Service:  The service was nothing to rave about.  The woman at the register seemed disinterested in taking our order, or even bothered to provide suggestions when my first order was turned down.  She even didn't care about the patrons behind us to take their orders either.  The poutine did come out quickly though (probably because the food was not cooked to order).

Mostly likely will not be back.  Sorry."
2,"Very average. I tried pork sandwich with kimchi fries, honestly nothing special don't know why the ratings are so high. Also when you order for in, you have to pick it up from kitchen which is annoying. Don't believe the hype."
2,"Horrible service. Slow counter staff, then our pizza gets sent to another table! They gave us a credit for our next visit. Lame!"
2,"I had an appointment yesterday afternoon, so hubby and I went to North Park Lounge for a late lunch. If you are looking for something fast and not special it is the place to go! The staff isn't the greatest (not very friendly).
I would be more inclined to go when there is a game on all the TVs, and for drinks not food."
2,"Went there for the first time in over a year and gotta say, if you're specialty is wings...make them right!  I ordered the dill and sweet thai wings and although the sauce wasn't bad, the wings were small and not cooked very well, the chicken was too slimy, no crispness.  Ordered a side of gar par fries and they were basically the same kind of garbage fries KFC uses and they had just some gar par sauce they put on the wings and charge $1.99 extra for them!  Don't think I'm coming back to this place for wings, but my friends burger looked pretty good."
2,"This is a nice little place in the Bellagio--which I wouldn't have stopped in had I not gotten a 2 for 1 drink coupon from a pretty girl out front of the casino. It's quite dark in here--to where you almost cannot see the menu. It's nice to find a place to sit and relax and have a drink in Vegas! The furniture is modern, complete with some awkward quilted round 'table' in the center of the room and little skinny hard chairs that sat higher than the table. 

One thing that struck me was the attitude from the waitress when we ordered a shot of Patron and a glass of water...to which she responded ""um, we don't serve TAP water.'  Fine and dandy, until we get the half pint bottle of Fiji that cost $5. 

I understand it's Vegas, but $10 for a Blue Moon? In a bottle, even, with no glass offered.  That's really difficult for this Missouri girl to handle, considering I can buy a six pack for $7 and drink it barefoot. :) We had to ask for the tab with the bartender because once the cocktail waitresses took our order, they completely disappeared. Be forwarned...sometimes a two for one drink coupon doesn't mean you'll come out ahead!"
2,"I'm giving this hotel two stars because I have been to many Embassy Suites and they were much better down than this one. There was mold in the bathroom the base boards were separating from the wall and there were lots of cracks throughout the bathroom floor. Also, the food was absolutely terrible. The bacon was cold, greasy and thin. The omelette was flavorless and paper-thin. The donuts were stale...it was just gross. I like Embassy hotels but this one gave them all a bad look."
2,"Thus place is going down hill. The taco Tuesday prices went up from .99 to 1.69 and the out less chicken in the tacos. On top of that, the chicken didn't taste so good. The only thing that is still the same is the front staff taking the order but what good is that if the food isn't anymore."
2,"$8 for a Sam Adams stout !?!

The italian hoagies are good. I've heard that the pizza is good. The wings are just ok (too salty, too fatty). I think the food at the Route 8  NPL clubhouse location is better."
2,"We usually go there as an office for lunch  a few time a month but today we had an in-house meeting so we ordered.  Got there and the order was ready but the number of cups they would only give  for as much as we ordered was a far cry from past exp.   Ask for chips and threw in one bag, then upon returning to the office we where short on food.  Called back and got their ""FULL"" voice mail finally got through and when I said the order  was not complete the call dropped twice.  Very disappointing"
2,"This was my first time eating breakfast here and it wasn't all that.  I paid  $25.00 (includes $5 tip)  and a guest to eat breakfast.  I had cheesy eggs, hash browns, raisin toast, bacon and coffee.  He had 1 waffle, bacon, eggs, hash browns and biscuit.  The food was unseasoned and the coffee pot looked gross. When I mentioned that to the waitress, she said the inside was clean and ran her finger along the inside to show me her finger??? Most of the tables were dirty, and I waited until one was cleaned for us. Also, I'm a BIG woman and had to squeeze into their booth table.  So, if you're heavyset, I highly recommend that you sit at the counter.

I left feeling full, but unsatisfied.  Wish I had followed my first mind and went to IHOP's. Or, better yet, cooked my own breakfast at home but I was ""paying it forward"" by treating someone who needed a ""real"" meal and not McDonald's dollar menu."
2,The food is always good but this time in I had a rude ass waitress. I was expecting a wait since it's New Years Day but I never expect or appreciate the attitude. I didn't make you get this job or come in today ma'am. Just take my order and make sure it's right with that attitude or I will shut this one down and make everything stop moving until it's right. #FoodJones
2,"Every  time I order wings here, they come out skimpy broken bones . Never equal drums to wing pieces.  I just had one drum out of 6. Sorry can't order here anymore. Very disappointing based on other baskets I've seen come out.. wings simple,  guess not."
2,"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second. 

The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry."
2,"Sub-par food.  My mom found a mosquito in her food.  That was enough for us.  

On a bonus - the mommy in me - They have a baby changing station in the bathroom."
2,"I will definitely NOT be coming back to China City. Why?
1. Food was at best mediocre, and mostly inedible. 
2. Steak kabobs were not only tough as shoe leather, but cold. Not ""cold"" as in intentionally chilled beef...but cold as in ""our warmer is broken and this kabob was (over)cooked four hours ago and has been sitting out since then"".
3. Most food either wasn't labeled or was mis-labeled.
4. All meat dishes were fat fat fatty...even for cheap chinese food.
5. Decor and layout were very low-budget. They took a relatively new building that has housed a couple of fairly nicely decorated restaurants and made it look like an old buffet in an aging strip mall.
6. Food not well-stocked. Many main items were left with empty trays  (Orange chicken, bacon-wrapped shrimp).

What did they do right? Polish sausage was crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside and served at proper temperature; and the little fried dough, sugary dessert things...like little doughnuts..those were amazingly warm and light and not as greasy as some people make them.

Of course, I made the mistake of eating my fortune cookie after the yummy sugary fried dough thing. Blech. The fortune cookies tasted old and stale.

If you're in the area and in dire need of Chinese buffet, go to Lin's at 75th ave and McDowell...I've stopped going there since they haven't been taking care of the place (bathrooms all destroyed and graffiti'd...food quality is not as good as it once was)...but I would choose Lin's EVERY TIME over China City."
2,"TNT dropped the ball on my second visit.  I bought the $16 for $12 deal through Yelp and that worked out fine, but they did a shabby job cleaning my interior and left a scratch on the dashboard of my new car.  To state the obvious, I'm not very happy about it!

I will never let them touch my interior ever again.  I will, however, stick to their $5 wash where you pull up to a user-friendly machine, punch in your order, get your car brushed, go through the machine, and they hand dry your ride with a towel."
2,"Wasnt happy with the food here...
Got fried rice instead of white...didnt get my drink..and the food was just meh..."
2,"NPL seems to be going downhill. Horrible service from the hostesses, waited 45 minutes for a table we called ahead for and was told upon arrival it would only be a 30 minute wait. Hostesses were rude and lacked any welcoming presence, they seated a larger party that came in after us with no real excuse. The waitress was wonderful but the food was lackluster...burned chicken parm and uncooked baked potatoes left the entire table disappointed. Manager took the chicken parm off the bill but offered no real apology or explaination. Won't be back anytime soon."
2,"I used to dig WH...but this last time we went Sunday in Phoenix-just wasn't impressed. Had to ask someone to clean the counter so we could sit down & the waitress acted bothered. Sorry did you want a 20% tip or?? Ugh. My omelet wS fluffy, small but good. My waffle-I asked for medium light-came out dark so she said her bad & made a new one. It was still not what I wanted but I ate a couple bites in the middle. My sausage was just sitting there waiting for pick up so they weren't even hot. It's ready go get it! Argh. My guests eggs were cold, cheese was not even melted in the grits so he didn't even eat his bfast & we had a 5 hour drive not happy. I'm all about customer service-when I go to pay...the guy has his back to me & is on his cel phone. Really?! Come on guys let's get it together don't slack. WH needs to keep up the fun atmosphere it used to have. Now there are slackers(I heard the younger kid/cook telling one girl all of her errors while calling out orders and she use said ""whatever same thing"" no you didn't say pull two sausage. Yada yada...I just need them to kick up the professionalism n quality. There isn't a WH on the west coast /Cali or Vegas so when I do find one I want it to be great! *Having a guy start the dishes right in front of your food was so gross it smelled & all the steam was going up onto our plates. Blah! Gota wait until ppl are done eating please!!"
2,"Great place to stay if you want a nice room but non working TV's, rude bartenders and construction the floor above.  I checked in and soon thereafter went off site for dinner since there was construction happening in the room above me.  When I returned I went to Tryon Place, the hotel bar.  When I asked for a beer list the bartender pointed to a corner about 8' up and over 10' away of beer bottles and said ""there it is"".  When I remarked at how hard it was to tell what was up there he simply remarked ""yes it is"" and went about his way.  Upon returning to my room I tried to watch a little tv but neither unit worked via remote.  I called the front desk and they said engineering would need to be called to reprogram the remotes.  Shouldn't this be a housekeeping checklist item???  It is no wonder this is the cheapest Hilton property in Charlotte."
2,Not very impressive. Small portions and undercooked fries.
2,"I walked by this one of a kind restaurant and thought it was neat that we have a poutine diner.  My friend and I decided to take a peak.  We ordered the pull pork with bacon and sausage poutine aka Notorious P.I.G.  I thought it would taste spectacular since they specialize in just poutines, but quite frankly new York fries is probable better.  The only difference is they have a wide range of toppings such as AAA beef, chicken, pork and a few more ordinary mix-ups that you wouldn't normally add to your fries.  They use a typical beef gravy, much like something that you could whip up at home yourself.  The poutine left a sour after taste, my friend suspected that it was red wine.  I was curious to find out what it was so I asked the cashier.  I brought the poutine up to the counter and saw the look on her face, she was probably hoping that I wouldn't complain. She said the sour after taste came from the south western sauce marinaded with the pork.  
$8 for a small poutine is a tad high but it's loaded with meat so I guess it's worth it if you're a meat lover.
The place is small and cozy so it's perfect for a small snack on a cold day, not so much a hot day because it was rather warm so I couldn't imagine how stuffy it would be on a hot day. 
This shack would definitely curb your enthusiasm if you're a poutine lover, not so much for me."
2,"I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years.  They have the BEST subs ever. 

BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town.  They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction.  The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them.  That $2.50 came out of their tip, they can hit up their boss for the rest.  Its 2014 and they still don't take credit and or debit cards.  Shame on them."
2,"I know my van is a big pain in the ass, especially since I have 4 kids in the back usually...but come on man, you didn't' even try...well maybe you tried a little bit when I pay you money to do a job, I want you to try a lot...like try hard. Try hard to do a good job, please. The van was mostly clean, but I was still scratching spots of shit off from the outside and was disappointed to see things like back seat cup holders totally ignored...not worth my time to drive back over and complain about cup holders and nit-pick about birdshit leftovers on my hood...just not really going to go back, ever."
2,"Let's start by talking about what I DID NOT have....carnitas, lengua, cabeza, Al pastor. ....they don't offer any if those! Only chicken, Carne asada or fish. This is Phoenix and you don't offer anything except those 3 for tacos or burritos? With all the taco and burrito options in this town, chicos falls on their face with very limited options. as for what I did have, the carne asada burrito was not very good. I specifically asked if there was rice in it they said yes but there wasnt any. The meat was just okay nothing stands out. don't waste your time here. There are way too many other options close by that are awesome."
2,"This is actually the first time I have ever been to a Waffle House. My husband's cousin talks about going here all the time, so I had to check it out.

Our server was friendly and she even was able to incorporate the phrase "" sausage fest "" into our brief conversations. In other instances this would have annoyed me because of how inappropriate it was in this setting, but while staring at her huge pregnant belly, I could do nothing but laugh.

The food was not good. The sausage gravy was way too salty, eggs were way under-cooked, waffles were average, coffee was alright ( served in a lipstick stained mug the first go around ), sausage and bacon were below average, hash browns were limp, mushy, and flavorless.

I would only return to a Waffle House if this was my ONLY option."
2,"So I think the time of closing posted on the front door was 10PM...we arrived at 8PM...that's a kinda normal dinner hour right? Well most of the food was gone, the only thing I saw them refill was the lo mein...
Meats tasted burnt and/or overly smoked. Salmon was so dry, it was enough to almost cut the inside of my mouth. 
The hot and sour soup was not only lacking in flavor but also smelt like a dirty foot just walking out of the gym.
The only thing I really enjoyed was the kimchi. It was the best I've had in a LONG time.
The sushi was OK...at least it was cold I guess.
Probably around 8:30PM all the staff sat down in the dining room to eat, I mean EVERYONE...cooks, waiters, hosts and hostesses...leaving all the customers to pretty much fend for themselves. We sat for prolly around 10 minutes waiting for our check to be brought to us. For 2 dinners, one soda and one water, it was almost $30!!! Are you kidding me?? Especially when most of the food was gone and so old that it looked shriveled up and nasty??? 
The kimchi isn't worth coming back to this place...Nothing is worth coming here..."
2,"Wow!  Not what I expected for a Hilton property.  When I made my reservation, I was advised the atrium was under construction but the pictures of the atrium looked amazing at the Hilton website.  

Walking in, I saw the barrier where the construction was taking place.  Again, I was hoping this was no big deal.  Checking in was easy and the staff was neither friendly or offensive.  Once again, I was not welcomed as a Hilton Honors member.  Is it a thing now that being a Silver Hilton Honors member means nothing to Hilton properties?  This is the second time in 60 days I've chosen a Hilton property specifically over a Marriott property and neither hotel cared (the other property was a Hampton property).

My room was on the second floor.  No big deal.  Because I'm on the second floor, I'd prefer to take the stairs to not waste people's time wanting to get to a higher floor.  I did find two sets of stairs that took me to the first floor but the only door I could go out put me outside.  I asked the front desk where the other stairs were and he said they were next to the elevator.  I walked over to those stairs to get to the second floor and SURPRISE!.....the stairs are closed off because of the atrium construction.  HUH????  Why in the blue hell would you be working the front desk and tell me where the stairs to the second floor are knowing I had a better chance winning the lottery thank taking the stairs from the first floor to the second floor.

I gotta say I'm huge fan of free happy hour drinks.  I'd heard a rumor that you get two free drinks here at the hotel between 5pm and 7pm.  Sure as rain falls from the sky, upon checking in I was given two free drink tickets.  I was over the moon delighted for free drinks!!!  I found the bar area and that's were the excitement turned into disapointment.  It felt like I was in the most depressing bar in the world.  I can't even accuately translate into words how sad I truely felt inside the bar.  I had to leave the bar.  I even gave away my two free drink tickets because no amount of alcohol was worth staying in that depressing place.

The only positive part of the stay is the room.  It has a livingroom area and a seperate bed.  I have a sink in my bedroom which is the thrid sink in the room.  Maybe it's a North Carolina thing, who knows?!?!?

The best way to sum up my stay (I still have another night here) is my first action was to log onto Hilton.com and look for another room.  My epic fail was reading lots of less-than-favorable reviews and thinking nuts to them, the property has to be much better than these sour grape-ers make it sound."
2,"If you're ever up a few grand at the tables at Bellagio and feel obligated to give that money right back to the house by paying $500 per bottle for alcohol, then this is your place. Short of those circumstances, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.

Some friends and I wandered into this lounge - looking for a place to relax, have a few drinks, and catch up. It was nearly empty at the time (probably around 10PM on a Monday night). The staff was friendly enough while we were the only ones there. But roughly 1 hour (and 3 rounds) later, as the place began to fill up, it was a different story. Suddenly ordering single drinks - and god forbid 1 bottle of water - wasn't enough to compete for the waitresses attention.

The drinks aren't cheap, which is fine and what you would expect, given the location. But you'd also expect the service to be a lot better - and to not have to get up and track your waitress down when you wanted to order something. Like I said earlier, if you're not willing to spend a grand or two on bottle service, skip this place. The final straw was the manager offering us a round of drinks in return for the table that we were sitting at.

I'll give a 2nd star because the service was decent for the first hour or so, and I had a great time with my friends despite this place's shortcomings."
2,"I didn't find the service here too great. The table we sat at had remnants of the previous diner's meal. No one bothered to come clean it off so it became self-service. I don't expect to walk into a place and feel like I'm at the Gap and get a ""Hi, there! Welcome to Lazy Daisy's! How can I be of assistance?!"" but a little acknowledgment would be nice. 
The food was pretty bland too. My husband ordered a breakfast dish that had bacon. He asked for the dish without it. They said they'd give him more eggs but lies! lies! lies!
The pastries looked pretty good though. I think if I return to this place, it'd just be to get a tea and maybe one of those yummy-looking pastries."
2,"I'm such a cliché.  Eating Chinese food alone...*sigh*  Anytime you ever see someone at a restaurant eating alone, just remember it's me.  

Anyhoo, after being spammed by numerous flyers in my physical mailbox, I decided to venture to Little DUMPling.  I got in a hair before 4pm, so I was able to get the orange chicken lunch special and a drink for a little under $8.  It comes with egg drop soup and some wonton chips (dine-in only).  The chicken itself was very underwhelming.  I mean, I like plain foods, but this was TOO plain...I'm talking devoid of any taste at all.  Even when I drenched it in the sauce, I tasted nothing.  It hardly seems fair to rate a restaurant upon one item only, but I'm going with a 2 for now based on the orange chicken.  If I ever decide to return, I will update accordingly.

Lonely out~ (?)"
2,"My experiences with The Big Cheese : 

Round 1 - I headed there with a couple other Yelpers for their opening day. Granted, they had opened just after a Poutine Crawl event that I had been on the day before, so at least for me they were up against some pretty serious competition. I found that their fries were a bit undercooked, but I quite enjoyed the different toppings that they had. Initial rating was, in my mind, 3 stars.

Round 2 - I was there after a friend's birthday party. It seems they fixed their issue with the fries being undercooked, but overall the poutine toppings tasted absolutely horrible. Their peppercorn sauce tasted quite bad, and the toppings were sub-par. Keeping in mind that I was drunk (and I've been known to eat pretty much anything when it comes to late-night hungries), I was quite surprised at how bad it tasted. This rating would have been 1.

Likelihood of going back? Pretty low, especially since there are other excellent places in Calgary to get a good poutine."
2,Service was okay server forgot our appetizer; roast beef was nothing's to remember coming out almost room temperature; bring a sweater because it was quite cold
2,"Ordered online for delivery and it took one hour and 45 minutes. The Buddhas delight had no tofu in it, and the brown sauce leaked all over the inside of the bag and over the other food. The food is good but the service could be much better."
2,"As a vegetarian, I know some people will say I am not knowledgeable enough to review a poutine place; however, I have lived in Montreal & in Ottawa, where I have had many authentic plates of this Quebec specialty. Plus, I know a good curd & a proper frite when I taste one! 

The pros at the Big Cheese:
1) lots of options, even for vegetarians
2) the vegetarian ""sauce"" is pretty good, a bit peppery. 

The cons:
1) curds are low quality. I understand they have to refrigerate them here (unlike Quebec & Ottawa) so you won't get the full squeak, but these were still below par even for Alberta
2) 2 of the 3 times I ate there, some of the fries were overdone to the point of being rock hard. Even the ones that had been soaking in sauce at the bottom of the container were too tough to stick a fork into. The first time, I assumed this was a fluke, but a repeat episode sadly proved me wrong.

Won't be back."
2,"If you walk around in the Bellagio casino, chances are you will be handed a 2 for 1 drink card for Caramel Bar & Lounge.  That happened to us and it's the only reason we went there.  The place is nothing special.  The waitresses were friendly (and wearing next to nothing), the bar was playing popular hip-hop and r&b songs.  The drinks were ok and the food was too.  Beware, the tacos are TINY, about the size of a piece of sushi.  The presentation of the donut dessert is kinda cool, but not much better than anything you could get at Dunkin."
2,"this was simply not my thing.  I thought it was terrible, there was a bucket of  gravy with some fries.  the disappointing thing was the fries, I could taste that the oil was not fresh and I had much better.

Please note that I am an big fan of poutine, but this was definitely not my style.  It felt unhealthy and did not sit well afterwards.   I was with the work crew and the other person that really likes poutine said it was great so take my feedback with a grain of salt."
2,"First time here - place has pros and cons. Had just a traditional poutine and fries were so over cooked and burnt. Really should have returned it. Incredibly salty dish, not sure if it was the fries or the gravy or combination of both but was huge salt overload and so hard to eat. Price was ok I think for what you get (just ordered the small) which I thought was very big/filling.

Pros: cute little place inside, cashier (girl) was friendly and nice. Place looked clean.

Unfortunately due to the extremely over salty poutine and the incredibly burnt fries, I will not be back again - it's a shame as I presumed that a place dedicated to just poutine would at least make an OK product but this wasn't even edible."
2,"Very disappointed, at first they had a ""confusion"" and I was sitting forever without a server come to take care. 
Then I got a glass of wine and the menu, another minutes went by... then I ask for the signature dish of the place: dry age meat, and they didn't have any. Why didn't they aware the customers that they don't have the signature dish?  Anyway I stayed. The place was half empty but the service was one of the worst and slowest in my life. 
I ask for some sauce that didn't make the table, I had to ask to refill my glass. 
The food was fine, de calliflower soup ok. The Mac and cheese was very good, and the filet mignion was good. 
Bad day, bad experience."
2,Came in for quick pound of wings and I was very disappointed. Soggy over breaded with one of the worst sauces I've ever had. As far ambiance goes The Bedrock Chairs they have are so ugly that I think their designer should be shot. I only gave a second star because it might be a place for a beer and pool.
2,"I took my car to this facility for a car wash. I purchased the extreme car wash for $21. They did an OK job. There was nothing fantastic about the car wash. They did a very ""surface clean"" type of washe to my car. It was very unfinished. They were still stuff on the carpet, it wasn't exactly clean and the corners of the windows were still dirty like the rag missed that part of the window. my car definitely was cleaner when they were done then when I first brought it in however they didn't do a great job. It was just OK I will return to this car wash but I wont buy the expense wash."
2,This place has definitely changed over the years!  Just found out this location is under new ownership. All the old employees have left and the prices have been raised. The reason for the 3 stars is that there is absolutely no consistency here anymore.  The chicken is also tasteless and not grilled anymore. Yuck!  Depending on who is in the back making the tacos results in if you get a taco with barely any meat or a taco filled up properly.  Please bring back your old cook!!!!  The younger woman that is predominately back there now makes them so weak!  You're basically eating tortilla and lettuce!
2,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards."
2,"My husband and I decided to try this steakhouse on Friday evening. The restaurant looks really nice and has an intimate feel that's great for a nice night out, however I was very disappointed in our service. The restaurant was out of several of their steaks and sides, but we weren't informed of this upon being seated so we ended up ordering several items before the server finally told us they had the 3rd steak my husband tried to order and I ended up getting the salmon. Once our food came out, we were brought the wrong sides and our surver also tried to give us the wrong food and wrong wine which ended up being for the table next you us. We had to ask a different server if they could bring the correct sides. It wasn't very busy so I'm not sure where the confusion was. I would have had a better experience if our server would have been more attentive and also would have at least let us know up front what they didn't have so we knew. The food was great but the service and overall experience missed the mark, so we'll try other steakhouses instead next time we're here."
2,"Big Cheese is a cool little place with tiled mosaic walls, limited seating and black and white framed photos.  The ACDC music was full blast and  needless to say very annoying.  Huge selection of toppings make the menu interesting.  I stuck with traditional, just cheese and gravy.  The fries were too dark, bitter and soggy. The thin gravy had no flavor but the cheese curds were authentic.  
 The Big Cheese makes a spiritless poutine and I've had better at DQ and A&W."
2,"I have been here several times since moving to Peoria. Once the car is driven out from the wash, these guys quickly go through this process and miss some interior spot. I have had fingerprints on the windows and smudge marks on the surfaces. The just don't take the time to do a nice job. When paying $23.99 you should expect a professional job, which doesn't happen. I will be looking elsewhere."
2,Chicken tacos were not very good. Beef taco was ok. Veggie burrito was ok. Salsa could be better.  Gigantic burrito was not very good.  Probably won't be back again.
2,"I love waffles. I love hashbrowns.

This waffle house suuuuuucks. The service is piss poor and they can't get orders straight. I asked for cream for my growing cold coffee twice, I got the wrong order of hashbrowns and no syrup for my waffle.

Keep in mind I am super easy to please (that's what she said). 

Our server kept her head buried down at the register for most of our meal. 

Get it together.

Oh, just drive to the one on the 101 and University."
2,"My wife and I decided to try Barro's Pizza. We'd never ordered from them before, but looked at their menu and thought their sandwiches looked pretty good. We called to order and everything went smooth. I ordered, 2 HOT Italian sandwiches with a dzn Wings! Simple order, how could you screw that up?

We made this order at 11:40 am on Saturday. We were told it would be an hour! No problem, they're covering their ass! I get it! Yet it took 1:20 mins to have it delivered. The sandwiches were actually pretty good, as were the wings. We'd have enjoyed them much more if our food were HOT, like we ordered it. I understand being busy! But 1:20 mins for 2 sandwiches and wings? What's sad is, I live less than 2 miles from Barro's pizza location. You'd think the food would stay hot for that distance, huh? 

I may give them another chance as everybody has a bad day. But I must say it wasn't a great first impression!"
2,"Worst experience I've ever had at an Embassy Suites hotel.  Kids running through the hallways, car alarms going off all night long, staff completely unprofessional and not concerned about guests.  This is a poorly managed hotel."
2,Service was okay server forgot our appetizer; roast beef was nothing's to remember coming out almost room temperature; bring a sweater because it was quite cold
2,"I went to Caramel because I heard that it was great. It was a nice, simple, very small lounge. I was surprised at how small it was. I had the Oreo martini, which cost $20. I could care less about drink prices, and don't mind paying a lot for drinks in Vegas, but $20 was a bit much for a so-so martini with Oreo crumbs at the bottom. Or possibly Hydrox - who knows?

Love the Bellagio, not wild about Caramel. Take the ten steps to the Sports Bar, put $20 in the video poker machine and get a free martini instead. The bartenders were much friendlier at the sports bar, too."
2,"This place drives me nuts.  The staff is so blase about their job and service.

Twice the have not honored the prices advertised on their menu.  First time was for specials on a separate board.  I was told it was passed time.  Okay, fine even though nothing states that.  Next time they charged me almost double what the menu listed as the price for beer.  When I questioned it I was told the prices had changed.  Um, don't you have to change the menu on the wall then to reflect that?  

Have had the pizza, gluten free pizza, wings and ravioli.  They are all fine.

The cheese garlic bread and cookie dessert are my favorite menu items though.

I do like that they let any age order off the kids menu if you want a smaller meal with a drink."
2,"Decent car wash, can not recommend the oil change.  They made enough of a mess under the car that is was dripping oil in the garage.  I was worried they stripped the drain plug even went back to the place and they showed me that they thought it was coming from the oil pan gasket (yeah right the car is 3 years old).  Thankfully after a few days the oil drops went away, it was all caused by a messy oil change and improper clean up."
2,"I came here after a grueling evening swim practice so I was really hungry - which means anything should taste really good, right? I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished. I may try the place again some day as this may have been an off day for the restaurant, but for now I'll have to give it 2 stars."
2,"Being a former Montrealer, I've been raised on poutine during my teen to adult years.  You need the right type of squeaky cheese.  The fries have to be fried twice. The sauce has to be brown and rich.
Well... they got the cheese right.  And they do have some pretty imaginative combinations that does make the poutines there interesting.  But the base of it all, is still the sauce and the fries.  And I can say, they've completely messed that up (and CBC reviewer John Gilchrist completely agrees with me when he did his own review in 2011).  
Look, the fries are done twice for a special reason.  The first time locks in the flavour.  The second helps enhance the crispness despite the gravy soaking in.  And at even the most basic places in Montreal, such as the legendary Lafleur hot dog and fries chain in Montreal, this is always done with FRESH potatoes cut right there on the spot.  I walk in, and what do I see?  Bags of McCain's-like frozen fries bags being opened and then cooked once.  
Then came the sauce.  Basically, it was lifeless, with little real taste except maybe too much salt.  Back home, the poutine gravy is made with some sort of beef base, and has a great flavour on it's own.  Hell, some people I know even drink it straight with their meals.  This was just a sauce that wasn't too far from powdered mix.  
As Mr. Gilchrist said, and I whole heartedly agree, if you're going to make yourself the gourmet poutine place to go in Calgary, then follow the basic steps at least.  If you need inspiration, go to Canmore and try the poutine at LA BELLE PATATE, a poutine easily matching some of the best Quebec has to offer.  Just make it right people!"
2,The one they have in Kensington is definitely better. Maybe the other options would taste better but i got the butter chicken and it tasted funky. so skip that if you decide to eat here.
2,"I had the chicken wrap found it salty but meh it's bar. The service really sucked, my friend had to wait almost 20mins for the second batch of wings. You only get 5 after the first 15 :/ we constantly had to get up and get her attention or put an order or request a drink with another server. I would give the food a 7 and the service a 4. The waitress was super nice but the overall service really sucked. If I ever did come here again it would be with a large group of friends, I wouldn't mind waiting 20 mins for service...I would be socializing anyway. 

The wings are DRY! I love my wings saucy *extra saucy* yum!! And they just drizzle the sauce on the wings...weird :/ well, I'm glad I didn't go here for wings :) 
The place is huge with. Lots of TVs but I come here to eat and get good service."
2,"I haven't been to a car wash in years. I used to come here years ago, so I took my new vehicle in for its first wash and thought it would be good here. I originally got the express wash, but then they said for just a little more they'd hand wax it and wash it for free. I figured why not... well when it was finished I had to go drive my car because they couldn't drive a standard. Then they asked if it was okay, I immediately saw some marks but just let it go since I had a friend with me and she told me she hasn't been happy with them. Well, I noticed the antenna wasn't put back on and there were a bunch of missed spots on the interior as well as the exterior. The rims and tires were shiny, but the rims were still dirty. The reason I didn't mention the issues was because I was just happy that it looked better coming out than it did going in. 
The wait wasn't long, the staff was friendly and they got the wash and wax completed in about half an hour."
2,"Meh. I've experienced better.

The AYCE wing night on Wednesdays, while sounds like a good deal, isn't worth the money. The wings are either under-sauced, over-sauced or over-seasoned. And getting consistent wait service is like trying to find Flight 370 at the bottom of the Indian ocean with nothing but a game boy colour.

They'll sneak charges into your bill, so be careful. If you come with a party of more than five they'll automatically add a 15% gratuity fee so beware. When you order a drnk for AYCE wings, make sure you order a juice (like pineapple juice). I ordered a pop which I though would be the cheapest (lets face it; fountain pop costs Wacky Wings pennies to the dollar) but my AYCE pop came up to $3!! My waitress never checked up on us until we were ready to leave so the AYCE pop was beyond pointless.

Their wing orders work like this: they have a few generic wings (breaded, non-breaded), and about 5-6 different types of sauces. When you pick one of their hundreds of flavours, they simply mix different quantities of sauces with the selected type of wing and serve it to you. If you get undersauced wings you'll notice it looks like generic, day-old KFC wings.

The decor is nice; lots of arcade games and TVs to watch while you eat.

The value of this place is pretty low. If you're looking to get a better bang for your buck, head on down to another wing place like Wild Wings where they have consistent service, consistent flavours, and honestly, better wings overall"
2,"While The Big Cheese is no Smoke's Poutinerie in Quebec, it will do until my next visit out East.

I tried the Philly Cheesesteak.  Overall, meh.  The chips were good, but most of the flavour came from the caramelized onions, not the gravy.  And it had roast beef on it, not actual steak as in a Philly.  I would visit again, but probably wouldn't try anything with meat and mushrooms again."
2,"My son and five of his friends went on ""All You Can Eat Wings"" Wednesday night.  I was disgusted at the treatment they received.  Being a group of 16-17 year olds I think the waitress took one look at them and decided since they were under drinking age she would not make much money off them.  They waited 45 mins for a table and then she was very slow in taking their order and when they asked for seconds she made sure that she went very slowly so that they would not get much for their money.  By the way, they only give you 5 lousy wings for refills so that you are constantly reordering and they purposely make sure they are slow in serving so that you give up and leave and don't get your moneys worth.  They arrived at 8pm and I told him to be back by 10pm and they took so long serving that they had to be picked up at midnight.  Completely unimpressed and will not go myself or recommend to others."
2,"Took a friend who is visiting from NYC to Big Cheese, and was less than thrilled. It was my second visit, and definately not stellar.

Ordered from a nice girl at the till, she was bubbly and pleasant, after paying we waited off to the side. Another diner's order came out, she called the number, he mentions it's to go, she quickly folds the container closed, and puts it in a bag.

Our order comes up, served by some guy, I mention that it's for takeout and I get ""Yeah, it's all for take out. It's in a takeout container."" and continued to serve up the unrequested douche-baggery. I folded the 2 containers up, and asked, albeit hesitantly for a bag. We got one, and left. 

My friend mentioned that he'd never had such poor service, even in NYC. When we got home, we found they'd botched his order (asked for no onions, and got TONNES of onions), but weren't about to walk back, and deal with this dude again.

Poutine was so-so my second round, fries a bit under done, gravy was a bit different than the first time, and WAY saltier. 

I'll definately go back, but not for a while."
2,Pricing is decent but they are either understaffed or  just lie to you. I've been here a few times and it always takes at least 30 minuets to an hour to get in and out. I go to a car wash for it to be fast and convenient. I feel that this place is neither of those.
2,"I went to the Danforth location last night. I was told that this restaurant had the best lasagne in the city. For some reason, they like to serve luke-warm water to their guests. I asked the server twice for ice, but she did not bring it. The restaurant only had one other table for two in it. The restaurant was not busy at all. The caprese salad was good. I liked the mozzarella and the basil was very fresh. The olive oil and bread was...okay. I expected better quality. The lasagne came, and I was really excited. Unfortunately, the lasagne was very greasy, and I could not finish it. The meat and noodles were under seasoned. 

I don't know if I would come back to this restaurant because there are soooo many restaurants in the city. I felt that I had purchased better frozen lasagnes in the past. I don't consider myself a great cook. However, I know that I can make better lasagne myself.

Very disappointed."
2,"Considering that this is a place that specializes in poutine I was very disappointed. I found the gravy to be quite thin and the cheese curds to be quite minimal. There was also no layering of cheese which made the second half very boring. When I asked if the Mac & Cheese Poutine was worth a try the server told us that it depended on the cook that day...I guess she was honest, but not really what I was expecting to hear. We therefor chose the standard poutine hoping that the cook would be consistant with that order.

 As for the ambiance....The music was WAY too loud and my husband and I opted to sit outside where we thought it would be quieter. We were wrong...it was just as loud outside. Not sure exactly what music they were playing but it hurt my head! 

I will not be going back again, nor will I try any other Big Cheese locations. Feeling sad that this did not impress given my love for great poutine ;("
2,"Great Chinese!  One of the better options around town.  Would probably give it a 3.5-4.  However, we tried their Thai menu tonight, and they have no business offering this menu.  The yellow curry chicken was almost green, watered down, and the chicken was typical of Chinese dishes.  The Pad Thai was bland and seemed to lack ingredients.  I will be back for Chinese, but have to first get over the money I threw away for the Thai experience."
2,"-Expensive drinks (but, it's Vegas, what do you expect?)
-No dancefloor
-Many lounge chairs & tables
-Mostly the latest hip-hop, R&B music
-Free admission

I went here with my friend on a Sunday night. I'd estimate the age-range was 27+, to about 40's. The music was very danceable, however, without a dancefloor, maybe it wasn't so danceable afterall. My friend and I danced in a small space, but felt out of place since we were the only ones. Caramel is a bar very much more for lounging since it's not so grand. There's lounge chairs, sofas and tables all along the walls for schmoozing. I ordered a cosmopolitan, $15, nothing extraordinary. I say order a drink with more alcohol content to get your money's worth. I'll return here on a night in Vegas when I don't want to spend too much money & want to listen to top 40's hits."
2,"Cool place to visit for the first time. So-so wing place with arcade games and pool tables, with lots of screens/TV's. The service isn't on par though. It takes forever to get your food even during nonpeak hours. During their unlimited wings days, they take forever to prepare the subsequent orders of wings. You are already full by the time the next batch comes. Quite an experience though when visiting for the first time."
2,"I started coming when this place was first built. This location is very convient, it is next to several shopping centers. 

The prices are okay, but lately the service has been lacking. Sometimes they do a good job cleaning the inside interior and sometimes it lacks, sometimes asking for the rag to do it myself often happens. 

Maybe i am going off of old management because the man that takes orders typically greets and opens the door and when I come today I dont even get a simple hello they seem to be in their own world. 

The place inside is clean although the customer service isn't all that good. Although,  you can kind of see that there is a work in progress."
2,"Seriously? You check a Diamond Member into a room with ripped up bedding, dilapidated bathroom and a spider to greet me?

Not that this is acceptable for anyone but based on my travel experience I'm aware that this does not meet the standards of the Hilton Family ... I predict this property will become an unknown brand very soon or perhaps the renovation is already scheduled???"
2,"Good food and the prices are fare. However, the service is inconsistent and if you are handicapped forget this place. I can't figure out how a public place that was remodeled 2 years ago can avoid handicap access .....  Shame on McCandless township and the owners of this establishment for your bathrooms."
2,"Went to this restaurant last week. 
We ordererd..
1) yogurt salad (it was average)
2) green salad (average)
3) barj kabob (Delicious) 
4) lamb chops ( thats where the two stars came from)

Very disappointing. First of we ordered two olates of lamb chops one medium rare and one medium. 
Now the concept is you order at the cash and then they will call you and you pick up the food and seat yourself. So the cashier called us and i went up there to get my two orders of lamb chops. And she said "" oh the cook forgot to cook the one medium rare and just cooked both medium"" like seriously instead of redoing my order and get the temperature i asked for they just gave me the wrong temperature so it doesnt come out of their pocket. Second the lamb chops were not even cooked medium they were medium well and too hard to chew and its just tasted awful and dry. 

Will not be back except for the barg kabab that they have."
2,"I came on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend and ordered from the a la carte menu. We ordered a Maki Set and the Chirashi Dinner. We were disappointed by the quantity of sashimi in the Chirashi and how small the Maki rolls were. The quality of the fish were decent. 

The biggest issue we had was the slow service. It took over 30 mins from the time we asked for the bill to the time we actually paid. 

The experience may differ for AYCE, but the slow service will keep us from coming back to try."
2,"Could be much better.  My standards for Turkish cuisine are high but even the ingredients in this case were either old or not well chosen.  Food was oily for whatever reason, and the oil was of poor quality. 

For those not accustomed to Turkish food, this place can still be your introduction.

Almost forgot: the service was inaccurate and sparse."
2,Meh.....It wasn't horrible but it wasn't good. Don't think I'll be back. Food was too salty for my taste. Service wasn't bad but wasn't anything special.
2,"Not for this location but the location in the smith's on Centennial and Losee location since they do have a location mark there. I'm pissed because the male employee that made my drink ""forgot"" I said light on ice and gave me the normal amount of ice for a drink. Get it together and either cut back on the ice or train your employees to remember what they wrote on the cups! I'm tired of ice to liquid ratio in drinks."
2,"Step your game up, Starbucks on Losee and Craig. 

There were so many mistakes that occurred during one visit alone. A coworker and I ventured down here to pickup drinks for our colleagues. Unfortunately, we realized issues with the orders once we arrived back at work.

Hot beverages were missing sleeves, there weren't enough straws for cold beverages, and one colleague received a poorly made chai that resembled lemonade and had a terrible taste.

The lines both inside and out at drive-thru are ridiculously long and aren't worth the wait."
2,Very pricy and food is ok. I prefer these take out place around Atwood better.
2,First and for most I do not like to be BS'ed. I came up from Tucson to purchase a Mazda. Communicating that I would like my windows tinted to legal specifications. I also gave those specifications. My salesman never gave me a direct answer he tap dance around the subject. When I got up there the vehicle windows were not tinted to my liking. I addressed it. Instead of just saying can't do that for you. I got into a disagreement. Once I showed him the Arizona law on tinting he changed his response to we do not carry that tint. I ended up buying the vehicle due to traveling all the way up there from Tucson. Then the Finance officer had a slight little comment because I wouldn't buy their Maintenance package. They did throw in a Rubber Trunk mat in for me so that was positive. I will not recommend or return in the future to this establishment.
2,"So, here is my story.  My family and I were visiting from Boston, MA.

After driving 5 hours from Montreal, we immediately dropped our stuff off at the Airbnb we were staying and went to the Zoo.

It was 7:30pm and we were tired and hungry.  We wanted something fast and decided to order pizza for pick up on our way ""home"".

So, we order 2 large pizzas which came out to about $50 (expensive!)

Drive was about 20 mins from the zoo and they told us 25 mins. So, perfect timing.

We get there and my dad goes in to pay and pick it up. they had not made our pizzas.  The lady at the counter told us, she thought it was a prank call and did not put the order it.  So, we had to wait a half hour longer for our pizzas.  Out number had come up on the caller ID and after we had told her we were visiting for the weekend.

We are all a little hangry at this point.  so, basically 1.5 hours later our pizzas were ready.

The pizza was rather disappointing as well.  Just too much and heavy slices.

Note to visitors: call from a local number if you want pick up.  Now i am not sure if they would have delivered had we called."
2,"When I decided to buy a new car ,Mazda was on my top three choices.However, after a bad customer service experience in Chapman Mazda,I decided to buy another brand.I almost had to beg the sales person for a test drive and the quote that I got was the highest among other dealers."
2,"Visited here a couple weeks ago, because I passed by and smelled the curry, it smelled really good.

Sat down and ordered a Malaysian chicken curry with Naan and a side of rice.

The curry was average, smelled better than it tasted. The potato was mostly melted into the curry already, and the Naan was too thick and moist.  Service wise.. there was only 1 person manning the entire restaurant, not that it's really big, but there were 5 tables at the time, so service wasn't the greatest either.

Doubt I will come back again."
2,"The service was absolutely horrible.  Our waitress took our drink order twice and still forgot what I was getting.  The food was 4 stars but the service was a 2.  

This wasn't the first time I have had bad service.  If the bacon wasn't so thick and good I would never go back."
2,"We were referred here by Craig Animal Hospital for boarding services. When I talked to Jennifer I clearly explained the importance of getting all paperwork and everything in order prior to us bringing our dogs there for the stay. I even stopped by the office and talked to Jennifer and gave her a copy of the current shot records for each of our dogs. I explained to Jennifer that one of our dogs needed her shots updated. I asked her if I needed to bring that dog to their clinic early to get her shots and anything else you may need updated prior to us leaving on our trip. We had a very early flight and I explained to her that we needed to simply drop the dogs off and get out of there as quickly as possible in order to meet our flight time. She assured me that she would get all the records from Craig animal hospital and that it would be no problem checking the dogs in quickly and getting out in order to get to the airport on time. When we arrived on the day of our flight the staff there wanted us to wait around in order for a vet to examine one of our dogs because the shots weren't updated. I explained what Jennifer had told me and also of my offer to come in days prior to get this taken care of and they told me they had no idea. Eventually after me strenuously explain this to them they agreed to get the records from Craig animal hospital and give The one dog who needed an updated shot her shot and that we would take care of this when we came back from our trip. When we came back from our trip we noticed several billing errors one they charge for physical exams on two dogs that were already done at the Criag clinic they also gave a dog a rabies shot he did not need  which once again was taking care of at the Craig clinic apparently no one at lone Mountain called over to Craig or there was a miscommunicationand we ended up paying extra money for services we did not need. Jennifer was there when we were picking our dogs up and assured me that she would call Craig clinic get the records and refund my credit card for the overcharges. That was over one month ago. To date, I have not heard nothing from lone Mountain animal clinic. The dogs were in good shape when we pick them up so they're boarding services I assume get a good job with your recordkeeping there overcharging and their lack of customer service has lost me as a customer for life I'll simply find another place to take my dogs for their vet needs."
2,"Food is ok... but service is terrible! The waitress, could be the owner, seen just want to leave before their closing time. They suppose close at 10 but mopping with the stronge bleach around you when you eating half hour before they close! No matter how good the food they make, is no way you could finish. Anyway, I won't back there for sure."
2,"Yes. the view is amazing. The rest is waste of time and money.
They serve their drinks (including wine and beer) in plastic glasses. the kind that looks like a real wine glass but is made of plastic. Its so cheap I couldn't believe my eyes. If you charge $16 for a mediocre sangaria, at least serve it in a real glass. 
The food is clearly instagram food. It looks beautiful but it tastes only half as good as it looks. I was quite disappointed, especially because the menu sounded delicious and I was looking forward to try the food.
There are so many places that will give you a much better deal for your money, and with a free of charge sexy cool ambiance, that this place so lacks of. Seriously, go elsewhere"
2,"Update to my previous review which was originally five stars. My wife and I went in to Poki Point today around 11:50AM. Apparently they don't open until 12:00.  Door probably should have been locked until that time. No one greeted us, and I had to ask if they were open.  The young girl working told us they weren't open until 12. That was it.  No welcome and/or have a seat and we will serve you when everything is ready.  We almost left because of the response or lack of, but chose to wait since this is one of our favorite poke restaurants. Time passed and shortly after 12 another customer walked in and began ordering. What?  We were sitting down the whole time, and not one employee let us know they were ready for us to order. We were both extremely disappointed and left. With so many poke restaurants popping up all over the area, this one needs to improve on their customer service. We will probably give them another try. Everyone has a bad day, but if the service is the same, we will be on to somewhere else."
2,"Completely overrated.   Ordered the kebob platter for 2 ($47) and it was...ok.  Factor in the fact that both Bamiyan and Kandahar are around the corner and taste better, and you're paying double to have a table cloth and to be ignored.  Yes, the service at either of those latter self-serve restaurants would easily have been better than at Pasha.

No one ever came to ask us how the meal was and it took 15 minutes before we were able to even flag down anyone to get some ketchup for our now-cold fries.  Out of the 6 or so people working in the front, it seemed like only the one guy was willing to do his job.  When we asked for the bill, the woman (presumably the owner) came to collect the money, never asking us how the meal was and never even bothering to thank us.  No surprise the restaurant was 80% empty."
2,"Skip the food--it's utterly lacklustre. Come for the drinks, the decor, the view. 

If you do end up here for brunch, ask for some hot sauce and liberally use the salt and pepper. 

Other notes: Coconut pancakes were decent. And totally request for more cream (no extra charge). Service is warm and friendly. Coffee is bottomless."
2,"Disclaimer - I came here for dinner on Labour Day, so this review is based on a restaurant that was very likely understaffed. 

This place was close to the waterfront park so my boyfriend and I thought it would be a good idea to try out the thick crust that has gotten great reviews. Here's my take:

Service (1/5): 1 of the 2 main reasons why I wouldn't come back. I knew we had to wait ""longer"" than usual, but good service would have warned us that we'd have to wait around 1 hour for food... We waited 50 minutes for pizza, 55 minutes for poutine. Sure our waitress was kind, and we were thanked for our patience, but it was too late at that point. We just wanted to get something in our stomach and leave.

Large Pino Special + Poutine (1.5/5): The 2nd reason why I wouldn't come back. You can read every other review about how cheesy and full of ingredients the pizza was. How the crust was great and overall for a mom and pop shop they did make good pizza... but that won't make up for the food poisoning my boyfriend and I paid for after the fact. We both thought it was something else, but after I brought home left overs for my family they also had to use the bathroom to get rid of what they ate. I figure it was because Pino's was understaffed and with an influx of orders they rushed and did not cook the pizza well enough. The Poutine was pretty standard, nothing much to say there. 

Cost (3/5): $20 for a large pizza and $7 for poutine + tip. Not bad. It's not a chain, the servings were large and hearty, so I think it was fairly priced.

Ambiance (3/5): It's a mom and pop shop! Don't expect anything fancy. However it's family friendly and clean. Can't really ask for more than that.

Overall, besides some kind of food poisoning and horrendous wait time, the pizza wasn't that special. it was a nice change from chains like pizza pizza and pizza hut, but not special enough to come back for a second round. Sorry Pino's."
2,"I was not at all impressed with this place. It was completely empty when we walked in, that should have been our red flag. Not 1 single person other than the waiter. It would have been nice if the menu had some pics so we could be familiarized with what we were ordering. The food portion size was very little in comparison to the price. We ordered a Chicken Skewer dish with an extra Skewer of lamb, but that was missing. Then when we inquired about it, the waiter brought us the lamb skewer of 4 small pieces of meat. When the bill came, we were charged for 1 extra chicken skewer AND 1 extra lamb skewer. When we told him, he corrected it, but I was not please about that error. All the dishes were bland, dry, and just not satisfying at all. The only good item was the kunefe dessert which was served warm and was delicious. The waiter was a very nice young gentleman. I gave this place 2 stars, 1) for the service, and 2) for the dessert. I would have given them 5 stars if 1) portion size was bigger, 2) the price was more modest, and 3) the food actually tasted good."
2,I needed to update my rating.  During takeout I really just focus on the food quality and taste.  I ordered a large 3 topping with wings special and I was so disappointed they didn't even start making my wings until I got there 30+ minutes later.  they had me and my pizza (now cold) sit for 20 minutes for he wings.  I didn't drive out there to get a very cold pizza; it is really unacceptable they didn't have the wings started when while there was traffic they were not busy.    When I got home they actually put too much cheese on (and I LOVE cheese) so much so the pizza didn't cook properly and the brick of cheese on top fell off when u try to eat it and topping were cold.   The mistake was so bad I really can't justify going out there if they can't serve hot food or get a simple order ready in reasonable time.   I won't be back
2,"The food is good, not great but good. They have 3 veggie options but the veggie mantoo and that potato folles bread is never available.

The service is hordenous. I had a take out order and the chef in the back literally had to tell the server 3 times to just hand me my meal so I could go. Even he was annoyed!

I would never go out of my way to go here."
2,"Coffee machine needs to be calibrated, different members of the family at different times have experienced ""milky"" drinks because this location and the one on mlk uses a different setup or needs to service their machines.. we want coffee not hot milk!"
2,"The Korean food is so-so compared to the awesome Korean joints I've been to in Chicago, LA, NYC, and San Francisco. Granted, it would be unfair to compare a Korean restaurant in Pittsburgh with those in these cities, I can't help but be a bit disappointed.

I would stay away from the soondooboo chigae. Not much seafood and bland soup base. The kimchi chigae is decent. The prices are high for the quality. I was disappointed by the lack of some key Korean dishes on their menu (i.e. maewoontang).

Korea Garden does the job if I don't have time to cook and am having a serious Korean food craving. Otherwise, I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere."
2,"I came in with a few friends and we were really excited to try their sandwiches based on all of the positive reviews. I've had many bahn mi in my day and I'd consider this experience one of my least favorite. Upon entering, you form a line and are surrounded by prepared snacks, meals and drinks. Everything looks great, but is a little pricey. I decided against a prepared meal as most of the reviews were for their sandwiches. I opted for the Saigon sandwich 10"" which cost $3.75. It's on special and all of the other 10"" sandwiches are $4.25. The Saigon has pate, Vietnamese sausage and ham with the radish/carrot slaw and cilantro. After purchasing our food we sat outside to enjoy our meals. There is no covering when you sit in their outdoor area so be cautious on sunny days as it can get a little hot. My first bite into the sandwich was all bread. This wouldn't have been so terrible if the bread wasn't hard and dry. Usually when I eat bahn mi the bread is crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, but this bread was hard and dry out the outside with an inside to match. Needless to say, I ate the sandwich open faced style as the bread tore up the roof of my mouth. Overall the downfall of this place is the following: 1) the bread to meat ratio is off. There's more than double the bread and it's terrible bread. 2) the atmosphere. It's like eating inside a convenience store. 3) The service. You never enjoy coming to a place where you feel like you're inconveniencing the staff."
2,The coffee they make is great however it never fails that I am on the drive thru for 10-15 minutes. This is not an isolated incident. Why the long wait? It's the same whether there is a long line or just one car ahead of me. A free coffee for the wait? I've never been offered one.
2,"Someone really needs to fix up a Korean restaurant with good tasting Korean food.

I come here when I really crave some Korean food... but it's not that good. It's tolerable.

Once when I came here, they gave me egg soup with noodles .... without the noodles! The jjajangmyun is bland, and so is the soondooboo. 

They have a karaoke room upstairs for parties which is fun, but it does cost an arm and leg since there is no other asian-karaoke options near the area."
2,"I'm getting tired of their approach of taking your animal in the back and then sending their assistant with an estimate of different  approaches in which to care for your animals illness. The most expensive of approach  includes a bunch of tests that may or may not be necessary but usually include a hefty price tag. When you ask the assistant details about the various tests they usually can't explain them and don't know the difference. The second course of treatment without as many tests is a little less expensive. 
If I was a veterinarian I would know which approach  to take instead of having an assistant that is not sure about the differences between the courses of treatment ask me which one I would like to take. 
I brought my chocolate Labrador in with an ear infection, the first estimate was $419 the second estimate was $230 when I ask can I just get the antibiotics and ear wash that I've always used before with my other dogs she said oh yes we can do that that'll be $96 including the exam.
I feel like I'm at the car dealership service counter and they are trying to tag on as many services and maintenance procedures as possible to increase the bottom line."
2,"Wow guys, 20 minutes for one frap. The line at the drive through was forever long, about 10 cars deep, so I went inside. There was one person finishing up at the register (he only got a regular coffee), a group of three, and then me. That makes it 20 minutes, to make 4 drinks. So the line at the drive through is long, the wait inside is long, even with 5 people working? Something was amiss here... and I know what it is. I am ALL about fun at work, but when the lines are long and people are waiting, it's time to buckle down and handle business. All hands on a focused deck! I also noticed there was not much multitasking going on, making one drink at a time type thing. So if you can't multitask well, and you're playing around, that means people are going to be late getting back to work from their break (this girl). Please be considerate of your customers time, team members. Have a good time, but keep the playing around for when it's slow, it would be appreciated."
2,It is just okay. I can't say it was bad but I wouldn't eat there again. It is pricey for the low quality and I would say it's like mall food court Japanese.
2,"Holy scheisse, this place has high reviews. I pray none of them are for the Vietnamese sandwich, which was by far the worst banh mi I've ever tasted.

An array of Vua's 10"" Vietnamese sandwiches are $2.95 after 9pm. What a steal! They won't toast them, though, because apparently they turn off the ovens by then. The sandwich is already pre-assembled and bagged so you can be in and out in under a minute.  

We went with the classic. Unfortunately the sandwich was terrible - did they put onion gravy in it??? There was an excess of something cloyingly sweet and sticky that is completely foreign to all my banh mi endeavors. The pickled veggies inside were mushy and tasteless instead of providing crunch or tartness. The bread, of course, was spongy and cold but didn't seem like it'd hold up as toasted baguette either. 

If there was pate in it -sigh!- then it was swallowed up by the strange gooey sweetness. Quebec, of all places to ruin a pate! 

I had neither high nor low expectations for this place - just hungry! but the banh mi was just a huge disappointment on all fronts besides price.

Come here if you just want to be full; 3 bucks for almost a foot of sandwich is a sweet deal. But if you actually know what banh mi tastes like, avoid avoid avoid Vua's offerings."
2,Slow drive-thru either needs more employees inside the business or they need to pick up the pace. 10 min and only one car in front of me is way too long.
2,"The menu was comprehensive and we ordered several dishes, but none of them were particularly good.  The bibimbap was room temperature but otherwise acceptable.  The shrimp and scallop bento box was covered in mushrooms (which were not listed on the menu but made up the majority of the dish... not a happy surprise for someone who despises mushrooms.  In fact they were the cheap western mushrooms that seemed only to be there to bulk out the dish.  Nasty.)  The japchae was passable but far from the best I've head.  At least it wasn't greasy but the sauce it was in was not quite what it could have been. 
Its on a dirty little street and hard to find and way overpriced.  We won't be going back."
2,"Go for the views but don't expect professional servers beyond what you'd find in a ""16 year old waiting tables at Kelsey's"" as one of my fellow diners commented. The food was pretty good, but nothing exceptional, the chicken was dry and the short rib too fatty for the $55 price tag. 
The service - we had to flag our server down multiple times for water refills, to ask for the wine list once starters were done, there was no inquiry as to my friends wine or to even ask if they wanted another glass! (Which they did and we went out after dinner because not enough wine is sheer travesty) after waiting for eons for our server to come take our dessert orders we said forget it and just paid the bill. Empty dishes left on the table for far too long, sparkling water refills had to be flagged down as they disappeared with the bottle - oh and everything is in a plastic glass. Sure sure, it's a rooftop, but other places I've been in the city stick with glassware so unsure why it's different here especially at these prices.
At the end of the day it's a hotel patio so grab a cocktail on a summer night, enjoy the view and leave before you get too thirsty to have to chase someone down for another."
2,"I wish I would have written a review of this place when I loved it. The other 5 or 6 times I've been here. This time, something is TOTALLY different. I always order the same thing, regular gyro meal with fries or a salad depending on how I'm feeling. Or, I'll order the chicken shawarma with fries or a salad. 

I immediately noticed there was a possibly Korean woman cooking (she stepped out of the kitchen to watch me while I was ordering ). The lady behind the counter was also unfamiliar. It definitely wasn't the same family that operated the place before. I ordered the chicken shawarma meal with a salad and a side of falafel. The chicken smelled absolutely delicious but it was soooo tough and dry. The falafel taste like it was fried in the same grease Chinese food is cooked in. If you've ever had fried chicken wings from a Chinese spot then you know the taste. 

I also noticed that not one single solitary person was in there besides me. Before there was always at least 2 other people dining or ordering. This time, no one. Most importantly, they're now selling Korean chicken and veggie bowls. I took a few bites of everything and was preparing the leave. The lady behind the counter asked if I needed a box and bag to go. I declined and asked if they have new owners. She said yes! I'm thinking possible in the future it won't be Greek Pita anymore. *Sad Face*"
2,"So I can only review the food that I ordered online. I haven't been to the place itself. 
After ordering, the food arrived really quickly. I think 30 minutes max. I ordered the Tapoki and for $9 I really did expect more. It was merely a handful of rice cakes and the fish cakes were under cooked and really chewy. I also ordered the beef bento box that came with fried rice and dumplings and let me tell you, this was not something I would order again. First, everything was leaking and sauce ran all over my carpet. Second, the dumplings were soaked and not fresh at all. The beef itself was quite oily as well. Not sure if the place itself is any better than the ordered food, but I don't feel like I'll be answering this question any time soon. I am sure there are much better Korean places around Pittsburgh."
2,"Since I moved last year, I needed a new vet and my friend recommended this clinic and as soon as I saw Dr. Debbie White was a vet here I got excited considering I loved her book about Pugs (How to be your Pugs Best Friend) I found on Amazon earlier last year!

I'm a crazy pug mom and love them like my children and as I've been taking veterinary medicine classes I always go crazy and ask a billion questions to be sure I'm always on the right track. At first Dr.White would keep a smile on her face and answered my questions even the repetitive or silly ones. But then in January she started pushing on me to test Luna for Ear Mites which the estimate provided was about $150? Now I love my dogs but I'm not rich so $150 is not easy spending money and I don't have credit cards I can just let $150 hang out with interest on. She let it slide and gave me a $20 ear flush to try out and when I returned in February she ONCE AGAIN pushed the $150 ear mites test on me. Now I know Luna's ears have a lot of wax in them but I had a feeling in my gut that ear mites was not at all the problem. So I took Luna to another vet for a second opinion and sure enough I was right, she just has bad pug ear wax and all she needs is daily ear cleaning! What a waste of $30 exam fees!!

They do give out complimentary Pet ID cards that have the renew dates for your pet's vaccinations which is helpful for people who can't remember like myself but honestly, this clinic is not the best in town. If you live close by and you need a vet, go see Dr.White but beware that she'll probably try and sell you the wrong diagnosis and be real fake with you about it to talk you into it. I'm lucky I caught onto her behavior! Also, don't bother using the Free Exam coupon on their website, my printer was broken so I showed it to them off my mobile phone explaining that my printer was broken but that is why I came in and they said ""sorry we need a paper version"" even though I called them on the phone an hour before my appointment and she said showing it off my phone would SAVE paper and it would be fine! So don't expect great customer service from the front desk while you're there."
2,"The food was excellent the one reason I give it a 2 star is because of the real bad swage smell in the restaurant. I was there this afternoon with 5 of my family members and all of us got stomach pain because of the smell. The smell came out when we were half way eating our food! 
The other reason is because we had to wait so long for the tea to arrive after we finished eating and had asked for it..
The waiter could have brought the teas while we were waiting for the take out we ordered for a family member who couldn't eat with us in the resturant. Instead, the waiter brought the take out and brought the teas after!
Also, I called after we got home just to let them know how my mom got sick badly of the smell and how she through up after we got home but, the person who answered the phone didn't understand what I was saying and transfered me to another person who was not listening what I'm tell her and kept asking me if I wanted to make a reservation over and over again!

Don't think we will go back again 
Very disappointed!"
2,"What happened to this location? Been ordering coffee from here since 2005 off and on and ever since their recent renovation the coffee hasn't tasted the same. Taste old, taste burnt, and the iced coffee's are watery. Maybe someone there will read this and let mgmt know. Still will visit other locations."
2,"First off, the staff here is EXCELLENT! They were extremely friendly when I called concerned about my dog, who I rescued from the NSPCA. I already had a less than positive experience from another animal hospital in Henderson weeks prior. They tried to upsell me and tell me all the problems my dog had without even properly examining him. I was warned by the NSPCA about vets like this, so I decided to go to Lone Mountain Animal Hospital as a friend had referred me. 
Upon arrival, the staff was just as friendly as they were on the phone. They got my dog all set up in their system, and we patiently waited for the doctor. This is where the problems began. Dr. Starks was horribly rude and condescending. He walked in and looked as if he was annoyed he had to take a 6:30pm appointment. He cut me off every single time I tried to speak, and corrected me and made me feel as if I was stupid. When explaining the situation to him, the only thing he heard was that I had recently adopted my dog. He immediately started to imply that my dog had certain illnesses from the shelter, such as kennel cough. This was exactly what the NSPCA warned me about, I thought. I advised him that I had already seen another vet and he was fine, but to focus on the issue at hand. He began to tell me that my dog probably had some sort of infection and that he would need to take him in the back. I told him that I needed to know how much any procedures would be, and he immediately got defensive and said that ""we will obviously give you an estimate,"" rolled his eyes, and took my dog in the back. 
Literally two minutes later, a staff member walked in with a printed paper of all the recommended procedures, prescriptions, and prices upwards of almost $400. I, as a diligent and smart individual, started to question every charge. If I'm going to pay for something, I'd like to know what I'm getting. Isn't that pretty standard? Well, not here. She started getting annoyed because I asked questions. The staff member insinuated that it was because I couldn't afford the procedures, which was not the case. I only wanted to know that if there was anything else I could do, such as home remedies or over the counter medicines, that I would rather do that. Instead, I felt bullied into paying them the high prices. When she couldn't take it anymore, she told me that she would get the doctor, and left. A few minutes later, I heard the doctor talking about me outside of the door, and then he literally barged in, rolled his eyes once again, and said ""So you had questions?"" His attitude was far beyond professional, and I had had enough. I told him of course I had questions as people should, and that I didn't understand how he could take my dog in the back and less than two minutes later have a printed paper with estimates. I didn't realize infections were diagnosed so quickly. It would have taken at least two minutes to type and print out that paper. Did you even have time to examine him? The more questions I asked, the angrier and shorter with me he got. He never once closed the door and argued with me in the doorway. He finally said, ""Well what do you want to do?"" I then told him I wanted a few minutes so I could text and ask someone who knew something about dogs. He, as you can imagine, rolled his eyes and stormed off. 
A few minutes later an amazing staff member from the front came in to check on me. I told her my concerns, and she walked me through every single item on the estimate list. That is all I wanted; to feel comfortable paying that amount because I knew exactly what I was getting. She was one of the nicest people, and genuinely cared about me and my pet. Isn't this why people decided to become vets? Because they love animals?
Like I mentioned in the beginning, the staff here was AMAZING! And from what I was told, Dr. Calloway is great. Next time, I will request her specifically. But I will never, and I mean never go back to Dr. Starks. He is a horrible human being that does not deserve to help animals or people. He clearly does not care about anyone or anything but himself. He is rude and condescending, and does not deserve my business. As we all know, pets are family, and I will NEVER let my family come into contact with Dr. Starks' horrid elitist attitude and energy.
*I would also like to point out that my dog left bleeding even though I was advised they would not being doing anything invasive, and the affected area has now gotten worse. If this continues, I may consider taking this matter even further than Yelp."
2,"Service was very slow, took 15 min to put drink order in, apps took half an hour and the halloumi was not cooked properly. The waiter was nice, but not attentive. Mains weren't much better - pasta was under cooked fries were under fried. My friends main came out 10 minutes after mine did. I left without anybody saying goodbye or thank you. 
Definitely never going back."
2,"I stopped in with a couple of goals in mind. I ended up there for 2 hours with misinformation and was unable to accomplish half of what I wanted to. Any question that I had about lease pricing or models required a 15+ minute trip to the managers office. Multiple times I called Camelback Mazda while waiting and had the answer 10 minutes before my salesman returned from the managers office. If you don't have the information, that's fine, let me talk to the person that does or just take down my info and find out on your time. I was one of two people on the lot in two hours. If the manager had the answers I should have been talking to him. I am not a fan of wasting time or playing games.

I think that I prefer to do my shopping online or with a company like Toyota where information is accessible and shared. I can then use that information to make an informed decision after detailed comparison. No games or disrespect.

My salesman seemed fairly nice and personable but was either not competent and a hindrance to the process or playing stupid games. Either way,  that doesn't work for me."
2,"First, the Good:
1. Good food
2. good decor

Now, the Bad:
1. bad/rude service; no ""please"" or ""thank you"" EVER....to the cashier girl, if you don't like working there, get another job....
2. Ordering process is too slow with hordes of people hanging around the cash register waiting for their food making it difficult just to order and pay for food....this despite the place not being busy. Even though no one was ordering food, we had to wait 5 minutes before the cashier took our order....there is no way I would eat here if it was even remotely busy.
3. sometimes your meal comes with bread and sometimes it does not....no consistency. When we asked for our bread, the cashier simply grab the bread with her bare hands after handling money all afternoon...this is disgusting.

I only have patience to eat here about once a month given the issues noted above. Some of my office colleagues will not go there because of these issues."
2,Blow out was good. I was very surprised that I was charged another $10 for my hair to be curled with a curling iron...this was in additional to the $35 for a blowout. Are you kidding me? I have been going to this location on several occassions and this is the first time I was charged the additional $10. Don't think I will be going back....Dry Bar here I come...it is all inclusive of curling iron and blow dry.
2,"pretty bland for schwarma, the rice had no flavor either, I was surprised to see asian on the menu, not something I would think would fuse well as cuisines go. very friendly staff and the place was clean, I just didn't blow my hair back."
2,"Came here on a Monday lunch and this place was packed! Waited around 10 mins for a table.

Special beef pho noodles - Beef is very high quality, unlike other vietnamese restaurants. However, the broth has a lot of msg. The noodle portion is around average. 

Satay beef pho noodles - This tastes just like curry on top of the noodles, nothing special. The type of noodles used in this is the thicker rice noodles. More noodles than the one above. 

Pad thai - This should be called tomato fried pho noodles. Much like the one at congee queen, but sweeter. The ingredients used are descent quality, but authentic pad thai should not be cooked with tomato sauce. 

Overall 2/5 stars. Quality is good, but the taste is not the best. Not very authentic vietnamese food."
2,"I enjoy getting blow outs especially at a discount with groupons. I have gone to many different places to get a blow out done and this location is by far the most disappointing. Each time I try it I'm reminded why it's not my favorite place. 
Staff- typically running late with no acknowledgement to the customer. Last time I sat for 30 minutes before someone started my shampoo. Then I sat with conditioner on for an extended time to wait for the stylist.
Make up- I asked for a natural, light look and came out like a clown in comparison. Bright coral lipstick and heavy eyes was not my idea of natural. The stylist was more concerned about using the new colors that just came in then my request.

Quality seems decent but never holds up a long time after like other places. Probably because of lack of hot tools without additional cost and rushing thru drying my hair.

Overall it's not my favorite blow dry bar but if you are patient, have extra time, and not too picky it's worth the discounted price of a groupon offer."
2,"Came here for brunch on my birthday weekend, and the experience was mediocre. I have been really excited about coming to this restaurant as there has been alot of buzz about it.

I have to say the view was stunning and the patio was beautiful. 

The food was quite plain and flavourless. They served the meal with a side of franks red hot sauce and ketchup. We ended up drenching our food with the franks hot sauce.  It reminded me when you go to an all inclusive in Cuba and have to drown your food in hot sauce in order for it to be edible. Our group ordered the kost burger, baked eggs, and eggs benedict. I had to pour the Frank's hot sauce all over my meal in order to have any flavour.

If I would ever come back here, it would be for the view and to have a drink (extremely overpriced) on the rooftop.


Our server was quite abrupt and unfriendly. We were a large party of nine, and I can understand its can be challenging but the service was not up to par. When the first four of us sat down, we ordered a margarita pitcher. She brought it out to us, and the rest of our party replied. Once she said that a few of us had moved in the booth to accommodate the other guests that arrived, she said ""you guys, now that your all here dont move spots as I'm ordering for your seat"". I've worked as a server for three years, and I know what to say and not to say. Clearly these servers need to be retrained, your working in a restaurant downtown Toronto, you'll have to learn how to deal with stress and parties. Very unprofessional"
2,"The bubble tea was excellent! The service however, was not. I found it pushy, rushed, abrasive, and incredibly rude. Their way of dealing with English speaking customers is to bark at them until they leave with their order. 
You certainly won't be receiving any of my money ever again."
2,"In general, I think the stylist are good at what they do. I have been a little put off by the management-- not terribly friendly and unprofessional. I scheduled an appointment with a stylist and the stylist left without my knowledge. So when I showed up for my appointment, I thought I was going to get the stylist I requested. No one bothered to call and tell me that my requested stylist was no longer there. If I purposely make an appointment weeks in advance because I like the way someone does my hair, I expect to be notified if they can not follow through on their end of the deal. The lady was unapologetic and rude. The stylist did a great job and not her fault but I still would have liked the heads up before my appointment so I could cancel if I wanted (which is why I think they were shady and dishonest about notifying me). I won't be back."
2,"food is good, service is crappy, and the parking is horrible at the green tree location, wont return their again"
2,I love Starbucks but this one I try to avoid because they are always so busy. Drive threw I usually wait 15-20 minutes .
2,"Food quality is good. Nice juicy kebabs and flavorful rice!
But bit pricey considering it isn't a full service restaurant. It is a self service place, with options for take-away or dine-in. Meal for two costs anywhere above $32. I don't like the fact that not even water is served. 
Service quality is extremely slow. An order takes around 20 to 30 minutes to be served. (when the restaurant is almost empty and it wasn't in the rush hours)"
2,"Came here on a Friday night. This place seems pretty busy but turn over rate is quite high which is good since we only waited 10 mins for a table for 3.

The menu is considered limited, as the there's only one side of the menu and there's only a few selection in each category. 

We ordered a small spicy house pho, and 2 large house pho. Within minutes of placing our order, food came. It was the quickest pho place I have ever been to! Either because the restaurant wasn't super busy at that time (7:15pm, Friday night) or everything is premade accelerating service speed.

They gave us a small dish of bean sprouts, limes and bayleaf. You can always ask for more if you want and we did since one small dish isn't quite enough to share between 3 people. 

The sizing of the noodles were quite weird, we ordered 2 larges, but one came in a large bowl and one came in a smaller bowl, making us feel like one was a small and the other a large. The amount of food which were in both bowls looked the same, I guess maybe they ran out of the same size of bowls!?

The spicy house pho had and tasted exactly the same as the house pho just with some red, hot chilli oil in it, nothing too amazing about it.

Service was average, basically minimal and didn't pay much attention to not only our table but other tables in general. If you needed something, you basically raise your hand or attention.

The soup tasted good, but I figured out why very shortly after drinking almost half the bowl. It was FULL of MSG!! For the remaining of the night, all 3 of us felt SOOOO thirsty! I kept drinking water until my stomach wanted to explode and yet I still feel thirsty! I can't imagine how much MSG they put into that soup!!

MSG is a HUGE TURNOFF for me in foods! If you don't have the ability to make good food without adding so much crap and junk into it, then please don't trick all customers and making their body suffer!

Pricing I would consider to be average, around $8 - $9 for a small and $1 or $2 for large. 

But I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends/family and WOULDN'T be a choice to come back!"
2,"Poor service inside. No creamer on the bar,and they were put  out to provide a good customer experience. No greeting when entering the store, or waiting in line. Store is not very clean."
2,"I've been coming to Osaka for years, and I'm sad to say that this last visit will probably be my last visit. The service was fast and friendly, but the food, which is the main reason for going to a restaurant, was really pretty poor.

I got a seaweed salad, which just didn't taste right, even though I've had them at Osaka before and thought they tasted great in the past. V2 Sushi orders, a California roll and a salmon roll, we're fine. But the two plates of chicken teriyaki tasted like something I would get at a public school cafeteria. The chicken was overcooked, the vegetables were overcooked, and not fresh cut, for example the carrots obviously came out of a large can of cut cooked carrots, and tasted like those hard things I remember from school days. Unfortunately that flavor infected the rest of the vegetables so the whole meal really tasted pretty bad.

I would give it a one-star, but like I said the service was excellent and our waitress very friendly and accommodating. And the sushi was okay."
2,"I called Chapman Mazda on a Saturday afternoon to see if they had a service or advice to wash the undersbody of my Mazda Miata. I recently bought the car from another dealership and was told by my mechanic that the underbody was caked with old oil so I wanted to get it cleaned so I could watch for any oil leaks.

The first time I called I dialed the operator's extension. When I told her what I was looking for she just asked ""what?"" When I started to give her a more detailed explanation of what I was looking for, she cut me off mid-sentence and transferred me to someone's voicemail box without telling me who it was or if/how they could help me. I didn't leave a message and called the operator's extension back thinking it was maybe a mistake. The operator picked up again and said i needed to call service. I called the service department and it rang over and over again with no option for a voicemail. I decided to say ""screw it"" and try to find a service on my own.

After some digging I was able to find a location in Phoenix that offered an engine cleaning/underbody detail wash service which has been a major help. I love the Miata and will probably want to buy another one (or more) in the future, but probably not from Chapman. I can't totally rule them out because I haven't been in to the dealership, but the treatment I got over the phone for a simple question was enough to steer me away."
2,"Uniquely large slices which is pretty neat. However, wasn't impressed with the quality. Felt like mall pizza. They threw an already cooked slice back in the oven for a few minutes and served it. Not exciting. I'll give it another shot before writing them off completely, and update if we have a better experience."
2,"There are other services at the same price that offer a much better product. Today was the second time my daughter has come out with a poorly done hair style. Her hair is pretty straight and easy to work with, yet a blow dry and two braids didn't hold for even 45 minutes. Now she is re-doing her hair for the homecoming dance. Could have been the stylist but since it has happened twice I fettle review was justified."
2,"Only two stars because of Dr. Starks.  I have been going to this Aminal Hospital since 2009, everyone HAS BEEN AMAZING except Dr. Starks, basically told me if my cat was a dog, he would crate her or the alternative.  She is 11 years old, has been on joint vitamins for 4 years, I took her in for a rabies shot, I asked about her arthritis and they had to give her 2 shots of something then knock her out for X-rays.  My cat has been vet scared since a kitten, and I give her the (cat Xanax) they gave me, before I take her in.  My cat is the loud one, and I even transferred her vet records from her previous vet.  I will continue to take her there as most of the vets and all of the staff are awesome.  We are returning 6/28, to see Dr. Shoppa, have seen her before, awesome! Two stars only because of Dr. Starks.
My old roommate had been taking her dogs there for almost 20 years, they are awesome!
All so this happened about 9 months ago.  Hoping for a better outcome this time. Love love the staff and other vets my cat has seen!"
2,"Now let me begin with saying I probably spend about $100 a month on Starbucks coffee and am a frequent visitor to many around town.  This location used to have my favorite Barista but he has long gone to another location.  I do visit this one periodically, and can say that I have encountered some cool young energetic people.  Tonight though was extremely to long of a wait and the chick behind the counter was to busy complaining about having to remake a drink from a customer that had come in from Drive thru.  I believe that is one of Starbucks philosophies is to ensure that you are satisfied..believe me when my coffee is not on point, it will be on point when Starbucks has been made aware.  There wasn't one time that any one of these characters came over and asked what I was waiting on...I suppose the level of customer service is not the priority here.  I'm going to go back in a short while and check them out.  Let me know what your experience is."
2,Last time they gave me less meat on my sandwich so you're lucky to get 2stars bc I like to eat.. Be NICE to touristy yelpers!  Just go to Toronto Banh Mi Boys for the real good stuff..I'm going there next (very meaty).
2,"Food is generally good breakfast food. Service runs very hot and cold. Hostess is not effective. Dull normal. If their service improved, would be a great breakfast place."
2,"Waited 20 minutes and the slim waitress was rude when asked about our order.

Drive for another 5 mins north and you'll arrive at Bamiyan."
2,"My order was completely wrong. For the second time in one week. Long waits in the drive thru even though there were only 2 cars ahead of me. Today I ordered a caramel flan frap, no coffee, with coconut milk. My kid was screaming since it was a long wait so I hadn't noticed it was wrong until I drove away. I got a tiramisu frap with milk. I was not pleased. Thanks for making my day just that much worse when I was trying to make it better by treating myself. Totally annoyed."
2,"The first time my daughter and I tried out this blow dry bar was with Groupon vouchers earlier in July. We had such a great experience that I decided to make it my regular place. Bri did such a wonderful job with my 5 yr olds hair. We had a special occasion today and I decided to take my daughter in to get the same styling done. Before we left on the first visit, I made sure to ask Bri what service to ask for next time we came. She told me the pre-teen blow dry and hot tool service is what i should get for my daughter. The two total to $35.
I asked for exactly that when I made the appointment today but got a surprise when it was time to pay. I was charged for a Primp and press which is $55. I asked why she didn't charge me for what I had asked for and as is listed on their price list. Response I got was ""because it's ethnic hair, we had to charge the $55"". Didn't argue, just paid the bill and left. 
I wish salons could be more consistent with what they communicate to their customers. How can one stylist recommended a service at a certain price and another one gives you a completely different price. 
I really liked the place and they do such a great job. Unfortunately we won't be going back there anytime soon."
2,"We've been to this restaurant over 3 dozen times in the past 3 years.  The last experience concerns me as this is my favourite AYCE sushi house.  We filled out the order form asking for 4 orders of salmon sashimi (3 pieces per order), 3 tuna sashimi (3 pieces per order) , 4 orders of tataki beef and several other items.  We received 2 orders of salmon sashimi, no tuna sashimi, 2 orders of beef tataki and the rest of what we order.  
The slices were much thinner than what we have always had at this restaurant, I can say about half the thickness.  The quality was still very good.
Same thing happened on our second order as well, skimping on quantity and quality.
When I brought this issue to our waitress, it was a ""what do you want me to do about it"" look
Place is always busy.
I hope this was just a one off, will give them one more try"
2,"Not very impressed.  I had been before it the food was fairly decent but when I went last Sunday, the other I got was no where near what I ordered and all I could taste was cinnamon.  I ordered the beef Shawarma  but got some chicken thing and some dried out gyro meat that tasted more like cinnamon toast than meat.  And for this we waited well over 20 minutes with no one at the counter ahead of us.  The girl spoke so softly you could barely hear a word she was saying and clearly, the last thing on her mind that day was working.

Bad service and a meal I threw out after one bite.  Should really be a one star but the rice didn't taste bad after I heated it up (it came stone cold)."
2,"Just paid $9 for chicken shawarma plate. Came with a salad where the lettuce was not cut into pieces less than 5"" long. It was not served with any dressing. Chicken was dry. Said the plate came with tzatziki sauce, but none came with. Portion was very small for a $9 plate. Kids high chairs all were filthy. I usually review places when I really enjoy something and hate to be so negative, but almost $40 for 2 adults and 2 kids was WAY overpriced for the quality received."
2,"My engine light came on an my local Fletchers could not fix it.  I decided to head to the dealer.  They did get it to shut off....and found an additional $2,000 in repair work.  About  2 days later the light came back on....frustrating.  They got me in again quickly but it took about 2 hours for them to figure out the problem.  I would not usually mind but I did tell them I had things to do and to please keep me posted on the progress.  I did not hear from anyone for about 90 min when I went out to check on their progress....no word but they would check.  About 30 min later I was told it was done.  My CX9 now runs great but I would have liked a bit more communication on the progress"
2,"I find this place to be the snob of the AYCE Japanese places. Its only available in the evening, prices aren't that great because it is evening (20+), not a lot of room, staff is so so, and its hard to get a spot. It makes me feel like it becomes a privilege to get a table here. The food isn't bad but it's not the best considering all the hassle I have to go through. Also, the ice cream seems complementary. It's not like you can order all the ice cream you can eat.

On the good side, this place has the best beef teriyaki hands down out of all AYCEs I've tried. Sadly, it's not enough to make me a regular customer considering the vast array of options in the GTA."
2,"Osaka used to be one of our favorite places to get sushi but I've have to say that the place has gone downhill as of late. The rag used to clean the tables was sour. Needless to say, that smell doesn't go well with sushi. When I noticed the low sanitation grade, we almost left. I spotted the waiter coming with our apps. so we stayed but will prob. not be back. Too bad."
2,"I always go here for lunch and usually get the chicken shawarma wrap. I honestly am so annoyed of their inconsistency. Sometimes the wrap itself is so hard to chew because it's hard or sometimes it's too soft and undercooked. There's only a few times it's been perfect and my coworker said the exact same thing.

There's a few pics of different times you'll be able to see the difference. They even put in the end of an onion. Today there was no onion or pickles, so confused! 

#annoyed"
2,I don't know if you need to eat this right in the shop but we ordered from Postmates and it was bad.  Just very bland all around.  Would not recommend.  Must have high ratings from the drunkards eating late night.
2,"I sure don't like giving not so great reviews.  The visit was a good as far and being my first time visit for a colonic in the sense of...to see what happens and how to improve your health was great. The lobby was warm and inviting.  The facility was clean.  It was a bit cold inside during my visit. The gravity system was an open gravity system. 

The very very veeeeerrrrry disappointing part was, the person who worked with me didn't ask me hardly any questions.  Questions like...what do you know about colonic therapy?  What's is your main purpose for coming (yes I know it's on the questionnaire when you check in but if your not asked and or the survey isn't followed up in the one on one session, what's the point of the questionnaire.?)  What's your health goals?  Based on what I see or you've expressed to me, I would recommend such and such...and this is why.  Do you have any questions for me?  After the procedure, there were two products left on the counter with an almost like exit questionnaire.  The person working with me didn't tell me she was leaving anything, no suggestions nor did she come and explain why she left what she left at the counter.  Being my first time, I wasn't told  after procedure things I can or cannot do.  What to eat or not eat.  I felt like a movie that was going so good and fell off at the end with no conclusion or understanding of what just happened. 

I'm not saying I won't go back but I sure in the heck need to be educated.  My tummy is upset and not sure why. Because I wasn't given any after care instructions, I ate soup  for lunch and a salad  for dinner.  So hungry. No matter what you pay for the service, I feel that I didn't get what I paid for.   I don't know if it was an ethnicity issue or something else.  Maybe she didn't know what to do for the customer.  I couldn't tell you!  Either way, the procedure was great but the knowledge and customer service was lacking tremendously.  I bought a product bud I'd not leave a tip because I shouldn't of had to ask the questions, I should have been informed by my nurse, consultant or what ever you want to call her.  I hope this changes and my next few visits are nothing like this was. Bad first impression...

#disappointedandmytummyhurts"
2,"While pondering through my day, stomach rumbling from an only smoothie breakfast, I decided to get something light.
I entering through the big wooden doors to be surprised, but nothing jumped out of me as being great.
I ordered my food and within 5 minutes my Salmon Roll appeared.  As I sat in my car,  stomach rejoicing over what was about to happen, but nothing.
Nothing was great or normal about this meal.  My taste buds curled from disappoint as my stomach did not even give me a comfort feeling.  The ginger was not good, the seaweed was not fresh and the size of the rolls were small.
So I folded my container, gave a formal apology to my stomach, tongue and promised my heart never to return."
2,"I have been to other Poke restaurant many many times. So when I found out this new place I definitely want to check it out.  

I went here first time and the food was pretty good, it is comparable to the other Poke places that have been popping up in the valley. The restaurant is clean and organize. It was not busy on a Sunday noon. I ordered a regular bowl with mixed greens and my usual salmon and tuna and added avocado. They gave me so little green salad. I was disappointed and was still hungry after I finished it. This would never happen to me at the other places. I am not a big eater and normally the regular bowl filled me up!

My 2 stars was based on the quantity of my food and experience I received and not over quality."
2,"Some people like mediocracy, and then there is the rest of the world.  

YES, you can discharge weapons in a designated direction at this facility, that alone is worth 5 stars, assuming the range officers were not sarcastic and condescending, and assuming you could use the rest of the range without being part of some club or group.  Safety is important and risk will never be eliminated but this place takes the cake in reference to simply tuning people off with their delivery.  If you are a child, this is the place for you.  If you are sighting in rifle, this place is satisfactory, but if you want to see what a real outdoor range look like go to Butterfield Shooting Facility outside of Las Cruces New Mexico.  

Over time I go to this place I remember why I rarely do it.  What people do not realize about talking down to groups of people based on the actions of a few is that the groups of people rotate constantly therefore sending mixed messages to those who have just arrived.  

Anyway, triggers can be pulled here...  But paper is the only thing you can shoot, and long distance or anything else that is common among shooters for the last 100 years is not allowed.  If National Healthcare, bar food, or dial-up internet was a shooting range...  It would be this place.  If postal workers and/or overzelous rookie cops worked the range 1 or 2 days out of the week and wanted you to know how enthusiastic they aren't or how intense they can get, respectively....  It would be this place.  If TopGolf's facility director ran a shooting facility.... Maybe she does... :-/"
2,"Gorgeous Reno of a former gym. Food took an hour to arrive. Rude front staff, food mediocre, one way exit. Stick to BAmiyan!"
2,"One of those cases where I got sucked in by just quickly searching for a bahn mi place and only looked at the *stars*. If I'd read more, I'd have found the other two star reviews which mirror my own confusion about why this place is considered good. 

Just going by the bahn mi, I'm never coming here again. It's missing all the key ingredients of a good bahn mi. The bread is too large and there's no crispy crust. There isn't enough pickled veggies to add the refreshing crunch. Not that adding more would have helped, they were soft, rather tasteless, and sad. Barely any cilantro either. I'm completely bewildered by how the actual product was so bad considering how many fellow Yelpers seem to like this place. 

The only plus is it was pretty cheap. And they sell many other food options like packaged rice/stirfry or sushi meals. Although given the quality of the bahn mi...consume at your own discretion."
2,"Found by accident in sketchy neighborhood. Nice family run place, friendly, 0 atmosphere. $18.95 for chicken Bulgogi was outrageous! :("
2,"There are much better spots for Turkish food in the GTA, especially for Pide. When you are paying $40-$50 per person for basic items that you could probably just make at home, you expect a lot better. It feels like you are paying for the decor and ambiance than the actual food itself. 

The Kunife dessert is great, but once again pricey and very small in portion."
2,"Most Starbucks personnel are friendly, don't expect that as compared to other Starbucks in the area here. They barely make eye contact, or tell u when mobile orders are ready. I can't tell you how many times somebody has ""accidentally taken my or someone else's order"". Actually it was never made. It's just the closest and the coffee bar at work is closed for the moment. Otherwise, coming to this one wouldn't be an option."
2,"It was really a bad experience. There was only one waiter and she even forgot to give us the plates, and we asked twice! Even the dishes did not taste well."
2,"I think the winning part about this place is convenience.  
It's not that good.  It's not terrible, but it definitely comes around 2.5/3 stars for tastiness in the BahnMi department.

This place definitely benefits from its location.

They also make it exceptionally easy to order by number if your french is so so."
2,"Disappointed with some of this restaurants policies. Inquired about a weekday lunch reservation for ~10 and was told they had a minimum per person of $55 all the way up to $85. For a place that has a regular lunch menu of roughly $14-$22, this really seems like a ridiculous cash grab. What is the actual reason you would have to charge double the price for a larger group? It's almost as if they're trying to penalize you for wanting to bring them more business... Anyway, my group of colleagues is only going to keep growing and sadly it looks like I won't be able to bring them here anytime soon for our monthly socials. Sad, because they do have that nice skyline view."
2,Pretty bummed. I liked this place. My hair isn't as great as before but my issue lies in the check out. Had a groupon that expired.i knew this didn't expect the deal. But on it I read price you paid doesn't. She made me feel I commited a crime getting what I paid. Said they don't do that! But it says right on it! I even read it again when I got home! Hate feeling wrong
2,"I used to love Osaka.. went there 4 times a week! But unfortunately they have gone down hill. I am not sure it it's new management or new cooks but the quality and the ESPECIALLY the presentation of the food has gotten terrible. I love spicy tuna rolls and I believe they have the best. The last 3 times I went I was presented with spicy tuna rolls that were not even rolled ! The tuna was falling out everywhere, did not look appetizing or appealing. Also a huge fan of the yaki udon noodles, but those as well were undercooked and the veggies were still hard not soft. Staff is nice & friendly but I just can't come back. Please go back to the Osaka I used to know and love!"
2,"Decent service and environment, horrible cook. Omelette was atrociously overcooked and would not have been served by anyone who knows what one is supposed to look like. Bacon was also ridiculously overcooked and resembled beef jerky more than anything in consistency and color. Previous experiences here were great, but this one was pathetic. Overall, a massive disappointment."
2,"I had breakfast there 6/18 /14.  I had a omelet which was very dry and undercooked. The service was poor. My waitress was giving me my check before my food ever came. I asked for extra butter when i did get my meal and waitress never brought it. The environment 
Is nice but food and service was below par. Very overrated."
2,"Great range and setup, but the employees were very rude and disrespectful, 40 minute wait when we left and there we 7 open tables, place is a joke"
2,the retsuarant is very fancy and coulerful and has a great feeling to it but the food and prices on the otherhand were not so great and expensive for normal food
2,Ok. I am Korean and this place is some disrespectful portions and overpriced. Just bought the galbi which is expensive in general but I literally got no meat for $33. Picture shown. Soondobo jiggae was ok doe. Seriously overpriced.
2,"I went a few months back and although I only went once, there is no way I'm going back. The decor was alright, very Turkish. I'm being generous with the two stars that I gave. First off, it was freezing inside the restaurant so that did't help with the experience. We got our food which was overpriced considering quality and the quantity. My friend ordered something and it came to her completely cold, so she asked if they would heat it up and the waitress was hesitant and seemed a bit irritated. My other friend got one of their ""popular dishes"" and was nothing to be impressed by. Overall, the food was below average and pricey."
2,"Brunched on a Saturday.  Service was slow, inattentive.  30% of the tables around us were food/lifestyle bloggers with cameras out.  A great view and beautifully designed restaurant but they definitely need to get their service in order."
2,"I stopped by Korea Garden with some friends last night, since they were looking for a restaurant in Oakland, and none of us had tried this one before.  Unfortunately, I doubt any of us will return after our experience last night, as there are many better places to eat at in Oakland (and that's saying something, given the mediocrity of the Oakland dining scene), and better Korean restaurants elsewhere in PGH.

Since me and one of my friends had never tried Korean BBQ before, we decided to order the pork belly version to share ($27). The waitress suggested that we get something else to ensure that there was enough food, so we ordered the chicken from the Chinese-Korean section ($16).  Finally, we ordered soju to go with our meal ($12), at the suggestion of my other friend, who's been to S. Korea.  Every one of these items, without exception, was subpar.  The pork belly, normally one of my favorite items to order, was chewy and flavorless, indicating low quality meat and overcooking.  The chicken was something straight out of an Americanized Chinese take-out place, consisting of fried and breaded pieces smothered in a thick, sweet sauce with some vegetables sprinkled in for good measure.  Some of the chicken pieces were almost completely dry, whereas others were gooey from sitting in the sauce, making for an inconsistent and undesirable texture.  The soju was sweetish and watery, despite being straight from the bottle.

The service we received was equally bad. Our waitress didn't stop by our table once after our food arrived.  Our waters remained unfilled, and the banchan that came with the KBBQ weren't replenished, which should be standard, according to my friend who visited S. Korea.  Indeed, we had to ask the person who came to bus our table for the check.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is grossly understaffed--our waitress was the only one working, except for the person bussing tables.

In the words of my friend who's visited S. Korea, we were very unimpressed with the quality of food and service we received at Korea Garden.  To add insult onto injury, the prices are quite inflated--we could have had a solid meal at the hot pot place up the street for equal or less than what I paid for this meal.  If you're in the mood for Asian food in Oakland, I strongly suggest checking out that place (Top Shabu Shabu), or one of the other Chinese restaurants nearby.  If you're in the mood for Korean, try Green Pepper in SqHill or Nakwon Garden in Shadyside.  Regardless of what you're in the mood for or how close you want to stay, I guarantee that you can find a meal with better quality, prices, and service at any number of nearby restaurants."
2,"This place had really outstanding pizza. we would pay $7 for delivery. Over th,e past six months the delivery has been really bad, pizza cold and salad dressing forgotten. Last night was my last try at it."
2,"Went with a group on nine for a Sunday birthday dinner and will definitely not return. Firstly, one of my girlfriend's appetizer was 30 minutes late. By the time it arrived, the rest of the party had already finished and were ready to order for our mains. The server tried to make a joke and it was not well received. They could've had the decency to give it to us on the house in order to redeem themselves, but sadly they did not.

With regards to the food, there was nothing exceptional, especially considering the price. I had order the peach salad (basically peaches with cream cheese), the green beans (I enjoyed this), and the lobster skewer (it was good, but the serving was tiny for $30). 

The service, sadly, was our party's least liked aspect of the experience. The wait times for our other orders, specifically the dessert, was long. In addition, after our allotted time was done, we were basically kicked out, despite the area being sparse, while also reminding us throughout our dining experience that we must leave after the certain time (they used the petty excuse that a large party was coming). 

Would not recommend, there are other restaurants with better service, better food, and a better view."
2,"Having spent seven years in Japan I found this place to be anything but authentic. The staff were courteous, but also not very attentive. The sushi was definitely not fresh and the assembly and presentation were lacking appeal. Operators should be careful when selecting restaurant names and not have the ability to live up to them. I will keep looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant with authentic and more traditional cuisine."
2,"""The tacos, another recommendation from the server, provided initial sticker shock. A whopping $45 for duck tacos and $35 for short rib barbacoa tacos. Craving some tender meat, we settled on the barbacoa tacos. A huge platter with all the fixings arrived: chimichurri, shaved red onion, baby gem lettuce and fried shallots. We opened the basket of six soft-shell tacos that were cardboard-like in texture and were the opposite of malleable. What surprised me most of all is that Kost used flour tortillas instead of the more authentic corn variety. As for the barbacoa--Heaton was asleep when they taught this technique in culinary school. The fatty, but flavourful beef was sliced into thick strips instead of tender, fall-off-the-bone shreds."""
2,"Bland service. I looked through a kitchen window and could see a staff member stuffing her face . She then exited and began helping people without even a rinse . The food was Bland. In addition to that, Small portions . How about a little fish with the rice? Nearly 40 dollars for 3 bowls, I would expect a little bit more. The salmon had no flavor . The tuna was okay.  After reading the stellar reviews and seeing the 4.5 rating on the restaurant, I was a little surprised when no one else was in there when I got there.... now, I know why. Ahi poki is probably a better alternative."
2,"First time trying this place. I have to say meat and rice are good. The salad sucks. It's just lettuce with virtually no tomatoes and like 1 sliver of an onion if that.  Worst thing about this place is the service SUCKS. 

I ordered take out and had to wait 48 mins till I got my food. The ladies at the front are lost and have no idea what is going on. 

Food is good but not worth waiting 48 mins for take out while standing. 

I will not return."
2,This location is super slow. I waited in the drive-thru for 15 mins for my drink. The waitress then handed me the incorrect drink which I had to wait another 5 mins for them to fix.
2,"When I am craving vietnamese food, I think of this restaurant...but every time I come here I am DISAPPOINTED. 

Their curry and soup bases are very flavourful and tasty (and I guess that's what keeps drawing me back to them)...but every time I come here their BEEF is IMPOSSIBLE to chew. This time was the absolute worse. None of us could even BITE into the beef. It was like chewing rubber. We ordered the pho and the curry noodles which both had beef slices in them -- NONE of the slices were consumed. It SUCKED. When we told the waitress about this, she said ""oh""...then walked away. She later came back and offered chicken but we declined -- we've become skeptical of the quality of their meats.

We also ordered their curry minced beef roti. It looked quite tasty but the roti (which was supposed to have minced beef in it) had mostly eggs and a pinch of beef. It was weird....I was expecting to dip my roti in curry but it ended up tasting/feeling like dipping scrambled egg in curry. 

I really don't want to come back here anymore (But this is not a promise). Their soups/curries are good but everything else sucks....my tastebuds feel conflicted!"
2,"I visited this restaurant a number of times when it was under old management (called Anatoli) and again yesterday under the new management (called Pasha's). 

Under the old management, the food was really good, but the service was really slow and bad. The staff didn't understand English and it was difficult for them to get the order right. Usually they forgot stuff or didn't bring it at all.

Under the new management, the staff are all the same, so English is still a problem.  The menu has been redone and all the descriptions have been removed, so now it's just Turkish names without any English meanings. Having to speak to the waiter to have him explain everything was quite an ordeal.  Unfortunately, the service is still really slow. The food is quite good - it's the same as the previous restaurant, but new management has also increased the prices and (I think) reduced the portion sizes. So you're paying $6.50 for a tiny cup of soup now. I was surprised.

If you're ok with paying a bit more and know what you want, then the food is good. I would recommend the Kanefe(?) dessert. It is very yummy.

The reason for 2 stars? While the food is good, it just isn't worth the bad service and the price."
2,"Too overpriced for less than average food. Waiting time for food is too long. The view is nice, but that's all."
2,"Okay for when you're craving Korean food, and don't want to cook at home. 

The restaurant is nice sized, plenty of space to sit and eat. It's not overly decorated with gawdy trinkets, well lit, and more typical of family run places.

 If it's your first time looking for Korea Garden it's easy to miss, since you have to navigate the maze of one way narrow streets of Oakland, and be careful where you park, since you can block someone's driveway without even realizing it. It's like the street, some sidewalk, and driveway are all one block of asphalt with no clear markings.

The service is pleasant, and attentive, not smothering. They say a place can be judged by it's panchan offering, but being in Pittsburgh, I'd say the offerings are decent, and they refilled on request. The bulgogi is usually a safe way to get a feel of the place, and it was okay, nothing spectacular, I really miss the open fire cooked bulgogi you can get in larger cities with a larger Korean population. I also had the chajangmyun, noodles with black bean sauce, and while it took care of my craving, it was no where near what I've had in Dallas, L.A., or northern VA. Pricing is reasonable, considering making Korean food at home is time consuming. I do prefer Korea Garden over Sushi Kim, going on taste alone."
2,"To all gluten free people......
There is GLUTEN IN THEIR MAPLE SYRUP. They make it themselves by ""cutting"" it with a gluten mixture before pouring in containers. 
There is GLUTEN IN THEIR SAUSAGE. They make it themselves and add flour to it so it doesn't burn when cooked. 

We came the first time and we told the waitress that my young boys have issues with gluten. 
She told us nothing we ordered had gluten (eggs, sausage, gf pancakes, syrup butter) 

Fast forward (TMI) to my sons having blood in their  poop after being impacted for daaaaaaays. 

Came back a second time and the new waitress clarified that all of above (that my boys consumed) had gluten except the butter and eggs and butter. 

So beware at this restaurant if gluten free. Aside from that the food is amazing and the food portion is huge. Avoid on Sunday's bc this place is Jam packed with a relatively small parking lot."
2,"70% of the times I go, an employee there will be a total a**hole. Great facility, but wish customer service and friendliness was better. I would rather drive farther to shoot elsewhere !"
2,My first and last time here. I didn't like the taste of the salad dressing or the Tzatziki. The chicken wasn't flavorful and I bit into one piece with gristle and a bone.
2,"Great decor, food not so great. It's defiantly not a Mexican place as advertised. It's a Californian tapas style. I got the tofu and it was burnt at the bottom, and the fries were the small crispy over dried bits at the end. The staff and service was prompt and the view is amazing. Just go for the drinks once the patio opens up? Just a thought."
2,"Sushi here is ok - not the freshest, but not bad either.  You get a lot of food for your money.  The Hibachi leaves much to be desired - I've never had shrimp sauce that tastes like pure mayo!  Service here sucks - my husband is severely allergic to shellfish and the waitress and the sushi chef refused to remake his food after putting it on the same plate with crab.  Won't be coming back here ever again!"
2,"The good: prompt, courteous and friendly service.
The bad: the rolls were bulked up with double layer of rice - designed to fill you up quickly / cheaply (oldest trick in the book for an AYCE place)
The ugly: the sashimi was watery, bland, borderline tasteless and did not smell fresh.
Will NOT be going back. In Mississauga stick to Heart Sushi and Sushi Sushi for AYCE."
2,"I tried this restaurants based on the positive reviews I found on their yelp page, but unfortunately I was highly disappointed and do not think that I would visit again, which is quite bad, because I had some hopes of finding my new favorites Turkish restaurant.

The interior decor of the restaurant is beautiful, its light colours and authentic tiles and millwork are very inviting, and certainly set up happy mood once you come.

Two major issues here, first one is the menu itself, being an authentic Turkish restaurant, they still miss out on so many great dishes, and kind of cutting it short with the very minimum basics of the cuisine.

And the second biggest issue is the food itself, it lacks any type of flavor, Turkish or not, and the portioning is very small, they put shop Pro Tien on top of a puffy piece of bread, so the plate looks very big and appetizing, but the portion Is half what you would expect for $16-$20 per plate, for similar cuisines.

We tried a few different items, five appetizers, three types of entrées, and one dessert and unfortunately they all failed to impress."
2,Went through the drive thru on my way to work. Grabbed coffee and breakfast a nice blueberry yogurt parfait! Imagine my surprise when I go to eat it the Enjoy by Date is 10/31! Today is 11/3!!!!! Really? You are going to get somebody sick doing stuff like this! Not to mention the frustration of losing money on something I now won't eat and can't take back as I am at work!
2,"We specifically went out of our way to buy a gift card for this restaurant to give to a friend. Their website states that gift cards are available in store and when we walked in and asked to purchase one the woman there flat out said ""No"". 

Also the location, specifically the parking lot, is not kept in very nice condition. We expected much more."
2,"Coffee was not brewed, had to wait for half and half. Disorganized. Perhaps they could use a cup of joe... I like the new juice Evolution."
2,"Guys, honestly I have been dying to eat here since I heard they have pide, but this place was an utter disappointment. The exterior of the restaurant was in shambles, but that can be excused as construction is going on and once you enter the interior - it is spacious, colourful, and welcoming.

My mother and I had come here and ordered the doner pide, the cheese pide, and the turkish ravioli called ""manti."" The doner pide had lamb and although, I'm not a huge fan of lamb, the gamey-ness was so strong that I took one bite and passed it to my mother. She couldn't even stomach it herself. The cheese pide was average - I felt the cheese they used could have been of a higher quality with a higher salt content. The cheese was rubbery and lacking in flavour. As for the manti or the turkish ravioli, let's just say that whole dish looks great on photos, but the flavour doesn't compare. Chewy ravioli with a thick yogurt smeared on top - the ravioli claims to have meat inside, but my taste buds didn't get the message. I have a feeling the ravioli is frozen and it really lacks seasoning. A sprinkle of salt really goes a long way.

For dessert, we ordered the turkish tea and kunefe, which at a whopping $9, makes you really question minimum wage standards. Both my mother and I really enjoyed the dessert - we saved a little bit of the kunefe the next day and even cold it was scrumptious.

I commend Pasha's for providing clean halal food in an alcohol-free setting and their customer service is on point. In fact, I would only return to Pasha's for their waiters & waitresses -- kind, hospitable, friendly and pleasant. We had some great chats with a few of them and it really lifted up our spirits. Pasha's is on the pricier side with not a lot of bang for the buck. I hope the quality of their food and their prices improve because I would really like to return again."
2,"I brought my bridal party to the Hayden location. The services that we received from the people that actually did our hair and makeup did a great job. My issue was with the manager who worked there. She was very unprofessional and did not listen to any of my concerns. When I made my appointments I specifically told them that I am only paying for makeup and that some of my ladies with be getting their hair done on their own and that I do not want their hair to go under my contract. Well needless to say she did not care about this and I ended up paying for the hair too, when I told the manager that I was not suppose to pay for the hair she just gave me a smug smirk and said, ""What you want me to refund you the money, and have them pay for it?"" and then she laughed like it was something ridiculous to do. One of my bridesmaids actually had walk away because she could not take how the manager was talking down to and treating me. On top of that when I went for my trial I was told that eyelashes are included ($15 value, but they are ardelle brand that you can get at walgreens for $5) but I could upgrade to the Mink Winks and just pay the difference. Well when on the day of my wedding I upgraded they charged by the full amount $35 and when I asked the manager about this charge she told me that, that is not how it is done and that there is nothing that can be done about it, really? Come on I was a manger in customer service once and every manager knows that if a customer was told something by one of your employees you need to honor it, but nope obviously this manager has no clue. She was extremely unprofessional and she is the reason that I will never return to this establishment even though my services by Briana were great I loved my makeup and hair!"
2,"I've been looking all over for decent Vietnamese food in Richmond Hill and Markham area, but been sorely disappointed with Chinese-influenced alternatives so far. I really wasn't too hopefully with Green Lemon Grass, but at the least for the price I appreciated the effort and portions. Conveniently located, there's other options in the same food plaza if so desired, which really helps it retains brownie points.

My first impression of the pho was mushy. The broth was okay, and the toppings were alright. I get that pho isn't the chewy kind of noodle and some prefer them to be quite soft, but it really didn't feel right that first bite - kind of like the bowl had been neglected for a long time before serving. By the end of it, I figured I won't be back for pho.

The curry rice looked promising, and the assorted appetizer platter with spring rolls, skewers, and other fried items was a large portion. Unfortunately the flavour palette is not diverse - if it looks like it's curry sauce, it'll be curry sauce flavored - no matter if it's your rice, a skewer, or something else. Same went for deep fried items - everything has the same spices on it. They're not bad, but you'll have to create your own diversity by ordering different items to complement each other.

So far I've been back a handful of times out of convenience - the location is really close to me and it's not the usual Chinese food but still has Chinese food prices. Décor is outdated and everything is a bit old - but you're really not here for anything fancy in terms of ambiance. Service is also short - but that's similar to many other Asian places of the same setup."
2,"We got our food to go. I was surprised when they didn't ask me how I'd like my steak cooked for my steak & shrimp hibachi. I asked for medium rare, but they turned out to be very small, thin strips of well done steak. They were cut so thinly, I don't think it would have been possible to cook them any way BUT well. Most likely a cheap cut. After I got home, I found that they forgot to put my soup and salad in the bag, so I had to go back. They were nice, but the food overall was under seasoned, and the quality of the proteins were below average. Smallish shrimp and bland, small, strips of overcooked steak. The miso soup was so-so, and the salad was pretty bare bones (iceberg lettuce with three shavings of carrot). I won't be going back."
2,"Overpriced pizza on cracker bread with an odd cheese blend and soggy meat.

I got the pepperoni slice. Its a large piece of pizza. The crust is excessively thin and crackery. There is no chew. The cheese is too cheddary and not stringy enough. The pepperoni was not crisp or flavorful. 

This place reeks of being the victim of profiteering ownership and low quality craftsmanship."
2,"I will give this location 2 stars only because I have not had a bad experience with the employees here. They are very nice and decent customer service. I am a regular at Starbucks, and usually I go to the location on Losee and Centennial inside Smiths. When I don't feel like going inside, I will come to this location but it's a mistake every time. The majority of the time I come here, I would say 8/10, my drink is wrong. I order a grande iced coffee with cream and sweetener - a very simple drink in comparison to many others. Every time there is either loads of creamer, sweetener, or just no sweetener at all. Being that this is the second time within 2 days that I have to drive back through the drive thru to have my coffee fixed, I am annoyed. This time, when I drove back around and asked the woman if I could have sweetener added, she did a long sigh and turned around to fix it. I don't know if she was frustrated with her coworkers about the mistake or me but Im not paying a ridiculous amount just to end up throwing it away because I won't drink the coffee. They fix my coffee each time with no problem, and although I do appreciate that I would prefer my coffee to be correct the first time. This location just seems to be very unorganized. Do not come to this location if you are in a rush, as the line takes ages and inside is no better. Always taste your drink before driving off, or even walking out because they have also made mistakes on my drink when I go inside. Usually I would not complain about something like this and just be relieved they fixed it, but I don't come here as a coffee lover to get a messed up overpriced drink - that could start anyone's morning off wrong!"
2,"I'll start by saying that I lived in Korea for 2.5 years and my wife is Korean, so I am a bit picky, yet knowledgeable.

Korea Garden is pricey for what it is, they know they will attract the Korean students and workers in the Oakland area no matter what.  The food is decent, but not worth the price most of the time.  It's quite salty, much like it is in a restaurant in Seoul for half the price.  The dumpling soup which is a staple of mine was very salty and didn't have much beef flavor.  The dumpling filling had a strange taste.  I've also gotten the cold buckwheat noodles, good but we can make better at home for a quarter the price (one of the cheaper dishes to make in America).  My wife usually gets the typical Korean soup, she says it's salty and just okay.

There are better Korean places in the city.  We've been here twice and won't be going a third time."
2,"Nothing crazy good. Food is kind of bland. Orange juice is great though! The crepes are better than the pancakes in my opinion. I've had the German potato pancakes, smores pancakes and a few different crepe dishes. The Dor Stop restaurant in Dormont has better pancakes."
2,"I walked in and took a look at the fish, and was so disappointed by the freshness that I did not even risk placing an order. I eat a lot of raw fish as sushi, sashimi, poki, and this was absolutely subpar. I would recommend looking elsewhere."
2,"Great spot. Beautiful view of the city. 

Stopped in for some apps and drinks before an event. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. The chips that came with the ceviche were hard and stale. The calamari I would recommend for sure. 

All of the plates and glassware is plastic. We were told this was because they have a pool but we were inside and nowhere near it. It just gave a very cheap feel to everything. The entire decor is a little too IKEA for me. 

The service was abysmal. Our server was one of those ""what do you want? Yup... yup... yup..."" as he's walking away while you're half way through your sentence. He had 3 tables but was nowhere to be found most of the time and whenever we did manage to grab him we were made to feel like we were bothering him. 

As we walked out after the experience all 3 of us looked at each other and said ""well, not coming here again"". Too bad because we had heard good things and it does have potential."
2,"Green Lemon Grass is located in Richlane Mall, where they have served the Richmond Hill neighbourhood for over a decade.  This restaurant is like a busy bee, tables always full, continuous short lineups and fast service.  In other words, table turnover rates, on average, are high.

The menu is based on comfort foods of noodles, curry, roti, rice and soups.  Do not expect fine dining here.  They built their reputation for fast convenient meals (fast food like).

BBQ Chicken & Spring Roll Vermicelli ($7.75) was a mixture of grilled chicken, fried spring rolls, topped with peanuts, carrots, cucumbers, shredded lettuce and mixed with fish sauce.  Served dry and warm, it was quite appetizing with the tangy fish sauce.  The chicken was over-grilled and very dry; rubber-like texture.  The spring roll was also over- fried, where parts of the wrapper was burnt; however, was crunchy.  But burnt food can cause cancer.

Small Rare Beef Noodle Soup ($6.75) has bean sprouts, slices of  beef and garnished with green onion and a sprig of mint leaves.  The beef was thinly sliced and lightly cooked; therefore, the texture was well maintained and easily absorbed the soup base.  It had a very standard pho soup base, therefore tasted consistent with my perception of pho.

I found both noodles were extremely salty and had too much MSG to it.  Water was being chugged down the throats for the rest of the afternoon and evening.  For the speedy service, convenience of meals, on a tight schedule, does not hurt to go.  But if you are looking for an enjoyable, savory meal, then this restaurant is not what you are looking for."
2,"I actually had a very pleasant buying experience at Chapman, and 2+ years later we are still happy with our CX-5. However, service department is another story. This is so clearly a profit center for them (which is not surprising) that they are borderline abusive about it. I get far more calls and emails than I could ever want, though it has gone down some since I've asked to be removed from the list.

The big problem is the ridiculous up-sell gauntlet that I have to run every single time I talk to anyone. I perform my own maintenance, and created a schedule with my mechanic to make sure everything would stay on track. I've explained this at least FOUR times to the same person during a SINGLE warranty service. Still, they have a checklist of ripoff maintenence schedule items I had to say no to all four times. Flush brake system and change fluid at 28k miles? With no issues reported? Seriously? There were about 10 things like this, and they kept thinking of ways to bring them up.

Chapman is conveniently located for me, but I think I'm going to have to try Camelback for the next issue because I just don't want the hassle."
2,"First, the good: a year or so ago, one of the vets here did a great job on a minor surgery for my pet. Five stars for doing a great job then!

For my visit today, zero stars. I had an appointment for a routine rabies shot. When I arrived (admittedly, about ten minutes late), it seemed that they were not expecting me.  (This despite the confirmation phone call and text.) I felt unwelcome. Perhaps they were too busy or overbooked?

But now for the biggest quantifiable issue: they informed me on the spot that I would need to leave my pet there for a couple hours after the shot for observation. I don't remember ever hearing of this need in previous years, but I am not a vet, so I guess this could be warranted. My unhappiness stems from this: I was asked to bring a stool sample (nbd!), but in making the appointment and the confirmation call, I was never told about this long wait! I live about 25 minutes from this vet, so going home and coming back again would be a waste of gas and time. I have a toddler, so hanging out in their waiting room for two hours was not a great plan. Had I known about this in advance, I could have planned accordingly--perhaps an outing in the area.

Last, here is something that is hard to explain logically: I felt extremely unwelcome there. I am not sure if they were too busy, having an off day, or what, but I felt the best thing to do was to leave. I was frustrated and *may* have been rather rude myself, for which I am sorry. But there is no need to treat a client as if she is a nuisance. I will find another place to get the vaccine.

All in all, if you live close by and aren't very sensitive to rudeness, this may be a fine choice. I have no complaints about the veterinarians, just the office staff. But I wouldn't recommend it to a friend!"
2,Got rare beef noodle soup and spring roll.  Soup base tasted oily. Not amazing yummy. Beef was all stuck together and soup was not hot enough to cook beef through. and we all love a gd piping soup! Spring roll was good! And it came with white noodle.  But not worth 5.50. Roll was slightly smaller with just two pieces. Very nice and crispy. Flavourful inside too. Would come back only for their other foods. lots of choice there. ie. pad thai
2,"I have been there many times (mostly for the view in the summer). 
- The service is ok, but staff can be rude and useless when you need them.
- The food is ok. Not crazy, not great, but overpriced and not impressive. If you are starving, don't stop there. Appetizers are nice, but you will be hungry for the rest of the night with the main menu. Portion are way too small, looks like a joke.

I won't eat there anymore, there is no point. Maybe for a drink in the summer, nothing else. Too much of a disappointment, not worth the hype.

The photo is a ""couscous""  and I took the picture after one bite, ONLY ONE BITE. This is the smallest plate I ever had in a restaurant. Chicken was so dry. I know it claims to be a ""Californian healthy food"" place inspired, but if I had cook a coucous at home, it would it be more tasty. And I'm not a good chef !"
2,"The rice is very good, the hibachi chicken on the other hand is very very dry. Disappointed because I can't seem to find a good hibachi place around Monroe/Matthews."
2,"Dissatisfied in the food. Disappointed in the price point for a subpar sandwich. Ordered the chicken Caesar pita. I can't recall a worse offering for one of my favorites. The Caesar dressing was more of a bland butter sauce. The only thing good was a generous serving of chicken, but it was broiled. Yuck! The salad was a leaf of lettuce with a slice of tomato wi a splash of vinegar. They forgot the Greek in a Greek salad. They also serve Asian food??? 
I love fusions but make sure your namesake is on point. Won't be back. If you're looking for real or good Halal/ Mediterranean food, pass on this place."
2,Updating my review. The quality and quantity of food has gone down since they opened. Owners don't seem motivated to keep customers. I've eaten there once a week. Will be going to the one down the street from now on.
2,"On the rare occasion the service and food are good on the same day, my advice is to play the lottery. There has been more than one occasion we've suspected that the fish and/or vegetables were not the freshest.  And it's not exactly the lightest on the ole wallet either. 

If you can figure out when delivery day is and get takeout, that's your best bet."
2,I was there once for a student party and was definitely not impressed by the food. It was greasy and seemed almost like Chinese food rather than Korean food. Once was enough.
2,"Loved the venue and the view but disliked the service. Came here for my sister's 30th with a table of 9. Our server was nice but did forget some orders. Also, one of the staff (wearing black) almost took one of our tables away cause she wanted to seat other guests even though the place was literally half empty with plenty other seats to accommodate others. The staff kept on reminding us we only had our table until 9 pm. I understand that and they told us in the beginning which was fine. However, to keep reminding us throughout the night was rude. It's as if they wanted to tell us to leave now. Sigh... we wanted to like the place though. Food was mostly good but they need to improve their service. Don't think I'll come back."
2,"The pizza tastes great and the ingredients are excellent but the service and the restaurant atmosphere are pretty terrible. 
The 1st time we went there we waited a very long time and after half an hour we were told they forgot to input our order and we had to wait another half hour for our pizzas.  The 2nd time we went  they brought one pizza and forgot our second order ( sandwich and fries). By the time they realized it , my husband and son were done eating their pizza and i was still starving and just really upset that I wanted to leave (by the way the fries are quite a disappointment) . When we complained they didn't offer any apologies and just said that the kitchen is backed up on ""non-pizza"" orders and they can't manage it so that all orders come to the table at the same time!
Both times the place was very poorly ventilated and smelled like burnt grease.
I might consider pick-up in the future  because my family really loved the pizza but I would never go eat there again."
2,"This place is a little below mediocre, the staff was awkward like this was their first day on the job and forgot little things such as straws, appetizers and soups which add up to be a not so great experience. We also witnessed 2 awkward situations with other customers, 1 that stormed out because they were told the place closes in 15 minutes. The sushi was decent, the few pieces of hibachi steak were tiny and the smallest portion I've ever had, same goes for the scallops and the sweet carrots were way too sweet. Overall I probably won't ever go back there."
2,I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap. What I got looked NOTHING like the pic. Feeling pretty cheated!
2,"Brunched here yesterday with a few friends.. I also wanted to see what all the hype was and take some stunning pics on the rooftop with that gorgeous CN Tower backdrop.

First thing I saw was the lovely hostess as soon as I got off the elevator. Cute concept. My reservation not being available til 30 minutes later?, not so cute.

I can't remember how long ago it was that I had to wait that long to be seated when their was actually a reservation in place.

The interior: wasn't impressed.. had a very IKEA feel to it and didn't like our table. The chair looked like folding chairs you would put in your back yard. Ordered a Mimosa and it was in a plastic glass?? Really? Okay...

The food: I ordered a side fries, the avocado toast and a Mimosa. My bill was close to $50 and not worth the quality of food served.

The avocado toast was okay? Lacked flavour. The potato hash accompanied were not fresh but very dried out. The fries tasted like they were frozen or left out too long. How do you screw up fries? Mimosa tasted bitter.

I asked my guests how they liked their dishes and they weren't impressed either. Our server ran hot and cold at times. Their was an older gentleman that finally picked up my plate when I was done and apologized for it sitting there so long. I think he must have been the owner or manager.

The only thing I enjoyed was taken pictures on the rooftop. The reason I gave this place 2 stars was the service, the food and the fact that we weren't seated promptly. I actually thought it was pretty rude that they seemed very nonchalant about it.

Anyways, I came to see and I saw. Won't be back.."
2,"I used to love the place under the previous owners.  The only negative was that it would take longer to get the check after you were done than it would to order and eat the food.  I went last night and the food was definitely inferior and the waitress was clueless.  I'll give them another shot since it was a favorite of mine for years, but I'm highly disappointed."
2,"I was not a fan of this place at all. The food was ok. The lady who served us was unreasonable when it came to our kids bowl we ordered. It was only rice, chicken, edamame and corn. They only do one scoop of anything you want as toppings for a 7.50 kids bowl. Since we had so little in the bowl, I asked for a extra scoop of corn (since we didn't get any other scoops of things that were included with the bowl) and the lady said it would cost $1 extra for a tiny additional scoop of corn. It was terrible customer service on her part. It was silly for her to huff and puff over that. We most likely will never return because of her customer service."
2,Been here a handful of times but the quality has definitely gone down. Came here during the blazing humid long weekend and it felt like a sauna in there ... left me with no appetite to even eat. When i arrived i noticed a crawling insect (not an ant or a fly) that was running across the table... i told the waitress and she took a napkin to try to kill it. I honestly think the bug ran off fast enough and her reaction didnt seem like she caught it.. but when i asked her if she caught it she said yes (i tried to look at the napkin in her hand to see if she caught it...). I could be wrong but i feel like she just lied so she can go on with the rest of her duties... my girlfriends and i just moved to another table. Their large pho has very minimal meat and small portion of noodles compared to before. Their curry beef brisket and roti is delicious but with all those other factors in mind i wont be back.
2,"The pho was stale tasting or maybe it was the noodles. The meat balls were also lacklustre. Our second dish never arrived as the waitress forgot to order it. Given the taste of the pho, I had low incentive to stick around and find out. Too bad.  The waitresses are ok in terms of friendliness."
2,"Coming from Atlanta, I was shocked by the lack of Korean restaurants here. I am used to the ""Korea Town"" feel of Gwinett County and I have to say that Korea Garden is pretty subpar compared to what you are ""supposed"" to get. 

I ordered the ""Seafood"" tofu soup and my friend had the jia jiang mien(spelling?) and the kam poong-gi (""fried"" chicken dish). The Seafood tofu soup had virtually no seafood other than baby shrimp, but it had an abundance of mushrooms (apparently, the ""other"" seafood). The jia jiang mien tasted like spaghetti mixed in with some bland sauce and the kam poong-gi was disgustingly soggy and sticky, and overloaded with chopped carrots.

Not only was the food terrible, but it is overpriced! I paid $4 more for tofu soup here than what I would in Atlanta, but then again this restaurant has virtually no competitors here compared to Atlanta. Also, there are some poor management decisions here due to possible stinginess? stupidity? only god knows what. Why would ANY manager put only TWO waiters to cater to the entire restaurant on a Saturday night????? The poor waiters were running back and forth, literally, and there were a lot of disgruntled customers. I never even got my drink refilled once, but I cant complain because there were people next to me who didnt get their drinks until AFTER they got their food (which took an extremely long time already). Afterwards, many people sat at their tables waiting for 15-20 minutes for their checks.

If the food doesnt drive people away, the service certainly will. Maybe I just got the worst items on the menu, since there are more positive reviews than negative, but If you must have Korean food,  I guess this is an okay place to go. I would advise you to bring a water bottle if you decide or happen to go on a busy night so you dont choke on your subpar food."
2,"So I had an Ionic foot bath treatment today and wanted to try it out . The girl was really friendly and informative about how the machine gets rid of toxins from your liver to gallbladder .  . I asked if the detox really works and if they ever hooked up the other machine without anyone's feet in them . She told me they ran a test and the water was a slight brown color with no feet but not as dark . I noticed my water was brown and dark green , the same color as other yelp photos . So , I continued to sip on my tea and watch this brown to dark green water fill up the foot spa . I finished paid $40 - minus the yelp $10 .00 coupon and off I went . 

I was still curious if this really was true . So I went home and researched it . I googled it and saw That Inside Edition, the tv show ,did an under cover episode and went to several spas . They had a Dr. show how it's just rust coming out from the machine due to the  electric charge . They even showed 2 machine side by side with feet an no feet , exactly same color . 
It's pretty gross to think your feet are sitting in rusty water for 45 minutes. What a waste of time and money , it's just a gimmick!"
2,"Place is very busy during lunch and dinner but it's a quick service so not really like you need to wait forever. The food was average. I enjoyed the curry dishes but mostly i look forward to eating bun at Viet places (vermicelli and veggies with random meat toppings to choose from). This place didn't really fulfill my expectations of the noodles dishes. I ordered the chicken dish which should have a skewered meat and they gave me twice the grilled chicken and just told me they forgot the skewer so here's the chicken... But other tables were getting their skewers after... Made no sense.. the food tasted average, though their fish sauce was delicious and I'm a huge fish sauce fan :)

It was really messy there and the sauce holders were all covered in caked on spills which just really makes you not want to use it.. they seated us right next to the food window thing which was extremely annoying cause they just kept brushing right next to me with all these hot dishes. They really should not seat people there. Plus they kept screaming at each other through the window.

Honestly no real desire to come back. I've had better Viet in Markham at better prices."
2,"I have taken all of my animals to Lone Mountain Animal Hospital for 10+ years and have always followed the direction of what the veterinarians have prescribed to do. Unfortunately, my dog has seizers and they can not pinpoint why this is happening; they have performed several expensive blood work tests and still nothing. (These test are usually every six months to check his liver and phenobarbital levels).  I reached out to this office to have my dogs medication refilled because I am currently out of work and can not afford to pay for these blood work tests in the next three weeks as they stated I had to. Again, I explained that I am waiting to get unemployment and even still with nothing I make sure that he has his medication refilled and is given it regularly everyday. What I was told was they could give me 2 weeks of his phenobarbital pills but nothing more. They would rather my dog have no pills and having seizers because I can not afford the tests then to help me, then to help my dog. I was told by one of the staff members, in a matter of fact manner, they are doing what is right for my dog... HOW is that what is right for my dog to allow him to suffer, to allow him to go without medication because we are in a tough situation right now? (I am not asking for them to foot the bill for his medication, I just a month prescription). Where is the compassion, where is the understanding, what is wrong with this place. For a place that prides themselves on loving animals and caring for them, it seems to me if you are in a bad situation financially, they are not understanding at all."
2,"I'm not really a fan. We ordered delivery one evening and the total was about $42 for two pizzas. We live down the street and was told our pizzas would be delivered in 20 mins.

We waited 20 mins... then 30 mins... then an hour...

We eventually called them to find out where our pizzas were. Turns out the delivery guy hasn't even left the shop yet.

We cancelled our order then and there and ordered sushi for dinner instead. What a waste of time."
2,"My order was completely wrong. For the second time in one week. Long waits in the drive thru even though there were only 2 cars ahead of me. Today I ordered a caramel flan frap, no coffee, with coconut milk. My kid was screaming since it was a long wait so I hadn't noticed it was wrong until I drove away. I got a tiramisu frap with milk. I was not pleased. Thanks for making my day just that much worse when I was trying to make it better by treating myself. Totally annoyed."
2,"This review was from April but was removed because it was posted on the Scottsdale Waterfront's location...

A miss unfortunately this time...

My 2nd time here and I went to the location in North Scottsdale (Hayden). Not a great blow out. My hair was totally flat. I was expecting WAY better given my previous experience. Darn. I have one more groupon left, hopefully the blowout will be a quality one like my first. The customer service and atmosphere were just as great at this location, unfortunately my stylist wasn't skilled :("
2,Usually LOVE this place when eating in but when trying to place a pick up order tonight the girl that answered the phone was CLUELESS about their menu. I asked about a sushi roll and she literally said 'we have like a lot of sushi and like I'm not really sure' and laughed. Know the menu or you'll lose customers. We went out of our way to pick up dinner from another place.
2,"Kost (pronounced coast) is a pretty trendy spot with it's gorgeous views of the city and the CN tower. Definitely a place for a photo op but as a few have said skip the food and get one drink! 

First off, we did come with no reservation and they said it would be a 30 minute wait. Hmm not too bad at all! We happened to bump into some nice guys where we joined their table to wait. Their table was located in a non-umbrella area outside. It was an excruciatingly hot day and we had to ask the servers several times for water! The heat was so unbearable that we asked multiple times to be moved to empty seats that were inside. We were told that they were taken. We had been there for 30 min and the tables still weren't taken. The hostess was very dishonest and not helpful at all! 

Finally my friend went back to the hostess and she refused to accept ""no"" for an answer and so we were moved to table in a cooler area near the pool but still no shade. I had asked the waiter to be moved previously and he said no because it gets too confusing for the tables. Ummm is it that hard to move one group to another table that you are also waiting? Mind you we never had a table we had just crashed a random group's table. 

Kost seems very poorly organized. It isn't that big and the waiters were huffing and puffing about moving tables that were in their seating area. In addition, it took forever to get water. I mean it's a 30 degree day with no umbrella and no water. Do you want lawsuits on your hands? Give a table a jug of water! It's not that big of a deal. Also the bathrooms are on the 43rd floor just below Kost (44th floor)! How does that work?!

Eventually we got sick and tired of roasting in the sun and as soon as a group beside us moved, we took over the table despite what every person in the restaurant told us not to do and guess what? No one even blinked an eye. Ridiculous!

On to the food: I would say Kost it's pretty sad in terms of food. The pancakes looked straight from my kitchen. These aren't the fluffy buttermilk pancakes from Mildred's Temple Kitchen, they're just sad flat pancakes with some fruit on top. For myself, I got the breakfast burrito and it was salty and lacking real flavour and dare I say egg? I mean isn't that supposed to be the main ingredient? The scrambled egg also seemed fake and artificial like the egg you get at McDonald's. 

The mimosa I ordered was delicious but was it worth $15???!!!! I would have to say no! We waited a ridiculously long time for our drinks and even longer for our food. It didn't seem that busy and there were lots of servers and chefs cooking up a storm in the restaurant. Would I go back for food? Hell no! Would I go back for a drink? Maybe. Would I go back for the view and ambiance? Yes. The only reason the place gets a second star."
2,"Shortly after I received my order of Shredded Chicken with Sausage Pho Noodle in Soup, the same server came back to inform us that they didn't have enough fresh pho noodles to cook for my mom's portion of pho and asked if she wanted to vermicelli instead.  Um, vermicelli is not the same type of noodles as pho at all and curry would have been ideal with pho so that it could soak up the sauciness...  So, no, of course my mom didn't want vermicelli with the curry chicken.  The server asked if she wanted the dry pho noodles and since my mom doesn't like the taste of dry pho (fresh pho tastes better for her), she decided to forgo the order entirely.

Anyway, my order of Shredded Chicken with Sausage Pho Noodle in Soup was so-so.  First, I liked that the broth was tasty and steaming hot.  Hot pho soup broth is so important.  The shredded chicken were tender.  The pho noodles were decent.  However, the Vietnamese sausage was cut too thick and didn't taste good at all.  I have fond memories of eating Vietnamese sausage in soup noodles that are almost always delicious.  This one was really disappointing based on it being so thick and kind of flavourless."
2,"Came here for brunch at noon and the place was about 70% full. Nicely decorated with a nice view of the skyline from all sides. The price is on par with what other dt brunch places charge, but the quality and portion size is quite disappointing. Food was very average, something I could probably make at home. My plate looked half eaten...."
2,"I was not impressed. I've lived in Pittsburgh for forever and have tried all the Korean restaurants. Korea garden left a lot to the imagination. 

They had an extensive menu from my recollection and all seemed pretty authentic. You don't see naengmyeon on the menu at places around here typically. Unfortunately...they were out of the dishes we wanted in particular. The soups were pretty good. The soondubu had good flavor and wasn't overpoweringly spicy. The LA style galbi we ordered was decent was well. Overall opinion is that the food is grossly overpriced. Especially for being in a very college environment. The price was not worth the overall experience in my opinion. 

Service was less than stellar. The waiter just started, so I give him the benefit of the doubt with not being familiar with the menu, but our order was wrong when it came out. We took it anyway since we've been waiting so long for our food and were running short on time. When we went to pay our bill it took maybe 10 minutes for is to get the check back for signature."
2,"Went again a few weeks ago. Been quite a while since I had been there. The range officer at the booth on the microphone was a complete jerk. Several times when people made some safety mistakes he berated them over the microphone. He was talking to adults like they were children. He even told one guy that, granted, made the same mistake of touching the items on the table during ceasefires, but he called the guy out saying ""WHAT DID I JUST TELL YOU!?!?"" This was completely inappropriate. Had he talked to me like this I probably would have been thrown off the range for telling the guy that I wasn't a child and not to talk to me like one. 

As I mentioned before, I realize that they see all kinds of dangerous behavior, but there is a better way to talk to people. Embarrassing them in public is never the way."
2,"foods awesome, 
service is awful.

The staff seem rushed in doing everything and anything. Sitting you down , and seeing you out. (I think this is due to the high volume of office people that come in for 30min or 20min lunches. They need to eat and leave asap. So, it does the job)

If you want a quick lunch, its great. Even better with a friend you can blab on forever with and not notice the huffy puffy attitude of staff."
2,"Food is tasty. 
Service is beyond hopeless. 
Cashiers are friendly but counter staff is pretty un-aware of wait times or what is or isn't currently available. 
They are not familiar with service industries standards. Arrogant and obnoxious counter staff.   Cashiers are polite but the manager behind the counter doesn't belong there.  
Restaurant is nicely made, they need a host/hostess out front to manage the incoming guests as it does get busy as any halal restaurant in the area. 
Another halal restaurant offering halal food but below standard service"
2,"The service is awful. I have had experience as a waitress and know that mistakes do happen - especially when it's busy! However, if I had wanted to be ignored and have some bad attitude along with my morning eggs, I would have just saved the $40(!) and eaten breakfast at home with my neighbor's grumpy cat. Then I could have not only enjoyed a less expensive breakfast, but I would have also had easy access to condiments and beverages - free of eye rolls (god forbid I ask for a water after I finish my orange juice). Good gracious, OPH, just put ketchup on the tables so we demanding customers do not have to put your staff through the emotional torture and physical agony of having to get us some! On the bright side, my eggs were cooked perfectly and food is always decent."
2,"Horrible service!! 
Well, the waiter n waitress are alright, they r just kinda rushed n unhappy looking. its the manager with the rude attitude that had us say ""Never again Prince sushi!!!""
the 2 star is all on the food!!

food is good but not worth the bad service that come along with it.

we kept going back( 3rd time) cuz the food is decent there, but we went there again recently n ordered the way we always do. we knew they'd charge for left over food so we always try not to over order.( plus i hate seeing food going to waste) never had a problem with this system until now.
 this time the portion was much bigger than we remembered so even though we tried our best to stuff our face and still had a bit of food left over. 4 portions of salmon sashimi( 3 slices per)=12 but we got 16 or something, n we ate it all... n mixed mushroom was triple the portion of wut i rememeber....beef tataki also more slices than wut i ordered....etc etc......
a little bit of extra here n a bit of extra here=left over which they can charge u for!
n then i had 2 slices of butter fish sashimi which i thought wasn't fresh so i didn't want to eat...the waitress question why those were left over n i told her...it's not fresh so i won't eat it, she repeated ""NOT FRESH!??????"" ....yes not fresh! why is it so hard to believe? 
she questioned every little bit down to the fake crab meat on why i have them left over....i feel like a child explaining why i have food left in my plate to my mom! after that the waitress said she will send her superior over to take care of the situation.
when i explained to the manager i had extra slices of sashimi served to me, she shouted to the sushi chef "" did u cut them extra slices?!"" ...i couldn't hear wut he said but she said she punched in the order according to wut i wrote down...n this time she'll let me go, but next time she'll charge me...blah.....
i have no problem paying extra if it was my fault, but serving me too much n try to charge me for it? no thanks!
n i guess cuz we wouldn't finish our food n was the only customers left in the restaurant, they didn't bother offering us any ice cream.

there will be no next time, i will not go back there again. pay to have some one lecture u on finishing ur food sucks! i guess if u'd like to relive that part of ur childhood then its ok...lol  that's wut it felt like!! already so full but stuck at the table because u can't finished ur food...:(
n i swear, i puked a little when i was trying to get out of the car after...
i reallllly did try to finish my food........i dun think any restaurant should make their customers feel like that!

only way I'd go back there is if they change management...it is the best tasting sushi all u can eat joint in Mississauga I'll give em that.
so now, if i ever want all u can eat sushi i'll have to go to MAKIMONO in Pickering...yet to rate it on yelp but its the best one in GTA! 4 star!

gotta say, protion control @ a all u can eat joint is such a buzz kill!"
2,"I went there last week and was not impressed with the process, there were about 6 people sitting at the front desk all playing on the computer and not one looked up when i was standing there waiting to be checked in.  I finally get checked in and i asked for a magazine and they gave me an almost dead ipad ""which has a lot of reading material on it"" along with gross fingerprints all over it. Then my stylist was pretty rough with my hair and she made a rude comment about how my extensions needed to be redone. I figured it was because I didnt get them done there and so she needed to make a dig at them. She probably over heated the round brush more than 10 times burning my scalp and the finished product was something I could've done. I would not recommend this location it seems like a free for all in there and it was not very clean."
2,"This place is OK, but just that, OK...
Nothing great about it, the food is not great but it is not bad either.
The restaurant is kind of nice, if you plan on sitting there and eating, but if you are there for a take out like me looking for a decent lunch, there are better choices out there.
The price is reasonable, you do get a decent amount of food the money you spend."
2,"This Turkish restaurant in the heart of Overlea is intriguing from the outside. Modern art on the windows, traditional art inside, a nice seating area and professionally dressed servers. However, our experience tonight had good elements and not so great elements that really left us with mixed reviews.

They have a varied menu with many traditional meat options. Their drink selection is primarily Turkish specialties and a few types of pop. Considering I hate anything carbonated, I ended up just drinking water and a glass of Turkish tea (which they supply free of charge). Personally, I quite enjoyed the tea and should have ordered it earlier; however, my dad thought the taste of the tea was relatively bitter-sweet (literally) and was not bowled over by the experience.

For our mains, we both ordered house/restaurant specialties. I ordered the sautéed vegetables with chicken. The dish overall was quite good except I felt the chicken was dry and tasteless. My dad had their lamb beyti and quite enjoyed it.

For the majority of the meal, servers were very attentive and courteous; however, when it came time to pay for our meal, all the servers disappeared. It took us 20-30 minutes to find and call over a server to get the bill for us.

Overall, I highly doubt I will return to this location; however, there was nothing significantly wrong with our experience. It just didn't 'wow' us."
2,"Extremely disappointed. 

Wanted to like this place - really did. Nice eclectic menu with some Indian mixed with Thai and other Asian influences.

Went last weekend with my daughter - she got the Mongolian Noodles (with Tofu) and I got the Red Curry Chicken. The owner or manager seemed to go out of how way to helpfully explain the menu choices and how ordering worked (choice of noodles). 

All in all both dishes were DROWNING in sauce - really a soupy gloppy mess of too sweet sauce that vastly overpowered the chicken (which was tender but seemed pre-made and simply added fast food style to the bean sprouts and other ingredients). 

This is certainly fast food fusion - nothing special at all about what we had. 

2 dishes cost $20 or so - and I could get the same at a REAL Chinese or Thai place and get some REAL tasting food with actual fresh food that isn't simply about throwing some pre-made stuff into a wok and calling it good.

The food here isn't bad mind you - but is isn't very good either - very average. Certainly not worth $20 (although someone in front of us had a Groupon and that would have been a better way to fly).

My teen daughter and I agreed - food rates about a 6 out of 10. We won't go back."
2,"Stayed here with a group so had 2 conjoined rooms that included 2 bedroom with living room and full kitchen. Very convenient mini apt. So if I choose to cook up something really quick instead of standing in line at restaurants, I can. 

Very roomy and pretty clean except the showers which had mildew/mold stains on the grout of shower walls. Is it that hard to bleach the showers people? Otherwise, bathroom pretty descent with a jetted tub in with the shower together. Bathroom a bit small though. Kind of have to squeeze by between door to sink area. Some of the extra towels they have underneath the sink were dirty. As if they dropped it, got stepped on and they fold it up and put it there anyway. Gross. Probably need to find a better place to put them rather than underneath the sink, maybe. 
A/C can be loud and you can hear others pretty close by above and below you too. Not just next door. Just like living in an apt. That's a bit frustrating.

This place is pretty far away from the strip. Another downfall unless your happy to be away from the craziness and traffic. No casino available. Specifically an apt type stay.

They say they have complimentary breakfast. Of many hotels I have stayed at, this is of the most pointless and sorry breakfast ever. They should call it a complimentary snack bar instead. Literally just coffee, bananas, and mini blueberry or banana nut muffins. Um, ok. I guess its better than nothing to some.

This is what I despise the most of this place. I have never had this issue with any other hotels where if you needed a later check out, almost all other places would give you one extra hour without penalty. Not only does this place decided to charge $30 for the extra hour. To top it off, they locked out all key cards by 10:30 am. We cant carry all the luggage in one round, you know. Give people a break! Lucky some of us were still in the hotel to hold the door and get the rest of our luggage. 

Generally, room itself is very roomy and to have a full kitchen is convenient but with all the trouble, I rather go elsewhere."
2,"This place has one of my favorite burgers and the first 3 times I went here it was awesome, good food, good service, and a good price. However, the last time I went I learned that they don't take your order at your table anymore which I wasn't that upset about at first but soon after I realized that it was a complete pain. Trying to communicate with someone to get a fork or a knife took 5 minutes alone. It seemed like they open at 11 and the employees got there at 10:55 and didn't think they were going to be busy... I'm disappointed Mr.  Hula."
2,"First time and my goodness all the up charges! 2 burritos  $21!!! Up charge to make chimi style and up chrge to make ""wet"" with a little sauce on top. I didn't even dare ask for sour cream, I hope I have at home :( Better Mexi places in area at half the cost."
2,"I usually give nice reviews, but .... I found the place by accident and liked the menu. Store is clean and a cool kind of edgy feel. Nice. I ordered the Kung Pao noodles w/chicken. Sadly, there was no spicy sauce and no hot chiles. A small serving of chicken and a small portion of veggies, mostly just noodles. For $8.99. I will pass."
2,Went here for breakfast this morning and was disappointed. My omelette was way over cooked and the egg was crispy. My husband got the chicken and waffles which was also really over cooked. The chicken was rock hard and dry. The only reason it gets two stars is because our waitress was friendly and super attentive. Would not recommend!
2,"We mistakenly booked this thinking it was the Tahiti Village resort in Vegas. Though this place was fine as just a hotel, note that it is away from the Strip (that can be a good thing) and not a resort at all.

No restaurant there. No bar for drinks. A very minimal continental breakfast (not sure which continent it was based on - not North America)  I found myself walking next door to the Denny's and the Starbucks a bit too often. 

The pools are small but okay.

They do have an hourly free shuttle to the strip but depending on what part you're headed for and if you're trying to make a show, it can be awkward and require an hour+ of negotiating. We ended up using cabs a few times.

The concierge services were useful.

It was a clean, fairly up to date place to sleep and stay but nothing special beyond that."
2,"The end result of my nails and pedicure has always been good but it's just not worth it. The staff is over worked and super rude. It's always so crowded and even if you have an appointment you'll wait. I was told I needed to come in the morning because then Danny will be able to take care of me. I work an 8-5 job so instead of taking vacation time I'll just go elsewhere. 
Also this place is $15 more for acrylics than other places in Madison."
2,"It's my first time to this place and will be the last time too. I have been to the one on Queen a couple of times and liked it, thinking this one would be of at least similar quality... Anyway, overall it is just much worse, and there seemed to have fewer items on the menu too, and one thing other than its food that really bugged me is: they added 15% tip on the bill without telling me while waiting for me to key in my pin, had I not noticed it I would have put another 15%. Honestly I didn't even think I got 15% worth of service, since everything was slow and cold(not talking about the food, although what I ordered was mostly cold too)."
2,Slow service. Neglected our table repeatedly. Food came out cold and drinks were delayed by 20-30 minutes.
2,"This place is really a hit or miss.  The service/quality is never the same. Some times they do a fantastic job other times I could have done a better job and saved myself the money. Making an appointment means nothinf to them so don't waste your time making one. The one good thing is the quality of the eye brow waxing,  they always do my eye brows great."
2,"We had to move out of state and needed to rent our home out for a bit. We decided on On Q Property Management after interviewing a few. We got off to a rocky start with their maintenance company, but they did resolve all issues (after many upset phone calls from me), but regardless, it got corrected. Fortunately I have family near by who was keeping an eye on things until it was rented out. 

We were pleased that they found, what we were told, were qualified tenants quickly. The rental person claimed they had no children except for an exchange student who would only be there for a month (not an issue, we didn't ask if they had kids since it was a 5 bedroom house and expected a family to live there. This information was offered). 

Everything went along ok for the most part. The time came that we were ready to sell our home. We got real estate agents. They needed to go over to the house and check it out, take pictures, etc. We contacted the tenants directly and told them what was happening. We also floated the idea of them buying it if they were interested. 

Well, to make a long story short, our realtors found out that the tenants had credit issues and could not buy the house and they had children. (Again, not an issue, but we were told differently, which was the issue). So, in essence we were lied to by On Q. They had no reason to lie to us. It certainly wasn't the tenants fault that they lied. We understood the tenants' credit issues. We had been in the same boat 5 years before. That really upset us that they lied. We were very fortunate that they were good tenants, paid on time, kept the home in reasonable condition. 

So, now the tenants move and its time to finish our business with On Q. That took FOREVER or what felt like it anyway. We tried to email and call our property manager, Rebeccah. She wouldn't get back to us in a timely fashion. She never did end up returning my husband's calls to this day. When she would email back, it must have been right as she was walking out the door for the day because it was 9 PM east coast time, which is where we live and we couldn't reach her after that to respond. I called over there and ended up talking to their accounting department, who was very professional, unlike our property manager. 

Our microwave came up missing. Rebeccah did call the tenants about that. Again, I have family that was keeping an eye on the place. They first claimed there was no microwave (not true, had pictures). They finally after 3 weeks (no thanks to Rebeccah) returned a microwave that was clearly not ours. From the pictures I was sent it was filthy, still had food in it, YUCK. I immediately told her to get that filthy thing out of my house and give it back. 

Also, supposedly the tenants furnished a receipt that they had the house cleaned and the carpets cleaned, which Rebeccaah put in her report to. There was NO WAY the carpets had been cleaned as per the lease. Instead of Rebeccah maybe telling the tenants this (if I paid for work that wasn't done, I'd certainly call the company that was supposed to do it!), she let it go. This was clearly in the lease that carpets were to be professionally cleaned upon move out!!!! I ended up flying out there to see what the heck was going on with our home. Found that the carpets were barely vacuumed or vacuumed with a broken vacuum. As I vacuumed them, I found clothing tags and the little plastic thing that connects the tag to the cloth, even old food. Trim was missing from the garage door into the house (what was that about?????) Fortunately that appeared to be the only big issues.

I had a family member pick up all the keys (or so I thought). Next thing I know, my real estate agent says there is still a lock box from On Q on my property! Seriously????? I told Rebeccah to get the lock box out of there by the end of the business day the next day. There was no reason for that lock box to be there. They had no right to be in my house at that point!!!! Next thing I know, they never returned the POS microwave that the tenants returned and had to get it back. Was this woman kidding???? I was livid by that point. I told her to take the cost of our microwave out of their security deposit (receipt was sent to her for that microwave) since it was about a month later and to CLOSE MY ACCOUNT. 

Supposedly there was some miscommunication. Regardless, there was no need from ANYONE from that company to be inside of my house by that point. Beings that their maintenance department literally broke into my house in the beginning of our contract, we were furious with them. I would not recommend them, or at least not Rebeccah to be your property manager. The other staff that I had dealt with were pleasant and friendly. But these people lied to us, then wouldn't talk to us, had an unauthorized lock box on our house after my family picked up all the keys!!! 

So, buyer beware if you're renting your home out and you are considering this company"
2,"As we arrived, there was no host to seat us at a table for my friends & I of 4. This is at 12:30 finally get sat at 12:45, then we sat for another 20 min before being greeted by a server who asked if we were ready to order without any menus. She proceeded to ask us what we would like to drink & we ordered water for all of us. Then as we proceeded to wait for our food. During our course, the waitress asked us if we would like more water & forgot about the refill. Our food was very delicious and well needed after a long day at work. Horrible serivce, great food."
2,"Went a month or so ago, ordered the BBQ pork taco with Mac and cheese on it. Left to go pick up order, received a call from an unfamiliar number didn't answer. Got to the store and was told they didn't have Mac and cheese at 1:45 PM!!! Ok so I was offered a substitute a very salty regular pork taco. It was not good....on top of not what I wanted. The fish taco wasn't crispy and it just ran together with the mango,pineapple salsa. The lady at the counter was pleasant, her co worker kept trying to get me to get a beer. I was fine with the complimentary soda.The other thing was this CREEPY looking black dude, who was just staring at me. I'm a black dude.....by the way. And dude still creeped me out....the menu is all over the place I must agree. Depending on the time you go , you have to fight the traffic on Broadway to get the wrong food and recklessly eyeballed by a weirdo. Not sure if I'm going back"
2,"This is the second time I am not having a good experience in the octagon ! 
First of all the food is not that good at all it does not match the high end quality that the restaurant is delivering. I ordered sea bass and the little tiny piece of fish came with a side of tasteless boiled cauliflower pieces and beans , it absolutely had no taste what so ever, that was it on my plate, I left very hungry and not satisfied for the price I payed for that dish. And the service I find judges you on how much food you order they are nicer if you order more expensive dishes. 
Me and my friend came to have wine and an appetizer last time and we got told that for the next time we are not allowed to just order an appetizer. never mind that we shared expensive wine with that and out bill came to more than a 100$. I will not comeback to the restaurant again!"
2,"Well I've been coming to this location for as long as i can remember since it's very close to my house.  The food is pretty good, but nothing more than what it should be since this is a chain.  The only thing i didn't care for was the waitress. She was only came around to take our order then i never saw her again until the bill came.  When i wanted a refill i had to get up and walk to the kitchen and ask if i could get a refill.  The quality of service at this location has been going down for years.  If it gets much worse then i'll just start going up the street to IHOP instead"
2,"Ordered food from here to have it delivered, once received the food everything was cold. We were missing pancakes and toast from the grand slam. Unfortunately we will not be ordering from here again due to the lack of customer service as well as the food quality."
2,"Be careful that you booked the right hotel! We reserved months in advance thinking that we were staying at the Tahiti Village with all those amenities only to find out we had accidentally booked here despite booking on their very own website. We drove here to find out the location and amenities were not as good. Plus, our room wouldn't be ready until 4. Thankfully, a manager allowed me to cancel on the spot so we could stay somewhere more appropriate for our family. 

Totally a bait and switch, but thankfully we got out of it."
2,"Very impressive at first. Sales person was pleasant but we were probably his most simple sale of the day. Things went smooth for financing and delivery was on time the next day. But then when things did not work is when I experienced another side of Spencer's customer service. When I realized my fridge did not seem as cool as should be the store was closed. The following day I awoke to find my brand new fridge a whopping 55 degrees and the freezer at 65 degrees, NOT recommended for food freshness. Needless to say, ALL the food had to be tossed! I called first thing in the morning, sales rep stated he would find out what time they would be able to deliver another refrigerator, then call me back.....did not hear anything after 2 hours so I called and spoke directly to my sales rep, whom explained to me I was scheduled for the end of the day and they would call 2 hours prior to delivery. 4pm no call. 5pm a call came they would be there in 20 mins...GREAT! Another fridge was delivered and the non-working one taken away. When I called and requested what Spencer's could do for replacement of all the spoiled food (it was a few days before New Year's lots of meat wasted) I received a cold shoulder not even an apology. A few days later since it was the holiday I received a call stating they would take 50.00 off my bill! I was insulted at this point. I just spent 3 months of my salary on new appliances and due to the defect of their refrigerator was out another several hundred dollars. ""Extraordinary service"" as they state is only when you have NO issues, not when you really need their service. They pride themselves on being ""family owned, family operated business"", maybe they need to take better care of the customers of their community. Long story made short: I felt everything went smoothly with smiles on their faces until my money was secured for payment. Then when I showed concerns about defected merchandise and taking ownership of their products, difficulties arose and the interest in service towards me vanished. Very disappointing when you find a place that does have the best prices, but makes you wonder what corners they have to cut in order to keep the prices low?"
2,"In town for a multi-day volleyball tournament and first time staying at this property.  Left our hotel room at approximately 6:30 a.m. on day 1 & returned at approximately 2:00 p.m. Our room had not been cleaned while we were gone.  At around 2:15, housekeeping knocked and offered to clean our room, however, we were exhausted from the day and preferred to rest, so we declined the offer and simply asked for additional, clean towels.  Today, we left the hotel at approximately 10:00 a.m. and returned after 10:00 p.m.  Much to our shock and disappointment, upon entering our room after another long & exhausting day, our room had not been cleaned, for a second day in a row.  The trash cans are now overflowing and two days worth of dirty towels are piled up in the corner of the bathroom floor.  We called the front desk to notify them of the situation and they wanted to know if we'd had the ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door, which we had not.  They mentioned they'd ""make a note of it"".  I asked for additional clean towels, which she told me she had at the front desk.  I requested they be delivered to my room.  Two towels were delivered for four people.

[UPDATE] Upon checkout, expressed displeasure with our stay and the lack of housekeeping.  Spoke with Nyal at the front desk who notified me of the 100% Satisfaction Guarantee offered by the hotel.  He listened to my concerns, apologized for my experience, and went to great lengths to make our stay end on a satisfactory note."
2,"Let's just start out saying that I am disappointed with this place after reading reviews that it's a good place.

I went for dinner (around 7pm) on a weeknight and found them semi-busy.  That's a good sign that the fish doesn't sit too long.

I ordered the all you can eat (ayce) for $18.99 and was given a menu and 2 different ordering sheets.  The first thing that I noticed was that you didn't get limited on how much sashimi you could order.  The bad thing is that the rolls come in 6's or 8's only which is terrible if you dine alone or have only 2 at the table.  They should allow smaller portions so that you are able to try more food.

Here is my review of the following:
Salmon Sashimi - pretty fresh tasting and decent size!  Ate 12 pcs!
Spicy Tuna Hand roll - wasn't spicy and not much taste
Seafood Soup - don't order it. just fish bits, mushrooms and 2 small pieces of squid
Spider Roll - seemed like the crab was deep fried a long time ago
Tempura Roll - tasted ok but the tempura wasn't fresh
Spicy Tuna/Salmon roll - decent
Mango Icecream - probably my 2nd favourite dish after the sashimi

As you can see, I didn't get to try too much since the rolls filled me right up!

Finally, the service.  It really, really sucked!  I had to ask a couple of times for my tea to be refilled.  Also had to wait awhile before they came to take my order sheet.  I noticed that the younger waitress had the time to talk to the sushi chef rather than serve her guests.  It even took time for my bill too!

I wouldn't recommend this place"
2,"Ok for the price and convenience but I'm still taken aback that the first room I was given had never been cleaned after the previous guests. I walked in to see the bed a mess, trash everywhere, and the bathroom door closed with the light on. Kinda freaked me out cuz I thought someone was still there and I just intruded.

Went back down to the desk to get a new room and the lady apologized and offered me a ""gift card"" and complained much more than I even cared to that ""housekeeping sucks"", like it's a habitual problem instead of a onetime freak mistake. I never recieved anything nor did I bother bringing it up at checkout, and I'd prepaid for the room so it wasn't applied to that either. 

The AC unit was absolutely deafening yet didn't cool the room effectively, but it drowned out the screaming people and loud airplanes, so it ended up being a good feature. 

Now the actual good....

I slept terribly, that was more just my own mind not stopping, so I called in the morning and requested a late checkout. Without question they gave me till 1pm with no fee. I wanted 3pm like some hotels do, but those hotels charge at least $50 for that. 1pm with no fee was actually quite generous, so thank you. 

In addition, the airport shuttle driver was exceptionally nice. Loaded everything, opened all doors, gave me his arm as I stepped off. Was such a kind gentleman and treated me like gold, which lifted my spirits, after I'd experienced a horrible last 24 hrs."
2,"This was not my first time shopping at Spencer's. I bought a washer and dryer the service was excellent, delivery was on time and installed great. The guys were professional and helpful. So when I decided to buy my new kitchen appliances I went directly to Spencer's. This time was not as great. Again delivery on time and helpful but when they went to install the stove the guys found it very damaged. I was assured it would be replaced. What I found strange was I never hear from the store. So got my stove and now another thing wrong a piece missing on the dishwasher. This time we have to order a part after not even having the product for 30 days.  Again no call from store. I am a little surprise that the store does not make a point to call customers when something goes wrong.  I guess once you walk out the store the customer service ends. Just FYI even Lowe's follows up guys. Have to say that customer service in the store needs some improvements."
2,"Went to Coaltrane's at 7pm when it wasn't busy at all, our party of 4 was the only group in the restaurant. I ordered the Pepino salad, asked for no tomatoes, and the other 3 in my party got 1/4 chicken and two sides. My salad came with no feta, no arugula and no salad dressing (which it was supposed to have on it).  It did however come with the tomatoes I asked them to leave off. It was basically $10 for romaine, onion, tomatoes and chicken and in a puddle of water. One of the sides with the 1/4 chicken was incorrect and the guy that brought it out seemed frustrated and short with us when we explained what it was supposed to be. I had to ask twice for the dressing for my salad. The food overall was pretty underwhelming. Perhaps they need more
Time to work the kinks out but they should definitely think about hiring nicer staff."
2,"Do you want to know what chinese food would taste like if McDonalds sold chinese food?

Eat here.

(If you are a fan of chinese food, don't eat here.  you'll cry and wonder why you didn't listen to that snarky review on yelp )"
2,"Overall, the food is good quality. About as good as Pei Wei for a similar price. Much better than Panda Express. They make the food quickly, and its easy to pick up. I pretty much only go here for the food taste/speed. 

Complaints: 

1.) Their phone is down, and has been for weeks with no fix in the future. The workers there didn't seem to care, and told me to order online. That's fine, but you would think that they would at the very least put that on their website/remove the phone number from it, or put a sign up.

2.) I go pretty much weekly during lunch. Their touch screen soda machine NEVER has soda in it. I looked at their 'no calorie' options, and of the 12+ options, they just had water left! At 12:00 p.m. in the day! Seriously? You're a restaurant. You should restock immediately when things are getting low.

3.) Cleanliness is spotty. Tables often need wiping down, the empty food bowls sit by the trash and pile up, and some people have been using their utensil containers as trash! There was some stuff touching the eating-end of the forks where they have the drinks. Seriously? Clean up your restaurant! 

4.) I went during a lunch break the employees had (2:00 p.m, sorry I just got off work!) and one stopped eating to help me. He prepared my food without washing his hands. Again - seriously? I don't know if you've been putting your fingers in your mouth or what!

I go there pretty often. Its good for a quick fast lunch, but be warned."
2,"Very disappointed... I have been here quite a few times and today my drink doesn't taste like it usually does. I ordered the number 11, which should be made from real coconut juice, but today it tasted like water with added sweetener: $6 for water with jelly and fruit is a little overpriced in my book. 

When I visit a place of business that serves food and drinks, I depend on them to be consistent. So this is a big no no to me. I probably won't be back for a while."
2,"Anybody who tells you that Vegas is a 24 hour town, is either lying or hasn't tried to find a non-poker bar to eat at, on a Sunday, after 10 PM, off of the Strip. It's damn near impossible to find any place open. 

Just like last Sunday, Jerry J. and I were on the prowl  last night (7/31/11) for some food to celebrate having one whole day this week, off from work today (Monday.) After driving home from work and getting picked up, Jerry suggested that we drive down by where he lives (Sunset Station) rather than by where I live (GVR) - there was nothing open, the cafe inside of Sunset was closed until 6 AM for cleaning and for whatever reason, Jerry doesn't think it's okay to take girls to bars for a proper meal. The only option was Denny's or IHOP over there and he said he didn't care for either, so we drove back up to GVR. Everything was closed there, so we ended up at Denny's on Eastern. Eff. We drove around for an hour for nothing!

The place was pretty dead at a little after midnight. There was only two tables that had people at them. We got the menus and... Jerry said nothing was jumping out to him. I'm not a big fan of Denny's - their food isn't very good anymore, so I agreed. They have some new menu out that has ""regional"" dishes and I was really eyeing the shrimp and grits. All of the sudden, common sense took over as I pondered how good the quality of seafood, at a Denny's, in a desert would be, and that the grits probably were of the instant variety. The waitress had to check on us three times before we were ready to order because we were too busy chatting to look over our menu. Good thing she was patient with us. When it was time, Jerry ordered a burger and fries, and I settled on the peach french toast, with two sunny side eggs, 2 sausage links and hash browns for $5.99 

The food came out quickly. My toast, and what I think were canned peaches, were a little black on the edges, but it was okay. The eggs were not good - they had a thick, congealed, clear layer on top - something I've never seen on eggs I've made sunny side up at home. They weren't good quality and they tasted...not good. You can tell the quality of an egg - the better the quality, the more orange the yolk. Of course, quality eggs come from chickens that were fed bugs and worms and quality feed and were allowed to scratch around outside. These yolks were highlighter-yellow and tasteless. Poor chickens.  

I don't think Jerry was that impressed with his food. The meal was pretty blah for both of us, but we were there over an hour. The waitress was good, but that's about it. Skip this place and just go to the grocery store if you need food on a late Sunday night because Denny's won't hit the spot."
2,"Decent room but wasn't cleaned all day. Came back called front desk , waited 20minfor answer to ask for clean towels then waited another 20 min. . I might also add that it's in a really sketchy part of town."
2,I feel bad giving Bambu a low review because I love their concept and am usually a huge fan of Asian drinks but we ordered three different types of their most popular drinks (added up to $17) and we couldn't finish a single one. The woman who served us was the sweetest and deserves a raise for her enthusiasm though. However the drinks themselves were too sweet and really difficult to drink. Our straws all got clogged with the pandan jelly and had to be thrown away
2,"We purchased a new refrigerator. It was delivered very quickly (I think it was in our house less than 24 hours after purchase) and we were happy. However, the refrigerator temperature was unable to stabilize, and seemed to take an unusual amount of hours to get back down after increasing (warming), greatly, at random times for no good reason. We called Spencer's over the weekend to ask about this. We explained what was happening and they agreed to bring out another refrigerator on Monday, and they did what they said. Both times, the delivery people (different guys each time) were great! They called us in the morning and then showed up within the time frame promised, and are genuinely nice people to have in your home! 

However, when the second refrigerator was delivered, we noticed that there was a difference. The second time, the delivery people were basically unpackaging and assembling a brand new refrigerator on site (putting the shelves in, screwing the door handles on, etc.), seemingly fresh from the factory. The papers with the second refrigerator were crisp and new (unlike the first refrigerated that had been delivered, but we didn't question it at the time). 

This makes us wonder what was really up with the first refrigerator. Did they know they were giving us a faulty product? Was there something they weren't telling us? Was the first refrigerator the floor model, already returned, refurbished, just to tide us over and keep us happy with a quick delivery, something they were trying to get off their hands, thinking we wouldn't know any better (and we didn't), maybe someone grabbed a faulty one by accident and delivered it to us? We don't know for sure, but we probably won't shop there again, and no one has said anything to clear it up, they just quickly delivered a new one. We now feel uneasy about it. It will probably be Lowe's or Home Depot for us with our future household appliance purchases. Service with the salesperson and delivery men was great with Spencer's...but what's going on behind the scenes...what are you really getting...?"
2,"This place is seriously overpriced.  They charge $18 for a basic manicure during ""peak"" hours and $16 during ""non-peak"" hours (i.e., before 3 pm on Mon-Wed).  However, even though they advertise this special on their website, they never seem to offer the discount in person when I go there.  I am a repeat customer who always goes during ""non-peak"" hours, so you might think that by now they would remember me and give me the discount, if for no other reason than I go every week.  It upsets me that they never offer me the discount.  Why advertise it on the website if they don't want to give it?  They do an *ok* job with nails; it is nothing extraordinary.  I come from New York, where better manicures cost $7.50.  I am disappointed with this place.  If it wasn't for the location being so close to where I live, I would go elsewhere.  The staff are friendly, though, and they offer you free water or soda while you get your nails done.  And they take walk-ins.  So, those are nice perks.  Still not worth $16 or $18 for a basic manicure, though!"
2,Was excited to meet friends here for Sunday brunch. Their website says they open at 9 but apparently this is not the case. Had to go to Yelp to learn they open at 10.  Should not be too hard to keep your website up to date.
2,"I like the idea of this place ... a walk-up cafe with mix-and-match options, made to order. Nice.  But, you know, the food actually has to taste good if I'm ever to come back.  And, sorry, I won't.

I had the Budha Bowl.  Yes, they inexplicably do not spell Buddha correctly -- what, are they actually trying to brand the word ""Budha""?  A bowl of noodles with an obnoxious amount of onions and peppers and few other veggies.  Bathed in a boring ""hosin-ginger sauce"".  I put the sauce name in quotes because I didn't taste ginger, or any other distinguishing flavor, for that matter ... I'm guessing it is not made on site. A quite-small smattering of mung bean sprouts and a lime on top.  Yawn."
2,"I've been here twice now. If I were just basing it off of the pedicure I would probably give it 3 or 4 stars. That being said the price for the pedicure by itself is a little bit much. $45 for the Citrus pedicure and you do not get a manicure included. The website and the manual that they hand you does not clearly state how much each procedure is going to cost. They make it seem like you're going to get a package but it ends up costing an extra $15 for the manicure. While I was getting the manicure my pedicure was obviously drying. Finished my manicure and sat at the drying table for maybe 10 minutes (this was without shellac). As we were driving, my friend's nailpolish started smudging and coming off. Mine followed soon after. I called when I got home to let them know. I live clear on the other side of town and really just wanted a partial refund at that point. No dice. They wanted me to come back. Why on earth would I go back when they already fucked up twice? I gave two chances, I'm not going back for three."
2,"My experience at The Octagon Restaurant was akin to that of a woman's experience on her cycle. It was a clusterfk of emotions...all out of whack, and all undetermined.

The evening started out good and bad. When we arrived, the parking lot was full, so the valet person told us to go away (WTF?) the valet line was backed up so bad and they were so unprofessional and rude about it; we literally decided to drive onto the separating garden island thing to get out (we keeps it classy lol). We didn't notice the cops on the street watching us from maybe a stone's throw away. They watched us ride first class on that struggle bus as we broke every traffic law in the book. They paused momentarily then LAUGHED (dafuq?!). We finally parked in the next plaza down at the farmer's market.

We were a group of 14, so naturally they sent us upstairs to one of the private rooms (had a door and errtang). THOSE STAIRS NEED RENOVATING DOE. NARROW ASS CASA LOMA ASS LOOKIN (if you've ever done that journey to the top) 1905-SECRET-STEPS RESEMBLIN STEPS. NO! Tight short skirts/ dresses, heels, and narrow  steps DO NOT GO TOGETHER. You have to walk by the ENTIRE DINING ROOM to get to the stairs btw. Great architectural planning, Octagon (smh). Anyways, upon entering the otherwise perfectly beautiful establishment, you are immediately welcomed by the owner (methinks). He's possibly the ONLY competent customer service provider on the entire team. A nice small bald man. He takes your jacket off (and on) for you (complimentary coat check). The first thing I noticed after the gorgeous deep mahogany wooden walls, fireplace, framed art, stained glass windows, antique decor, dim lights, and classy ambiance, was the service. We had about 3 waiters assigned to us, and they were absolutely professional...AT FIRST. Lookin' all busy n' shit. They be wipin' down their foreheads, huffin n' puffin all up in my personal bubble in attempt to silently enunciate their strong desire for a generous tip I assume (made me uncomfortable). You're pouring a glass of water, calm yourself. Mind you these waiters are relatively older men, ones who look like they done had their midlife crisis back in the  80's.

Food came, no confusion with orders. Everything cooked to everyone's desired rareness/ tenderness. Maybe a little under-seasoned, but that's okay, it was still good. The food chapter of this evening was smooth sailing and we experienced no problems. JOKES! You know bout that pms doe, it'll seem all proper and shit until it rears its ugly ass head to bite you in the tuchus! The calm before the storm. Ya feel? So, everyone was I guess just about finished eating. EXCEPT, WE WEREN'T. HOW ARE YOU GONNA TAKE AWAY MY MEAL BEFORE I FINISH IT?! HOW ARE YOU STILL EMPLOYED TAKING AWAY A PLATE FULL OF FOOD! BRO. FACEPALM! I actually have no words for you, actually that's a lie, this review is longer than any essay I've written in my university life. And then you have the temerity to say it was an empty plate. I KID YOU NOT, the mans tried to argue with me that there was nothing on the plate. And then he proceeded to tell me that it's on the kitchen table, he will bring it back, that it hasn't been thrown out yet. Are you ready for this next bit? (As if that last statement wasn't messed up enough on its own, bout ""on the kitchen table, bring it back""). THIS GUY BRINGS BACK SOME NEXXX PERSON'S HALF EATEN MEAL. #DEAD. Yelp, I can't even make this shit up if I tried. I was so flabbergasted and shocked, I didn't know how to respond to that. So, I kind of just stood there in silence for a moment with bewilderment in eyes, I straight up looked anencephalic. MY GAWD. Oh yeah, and then they asked us to pay for the meal we never ate (These guys lol). The manager got involved, after 15 infuriating minutes of arguing, they offered a free dessert, I didn't want dessert, so it was finally voided. But in a restaurant as ""reputable"" as The Octagon, who markets themselves a certain way and ensures a ""fine-dining"" experience, I feel like it should've been handled much more professionally, and the problem should've never arisen to begin with. The offer to void the meal should've come from their end without a debate. What kind of business argues with their patrons and shames them?! 

Finally, PAYMENT TIME. Ohhh muhfkn boy! You ready fuhdis? Our bill was $800?-ish. Which is more than reasonable. (BTW, YOU CAN'T SPLIT BILLS HERE, come prepared with cash). We were never made aware of this over the phone, or before eating even (Thanks again!). So our waiter now starts giving us mad attitude. He made it be known he was irritated with us (who fkd up doe? Don't be displacing your anger onto me, I'm the one with an empty stomach). So, I put the bill on my visa, and WOAH, THIS GUY ACTUALLY THREW MY CARD BACK AT ME. LIKE PHYSICALLY THREW MY CARD AT  ME. O___O WHATTT?! WHO THE FF. I SWEAR THAT'S HARASSMENT. Nope, I'm done. My blood pressure is rising, I can feel a hormonal imbalances just now."
2,"2.5 stars.  Maybe.

Maybe I'm spoiled from having just completed a two week stat at a four seasons.  Or maybe this hotel simply isn't that good.  Check in was fine.  Check out was fine.  Room was fair.  Floors kind of dirty and sofa bed as well as king bed were uncomfortable.  Pillows honestly terrible.  Kind of funny when I checked in because front desk person told me I had 'strip view' room...laughable.  The strip is like 5 miles away.  Stratosphere tower looks like tiny miniature model from where the hotel is.  Funny.

Here's the main issue I had...first day we checked in I called and spoke to girl at front desk to request more towels and another bath mat.  She said 'I don't know if we have those.  I'll call you back.'....never called back.  Never got towels.  Don't know if she didn't know what a bath mat was but since there was one in the room, I know the hotel has them.  Anyhow...

Next morning, I left a decent $3 tip for housekeeping along with a note asking for more towels.  This is what I got....beds barely made, dirty floor not cleaned, sofa bed not made and a stack of 5 bath towels (room came with 4 originally) on the counter.  Not put away in proper location, no face towels, typical number of hand towels.  My $3 gone.

Didn't bother to tip after that.

Wifi sucked.  Other than not being able to sign into Hilton honor wifi and not getting any help from girl at front desk was the issue of getting kicked off every day.  Plus the embarrassingly slow speed of the connection when connected.  Girl at front desk told me to just sign into the regular complimentary wifi.  Said it was all the same.  Is it?  Don't know.  Seems redundant to have comp wifi for Hilton honors members if it's the same as the free wifi.  Oh well...

Only other issue for me was airplane noise.  All day.  All night.  Every 10 minutes.  Maybe less.  Location was bad.  Not near anything you'd want to see or do.  Neighborhood a little sketchy.  I certainly wouldn't walk anywhere from this location especially if I was a woman.

Oh.  And I'm a Hilton honors member who paid with my stay with points.  Can't imagine how the other customers are treated and what their rooms looked like.

Won't return and won't recommend."
2,"Update: I called back to schedule another appointment with Jane and was told rather abruptly that she no longer worked there and that this location was not taking appointments because they had no esthetician. It came off as quite sketchy and unprofessional. With multiple locations, I'm surprised there is not adequate staff to cover them in situations like this. In addition, the way it was communicated left me with a lot of questions regarding the turnover. 

I received a nice email last week that they have hired a new esthetician and that she is running a special, but I have decided to go elsewhere for these services."
2,"No longer Todd English.

Most of their menu is gone. 

No raw bar.

No pot pie.

Prices are expensive. 

$20 Ruben was OK.

Service was great but I want more options!

Food was slow to come out when empty.

I was a fan.

Good bye!"
2,"We understand this place has not been open long but there were some things that could definitely use some help. 

The first thing that we experienced was the manager (Sabrina maybe?) at the hostess station who seemed flustered and unprepared to receive customers. She was out at the station but was still taking off her coat and scarf and seemed to be stashing some sort of take out food under the hostess station. When she spoke to us, she was brusque and lacked any sort of warmth. Even when we told her that we had never been there all she offered as information was that they had general seating, hibachi seating, a sushi bar and a regular bar and asked us where we wanted to sit and then handed off a menu so she could take a call. Over all, this was something that kind of lowered our expectations for the experience

We elected to sit in the bar area as we were interested in dishes from two different parts of the menu. The bar top itself is VERY blue and lighted from underneath. Not a bad thing, just something that we weren't expecting. It wasn't really making our experience better since it was so bright so we moved to one of the granite top tables still in the bar area. Oddly enough, the stools/chairs for the granite tables are bolted to the floor so don't worry about scooting in to be closer to the table, you can't! For anyone who is larger, those chairs will not be comfortable because they are very narrow and just close enough to the table to not be comfortable. On the other hand, if you are smaller, still not a comfortable seating situation because you will be too far from the table if you sit in the chair instead of on the edge of it. We shared the Rum Volcano and the chair and table situation made that an interesting experience. The drink itself was very good, just hard to reach. The bartender (Lauren maybe?) was very sweet and took great care of us and mentioned that she takes great pride in her drinks. 

Food was just meh. He had the Sumo Pineapple Fried Rice which was over and under seasoned all at the same time. It had way too much curry powder and turmeric in it, and not nearly enough salt, acid, or cumin in it. I would have even put some pineapple juice in it to help balance out the flavors. The shrimp in it were huge though so that was nice. I had the eel roll and the Alaska roll and the Nagiri octopus sushi. The eel had as many bones in it as I would expect from cheap grocery store sushi rather than a restaurant. The Alaska roll had very uneven distribution of ingredients which made the roll loose and a little difficult to eat. On the bright side, the fish was fresh and cold and did not have any off flavors to it at all. 

At the end of the meal, we asked the hostess if there might be a comment card that we could fill out as we wanted to leave some feedback and we were told adamantly no and then she brushed us off. Instead, when we got our receipt, we wrote some notes on the back of it and handed it to her. Despite the fact that she was not busy (we waited to make sure she didn't have anyone to wait on) she took the notes with a huff and shoved them under the hostess station without even looking at them. The bartender, on the other hand, did listen to our comments and said that she would be happy to relay them to the staff and genuinely seemed to care about the feedback saying that it was important to get feedback to make the restaurant better since they are brand new. 

It seems that the hostess/manager is the biggest let down of the establishment. The rest of it will just take some time to get in to the swing of things. As someone who cooks at home, I know how hard it is to get used to a new kitchen and new recipes and everything else. 

We might be back to try again in about six months, although if the same person is the hostess we might just be walking straight back out, so who knows."
2,"Well, let tell you this is not a typical Hampton Inn.  We arrivè New Years Eve.  I had two rooms.  It was 2:30 am. There was yelling in the hallway.  This went on for 15 minutes.  I called the office, spoke to Andrew.  He sent the van driver up.  The people then moved the noise into their room.  The yelling continue.  I call again.  Nothing changed.  Then the child in the room began yelling and throwing himself against the wall.  I called again.  After 4 phone calls, and 1 and 1/2 hours, they finally stopped.  I told Anrew I was not 100 percent satisfifed.  I then spoek to the cleark in the morning. She ws aware of the ptoblem. ll was offered was ""I'm sorry"". When I checked out on 1/4/14, I expressed my concern and not being satisfied. I has 2 room for 4 nights.  Nothing was offered for my troublem.
Now lets go to the other issues.  Lack of staff.  One kitchen staff.  She was unable to keep the food supplied for breakfast. Trays were empty, and it didn't matter on the tme.  Also hot food was not hot,  and the cold was not cold.
Continue the lack of staff, the bus driver was the plumber, trash collector, the person to take the tree down, stocker of material, cleaner and over all jack of all trades. The plumber we know about was the van driver was the plumber who came to fix the toilet.  There was very little hot water. The water had to run for 20 minutes to get water warm enogh for a shower.  
All I wanted for my trouble was a comp night for one of my room.  Nothing was offered.  I was very disappointed with the poor breakfast offering, lack of hot water, the lack of dealing with unruley guest and the over working of the staff.  If you can, find a new place to stay, until they correct the problems.  If they respnd to me in a positive manner, I will change my review."
2,Our group of eight were not impressed by the hibachi service. I suspect that there was a traveling group of chefs that opened this place to get good reviews and they moved on. Our cook gave a mediocre show at best and did not interact with any of our group. We did see other hibachi shows near us that were much better than ours. The food was actually pretty good but others in my group thought it was bland and flavorless. It was around 25 bucks for steak and scallops so the price was not too bad. This place was very crowed and can probably seat two hundred people at once if needed. Four hibachi bars seat twelve or so  and lots of big tables for the other types of service. When we were there on a Saturday there appeared to be only one bartender and she was trying desperately to keep up. They need more help there. I would say if you want to try it do it on a week night when it's hopefully not so busy. Maybe you will get the A team cook and see a good show rather that the bored B team guy we got. We would not rush back.
2,"Not great quality of sushi. Tiny pieces of fish on top of the ""dragon rolls"" which had maybe one type of fish in them too....and that was it. A ton of rice instead of fish/ veggies in the sushi, the ratio was totally off. The tempura was decent, but again not worth it for Ayce dinner at basically $24 (tax included). Much better places around it. Service was quick, but awful attitude of the waitress which was unsurprising given the reviews. Never going back."
2,"One of the worst companies to deal with.  I have sent emails for the past month concerning problems in
The rental unit. 
I had good people when we were signing the rental agreement.  Been downhill from there. 


Roaches that need an exterminator
Door lock that is broken 
AC that keeps running and froze up last year. 

There is no communication. I guess Our Landlord is not willing to fix anything!  

Renters have no friends!!!

2,"Cute name.  Cute concept.  Had the kung pao noodle dish which was surprising lacking in any pow.  I had to search around for the pieces of chicken.  Still I thought it was good enough to eat - nothing special but not too bad.   

I also ordered the sampler which is a bunch of so called small bites.  I was thinking appetizer but they call you to the counter when everything is done.  

The sampler included cold practically still frozen edamame and a bunch of items that seriously looked like they came straight out of a box from the frozen section in my grocery store.  The partially frozen edamame was pretty much par for the course.  Pun intended."
2,"This salon is so hit and miss but lately it is just going downhill. 

The prices are reasonable for all the services they offer...IF you get good service. It is sometimes very busy but they are typically really good about getting people in and out of there. Maybe to a fault. 

The things I am not thrilled with:
The quality of the nail polish- the last few times I was there a good portion of the polish was very think and the rest had been clearly thinned down. To me, that is just being cheap. You are a nail salon- have decent polish! I brought my niece here to treat her to a pedicure and her polish came completely off the next day. We were not doing anything extravagant- just some shopping- and I looked down and noticed on over half her toes the polish was missing. We looked closely at one of the nails that still had polish and it was all pulling up. My polish was completely chipped. 

Some of the chairs are broken and have been for awhile. 

The techs dress very provocatively. I am not a super conservative person, especially in this Arizona heat- but when I can see all your goods- Im not a fan. I don't care how cute your figure may be, nobody needs to see your ass cheeks hanging out. 

The Vietnamese. I get it. It is very nice to speak in your native language. But it is very rude. Maybe it is a cultural thing? Maybe they are just talking trash about their customers? Regardless, it irritates me. 

I also don't like that nobody ever introduces themselves or wears a name tag. 

All-in-all this salon has all the makings of being a fantastic and very lucrative nail salon. But they have got to quit being cheap with the polishes and broken chairs. They need to tighten up their customer service standards and stop being so complacent about how they treat people."
2,"I called ahead for my order, so that was conveinient. The spring rolls were okay, sadly though they were the best part of the meal.
When I got back to my office with my lunch, they had put so much sauce in the box that it leaked through and I didn't notice until I set the bag of food on my desk. I would highly recommend asking them to double box your order. 

The food was really hot (temperature), which was good, but it was too hot to eat so I had to wait a bit to let it cool. 

It tasted like a whole bunch of salt and squishy bread dough (I ordered noodles). 

It wasn't an altogether terrible rage inducing experience. The staff was nice, the restaurant clean, but if you are wanting asian food. Go somewhere that's worth it."
2,"It's a really good concept but the execution in authentic flavors for each region falls a little short.  Every dish we tried was a bit off.  We had the Indian Butter Chicken, Thai Lemongrass Curry, Samosas (that was probably the best item) and some weird Korean Firecracker Riceball.  (I'm Korean and my Eomma would be like ""what the truck is this?"")  Kind of reminds me of Trader Joe ethnic food but if you like the real, authentic deal then this place is probably not your speed."
2,"TL;dr beautiful interior and good service but this old fashioned establishment is not worth the big bucks.


Service was very attentive but not perfect. Although our orders were written down, the sides were messed up and the servers blamed the food runner on the mistake when it wasn't he who punched in the chit.

I did feel like I was dining in a high end establishment and I appreciated the old school style of the waiters. I never felt like they were 'doing me a favor' by serving me as you sometimes feel at high end restaurants downtown. No chips on shoulders here!

now, the food..

the garlic bread, pickles, olives and hot peppers were very good, but that's not what I'm coming for.

the 18 dollar a person Cesar salad was skillfully prepared but was very bland. it needed some seasoning, whether it be more parmesan or some salt, but maybe they are just staying within the main theme of the food at the octagon, which is that nothing is seasoned.

I'm talking about salt and pepper, flavour enhancer!!

My rib eye was cooked as I had ordered it but it did not see even one fleck of salt before it hit the grill.

aesthetically, grill marks were randomly distributed and it was sitting in a huge puddle of juice, accompanied by the saddest greyish brown mushrooms you've ever seen. the eye of my rib eye was not tender. I've had much better rib eyes at the keg.

my steak was a huge disappointment, especially considering that steaks are their speciality.

I ordered fries hoping for thin, crispy frites but received a pile of unseasoned wavy cut disks of fried frozen potato. I tried the garlic mashed potatoes which were also awful. 

two people with my group ordered the ribs which are probably the best value on the menu. the ribs I tried were well cooked, not the overcooked mush that releases from the bone with no effort that most people seem to think good ribs are like. the only problem was that they were barely sauced. 


with tax and tip, we averaged just under 75 a person which is 50 bucks too much.

I came here 17 years ago for my 13th birthday but I don't foresee myself visiting again in the next 17."
2,"This place is usually very good and not terribly slow, even when busy, but the last two times my fiance and I have ordered from here it has been very slow and the service has been poor.  I attempted to order on Postmates, and I guess I started my order before they flipped the ""too busy"" switch so was a little confused when I wasn't able to complete the order.  Instead, we called in a pick up order and were told the wings would be 30 minutes, which would be alright but I'd rather not wait, so canceled that part of the order.  I wish I wouldn't have, though because the order we went with took longer than that anyway and was of much lower quality than past orders.  Even with the difficult parking we still had to wait a long time once inside for food.  Instead of an apology they just said ""OMG we're busy"" even though it didn't appear to be the case.  This place is usually good but there is way too much good food in Charlotte to deal with that sort of disorganization."
2,"This place is not that great.  Considering Blush is just down the road, Lotus does not even try.  

First, they charge you an extra dollar for using credit.  Barf.
Second, they do not include a hot stone massage with their standard pedi (and it is $32).  
Third, the massage seats were sporadically.

Honestly, the pedicure was just ok.  Another person started before me and finished after me.  I felt like I did not get enough soaking time on my feet and enough massage time.  I would not choose this place over other locations."
2,"I got a mani/pedi and the difference between the manicure and pedicure were night and day. 

I would like to give the pedicure a 4/5 stars - it was relaxing, a calm environment, though some interesting 80's music choices. I had a glass of white wine while I read and had a foot massage and got my toes painted a deep read. The woman was sweet and not chatty and had a pleasant smile. I loved every minute of it. 

I cross to the other side of the wall am greeted by a woman who looks at my choice of nail polish and rolls her eyes - ""do you want a shellac? Because this will come off in 1 day!"" Curious on why they would distribute such an inferior product, I inquire about the price of this and find out its double the cost - a bit outrageous as someone who was just looking to get some relaxation after a Monday at work. She rolls her eyes again as I agree to the ""one day"" manicure, which she reminds me of multiple times. My nails are trimmed speedily and inconsistently. She then asks if I want to pay and I agree that's probably best. She paints my nails sloppily and quickly as there is another woman, a walk in, who wants a shellac. My fingers are stained with polish and she pointedly asks if I would like and eyebrow wax after looking at my eyebrows. 

I'm ushered to the drying area with no goodbye, no offer for any water, or any warm remark. With not much guidance on where or what I was doing, I burn my hand on the black light and leave in frustration as there is no one in a 10 foot radius of me. Looking at my nails now, I think I would rather pay a middle school girl to do a better job. 

The manicure was at best a disappointment. 0/5

TL;DR - I would return for a pedicure, but you couldn't pay me to have a manicure."
2,"Just tried Coaltrane's for the first time and was mildly disappointed. Went on a Tuesday evening around 8:30 and entered the restaurant to be promptly greeted. The setup (and menu) is very similar to Viva Chicken - order up front and the food is brought to you. The atmosphere is much more chic and hip feeling, though quiet the night we went. 

The menu was explained to us and we were informed about beverage options. The downside was that beers were overpriced ($3 for PBR and $6-8 for all others). No drink specials either...even though it was dead inside and mid-week. We decided to sit upstairs on the patio since it was unseasonably warm for a December night. 

Upstairs there is additional inside seating as well as a bar and a few tables outside. The patio had a couple tables with other patrons. The area was nice with a peekaboo view of Uptown. The bartender was vaping behind the bar talking to a fellow employee who seemed to be off duty. There were also several people smoking (including the off duty employee) which made the patio a place we'd probably not go back to in the future. 

The food was really good. It was also very similar to Viva but served in much nicer dishes.  We had a chicken sandwich and a grain bowl. The verde sauce served on the side had really great flavor. I wish it would have come with two small sides of it. 

The main issues for Coaltranes were the higher prices (about $2 more per dish than Viva), the large amount of smokers on the patio and the early closure (the closed sign up at 8:55 when their website and Yelp both say 11 PM). It's a shame because the food was decent and the remodel of the space was borderline amazing compared to what it was beforehand."
2,"Service was efficient and quick.

Fish and chips.   Fish way-way overcooked.  Fries were ok but some crispy and some soggy and overcooked.  One piece of fish for $20 is just sorry even for Vegas.

Great beer selection."
2,This food was just decent. The tacos al pastor we're not traditional al pastor tacos but overall it was decent.
2,"I've been a regular since Wok Box opened this location. The food quality was good when it opened. Now, not so much. 

I've tried several items on the menu and at this point, I'd rather have Panda Express if I'm looking for a fast food option. The meats taste low grade. The orange chicken is flavorless. The Indian butter chicken has way too much sauce.

Today was the final straw. The white rice in my takeout order was so overcooked, it was like eating mashed potatoes. 

Will not be back here again unless they can get their food quality in order."
2,"Walking to this location from Eaton Centre, I worked up quite an appetite for All You Can Eat at $18.99 instead of the A La Carte option.

We were seated right away as I had made reservations in advance. Looking at the menu, there wasn't much selection but I still managed to grab some of my favorites.  
When the food came out, it seems like they got all of our numbering wrong and just gave us everything we ordered but in a portion that would feed the whole table. 

In a way it could be a good thing but not when the table may not be in agreement with some choices. All the meat looked and tasted like it was drenched in sauce and nothing really stood out.

Overall, it was descent for a downtown all you can eat price and it's at a very convenient and accessible location."
2,"Not great and not worth the money. The appliances were leaky. When we asked for fresh towels for the bathroom, housekeeping knocked on the door and dropped off a bag without even folding them and putting them away. The continental breakfast is a joke, they don't even have real milk for the coffee. The pool is not very big. This place is located in a sketchy part of town. The bed was comfortable. The TVs are old and not even flat screens. They said they were going to give up a room with a view of the pool, all we could see are the trees. Do not mistake this place for the Tahiti Village, which is a bit nicer. I would not stay here again. It is way less than average."
2,"While the sales process was good it goes into the toilet after that. Good luck if you decide to get delivery from here!!!! I purchased a refrigerator, stove and microwave on August 9th and we were doing remodeling so I asked for an afternoon delivery on the 16th. (Figured scheduling a week out would be safe for getting a preferred delivery time) So much for that... The salesperson says pick a morning or afternoon delivery; might as well been playing blackjack!!! They call on the morning of the 16th and want to deliver first thing in the morning. Why even offer morning or afternoon if you have no control? People have to work for a living.. Did you forget that??? Way to ruin me and my wife's week! Apparently in talking with my salesperson you have to tell them your refrigerator went out and need it the next morning and that drives their schedule. Wish I wouldn't have bought all what I did from them. I've purchased from many stores; Best Buy, pruitts, room store and never had these problems!!! Knowing what I know now I would have been willing to pay a little more for less hassle..."
2,"This place is good but  is good for very basic stuff  I mean bare bone basics. The Gentleman on the 1st station to the right is fantastic and the best by far. He does great work and is Fantastic. If you can get him the your in for a way better experience (4 out of 5 stars for sure)  but make sure you make an Appointment with him as he books up very fast. His name is Danny. Today I had the lady on the end on the other side, and felt very rushed w/ my nails and her work was far from my mid-range price range expectations. She seem very rushed and almost sloppy just to push people through the line."
2,"Parked my car here. Seems like a nice place but if there's any issue they'll expect you to resolve it and waste your time rather than assume customers are honest. I.e. Didn't accept receipt on my phone, asked for confirmation number so I gave that after waiting on phone 10 mins for it, then they said that wasn't good enough that they needed an email of receipt with confirmation. Idc whose fault it is just don't make me jump through hoops while I'm trying to get to the airport. If my car ends up OK I'll bump up a star. Its better to treat every person with trust rather than everyone like the few dirtbags in the world."
2,There is a manhole in the parking lot that reeks a horrible smell of poo and rot that wafts into the restaurant itself. The waitress seemed overworked. Lack of staffing? I ordered a kale salad. There were a bunch of hard kale stems in the salad and they had what appeared to be mildew on the cut ends of the stems. I picked these out and the rest of the salad was ok. We were all kind of sick from the poo smell outside and at least two of us had rumblies in our tumblies later. I would never go back.
2,I tried to give this place second chance today but I have waited for 10 minutes and I haven`t got my drink. It is really slow to make tea only.
2,"Not a fan of the new renovation. My wife and I came here on every Vegas trip for  the lobster roll and free popcorn. Now no free popcorn anymore, the lobster roll is meh, and the service was super slow. I had the pretzel, that was pretty good but not worth the trouble of going out of our way to come here. Probably won't be back, tried Momkfuku in the Cosmo and that may be the new regular. RIP Todd English P.U.B."
2,"Terrible service!  Was greeted and offered a drink. And then 10 minutes and saw no one!  There were only 5 people in the whole place at 6:30 pm. The tacos were actually pretty good!

The person that I assume is the manager, who greeted us and took our drink orders when I first arrived, and then wasn't seen for the rest of our time there until just before we left. He left a waitress to service both the dining area as well as the drive up window most of the time we were there. He must've seen my initial version of a Yelp review, as he came directly to our table and asked if everything was OK and if we had any issues. He didn't seem to want to take no for an answer to the question. He eventually comped our meal, which was very generous, but too little too late. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. 

I appreciate his interest in trying to make it right, but I left $20 on the table to cover The cost of our two meals. I have bumped up the review to two stars based on his attempt to make things right. However, the service was still poor the majority of the time. Therefore I stand by my initial review.

Next time I'll keep driving and spend my money elsewhere. Wouldn't recommend this place."
2,"As a huge fan of hibachi I had to try Sumo. Was not impressed, the chicken was average at best and the shrimp was awful. The fried rice had little flavor. Awful service as well.
4/10"
2,"The only impressive fact about this place is their Boston Rolls which my husband and I really like. They have a good all you can eat selection, however I am not a fan of their sushi because it doesn't taste fresh and it's cold and dry. A few times I noticed water inside their salad dressing which made the dressing taste horrible."
2,"Come here if you want to be entertained in a beautiful restaurant.  DO NOT come here if you want to enjoy delicious food and good service.

Food: Extremely bland food!  I went with a group of 8 so we were able to try and little bit of everything and all of their dishes were super lame.  The sushi was okay but nothing to brag about.  We had the Sumo Deluxe, Chicken Curry, Steak and Scallop Hibachi, Pineapple Fried Rice, Grilled Squid and more but all of the dishes tasted like canned or frozen Chinese food, seriously.  Their food was very disappointing and our entire party left unstatisfied.  

Service: Our first impression when we arrived was walking past a filthy and trashed VIP room and when we left almost 2 hours later, it was still in its same state.  Maybe because we were a party of 8 and the server knew gratuity was guaranteed but our service was mediocre.  The server took 10 minutes to get us our hot tea and never attempted to clear away any of our empty dishes, they were piling up and it was a mess.  I can't speak for the Hibachi service since we were in one of the party rooms but the party room service was very mediocre.

Atmosphere: Beautiful Japanese themed restaurant with plenty of parking.  Brand new and modern facilities.  Interesting decorations create a fun and inviting experience.

Value: You're paying to be entertained and not for the food here.  Feel free to come here if you're looking to have fun and don't mind eating bland food.  A better value would've been a Trader Joe's frozen dinner and Netflix."
2,"Good at collecting the rent and taking their cut for doing nothing.  I let them rent my house for 2 years.  Wow,  huge mistake.  They are horrible at getting back to owners.  Their maintenance help is very expensive.  The renter trashed the place and OnQ didn't hold back enough of the deposit to pay for everything.  I have tons of repairs that I need to pay for as a result.  Law gives you 15 days to claim and identify all damages but ON Q didnt send their maintenence team out until day 10 - too late with horrible follow up and guidance.  It's been a nightmare.  Thank goodness I got the renter out and reclaimed my property. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.  JUST DO IT YOURSELF.  YOU PAY THEM TO DO NOTHING BUT MESS THINGS UP MORE."
2,"We went on a Saturday during prime breakfast time (10am), so to ask for great service is always a stretch. We had this mentality going in but sadly we were still disappointed. Our waitress was Rosemary and she stopped at our tables only a few times; once to take our order, once to drop off our food, and the last time was to drop off our bill. Other than that we had to either flag her down or just deal with our issues.
A few of those issues included: Cold food (which I noticed was mentioned in other reviews so this Dennys must think it's acceptable), running out of our drinks and not having them refilled a single time during our meal, and having our order messed up.
I wish I could blame this on the restaurant being understaffed or just extremely busy, but sadly it was just poor service."
2,I went with the Kung Pao Chicken today. It was not even close to a spicy dish. I literally couldn't find anything resembling pepper flake. The fresh veggies are nice. But it is far from what I would expect. The other dishes at the table didn't look all that spectacular. My girlfriend didn't eat much of her dish. The lady working out front was very helpful and offered to replace my girlfriend's dish. They get high marks for service but the food just isn't that great.
2,"bad service, the waitresses were rude and ignored us. the food was decent although the sushi did seem a bit unfresh and warm (sushi is typically cold)."
2,"For $20 AYCE, this is pretty good value for money. They have a large selection of sushi and rolls, but very few sashimi options (no tuna; crab stick is not sashimi in my opinion). The problem is that when we ordered a few dishes from the kitchen (tempura, edaname, grilled squid, eggplant, etc.) none of them were good (just salt, grease and sugar) and the waitress brought out a large amount at a time. So for three of us dining, the kitchen staff assumes that we ordered for three, when in fact only one of us wanted an item and marked one (1) in the menu. So we ended up eating more of the greasy food and less sushi. This strategy probably worked in favour of the owner, who may lose money on sashimi. So I recommend communicating clearly with the waiter how much of the non-sushi item you want when marking it on the sheet.  Also, the bathroom could be cleaner."
2,"I'm torn about the proper rating, here, so I'll go with two stars. My night at the Hampton Inn was a roller coaster ride.

After yesterday's debacle with the complimentary hotel shuttle from the airport, the state of the room was a pleasant relief. It was clean, cool and well-prepared. Kudos to Juanita from housekeeping for that.

After a long day of long flights from the East Coast to Las Vegas, I settled in for a very early night. I was actually sleeping by 8:30 pm. However, I was awakened at 10:30 pm by very loud music and talking from the room next door. After 10 minutes of hoping that the noise would die down, I called the front desk. The night clerk sent someone up and the music died down, but only 10 minutes later, the noise started, again. Another call to the front desk resulted in a call and another visit to the room next door, and the noise died down, again. But shortly thereafter, the party continued in the hallway. I waited five minutes hoping that that the party was on its way out, but finally stuck my head out the door. There was a group of well dressed kids with red Solo cups in their hands talking in the hallway. I said, ""Would you please keep it down?"", and someone responded, ""Put a shirt on, dude!"", so I closed the door and called the front desk, again. Thankfully, the third visit from the hotel staff quieted the party down for the rest of the night and I was able to sleep until dawn.

The next morning, I went downstairs and had a hot breakfast that was above-average for a Hampton Inn. While I was eating, I overheard the night clerk at the front desk apologizing to a customer who had given up waiting for the hotel shuttle at the airport the day before and taken a cab to the hotel. The clerk explained that the hotel shuttle had broken down and was out of service for a couple of hours; the van that had picked me up was a replacement. Now, why the day clerk and the van driver couldn't have told me that, instead of lying about ""bad traffic"" due to non-existent construction and an imaginary accident is beyond me.

As I was walking to the front door past the front desk, I overheard the night clerk tell the day clerk as they changed shifts, ""If the guy in Room 318 calls to complain, apologize for the service."" So, I stopped and said, ""I'M the guy in Room 318!"", to which he replied, ""Sorry, man, your stay last night is on the house.""

FINALLY, an acknowledgment of the poor service and an apology from one of the hotel staff!

Now, while I can't fault the hotel staff for the rudeness of the customers in the room next door to mine, I DO fault the day clerk and replacement van driver for lying to me about the shuttle. If they had simply told the truth and set a proper expectation about the delay in picking me up at the airport, I would have had no complaints at all about the hotel staff. Hopefully, they'll exercise candor in the future.

If you stay at this hotel, request a room as far away from the elevators as you can get. It's noisy there. Ding! Ding!"
2,Great food. Terrible delivery. My order is 45 minutes late and the driver has gone to the farthest locations to deliver when I live only a two minute drive from this location. My food is cold and I am very frustrated/disappointed
2,"We stayed here for a week for our anniversary. The hotel was nice, a lot better then we were expecting. We are a timeshare owner and were staying here with our bonus time. We thought we had booked at Tahiti village.. and were excited because of the pool. We were bummed when we realized we had booked the wrong hotel but we went with an open mind. The pool was not really that great. It was small and not that fun.

We enjoyed the room, there is nothing really bad to say about the hotel besides that it was far from the strip. Taking the shuttle was a pain. You had to plan your day around taking it and making sure it was going to the right end of the strip.

One thing that was VERY annoying was we booked a shuttle to Fremont street at the hotel. The lady at the hotel forgot to reserve our seat on the shuttle.We had a show at 6:30 and she said if we took the 6pm shuttle we would be there in plenty of time. At 6:18 we still had not been picked up. The hotel said to pay for a taxi and we would be reimbursed. Well we asked for the manager to call us, I left a VM and still no call back. We are out the $30 for the taxi...

But only $250 for a whole week to stay I guess you cant beat that. But I would never stay here again. Too far from the strip. I will stay at the Marriott on the strip next time with my bonus week."
2,"Extremely unimpressed with the customer service at Spencer's. My husband and I just bought our first house so we went in to Spencer's looking for updated appliances. The salesperson in the store was very nice and got us what we wanted which was nice. Everything after the purchasing has been a nightmare. Our delivery guy was over an hour late to dropping off our appliances (didn't get to our house until after 7pm), he was very unprofessional, we asked him to unbox the appliances and haul the boxes away and he just opened them for us, which we could have done ourselves obviously. And to top it all off, our range was apparently damaged and wasn't delivered with everything else, which we weren't informed of until the delivery guy was at our house with everything else. I called to talk to someone about our experience (and find out when we're getting our range) and I informed the man on the phone of everything that happened and he seemed unbothered whatsoever and did nothing to help the situation. Needless to say, once we get our range we're never doing business with Spencer's again."
2,"I think the quality of food has changed over the time. It was good in the past, apart of that they are not good in serving the proper order. I ordered ""Arizona Chicken Burrito"" and what I got was beef Burrito, other time I ordered same and there were pieces of beef in chicken burrito. I'll avoid to go there."
2,"The room, facility, and price/value were solid.  Their processes or info systems, however, are disastrous.  It literally took them 30 minutes to simply check us in, with just 3 guests in front of me in line when I arrived.  After that 30 minute wait, the room they assigned hadn't even been cleaned and was somehow mis-communicated by housekeeping.  Another poor process is they send you to the concierge for a parking pass, after the impossible check-in process completes.  Good grief..."
2,"This was our go to steakhouse!!! When in the city  Until tonight!!!  Cesar salad for two was way to sour!!  Not enough anchovies and garlic.  The garlic bread was just toasted bread, with no taste!  I ordered my favorite Prime Rib, and it was awful!  Dry, tasteless, and no au jus.  I ordered medium rare, and got medium!  We were also rushed to complete our meal, so that they may turn the table, for more profit.  All in all a real disappointment!!  Too bad!!!"
2,Food quality is the same as the other locations but the portion sizes on some item's are smaller at this location.  Normally I just order 3 dishes as that's sufficient enough and usually have leftovers. Not this time. Won't be coming back to this location.
2,"My last review I gave a 2 star and this updated review it still gets a 2 star. Horrible service and slow. Server only came to the table once. There was only 4 tables seated and it was 8:30p on a Friday night. It took forever to get the server so that I could get a to-go box and check. I would complain to the manager but she was busy looking up things on social media. I went to try to pay and the manager slowly walks up with her face focused on her phone. The only reason this place gets a 2 star is because of the price of the $2,4,6,8 deal and the staff was friendly. I really wish someone higher up would read this and fix the problem here"
2,"Horrible check in procedure.

Attitude of front desk receptionist was unfriendly. 

We arrived at 3 am in the morning. The receptionist cannot find our reservation through booking.com and would not accept the online reservation screen shot showing confirmation reference.  We asked to be check in first and clarify the following morning as it was almost 4 am.  She insisted to have an email or fax from booking.com or she has to charge full rate for without reservation. 

We made an international phone call to booking.com which confirmed there is nothing wrong at their end but they are willing and sent a confirmation email to the receptionist. Email arrived but the receptionist cannot read some Chinese even though the confirmation number is English. We called again. An English version confirmation finally arrived, and it looks similar to the screen shot that we showed to the receptionist. 
Now the receptionist has to consult an off site supervisor as they still cannot locate the reservation in their system or don't know what to do. 

Finally we got our room key and it was already 5 am in the morning. With the room card, we entered the room just to find out it was occupied. 

Shocked, we quickly exit. A tall African American guest came out and questioned us. Embarrassed and horrified, we apologized and reported to the front desk. With no explanation, we were upgraded from a studio to a single room for our entire 9 days stay. It was already 5:30 am in the morning when our tired body and heavy luggage found our new room.

The room was clean and came with a spacious kitchen, sitting room and good size bathroom together with washer dryer combo including detergent.  

Breakfast is complimentary and basically its just bagel, toast, muffin, coffee, milk, chocolate, tea, banana and oranges etc. No scrambled egg or bacon.

House keeping/cleaning is once if you stay over a week.  It never came, and you have to call and talk to the front desk again and again to remind them if you need the service.  The service came almost at the end of our stay.

Check out time is 10 am and we requested late check out.  You can have a late check out at 11 am.  They charge a nominal fee after 11 am, and charge again if you check out after 12 noon, and again if past 12.30. When we check out, we explain our whole ordeal and the manager gave a 50% discount on the resort fee.

The standard operating procedure should be revised along with better trained front desk personnel to welcome guests."
2,"Average food, but expensive - with a side of attitude

I remember when going to the Octagon was a great treat. No more. Now they offer only mediocre food and pompous, ""we're doing you a favour"" service. To start, we sat there for 20-30 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order.The restaurant was not that full
I went there with 2 friends and we asked for separate cheques. ""My boss won't let me do that"", came the reply. That request has never been a problem at any other restaurant -- fine dining or otherwise. Is it really that hard keeping 3 tabs? So much for customer service. One of us ordered a bottle of wine and we got billed for another bottle at twice the price. Honest mistake? Maybe. The food? Just ""ok""

Bottom line: The food used to be terrific. No more. The service used to be good. No more. The prices, while always high, were easier to justify when the dining experience was better. And I think prices were recently raised. Other reviewers mention a caesar salad at $14.95 per person. When we went in June it was $17.95

We won't be going back"
2,"Not so impressed with this particular Hampton. I usually really enjoy them. However, when I checked in I went to my room, and the inside lock was engaged. So I knock on the door and there was already someone occupying the room. Ouch!

Back downstairs and the staff was accommodating. So I go to sleep and need to get up super-early for a flight. My wake-up call never happened, I couldn't find the coffee pot and when I finally did (located on an inset shelf in the bathroom BEHIND the door, they only had decaf available. What?

All-in-all I'm happy I had a place to lay my head--and it was a comfortable bed--but I've stayed at Hampton Inn's before where I had a much more enjoyable experience."
2,"I used to love this place but it seems the cooks have all been replaced and the recipe has taken a complete redo because the dish that I get routinely has changed now for the past 2 weeks. My husband got very sick from the garlic sauce, I'm eating mine now I tried to have it on the side but it's extremely salty now and there must be a different seasoning added in because it's making me puke
Just be aware that your not alone if you think it taste different. It's changed and it's no longer what I will be consuming twice a week when I'm in east liberty area. 

I DID enjoy honeygrow for a long time until now. 

Whatever they changed- they need to re-evaluate the ingredients. We don't eat meat so we know it's not about bacteria (hopefully they aren't cross contaminated cooks- I don't believe that of them but if this is your business, I would strongly advice looking into it making sure the products being used are right)"
2,"UUGGHHH! $2.25 for coffee? I should have gone to starbucks. I needed a table to fill out some paperwork and I did not want to sit in the car (but I should have)..
My waitress was very nice, but this place is uh, dirty.. The blinds look like they have not been cleaned in FOREVER!!
If I were eating there (never) I would have been more than a little freaked out.
Yes it is a chain, so no points there, it is the same as the last time I had the misfortune of being in a Dennys..."
2,"I have to agree with everyone else, the revamped of this place is a flop. The fried pickles were made with what tasted like bread and butter pickles which made for a disgusting sweetness to the app. The Reuben was filled with 90% meat, less than 2 tbsp of sauerkraut, overall it was very unappetizing. I used to look forward to Todd English PUB for every trip to Vegas, now I wouldn't bother coming back here again. Boo!"
2,"Wok Box is a wonderful idea, in theory. The restaurant itself is very clean and hip looking. We decided to try it out for a healthier option other than the next door and very delicious burger option. I will say the portions are a good size and one noodle bowl can feed two. Anyhow, the noodles my husband ordered were very thin and tasted like top ramen. Top Ramen would have more flavor, though. My dish came with Udon noodles, which is a better option. The teriyaki chicken came with an odd combination of vegetables that did not taste good with the flavorless sauce. The biggest issue with both items was the large amount of flavorless liquid swirling around in each dish. Even though the teriyaki chicken should have a different flavor profile than the plum sauce dish my husband had, they tasted the same. Bleh."
2,"Ordered online for pickup at 7. I got the spicy garlic chicken, wife had the fall salad. We also ordered focaccia and a juice.  There isn't a specific place for online order pickup. I asked the ""cashier"" about my order and she said it wasn't ready. 

I watched people come in off the street and place orders and get them before us. I waited till 7pm before asking about our order again. This time the worker simply dismissed me since she hadn't called out any orders. At this point it's been over a half hour since we ordered online. A couple minutes later to her credit she asked me what my order number was, it was done and had been sitting on the back shelf for maybe 10 mins.  She hands it over but forgets the focaccia and drink. I remembered the drink (because it was $6, hard to forget). But I also forgot about the focaccia. 

Wife's salad looked awesome though. They forgot onions on mine but it was good, even if a little cold. 

I recommend ordering in person, and sticking with the salads."
2,"I grew up in the area. The first time I went to The Octagon restaurant, I was probably 5-6 years old. My parents went every 2 weeks for many years (until I was in my late teens). I used to LOVE The Octagon, I always recommended it to anyone who was looking for delicious ribs, steak etc. I was there 2 weeks ago for lunch. Probably my first time in 5 years. I feel like there is so much more hype to the name now then there should be for the food. 

Service - walked in and got a bit of attitude. No ""how are you doing this evening"". We were seated in a very dark part of the restaurant (you would need a flashlight to read the menu).  They like to cater to larger groups & the business lunch clientele first. We had to flag down our waiter to ask for everything - water, wine, coffee, more garlic bread, our bill etc. Surprised at the service considering the fact that there were many familiar faces - most of them have worked there for almost 20 years. 

Food - dated plating - nothing visually appealing about it. 

Steak neptune - no seasoning on the steak. Hollandaise was bland and clumpy and clearly placed under a broiler because the top of my food was brown not the colour of the hollandaise. 

French onion soup - same bowls from 20 years ago - very little onions, cheese or bread - too much pepper in the broth

Chicken neptune - zero seasoning on the chicken - hollandaise was the same clumpy cold sauce as the steak neptune. No flavour - only highlight of this dish was the amount of crab meat

Shrimp cocktail - overpriced - yes they are large BUT 5-6 years ago they were much bigger for around the same price.

Caesar salad - way TOO much cheese - they don't make them like they used to. Yes it's nice that they make it at the table, but that doesn't make it taste better - big disappointment for me overall.

Garlic bread - burnt on one side - but it was still put in a basket and brought to our table.

This place is certainly not up to par with some of the other great steakhouses (Barberian's, Hy's, Morton's etc.) They need an update out of the 80's for decor and with the amount of lights all over the place a bit brighter especially at lunch would help.

Not sure if i would go back or recommend to any family/friends anymore."
2,"This is a chain restaurant - my food was not very good, the blue crab sushi was very bready and the pad Thai smelled off, like the sauce was something premade full of chemicals. I'm never going back"
2,"This place is okay but their other location is better in food quality and service. I will be reviewing their buffet

The sushi buffet doesnt always have a sushi item you want and the fish itself isnt always fresh. They always seem to be out of salmon skin handrolls when I eat their buffet (and I have literally been to this place for their buffet more than 5 times). In addition, the sauce they use to spice up the handroll or sushi gets boring and stale after used in more than one sushi item (Spicy California roll, various handrolls, and sushi pizza). The non-sushi items in the buffet do not taste good: the sweet and sour chicken is drenched in sour sauce (the same sauce used to drench the spring rolls) and dumplings are bland. 

As for the service, the staff look miserable and unfriendly. The food doesnt necessarily come when you mark it down, or in a timely manner. We got explicitly scoffed at by the manager because we gave them a smaller tip as a result of the crappy service. If smaller tips are not indicative to staff of a needed change in customer service standards, then its no wonder the buffet has yet to improve over the months.

For such an expensive buffet, there are other sushi places to spend your money on (such as their other location). 

Only good point is the convenient location."
2,"It's ok if you want to stuff your face with a lot of rice.  We were there at 4 pm and missed the lunch price.   The all-you can eat dinner deal is over $20, and is not really that much of a deal.   Sushi pizza was deep fried and greasy.  You can get better sushi rolls at the foodcourt.  I won't be back."
2,"This is my second purchase from Spencer's. First time was kitchen appliances. Second time was a new washing machine. Their prices are good, in-store service is so so.. First time their installer never made a air gap for my dishwasher. Without an air gap you can destroy a dishwasher in one week. Luckily I seen it before it was too late. This time I was promised delivery today with a call this morning between 7-10 to set up a time. NO CALL. I called the store and the sales idiot never submitted the delivery yesterday. Why is it we just can't get something done right the first time these days. Why is it sooooo hard?"
2,"We spent one night here to be near the airport. We probably should have just stayed at the airport. Hate to be negative, but our room, while quite clean, was on the small side and noisy. Not only did we hear others in adjoining rooms but there was a mechanical noise in our bathroom that couldn't be stopped. It was, however, drowned out by the noise of the AC, so there's that. The front desk personnel were very nice, check out and in went smoothly. Not a ghastly stay by any means, but we've visited many better Hamptons. By the way, there are no restaurants or anything else nearby, so you'll need your car or a taxi to get a meal. The Hampton does operate an airport shuttle every half hour."
2,"We arrived pretty late - I called in earlier letting them know and it was no problem. We walked through the door and they had our key ready to go. It was the best part of our travels to Vegas especially after our flight being delayed and having issues with renting a car. Breakfast was delicious and the beds were comfortable. 

One of our friends forgot her belongings at the hotel - she noticed and called the hotel before they even started cleaning the room. They said they'd keep an eye out. She received a phone call later saying that they had her belongings and we were going to pick them up before our flight back home. On our drive to Vegas, my friend called again to confirm that they had her belongings and to let them know we'll be there soon to pick them up. Apparently, they did not have her belongings and they made a mistake with their earlier phone call. They meant to call someone else. We arrived at the hotel and no one knew what we were talking about - there was a lack of communication on their end and we were extremely frustrated because of it. They said they'd check again and call the next day. In the end, they didn't have my friends belongings - they said they checked security cameras and also always check housekeepers purses before they leave. My friend arrived in the clothes she forgot to the hotel and they weren't with any of us or in our rental car - they only place they could have been was in the hotel. My friend shouldn't have forgotten her clothes, but mistakes happen. What shouldn't happen is people stealing those belongings. I'm sure housekeepers have found a way around the security cameras and purse checks and the clothes are long gone. But keep an eye out and don't forget your things here."
2,"Room is nice, it has everything you want,  just need a good customer service,  we only stayed one night,  but I felt like they only wants us to stay for 12 hours, they check us in late because room is not ready, and called at 10 asking if we're checking out,  kind of feel like they're kicking us out for overstaying,  probably not going back unless they have a good sale....pricey too.."
2,"This place is not the same since they changed hands. Expect a wait. They dont have enough help and the woman ""manager"" is downright rude.  Zero customer service. The only reason it isn't one star is because the gal who gave me a pedicure was very nice. Never did get my nails done."
2,"It's not our first visit - but for sure the most disappointed one. 
We did not got chopsticks. 
We did not got small plats do we can eat somehow. 
We did not got small containers for soy sauce. 
We did not get drink refill
By mistake - they charge my Amex with over $130....they fix the mistakeWITHOUT TELLING ME!!!

What is wrong with this servers??"
2,"This place has awesome deals but you get what you pay for. 
I must preface that I am very picky about my brows as they are very dark and prominent on my face. It seems difficult to find someone who can do a decent job shaping them.
I had been going to get my brows threaded here for the about a year and usually got the same girl to thread. I had been trying to grow back the end of my eyebrow that had been waxed off by a bad waxer. I pointed out that I would like her let that end grow in. Once it had filled in I thought I didn't need to point out how to do my brow anymore since I had seen her pretty regularly and had told her to leave it each time. Once that spot had filled in she threaded that spot again removing all the hairs that had taken so long to grow back. I guess it was my mistake for not saying something but thought after all this time that she would know. Also the spot she removed made my eyebrows uneven, you can tell just by looking. I would rather pay someone more who is experienced with shaping brows and not just threading and pulling willy nilly without looking at the shape and trying to match the brows."
2,"Not a good morning for Ricardo and the cook. As seems to be the case at many Mexican quickie joints they use french fries in the breakfast burrito, but they fail to deep fry them enough. The result was uncooked raw fries and a mess of a morning and the loss of seven bucks.

This place also can't stop raising prices. The last menu I had at my house indicated prices about a buck less than the new menu. So we have higher prices, same quality food, but they do make a decent hot carrot.  Will add hash browns next time as those seem easier to cook for the ""chefs"" at Roberto's."
2,"It was... OK. I would give it 1 star had it not been for the excellent customer service and nice atmosphere. Food was so so. Not authentic asian. I was happy with the large portion of noodles, but the veggies and tofu was lacking, same with the sauce. It seemed there was no sauce. And it was supposedly a spicy option. :(  So over all, judging the food, I was disappointed. Also I ordered spring rolls to go with my order, and for $15 bucks, I get plain noodles and super basic spring rolls that were over priced. I'd rather just go to a real Thai/Vietnamese place. Sorry. I'm over the Caucasian catered Asian restaurants in this area. I want some real Asian food, with more veggie options as I'm used to getting in Los Angeles and Hawaii."
2,"The staff was friendly and the place looks clean but food was pretty bad.

The place looks like your typical fast casual franchise. It has a well thought out design and it is clean but it certainly feels a bit hollow and fake. 

The food was pretty bad considering the prices were on par with a standard sit down restaurant. The teriyaki sauce was watered down and extremely sweet (to the point of being sugary). The chow mein noodles lacked any real flavor. The meat was about the same quality you would expect from taco bell and the veggies certainly were not fresh.

Bottom line if you are starving I suppose you can eat here but this is just another mediocre chain in a sea of chain ""restaurants."""
2,"The decor is nice and that's about the only highlight of the meal. There are lots of congee places in the GTA and this place easily has the best decor for a congee place. Unfortunately, I thought the food was just so-so.

I know most places put MSG in their congee. This place is no different. But they seemed to have put EXTRA MSG because I felt super tired and thirsty after the meal. On top of that, I felt they were being a little cheap with the ingredients. There were only 2 shrimps in the bowl. Relative to other congee places I've been to, they put more ""cheap"" ingredients. 

We also ordered a fried rice and a fried noodles (soy sauce beef noodle). Nothing noteworthy. They were about comparable to other Chinese places.

With nothing special about their food and a sub-par congee, their prices are about 10-20% higher than the regular congee places. So you're basically paying for the decor. I know Chinese places often don't have the best decor (by western standards anyways). If having nice decor is important to you, then I suppose you can make a case for Congee Queen. If you want average or better Chinese food, you need to look elsewhere."
2,"Thought I'd give this new place a try located across the street from Target. I've driven by before and it looked new and hip.
I must say I'd rather go to Panda Express than eat here and I don't go to Panda Express anymore.
The food is cooked by amateurs. I ordered the Dan Dan noodles that come extra spicy. All the spice really is, is Sambal sauce. Like scoops of it. If I wanted noodles with Sambal sauce I could have made my own at home and it would have tasted 10 times better."
2,"I have heard about this place with mixed reviews for years now, and we had a client coming from out of town and why not go to give it a try.

We reviews are always trying to be as positive as possible giving my opinion on what was good and bad. 

This place is priced high, it's getting old but has a high class feel which can feel sophisticated. 

Service is plenty because it was Sunday night so we were treated with a lot of attention, the starters are great: garlic toast, olives and pickles 

Here's a crap story that can turn off a lot of people but the real truth, "" there was a hair in the ceasar salad they prepared at our table, and our guests pulled it out of his mouth"" ugly truth.

The steak are priced high but very good, 
The ribs that I had were under average, not off the bone, not juicy or saucy... Disappointing  

All in all we had a unlucky night with a high bill so it's not possible to give a high rating hopefully you don't get unlucky when you go !!!!!"
2,Not too impressed. The service was slow during lunch hour where most people would be rushing. The servers were really nice but not too attentive. They didnt have spider roll that was on the menu which was a huge dissapointment.  Was not the best visit.
2,The worse place I ever stayed in Vegas! Didn't clean the room regularly. Gave me a smoking room without my acknowledgment.
2,So I been wanting to try this place for some time I went there today and to be honest I'm on the fence about coming back I ordered the stuff avocado and street corn casserole the food was pretty tasty a lil bland for me but tasty my issue with this place was the lack luster customer service and the fact that I had a 40min wait for something I ordered to go I was very annoyed but here's the kicker I ordered a drink when I went to refill it before I left there was mosquito in my cup not sure how it got there or when but I noticed it half way through my drink I ask for the manager one of the team members takes my drink to the manager and I honestly didn't feel any since of urgency or remorse all I got was a new cup and a $5 off my next trip no refund no free dessert no apology nobody stopped to check the ice machine or anything that didn't sit well with me
2,"Updating my review here! Unfortunately it's bad news.

I've been slowly coming less and less here. I've been on two dates here for dinner service (normal menu) and although the dates were months apart, and I bought two completely different dishes, I was up all night SICK. Like, throwing up sick.

Today I came back for AYCE, which is my favourite thing to do at this location for lunch.

I crave their green salad, but today it tasted sour and was much more watery than usual. I found some lettuce that had brown spots and other large bits didn't seemed to be washed. I ate it to be polite but it was super off putting.

The shrimp tempura in my roll was soft and rubbery. Like eating a sponge almost :( it also had a strange taste but I don't know if it was because of the salad prior.

Everything else I had was fine, other than the chicken teriyaki, which was tasteless and basically weird fatty bits. Like all of the pieces from the chicken you don't want.

They have changed the seats in here though, as before they had seen better days. I have no complaints about the wait staff because they are always pleasant to me. Shame about the food quality, I will not be coming back."
2,"Not impressed. 

Service was very slow on a night when we were sat immediately. Everything seemed to be very overpriced, for marginal food, at best. We ordered 2 appetizers, a hibachi dinner and sushi, so I felt like we tried a vast array of their offerings.

Will not return with better, more reasonably priced options in town."
2,This place is not a place I would recommend at all...  Tahiti village is much better. Or any other hotel. This place just feels run down and staying here made me feel like everything was dirty. The condition of the beds are bad and not comfortable. The good thing is that this place is close to the strip and that's it.
2,"The girls who thread eyebrows here are absolutely AMAZING! I've never had a bad experience with threading here.

However, I had a TERRIBLE experience with the Lash Plus lashes and will never be getting them done here again. They weren't applied very well (you could see the glue along my lash line) and half of them fell out within a day. I was never given after care instructions nor really told how to care for them at all. The esthetician just told me not to use oil based makeup or face wash. The day after I had these eyelashes applied, I called the salon to see if I could have them fixed. The esthetician said that she couldn't get me an appointment until Tuesday (it was Saturday). I called the Whitehall location and the esthetician there said that she could see me right away. When I got to the Whitehall location, I was told that ALL of the lashes would have to be removed and I'd have to get them completely redone. Instead, I just had them all removed. 

I sent an email to management and was pleased that they responded; however, the owner, who said that he would be calling me, never did. I would've liked for the tip that I gave to the esthetician at the East Blvd location to be transferred to the esthetician who helped me at the Whitehall location. I'm sad to say I'm disappointed with the service I received from the salon."
2,"Not bad for an AYCE sushi joint. The selection is fair and price is average ($20.99 on Fri-Sun dinner) but food poor.  I found the fish:rice a little too much and food was on the bland side. 

Liked:
- Shrimp & calamari tempura
- BBQ eel (unagi) sushi
- Volcano roll
- Spicy salmon sushi
- Butter fish sashimi
- Red tuna sushi

Disliked:
- Yakitori (it was a large piece of dried out chicken deep fried)
- Snapper and salmon sashimi (bland)
- Steak teriyaki (chewy and dry)
- Selection of rolls (almost 90% of the rolls consisted of tempura bits)
- Agedashi tofu (cold and tasted weird)
- Salmon teriyaki (they only had the neck & belly)
- Udon (not the Japanese ones so very hard)
- Soy sauce (Worst part of my experience. They use the cheap Chinese brands so it's salty as ever. It made everything taste bad!!!)

Unlikely to return!"
2,First time I have ever been hungry after eating five rolled tacos.  Their rolled tacos are half the size of what are normally served everywhere else but they still charge the same amount.  The lettuce was welted and the amount of guacamole they give you is a joke. The only redeeming part of this place is the hot sauce. The hot verde sauce was very good but it's not worth going back for.
2,"The only reason I ever come to this place is because it is the closest to my home. It's good when you're in a hurry but not so good if you want a good job done. Every single time I come here the ladies rush even when it's not even busy. Today I took my daughter to get a manicure and pedicure, polish only, and the ladies were very rude to her. The one doing her nails was pretty rough with her, jerking her arms and legs whenever she needed her to move. My daughter was a little sad after we left and it was not a very good experience. The pedicures are OK at best,  I don't usually get manicures but I have heard other customers complaining while paying that the job is not what they expected. Today's visit was my last, I will not return. I would not recommend to anyone."
2,"I went this afternoon for a call in order. I ordered a standard taco with steak, no lettuce, and a build your own burger....The Kahuna, build your own burger, grilled onions only. Food was ready when I arrived. The taco was very good....filled with steak, I mean loaded with steak! The fries were awful! The burger was a bit overcooked, very dry, and for the $0.50 I paid for grilled onions ONLY on the burger, I got maybe about 20 pieces max of chopped grilled onions on my burger. WTF?? When you order a burger with grilled onions only, you'd expect a good amount of grilled onions on it. Not the case here. If I go back, I won't be ordering burgers. The taco & customer service were good, but the lack of onions on my burger was pathetic. That burger should have been smothered in grilled onions!! From now on I'll get my burgers at In ""N"" Out burger, where the burgers & fries are consistently good! Get a clue Jimmy Hulas!! You will be out of business soon, like so many other mediocre places in Tempe."
2,"I've had most of the menu now, but won't be going back anymore.  The ingredients appear great, and taste really good, it's just unfortunate they do not cook things enough to make them hot.  The past couple times I've been there my dinner was barely luke warm."
2,"I asked for them to cut off 2 inches. At the end of my haircut she let me know she cut off about 3 inches. Although it doesn't sound like much of a difference, I have curly hair so it makes a big difference. Paid almost $50 for something I did not ask for. Other than that, it was a very nice salon and everyone was friendly."
2,"Very disappointed.  Asked if I could get my bowl without the sauce, came with the sauce. Husband was done eating by the time my 2nd bowl arrived.
You do not get much for your money. Not sure we will go back."
2,"This place was clean, had a good range of food and fast service. I ordered the carne asada fries today and there was refried beans served in there... I've been to enough places and I've never had it with it. It was kinda weird but for me I was not a big fan. The meat was dry and chewy. Not the best but it's alright"
2,"Just got done dining here and felt compelled to write a review. The food is okay, but wasn't enough to compensate for the poor service we received. We asked for water (something so basic) multiple times and finally got it when we were halfway through our meals. The wait for utensils was also ridiculous. It wasnt even as if they had chopsticks at the table and we were waiting for forks. They had nothing. When our sushi came, we realized our soy sauce bottle was empty; took forever to get soy sauce. Asked for extra ginger when the sushi got there and it came at the end of our meal when there was nothing left to eat said ginger with. Service was poorly orchestrated & made what would have otherwise been a good meal, horrible. 

Waitress brought over the check; must have then heard us complaining about the service because she brought ANOTHER check with 18% gratuity added and then proceeded to say we couldnt pay at the table and must pay up front, where no one was available to take our payment. Mind you, there was someone there -  they just couldn't take our payment. When we're about ready to just walk out, our server comes, we give her the check with no gratuity added and she still puts it through with gratuity. Whatever. 

If you're hangry, this is not for you. The wait is ridiculous and who knows what order you'll receive anything in. Food is good; ultimately not worth the hassle."
2,"I visited this salon yesterday and just asked for a simple cut. My stylist barely talked to me after I showed her the picture of what I wanted and didn't have a friendly attitude. The whole experience took about 20 minutes and I was charged $75! For a super simple cut I could've gotten at Super Cuts! They did give me a glass of wine and a little bag of samples when I left, but I was not impressed with the experience or the price tag at this place."
2,"Upset about this place. The hair color and cut I received were perfect. The only complaint I have is the wait time I've had 2 times when I've made appointments. The first appointment I had I showed up 10 minutes early. I didn't get seen until 15 minutes after my scheduled time. Since I was happy with the cut and color I decided to go back for my follow up appointment. I arrived on time, checked in and received a glass of wine. 25 minutes had passed my appointment time. No one said anything to me as I watched clientd arrive after me and get seen before me. I decided to leave without saying anything as I will not be going back. It took them 45 minutes after my scheduled appointment to realize I was gone and to call me.  Very upset."
2,"The correct address is 20020 N. 59TH AVE .

I note this place is very new and still working things out and has potential so it's worth a try.

We tried several things here and I think some things are better than others.

From what I tried on my visit I think the Beef Asada and the Chile Verde are much better than the fish here. The meats were flavorful but terribly dry when we were here.  The fish from the fish tacos might have been a frozen product that had little flavor and it was kind of dry for fish.

They have a selection of house made sauces and a few condiments to add to your dish.

Customer service is not the best.

I ordered a side of Hot Carrots (.99 cents) before I noticed they are a free condiment. They should have told me it was on the sauce bar. But it made me a little more mad when the woman working there runs me an empty cup and tells me to fill it up myself from the freebie bar. If they are on freebie bar why charge me???? 


Like I already said they are new and still working things out hope your visit is better."
2,"Why they decided to open a Congee Queen here that is a stones throw away from the one at Steeles and Don Mills is beyond me. If they really felt like it could be a contender, I've got some news - it's not. The place is crowded beyond belief, and our party of 13 was just three small round tables pulled together side by side. It was like we were ""dap toi"" (sharing a table with separate bills), extremely uncomfortable and tight and so noisy that we couldn't hear the conversation two persons over. 

The food was passable, but not up to the quality of other Congee Queens I've eaten at (4 in total now). I don't even feel like recommending any of the dishes. If you're absolutely desperate for a congee fix, this is doable - but I'd suggest you drive the extra 10  minutes to go to the next closest one."
2,"Terrible experience, it took 3 hours for regular mani and pedi, the lady that took care of me acted very rude and my friend had a bad experience as well, Madison must have a better place"
2,"I have been to Lotus a few times for both a manicure and a pedicure. I found my first few experiences when they first opened relaxing and enjoyable. Since then they have gotten much more busier and my experience of just lately is rushed and unenjoyable. I got a basic manicure this time and it was all of 15 minutes. The woman who was helping me, kept looking up at the incoming clients as she was clipping my cuticles. I know she was in a hurry with the wait list being so long, however I had made an appointment prior to going in. My polish was hurled and put on very uneven and sloppy. I was told to dry my nails and she finished my top coat in between drying while in the dark. Meanwhile 2 woman next to me who came in around the same time as I did, got sick of waiting, for over 30 mins and decided to just leave. I feel its very unprofessional to hurry a client through and to answer phones while in the middle of a treatment with a client. I am very unimpressed and will go back to my other place of service, even if it means a longer drive."
2,"UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP. I used to come here a lot when I lived in this area, and I loved this place! I moved away but came here today for the first time in a few years. I could immediately tell it was under new ownership. Everything looks dirty and worn out (all the chairs, the massage controls, etc), and the chair I was put in had a broken back! When I asked if the chair was broken, I was given a pillow instead of moved to a working chair. They have way fewer nail color choices, and I'm pretty sure they water down some of the colors (I first chose a color I know I've used before, but when she started painting my nails it came out really really light and I had to choose another color). The pedicure itself was decent, but I can get a decent pedicure anywhere for a similar price. Sadly, I will not be returning to this shop the next time I'm in this area."
2,"I go to a lot of nail salons and this one is okay. The place is nice and the people try to be friendly. I made an appointment with my friend to get manis and we sat waiting to be helped for a good 30 minutes and when we did they decided my friend and I would be helped by one person..? Huh? So it took 2 hours to get through 2 manis. Also they don't listen to your requests. I asked for pointed nails and they just said no it looks better square.. Which has never happend to me before. My nails were often left lop-sided and misshapen too, and when I pointed it out they would either act really irritated and kind of fix it or just pretend they didn't hear me. They also cut my finger tips and burn them when I get acrylics and it happens every single time, and they fix a cut by just gluing it shut which hurts! Overall it's fine."
2,"I like to give every place a second chance, but this place received one by default.  I went here recently, having just come from out of town on the way to a job interview.  I am trying to grow my nails out/strengthen the nail beds,  so planned to forego gel polish, but since no one asked, offered, or recommended anything in the way of gel polish, specials, combos, etc., when directed, I chose a regular polish. (None of the three technicians were occupied when I entered.) The tech did show me the card to choose my pedicure. The chair was very relaxing; no real complaints about the pedicure, though I was a little embarrassed by the cleavage of the young lady (and I'm not a prude); pretty decent callous removal, even though I only chose  the ""regular"" pedicure; leg massage was very nice. When it was time for the manicure (same tech) I was asked about filing a little and evening out, and what shape, to which I said yes, just file a little and square-rounded. Next thing I knew she had clipped my longest nail with a pair of big clippers, then proceeded to clip them all (no need stopping her at that point because it would have looked weird); however, the one nail I had expected to be clipped and filed wasn't even touched. I thought it had been fixed during the cuticle work, but even hang nails were missed, as discovered later.  The polish went on and even then seemed a bit thick, but, hey - I'm not the technician. After she started the polish, she asked why I didn't like gel; I told her no one mentioned it, but I didn't want my nail beds filed on, like I have had done before, to which she replied they don't do that there; even though I expressed interest, she made no suggestion to do it or start over.  

I was moved over to the UV drying station and just left there for 10 min. or so. Needing to get to my interview, I looked at the manager, standing behind the counter, and asked if he thought they were ready; he said oh, sure...didn't even check, but I got the feeling he was waiting for me, so I gathered my things carefully and went to pay. When I asked the name of my technician, he didn't even know, but did find out. I noticed one of my nails smudge so asked if I could/should dry some more. I waited another ten min. and left. Within a few minutes, even though super careful, three nails looked like they had just melted...the whole shebang had slid down toward my cuticle! Not having any time, I smoothed them and poured water on them ASAP (a quick set trick from an old manicurist), and hid my fingers during the interview. (Note: toes were just fine, even after slamming into shoes for interview; four hours afterward, my fingernails were still mushy and pitting!)

 I planned to chalk it up to ""lesson learned"", but found myself in the area the next afternoon and decided to see if they would fix my manicure. While much busier, the lady manager (I think, no one introduced themselves ever!) came right over and loudly proclaimed they would fix for free, though she denied anything being wrong with the polish, that it was probably my fault for rushing...but why hadn't I done gel nails? I explained. She called up another technician (the guy manager did remember my technician's name from day before), still loudly declaring they would fix but I must stay longer. When I mentioned my toes were fine, that I thought they may want to take that bottle of polish down, they said toenails dry differently than fingernails and the polish works differently. REALLY? Which turnip truck do you think I fell off of? I decided to ask if they would discount a gel manicure, and they knocked $10 off, handed me over to the new manicurist, amid much foreign chatter and what appeared to be an attempt to hide me from the previous manicurist. (I see someone else mentioned the huge amount of giggling, seeming side exchanges, and foreign conversation, which I do find to be a little disrespectful.) My new caretaker was polite, made suggestions/created my color, but did ask why I liked my nails so short; though I think that was a little impertinent (but not as much as her cleavage; no I am NOT a weirdo, but worse than the day before!), I responded I didn't, that her colleague had snipped them off! This gal did some prep, continuing to extol the wonders of gel polish, had me wash up without soap, and finished the manicure. I ended up being moved near my manicurist from the previous day, explained what happened, suggested she may want to take the polish down, to which the present manicurist rolled her eyes and clicked her tongue. While she did a decent job, the polish ran over my cuticles to some degree (and now 4 days later, polish is beginning to flake off at edges). I paid; I left...and won't go back.  I'm sure this place is good for some, but not for me.    Note: The shop is quiet enough, no fumes, fairly clean - though never did see sterilized equipment, and the restroom/hall area were kind of dingy."
2,"Anything but the basic pedicure is way overpriced. I don't think there was anything organic in the organic milk and honey option I got. I never saw anything resembling honey but they did pour some white murky liquid into the water. 

Then she tells me there is an up charge of 4 bucks on the OPI polish I picked out after I was sitting in the chair. Really?! No sign over the polish area to warn people.

My one foot is still red from the scalding wax treatment. She kneaded my foot so hard I thought she would break a bone!

Still have dry calluses on my heels- she barely touched them. My polish on my big toe was smeared before I even left the shop but it was tolerable since there was a line waiting.

Then a buck for using a card to pay...2 stars is generous if I think about it!"
2,"I grabbed some late night sushi and tempura and was not impressed. Though the atmosphere is very interesting, it wasn't enough to make up for everything else. The vegetable tempura was covered in panko and served with a sauce that tasted like fence dressing. And the sushi was very meh considering the price, both in presentation and taste. Red is definitely a better option if you want sushi with aesthetics."
2,"Stay away from this place. Very poor food, made by people who obviously have never eaten asian food.  An employee could not speak english and did not understand what Duck Sauce was.  Um Hellllooo? I had the egg rolls and Chicken pad thai.  Both were horrible."
2,"I went in yesterday for my first time with a friend. We both had long weeks and needed some pampering, plus I've never had a pedicure before. The place looked clean and welcomed us even though we didn't have appointments. Once they sat us down into the chairs is when the problems began.

I let the lady know it was my first time getting a pedicure so my feet are sensitive. She nodded and began talking her native language to the other girl taking care of my friend. I find that to be a little disrespectful. While she was filing my nails a customer came out from the waxing room very irate yelling at the tech who waxed her, during the commosion my tech kept filing on one of my nails until it bled even though I kept jerking my foot back to prevent it from happening. She finally got the hint and said ""oh it hurt"", then proceeded to spray rubbing alcohol on it! It burned, for a little, but it burned!

I was shocked and just asked her to please take it easy on my feet. I wasn't about to create a scene too and I really just wanted to relax so I bared with the tingly pain. The massage was great as was the hot stone treatment. The nail polish I'm not too happy about. I already have a chip on one nail. Overall I had an amusing first pedicure experience, however, I will never return to this place."
2,"Have been coming to this place every year for the past 6 years. While on this past trip I was told they parted ways with Todd English and are no longer affiliated. 
Had two meetings pre arranged, and I thought I was going to the TE Pub. 
Food and menu are completely new, food was horrible. Bar is basically the same, but food is completely different and sub par at best. Disappointing. 
Only go there for drinks."
2,"Food and service were decent hence 2 stars. 
The Congee queen steeles and 404 is always busy but definitely wayyy better than this location. 
I was very disappointed with the Hong Kong style lobster which was soggy and not fresh."
2,"The ingredients are fresh but combine into flavorless piles of large hunks of various ingredients. This is true for both the salads and noodle dishes. At least the design of the restaurant is done well, wish I could say the same about their product."
2,"During times of low-carbing this is a go to for Skillets as Denny's has a number of them that you can substitute  the hash browns for spinach and not mess up your diet. This location really struggles with its customer service. Seems like everytime I come here there is only a couple waitresses and they're not really on point with getting her order, refilling your coffee or virtually any aspect of the job. When the food does come out usually it is accurate but it's just the terrible customer service you have to deal with if you want to come to this location. Eh, skip this joint."
2,"Passable.

Was in the area and hoping for a variety, so we opted in for AYCE. Not impressed whatsoever. 
Prices for A La Carte were reasonable, but the quality overall for either option of AYCE or A La Carte was horrible.

There was way too much rice in every piece of sushi, and the pieces of sashimi were super small. Aside from sushi, there were hot items as well like Tenpanyakki and Grilled/Tempura based items, but even those were at most passable.

For $23 a person AYCE, the quality could've been better. Probably will not be back. Definitely worth the additional dollar or so for better quality, and better atmosphere in general."
2,"Not very good.  The food is average at best.   Poor location and I wonder if they will make it.  The service was OK and friendly, but the food is just not very good and it is over priced."
2,This place used to be so good. They used to have the largest hot wings and the freshest oysters. Kind of went down hill after it changed to the pub. Won't be coming back.
2,"So, let me begin by saying we have stayed at the REAL Tahiti Village resorts that are on Las Vegas Blvd.  We booked this trip last December for Tahiti Village.  I am not sure who's fault it is-but when us and our 5 teenagers arrived to check in at Tahiti Village-we were told that we were actually placed at Tahiti Resort.  Upon arrival, Tahiti Vacation Resort is the K-Mart of Hotels.  It was OK-but the WiFi service reminded me of dial-up or the 3G days.  There is absolutely NO phone service in the rooms or the hotel.  We asked if we could at least see the rooms, were not even allowed to see the rooms before officially checking in.  We wanted to see if they were large enough for our 7-person family, but she said we had to check in and pay in order to see them.  Upon paying hundreds of dollars, we walk to our room.  The rooms are OK-really, if the pool wasn't so depressing, we could have made it work.  We booked a room to sleep 8(Which Tahiti Village has)-we got a room that slept six, so one kid was on the floor for a night.  We tried to talk to the floor management, who was a woman but I don't remember her name, but she was absolutely no help.  We asked if we could switch to Tahiti Village where we were supposed to be because she told us it was a sister hotel, but she said she would look into it, stalled and never responded or returned our calls as she said she was going to call her manager to ask if we could cancel the reservation for the next two nights (side note-Tahiti Village said it happens all the time and it is not their fault - most people are super mad when this happens to them too!) We ended up walking down there after numerous calls and her saying I will call you back when I contact her and ask her and let you know.  An hour later we walked back down to the desk, she hadn't called the manager at all yet and called her when we were there.  She was not any help, and honestly sounded like she could care less about anything.  After two hours of back and forth with the woman at the desk who refused to assist us, we ended up making another reservation at the real Tahiti Village.  We sucked it up and stayed in that room and left as soon as we could the next day.  We ate the three nights we paid for because it is that bad. So, a 3-night vacation that was supposed to cost us $700- ended up costing us $1600 just for the hotel cost.  The real Tahiti Village is AMAZING!  The lazy river is to die for and the regular pool that they have in addition to their amazing lazy river, blows the two pools that are at the Tahiti Vacation Resort out of the park.  The two pools that are at Tahiti Vacation Resort are incredibly basic, although they do have a small section of sand on one side in each pool.  We arrived to dozens of towels laying out, apple cores laying all over the ground, chairs were in the pool, and no towels were available for my family.  Like I said, the rooms are OK-and if you haven't been to the real Tahiti Village and don't plan to spend a lot of time in the pools like we did, this place is ok although their management needs an upgrade.  They do have a basic continental breakfast with muffins, bagels, bananas, apples, orange juice, hot cocoa and coffee.  We did not mind too much having to stay there the first night.  What made us angry, was their refusal to comp us, or allow us to cancel with a 20 hour advance the next two nights for the reservation, so lucky us, we were stuck.  If we had stayed there, our vacation would have been a bust.  Tahiti Vacation Club management-please advise.  I do not recommend this place unless you're a senior citizen wanting peace and quiet away from nice pools and families."
2,"Not exactly what I expected. Food lacks flavour and seasoning. I had to salt and pepper my own rack of lamb. For the price you're paying, definitely deserve to get something that tastes better. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 just for the service. Will not recommend to friends or family."
2,"Over priced and always a wait. The last time I went the woman waiting on me explained how ""she only has two hands"" after I mentioned I was running late. She also explained how other places that charge less are taking advantage of people who are afraid to say anything and work like slaves."
2,"So I just got done eating this food. We got the carnitas burrito wet and a shredded beef chimichanga and all I can say is this food lacks in flavor. The red sauce taste like it comes straight from a can at least add more spices the carnitas meet isn't too bad. The shredded beef chimichanga was a little better then the wet burrito but not by much the shredded beef was okay it lacked spice. This food is not worth the price. The burritos were so bad that my husband and I didn't even finish the burritos we threw them out. Mixteca is a whole lot better then this place.  

On another note we got the kids crunchy tacos and they said they were good. Still not enough to get us to go again."
2,My friend suggested me to come to this place and tbh I'm really disappointed. The presentation and taste of many kitchen food were really bad. Seaweed salad looks nothing like the thin green stands that I am used to. Sushi rolls were pretty average as well. Oh and no shrimp tempura and ice cream desserts like any other AYCE lunch menu.
2,"I thought that it will be much better than expected.  Service is great and valuable, and this is a great job. But we have ordered 2 stakes  one rare another medium well, and we have got  both medium stakes. I this is unacceptable. Anyways you can go and try their food and  fancy service, but i will pay this much money for something more in other place."
2,"The service was slow, and the waitress was not nice and friendly enough, to keep me patient. My food was so plain and not good. I like Denny's I just don't want to spent money on service like that."
2,I don't believe this place will survive. I liked it so much better when it was the Todd English Pub. Food is just OK and nothing to brag about. Don't think I will be going back. It's a real shame.
2,I don't recommend getting your full face done here on Mondays. They do such a hurried job and there was still hair on face where she was supposed to thread it. I had to go back inside and get her to retouch it.  Not a very good job even though you're having to pay 27 plus tip on Mondays.
2,I'd recommend you try noodlehead (lower price point/higher quality) or chipotle (similar price point) instead.
2,"I have been here twice. The second time was with my daughters who are always well behaved. My thought is that The Octagon does not like you bringing your children to dinner. The service that night was deplorable. Because of that, I have not and never will return. Too bad that Eddy's closed, had to retire at some point, that place was so superior in so many ways. There are still other and better steakhouses in the GTA that deserve your patronage over The Octagon.

2,Didn't care for the work done  and was rushed to pay as my nails didn't even get a second coat while they waited for me to sign my receipt ....apparently couldn't wait
2,"If you are in the area and looking for a tasty bite to eat, keep on looking. I ordered the lemongrass curry box with chicken. The box was roughly 75% rice, 20% vegetables, and 5% meat = 100% disappointment. The lemongrass curry sauce was listed as ""spicy"" on their menu, however, that was far from true. Bland and dry is a more accurate description. I was not able to finish my meal. Was not impressed and will not return."
2,"Stayed here for 3 nights.  

Overall, I found the hotel itself amenable to sleep - but the staff were entirely clueless and unprofessional.

When we checked in, our first room had an *overpowering* smell of cleansing material - so much so, we had to move rooms.

To make matters worse, my wife cut her foot in our (well, their) room and the staff were virtually apathetic to helping her. They offered us a new room, but we needed to leave the next day - thus, no good.  I felt like I needed to argue to get some kind of financial comp for an issue that was not our - this to the hotel  manager, Ashley.

I was left disappointed and would not recommend this hotel."
2,"San tan location..  Bad customer service, never return calls,  spend over $4,000 there, but still no one cares to call back, including 2 messages to the manager, He does not care to return calls of customers either..

not going there again !!"
2,"The low rating is for the food only. Service at this restaurant is excellent. But the food was disappointing. We had the fish and chips and the crispy chicken sandwich. We were not impressed and ate less than half of each. And they don't list all ingredients on the menu. I cannot stand mayonnaise. I wasn't worried about it since it wasn't on the menu. Yet the sandwich was slathered with it. We've eaten here a few times and every time it's empty, even on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. We won't be rushing back."
2,"Ordered take out here because Ritual had a deal. Chicken teriyaki with rice, soup, salad, 2 spring rolls and 3 pieces of California maki for 5 bucks. Decent deal but the food and service was another story. 

I came on time but still had to wait 10 minutes (this is in addition to 10 minutes that Ritual told me to go). When I got there, the restaurant had 2-3 tables so they weren't that busy. I saw my order and all it was missing was the maki. The sushi chef took forever to get started even though I didn't see him make any other rolls in the time I was waiting. The servers were even telling him that I needed the rolls but he dgaf. Finally, they packed up my food but didn't give me a spoon for the soup.

The food itself was bland, the teriyaki sauce was thick and bland, too much corn starch (or whatever thickening agent) was used. The chicken was dry and chewy. Salad was warm. Best part of the meal? The 3 pieces of sushi I waited so long for."
2,"In short I dislike two things from them. 1) Repair company they use. 2) they lack sense of ownership. We need to keep track and keep reminding them.

I used this company to rent my home. I have with them more than an year. As long as there are no repairs at home this company works fine. But, if it needs repair they have only one company to go with. They don't provide second option. Me being Out of town. Have to rely on them. But, they charge alot of money for small repairs. Which I hated.

Also when my home kept in the market, There were issues like, prospective tenants could not open the number lock."
2,"First off our server was amazing.  Super genuine, attentive and she had excellent follow through.  Ok, onto the food...marginal at best!  We started with a shrimp cocktail which was smelly.  Next we had a fried mozzarella piece in panko...not seasoned at all.  We ordered the Prime Rib...supposed to be medium rare...it was extremely rare.  The prime rib sandwich was pretty good....au jus lacked flavor.  We ordered a Bloody Mary with their ""house mix"" it was awful. I have never sent back a drink...ever.  We also ordered seasonal vegetables...sliced undercooked carrots...really??? Please don't waste your time.  Again, our server was great!"
2,"Visited Sumo Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi for the first time last night. Ordered the shrim and scallop hibachi dinner and friend had calamari steak hibachi dinner. 

Soup and salad came with dinner. The miso soup tasted watered down. The salad was made up of head lettuce carrots and cucumber topped with an excess of mayo based ginger dressing. Please put dressing on the side. 
The entree included combo veggies of carrots, zucchini and onions which would have been great if they weren't swimming in teriyaki sauce. The fish was clearly cooked in the hibachi. The scallops and calamari was cooked to just right doneness but was swimming in teriyaki sauce. The fried rice was ok. 
Waiter (Kevin)  was pleasant but stilted. Did not smile. Perhaps he was new to this job. 

All in all if I go back, perhaps to try their sashimi or sushi,  I would not order hibachi unless I was sitting at the the hibachi table where I could tell them not to add sauce to my food. 

I thought food should be marinated in Teriyaki not swimming in it in the finished dish."
2,"I hate to give this place a 2 star review based on some things that are not their fault but the truth of the matter is that I have had better accommodations elsewhere and at other Hamptons.  

I picked this Hampton because it was close to where I needed to be, not too far from the strip/food and it was close to the airport...that last one is what got me.  It's VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY close to the airport.  I mean very close.  Like, look out your window and there's a jumbo jet close.  

So the planes landing and taking off at all hours of the night?  You can hear all of it.  It gets so bad that the windows shake at times and if you're a light sleeper then you probably aren't sleeping.  They provide you with ear plugs but...how will I hear my alarm with those ear plugs in?

Anyhow, the staff is really nice and the breakfast isn't bad at all.  But the problem comes from location and it's proximity to the runway.  If you like watching and hearing airplanes take off at all hours of the night, this is the place for you.  For me?  Not so much."
2,"I have to echo the negative reviews on this site. I stayed here to nap before a late flight. Despite most of the staff being nice to your face, at least two were quite unprofessional. I made it clear that I was flying at a busy time and would need a timely shuttle to the airport. One of the staff booked the flight in a friendly manner but did not actually write it down. By the time I was waiting downstairs there was no evidence of a shuttle having been booked. This by itself would not have merited a 2 star review but the lady working the desk on a Sunday night did not so much as apologize. She just acted like it wasn't her fault and didn't know what happened. I had a polite conversation suggesting that such an attitude led to a poor customer experience but she acted as if she could not care less."
2,"As soon as I walked into the salon, all the employees just stared at me before they greeted me. The lady did great on my nails but they were very rude. As I was paying, I handed her my card and she basically broke her neck to look into my wallet and saw cash. She then denied my card and said ""no, cash"". I have never been so offended. The ladies are rude there. Would not go back. Also my nails are already chipping with a gel polish."
2,"EDIT: I called about my missing dessert. I drove back there to retrieve it(no discount for my troubles) and wasn't even pleased with their version of a tres leche. Extremely disappointed 

This is first time I've visited this place and it was awful! I ordered to go. My chicken was burnt and they forgot my dessert. I also got the quinoa and it was extremely salty to the point that it was inedible This is a new location so i guess they're just working out kinks but i suggest they work quickly."
2,"I don't write reviews but just thought I'd do it for this one since it was over hyped.  

The casher was friendly but lacked the knowledge about what's in the drinks so it felt like a learning experience for both sides.  

I was the last in line for my drink and after everyone's order quickly came out I finally got mine 15 minutes after the two people in front of me got theirs.  

I ordered a passion fruit tea which probably contained half a cup of syrup.  Good thing I don't get sweeteners for my teas because it was extremely sweet.  

Their Vietnamese coffee is whatever.  You want better coffee?  Go across the street to Lee's sandwich.

The fruit addict was the only thing decent.  While not great but better than what anyone else has to offer.

Overall it's a place I'd probably just glance at and maybe stop by when I'm tagging along with other people."
2,"Wait a darn minute!  I thought it was called 'Tahiti' but I felt like I was in Cuba?!  What gives?  Wait... I'm being punked... Wait. No? Grrrrr

My buddies and I wanted to go to Vegas for a few days and my friend said he had a 'Time Share' that we can use.  We thought GREAT!  Let's book it.  So we did.

We get there and the only thing that looked like it was from Tahiti was me!  Well, I'm of Mexican decent but I think I can pass for a Tahitian.

Overall it's your average looking hotel.  Like Yelper Myles B. said in his review ""It's about the same {quality as} a Ramada inn""

My complaints:

The 'free breakfast' in the morning are prepackaged pastries, and assorted mini muffins.  To drink you have a wonderful choice of Water/OJ/Grape Juice.

No Housekeeping for the 5 days we've stayed there.

Often confused by taxi drivers with ""Tahiti village"" (we got dropped off there when we go off the airplane and told then guy)

I had a hard time operating the AC and it kept blowing in my face when I slept on the sofa/bed

Oh... The beds!  I didn't have an opportunity to sleep on one because I'm the youngest and I sacrificed the older ones to have the beds.  The sofa bed had to be once of the worse ones I've slept on.  So I ended up just sleeping on the sofa without pulling out the bed for the rest of the trip.

My praises: 

The staff was ALWAYS helpful and nice.  :oD To bad they can't change the look/feel/comfort of this place.  Nevertheless, they were awesome in pointing me to the right direction and giving me great Vegas tips.  

This place is about 3 miles away from the Strip

Cheers and Relax Responsibly!"
2,"Customer service. Customer service. Customer service. This place has absolutely no concept or understanding of customer service. Usually, a place will have a big handful of people that can really deliver on the basis of customer service, then you have a couple bad apples that ruin it. At Aji Sai, it's like EVERYONE is a bad apple. This place is horrible- but the sushi isn't that bad.

They do have a pretty good selection on their AYCE menu. The selection is pretty good. One thing that I do have to get out there is the fact that their spider roll just tastes ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. It was pretty disgusting and I love crab- just not this one. The tempura is always on point. Pretty good sized shrimp tempura and the batter is nice and light and crispy. 

Speed is a hit or miss. I've gotten pretty fast service at times and then other times, I've gotten some pretty slow service. 

I really can't deal with the servers at this place because they are too rude, so I won't be back."
2,"This is a newer Hampton Inn and is quite chic for a limited service hotel, it's also a far, far cry from your Fairfield Inn's or Holiday Inn Express type of hotels.

The rooms are pretty awesome!  The little foyer area as you enter the room is tiled and connects you to the amazingly large bathroom with stand in shower and large granite top vanity.  The closet located just outside of the bathroom is a little small, it can hang maybe about 6-8 items perfectly.  The bedroom area was great and well decorated.  IMO, I think the interior designer of this hotel must really like DWR, Z Gallerie and those type of furnishings.

Each morning, they host a complimentary breakfast, which is really an upgraded continental.  I wasn't a fan of it but, no complaints really since it's complimentary.  They had your basic breads, bagels, muffins, danishes, cereals, fruit, make your waffle, eggs and one meat, coffee, juice, milk and tea.  The bread products were cold and when the hostess would replenish them, they literally were just out of the freezer.  The coffee wasn't the greatest but had caffeine which is all that mattered to me.  One day they had a ham and scrambled egg mixture going on, which was tasty but the next day, it was dried scrambled eggs and paper thin bacon on the side.  Again, it's complimentary, it's not designed to satisfy your morning appetite, much less your palate, but, it'll get you through the morning.  We ended up only eating there the first 2-mornings out of the 5-mornings we were there.

Okay so it's going from excellent to good to bad, it eventually had to happen.  The hotel is literally next to the runway of LAS.  You can see the runway, from our room at least.  You don't hear the planes landing as much as you hear and feel the thunder of the planes taking off.  The first night, I literally woke up to the rumble of a plane taking off at 12:40am, probably because our window was vibrating.  No kidding!  We asked the front desk agent the next morning, who BTW wasn't all that pleasant, but seemed like she had a scripted answer to the ever popular question.  We were unpacked anyway and didn't want to move so we just went to CVS and bought ear plugs, which DID help.  However, we were in an odd number room, facing the back.  I have a feeling if you got an even number room, facing the front, the noise isn't as significant.  Not sure why the front desk agent wasn't so proactive in trying to make us happy, the hotel wasn't full or anything the whole time we were there.

Overall, it's a nicely furnished hotel.  The service might be a little iffy.  But it's just too close to the runway for me to comfortably stay there again.  But, the concept and design of this newer hotel sure made me appreciate Hampton Inn's much more!"
2,"I will not go back to this place nor do I recommend it. The people are very nice don't get wrong. The service is great. The problems:
1. The prices are too high. I get suckered into choosing a more expensive pedicure package bc I think I'm saving some money but I'm not. It would come out to the Same price if I did it all a la carte. 
2. I just got them done last week and pedicure is already ruined. It actually never looked good. It is too expensive for what I got. I can go to other places and get them done and they usually last for months. So this place must be doing something wrong. 
3. Can I just say they are over priced again. If you go here you will be paying more than others and getting nothing more in return. 

I got my nails done. They did a good job on that. But not any better than other places. 

Needless to say. I would not recommend this place to anyone. (unless I didnt like you!)

Oh yeah. what's up with places asking for the tip in cash. If I had cash then I wouldnt be using my credit card in the first place. I am not going to go to the bank just to tip you in cash!!"
2,"Food is good! Too bad the employees are RUDE and they nickel and dime you with a charge for EVERYTHING! I just ordered a regular breakfast burrito and it was $10.00, the menu price was $6.59. The food is quite good, but not better than other local places to make me come back to this very cheaply run, price gouging spot. A clear sign of poor ownership, the place that occupied this location before was MUCH BETTER. When I asked questions about the charge, it clearly annoyed the clerk and I swear they made me wait extra on purpose."
2,"Walked 20 minutes to get here based on a review I read about their Bloody Mary... they are under new ownership and have a very average Bloody Mary.  We arrived at 10am which is opening time and watched the staff sit around for an additional 15 minutes before unlocking the front door upon which the manager welcomed us with ""You can come in now"" - no apology to the group of people that were waiting outside.  Food was ok with the exception of the eggs Benedict - egg came out hard boiled vs. poached. Since it took 45 minutes to hit the table we excepted more.... won't be back."
2,"I've given  Aji Sai three chances, and now I'm done with them. Between ""meh"" sushi, slow, grumpy service, and the fact that you receive about a quarter of the items you order from their all-you-can-eat menu, I don't understand why anyone bothers with this place."
2,"One of the worst people to deal with.  I have sent emails for the past month concerning problems in our rental!  

Roaches that need an exterminator
Door lock that is broken 
AC that keeps running and froze up last year. 

There is no communication. I guess Our Landlord is not willing to fix anything!  

Renters have no friends!!!

Update on my review. I received a lengthy message on Saturday from my contact person.  with a promise to call on Monday. Which was yesterday. Monday came and went.  I work 24/7 and there isn't a day that ends without a follow up to all my text's and emails.
I know us east coast people know what a work ethic is!!!! Proud of it!!!"
2,"Super disappointed in my service I received from Sandy on Saturday. I came in as a first time client, checked in a few minutes early. 15 minutes after my appointment I went and asked how long it would be. The woman assured me that Sandy was finishing up. I had a gut feeling I should just leave, I mean a first time client and you are late and give me no update. 

She finally comes out in a whirlwind 20 mins after my scheduled appointment. She basically told me she forgot about my appointment. She takes me back to her chair and starts my consult, she sounded knowledgeable so I tried to be as ease and more comfortable. I mean who isn't a bit nervous the first time a new person cuts your hair. I showed Sandy a photo (which I will add to my post) it was a highly textured cut for long hair. I spent a lot of time growing my hair out but wanted to shape it up and give it a trim to air on the healthy side for my long locks. 

Sandy took me over for a shampoo, she washed my hair. Many times getting shampoo in my face. She said she wanted to put a conditioner in my hair and leave it to set for 5 mins. Well I sat there with my eyes closed, finally got restless and opened my eye and see my hairstylist with another client. WHAT THE CRAP! I felt very unimportant at this point but... what do I do with wet hair. I felt committed but I was very upset. She finally came back, much longer than 5 minutes had passed. She rinsed my hair, gave me a two second scalp massage and sent me to the chair. 

She starts to cut and I see her out the scissors up by my nose. I said ""whoa, you are scaring me! that's super short"" to which she replied ""oh it's fine, these are inside layers"" then SNIP! I was so tense and freaking out. She revealing to me at the end and I was about to cry but I couldn't tell her. I mean what is the point, you can't put the hair back on! I now basically have bangs, hair up to my nose! My cut looks like a mullet, very short on top and super long underneath. It's awful and I'm basically having to pin it bad everyday until it grows out. 

Not only that, she barely put any effort into styling it. I feel like that was because she was running behind and had another client. 

AWFUL EXPERIENCE!

Below is the cut I requested. 
I'm too embarrassed to show what I got!"
2,"When I first arrive find the last ada parking spot taken by the lazy shuttle van driver. This hotel is in major need of updating. The plane noise is not a major issue, the AC drowned it out. Don't take staffs advice on take out. Already reviewed that dog food company. I stay at Hampton inns because usually they are great. This one not so much. The breakfast by the way worst ever I have had at a hotel. Nothing cooked right and nothing stocked. My daughter looked forward to a waffle and fruit this morning, both empty. Great way to start your day, hungry and irritated. This hotel, unless they update it and hire some new staff will be off our list as we travel. I had high hopes and got let way down. 1 more night stuck in this place. Lovely"
2,"Not the place to visit if you're hoping for Hawaiian BBQ. I feel the name Jimmy HULAS with a strong Hawaiian theme was slightly deceiving. My first impression of the menu was that they were serving Mexican food. Nachos, Guacomole & chips, ""Crak'd out corn"" also known as Elote is Mexican establishments. They do attempt to add some sort of tropical twist but I feel the food still lacked flavor. 

My husband & I both were very disappointed. He ordered the Malibu & Killer tacos. I ordered the Voodoo & Jimmichurri tacos. All 4 tacos were stuffed with far too much lettuce or cabbage (depending on the taco). The ""Jimmichurri"" lacked flavor and felt like plain oil poured into my taco. The fries were very greasy and soft. Our daughters refused to eat their chicken quesadillas (YES MORE MEXICAN). 

Our server was sweet, maybe a little too attentive. Not too big of a deal. 

I left upset at myself for paying $40+ on that meal and we will not be returning or recommending."
2,"My wife and I stopped in looking for a new washer and dryer. We were quickly greeted and shown a large selection of well priced options. The associate that helped us was very knowledgeable and answered a wide range of questions. He offered to match any price and even volunteered to do a bit of research to show that the price we were getting was lower than other options (Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowes, and Sears). So we chose the top of the line front loading Maytag washer/dryer.

While we were there we also decided to buy their top of the line Maytag two door and a bottom drawer (freezer) refrigerator. We had it delivered the next day. All together we spent just over $6,500. 

Great experience, so far.

The next day everything was delivered without a problem. The guys were in and out fast, they were friendly, and cleaned up after themselves. Before they left, I noticed one of the refrigerator door shelves was missing. They told me to just call the store and they would get one right over to me. So I did, within just a few minutes.

This is where the experience tanked.

When I called, my original sales associate was out for the day. The guy who answered the phone took my information and said it would be no problem to get the shelf ordered and to my house within a few days. I waited two weeks, nothing.

So I called back and spoke to my original associate. He couldn't find an order for the shelf but said he would take care of it. I waited two weeks, nothing.

I called back and spoke to the original associate, he said it should arrive any day. I waited two weeks, nothing.

Finally, 6 weeks after I placed a $6,500 order I stopped back into the store and talked to my original sales associate. I was frustrated, but I was not rude. The associate however was very short with me, as if I was bothering him. He walked over to the floor model, took the shelf out, and brought it back to me. 

I was still curious if I should expect to receive the other shelf in the mail and inquired about it. To which he replied in a condescending tone, ""you have the shelf. Is there anything else I can help you with?"" 

I've waited a couple months to write this review because I was hoping that the earlier great experience would wash away my memories and feelings about the poor service I received at the end. It didn't. I wouldn't go back to this store because I know if there was an issue, I couldn't count on them to put their best foot forward and help me solve it."
2,"- Used to be my go to cheat day spot. Not anymore.
- Quality has dropped significantly as has the service.
- Dinner is a bit more expensive but definitely the better choice. More variety and for some reason, ingredients seem a bit more fresh.
- Salmon rose - my favorite item on the menu. Used to over order on this very item.
- Wakame salad used to be great. Now its just very dry and tasteless."
2,"Its Danny so we can expect much. My 7 year old daughter keeps seeing the commercial on Disney so she wanted to try it. When we left she said ""we dont need to go back there again! We tried it and it's not our cup of tea"" her pizza was cold and  no flavor. So she tried pancakes and said that they were okay"
2,"Extended warranty not worth the money. Six to eight weeks for washer parts is B.S. We have bought everything TV's, washers, dryers, dishwashers, and beds, Sorry to say never again all do to with the worthless warranty they sell. Now I find out they own the service company Goldwing.  Don't get taken for a ride."
2,"Updating my review to a 2 star because the guy who originally did my 5-star manicure hasn't been there since. I've returned a handful of times and they constantly have blehhh customer service. Color choices for dip are limited and the quality is just OKAY. I never leave 100% satisfied. I've gone back due to location convenience, but definitely not my go-to place."
2,Had to give it some time before I posted but there is a serious problem or disconnect between the sales team even store manager and the delivery team.  Shouldn't call them a team because the implies they work together. Bought a washer and dryer and they said next delivery date is Monday. Had a conflict from 11-1 asked if it would be ok to request they don't deliver during those hours and they said no problem. Driver called on Monday saying that he would be their from 11-1.  Told him of the request but he said it couldn't be changed so I ended up changing my appt to later than he didn't show til later when my new appt   My husband had to run home from work to find out they only had the washer they are stacked so not worth doing to redo when dryer arrived so he sent them away asking them to come back with both. Wasted one day.  Them spent time on phone to get new delivery date on Wed to have the dryer show up without washer.  Then got another delivery date on Thursday where we finally got them almost a week later. Problem is the drivers didn't have the tools to change the doors so they worked properly for stacked so had to wait on Friday for another driver to come out who had the right tools. Only wasted a week.  Beware!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Did not even taste it yet, I only stirred the crushed ice up and this is the amount of goods in the reg size cup that I paid $7 for. Not satisfying at all."
2,"My fiance and I came here for Valentines Day dinner.
With the exception of the door man and the manager, the rest of the staff were miserable. 
Our waiter was pretentious and rude. The waitress wanted almost nothing to do with us.
I felt as though we had previously personally attacked them since our treatment was embarrassingly bad. They were treating all the other guests perfectly well from what we could see. 
At one point, when he waitress came by with our drinks, she didn't make a single sound to notify to us that she was close by. She just quickly and harshly dropped down our drinks onto the table, nearly smacking me in the face. I thought it was just me exaggerating but my fiance saw it from his side of the table and was furious but didn't want to ruin the night. 
The food itself was very good. My filet was cooked perfectly so big thumbs up to the chef. However, the presentation was depressing. No garnishing on mine or anything. Just plopped down a tiny piece of meat with a side order of garlic mash. I asked for gravy and was told this establishment doesn't give out gravy so to just enjoy it as it is. Maybe this sounds uncultured of me but WHAT THE WHAT?!
My fiance has a piece of parsley for garnishing on his that was sitting at the edge of his plate by the time the waiter had also loudly dropped it down the the table. 
Ambience was beautiful but I wish they didn't seat us in a shitty area knowing that they're not full (we got there around 10). Maybe it was a race thing? The only people with the decent seatings were all older white couples, I noticed. I also got very cold as did many of the girls that chose to wear dresses. I asked the waitress to turn up the heat and she flat out ignored me after I looked her in the eye when she was at our table. 
Overall, we had a great valentines due to the fact that we're capable of laughing and finding humour when situations like this happen. But definitely never coming back here again."
