4,"Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. 
The staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger.
Caution: will smell like BBQ grill after."
4,"I love love their Kalbi, I always order it the sauce is what makes it really good..hmm think I wanna eat that today.i didn't like their noodles to sweet.."
4,Just finished breakfast and experienced the best customer service! Trisha is an exceptional server! Had the chocolate peanut butter pancakes...like eating the nectar of awesomeness. Far superior to the Reeses pancakes I had tried at OverEasy
4,"Good food..well you have to cook yourself.. but great place, good location and a decent price. 

Would have rated higher if the service was better..been there a few times n  had to wait n call out to get food or drinks. . The servers always have a ""not interested"" look and that gets to you no matter how polite they try to be.."
4,"Had to get my wing fix, I like dry rubs on wings they had 3 different types couldn't choose between 6 pepper, smoked and cajun style so I just got all three. 
All were great but if I needed to choose I would go with the 6 pepper, along with incredible craft beer offered makes this place a great stopping place while passing threw !"
4,"I had brunch here last Sunday and I would have to say that the Rib-eye steak was awesome. A perfectly cooked medium rare with soup ,appetizer platter and dessert buffet  for around $24 is a pretty awesome deal for me. The service was very good. The meat is most likely not ""PRIME"" cut but for the price it was delicious. This experience this time around was way better. I would definitely eat here again."
4,"Excellent - have not been here in two years, since our last meal was exceptionally Bad. However after being told it's been under new management for over a year and getting positive feedback, we gave it another try. First - the reason I did not give it Five Stars is the Prices. They are approaching High Dining with one appetizer, two dinners and no alcohol near 150 dollars (including tip) for two.
We had the Baby Spinach Salad with Strawberries and caramelized pecans in a house poppy seed dressing (excellent) in nice presentation bowls. The Crab Cake appetizer consisted of chilled crab meat topped with lettuce,tomato and avocado with some excellent sauces. Surprisingly refreshing and unique, but missing the top quality LUMP Crab Meat the dishes price implied. Two Filet's - one Medium the second heavy medium, were both excellently cooked, fork tender, and the wine reduction sauce added a nice flavor.
Side orders of Creamed Corn and Loaded Baked Potato were generous and as expected. The service was far above average and made for a pleasant experience.
I would definitely recommend Waverly's - but only with a partial comp or other discount.."
4,"Great lunch price of $11 after tax and tip! 

Now onto the food, had the ayce normal menu so the squid, White fish fillet, shaved pork, shaved beef, and spicy chicken. Side dishes included fried tofu (spicy), kimchi, spicy and normal bean sprout, pickled radish, beef soup and rice. considering it is a lunch menu offering this isn't too bad and earns 3 stars.

Where they shined was on service, now this might have been an odd staff member who took pride in great service, but I found that they were very attentive, and kept our table well stocked with the side dishes that we were pounding through and the meat which we were dumping into the grill.
We had to change the grill once and that was quick and courteous.

Note: they offer an AYCE veggie+pineapple addition that you can get, but it is 3 dollars and if you are going strictly for the cost-food ratio it isn't recommended. 

I would definitely return, however considering how hard ayce is on the healthy living aspect of my life, it is unfortunately an once in a while splurge. 

3 stars for the food + price, 1 star for the service"
4,This is our local Denny's so we eat here probably 5 times a year for breakfast on the weekends. It's always busy for breakfast but they are really good about getiing you in and the food is always good. I've never had a problem here.
4,"Om nom nom. Warm and full and happy. Came right before the lunch rush. We were one of two tables occupied. It started to fill up about midway into our lunch though. Service is efficient, but not in a brusque way. Fairly pleasant, actually. Interesting thing to note: chopsticks and spoons are self serve from a container at the table. The chopsticks are disposable, but the spoons are metal. Side note: If you sit at the booths close to the door and the door opens, it can get chilly (but it's alright if you have a piping hot stew in front of you).

Had:

Black goat stew ($12) - single portion. Came with purple rice. Oddly enough, my rice came when they brought the banchan to the table (about 5-10 minutes before my stew came out). What that meant was that my rice got to cool down before my stew came. Not a good thing, but something I can live with because my stew was still boiling when it came to the table. Goat stew had a lot of bean sprouts in it. I thought there wasn't that much goat, but there was a decent amount. It was shredded and boneless goat, for those of you who dislike having bones in your meat. It was quite tender, and had a mild goat taste. Soup was spicy and delicious. Love that they sprinkled perilla seeds on top. I like the crunch.

Dolsot bibimbap ($10) - What I really like is that the dolsot bibimbap and the regular bibimbap are the same price. Dolsot is the one in the stone bowl, for those of you who aren't familiar with the term. It usually costs a dollar more than its non stone bowl counterpart. Big bowl of bibimbap. My mom only finished about half of it.

Banchan: 7 dishes here, which is a plus in my books. Kimchi, radish kimchi, sprouts, wakame salad, pickled radish, spicy fish cake slices, and dried anchovies and peanuts in a seasoned soy sauce.

Awesome bonus: These prices are tax (but not tip) included. Yep. Their menu prices are exactly what you pay (sans tip)!"
4,I am a truck driver have to sit a day  Great place ... Great wings ... Great waitress... But get a Sunday liquor license please my company comes here a lot
4,"By far the most affordable sushi place on the west side :) I love their Hawaii Roll!! The slivers of almond get me every time!! I also love their bento special. If you're not particularly hungry, don't get it! It's a lot of food.  You can get a lot of food for under $10.  Definitely a place to try :) ahem ahem walk over to the donut shop next door and have a boba for dessert. Just sayin!!"
4,"This Trader Joe's in particular is one of my favorites. It's never too crowded except around the holidays, I've never had to wait in line for more than 1 minute (someone always comes around to pull me over), all the cashiers are extra friendly, and the samples in the back keep my belly warm. WARNING THE PARKING will drive you crazy. Come at an odd hour to avoid the extremely stressful experience that is parking here. It's cramped, the spaces were made with ant-sized cars in mind, and you'll often have to wait for a spot by loitering in the middle of the whole lot and blocking people. Coming even a little later in the night will save you the hassle.

Trader Joe's in general: Why must you package all your vegetables? Why do your herbs only come in small, plastic-wrapped bunches? 

My favorites: a bag of four avocados for ~$2.50. Two salmon filets for ~$10.00. $3 wine, ""healthy"" (I'm not really sure, but the ingredients definitely read a little better) frozen food."
4,"Two separate experiences: Food Quality good (for price) but service was slow. Next time the service was attentive but the food quality poor: leathery and VERY THIN filet mignonette steak (not like pictures!) and shrimp was salty and poor quality. Potato cake was a hit!

 Managers make things right. Needs Proper staffing, better quality steaks and seafood. Our kiddo loved the chicken strips. Ok, I may be spoiled from all of the other mid-level steakhouses. I'm really pulling for you, Outback! Thanks for making the effort.

UPDATE: last experience was perfect (service,quality,prompt)."
4,"This place is amazing... I mean, they have a free sample bread table! They change their bread specials daily, so make sure you either call or check online! The sandwiches, oh so good! It does tend to take a little while for your food, but it's worth the wait!"
4,"Pho KC Vietnamese Restaurant recently opened. The restaurant is casual but also is new and modern. They offer most of your usual Vietnamese Favorites. We wanted to start out with the Potstickers but I hit them when they were all sold out of them so we just went to the entrees.

I had the Stir Fried Lemongrass Chicken with Mixed Vegetables Rice Plate. The Chicken seemed like good quality chicken because the white meat was moist and tender and just melted in my mouth. The Asian flavored sauce was delicious and laced with lemongrass as promised. My plate came with a generous amount of fresh steamed rice and tender crisp vegetables such as baby bok choy, broccoli and carrots. It was a delicious plate there is no reason why anyone wouldn't like it. Some people might point out that fish sauce sauce should be served with this plate.  Other sauces are available on the table.

My husband loves Oxtail so he ordered the Oxtail Pho. He said the clear broth was delicious. He thought it was really good and was spicy. As delicious as the broth was the dish wasn't perfect and not all of the three pieces of Oxtail were edible. He could only chew the meat off of the small piece the two bigger pieces weren't ready yet. But this is a newly opened restaurant and they are still finding their way.

The woman who took care of us was very attentive and eager to make sure we were pleased.

3.5 (because of some undercooked Oxtail but bumped up to 4 stars because they are new)

Worth a Try!"
4,"I've learned the hard way not to buy my produce at TJ's, but I must say that the quality of produce at this particular TJ's is much better than that of the TJ's that I frequent when I'm at school in NY. There is also a much larger selection of fruits than I am used to. This came as a huge surprise to me, but it was a very pleasant surprise! :)

Regardless, I rarely buy any produce at TJ's. With TJ's, it is all about their frozen foods, canned items, and snacks (oh yes, the snacks!!). I love that I can find all the same goodies that I am accustomed to, even if I am miles and miles away from home. The only huge difference that I've noticed is that the beer selection here in the Midwest TJ's is much more expansive than that in CA or NY. Not that I am complaining...

It also helps that most TJ's are organized in the same way. It makes it easy to get in, get out, and get on my way!

Tip: I only recently discovered this, but there is a FREE designated TJ's underground parking lot that you can access from the side street!! Happy shopping!"
4,Friendly staff and tasty dishes.  Only draw back is traffic in and outbid the area it is in.   Worth it however.   Good selection of wines as well. Martin
4,"This place has got a lot going for it: their food is fresh, they're open 24 hours, the menu is extensive, and so far they're doing quite well judging by the long wait during peak meal times. I heard different stories about the ownership but the main thing is that they were associated with Im Ga Nae in North York once upon a time, which was also a 24-hour joint. I recognized our waitress as one who used to serve us at Im Ga Nae too! One reviewer mentioned that the samgyupsal (pork belly) was cut thinner than at other BBQ restos, and that was actually something I did NOT like about Im Ga Nae, so hopefully they'll cut that nonsense out as I am sure one day I will end up here wanting samgyupsal at 4am and will be thoroughly disappointed if they bring me a plate of bacon-thin slices of meat!

While waiting in line, you get a pretty good idea of the range of different dishes on offer: BBQ, soups, stews, noodles, rice dishes, etc. The food must be pretty damn good as I saw one table of three super-thin girls order enough food for at least eight people! There was barely enough room to place all this endless amount of food! Note that portions are pretty big, and as one other reviewer mentioned, the menu prices do include the tax so don't be alarmed. You're definitely getting your money's worth here. You also get a range of banchan (side dishes) which can vary from day to day. 

After waiting about 20 minutes for a seat, we ended up at a table where we had to sit cross-legged, traditional styles, which would not have been my first choice, but I didn't want to wait to eat any longer. You get these faux-Gucci cushions to sit on but apart from that, there is very little comfort to be gained by sitting and eating this way. Some people don't mind, I guess. My legs tend to fall asleep when I sit for too long like this and stretching them out while eating means someone is going to get kicked. 

We ordered the jummulluk (non-marinated marbled beef) for two ($40) which came with a small choice of soups--we opted for the soondubu--two bowls of purple rice, and of course, an array of banchan. The soondubu was not at all spicy and contained mostly seafood, kimchi, and soft tofu. The broth had a very seafood-y flavor, moreso than when you order seafood soondubu in other restos. The waitress remembered me from Im Ga Nae and made sure they threw in some extra beef, which was cool as it was pretty delish. We enjoyed everything we ordered, and it appeared that other diners did too. What we got could have easily fed three people! The place was rammed with mostly Korean families and visa students the night we went but there was also a smattering of others. And the wait staff do speak English so not to worry. 

Service is good but when it's really busy, you may have to wait a little longer for things. The place is pretty cramped--it used to be Urraca which for some reason I remember being bigger than this? Maybe with the different layout, it seemed bigger, or maybe it was all the fluffy winter coats all over the place that made me feel suffocated, I don't know, but space can be a little cramped. This applies also to surface space for your food--especially if you order BBQ or chunggol, which I suppose is normal, but we had to leave our lettuce wraps and a couple of other things on the ledge next to where we sat. I was afraid something would fall over and land in someone's shoes if someone were to walk by too swiftly! Either way, check this place out--anytime! Just remember not to wear something too nice if you're ordering BBQ as you will be grilling it at your table."
4,"I can't say enough great things about the food here. Everything I have tried has been stellar. Not just good, but great! Everything from the appetizers, to the mains, to the desserts (note: I loved the espresso). The food is sure to impress almost anyone.

This location is located in a plaza across Vaughan Mills shopping mall, and in an area where there are a ton of other restaurants and places to eat at. For this reason it took a couple years for me to get into Grazie, but let me tell you, I'm so glad that I did! I'm not Italian, but comparing to all the other Italian restaurants I've dined at, this ones seemed extra authentic. The little details seem to have made a big difference in my experience.

We had a large group, approximately 15-18 people. Though we made reservations we still ended up waiting close to 30 mins to be seated. However I noticed that people were really enjoying their meals, and also their dinner experiences. Everyone was so jovial and clearly enjoying their evening. I think that this is the reason why our reservations were delayed (you can't kick people out, can you? lol) -- which is a perfectly acceptable situation in my mind. People having a great time and staying longer may be bad for maximizing the number of patrons served, but makes a huge impact in the experience and memories patrons take away with them. Great experiences let people come back over and over again. FYI: we stayed longer than average as well, and I'm sure majority of us will be coming back.

Overall, the service was superb, the food was delicious, the ingredients extremely fresh and evidently of high quality, ambiance is nice though a bit loud, and it seems to always be packed - so people definitely love coming here.

This resto is a must try if you like pasta, pizza, Italian, or even just food in general! Grazie, Grazie... I leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. Can't wait to go back :)"
4,"I had been reading the reviews and wanted to give this place a try. I am glad we did. The staff working there are very welcoming. Make you feel right at home. I honestly do not know alot about Hawaiian food. I was eager to try. 
As a person allergic to pork, :( there were a few chicken and beef options.. 
I did make an excellent choice, I had the short ribs. They were delicious. I chose the side of mac salad and the fried noodles. I did not realize when I ordered it had pork in it. I found out I can order the noodles without pork and will do so on my next visit. 
My DH had the fried chicken. He loved it. The chicken had great flavor, super crispy, crunchy and fell off the bone. We also ordered the waffle fries. They were the star of the show. Perfectly seasoned, and crunchy. It was gone in seconds. 
The restaurant is spotless. The portions generous. The prices very reasonable.
The two suggestions I have is bigger plates, for these huge and generous portions, and a steak knife. 
We will be back. 
I hope I do not jinx this place as I have to Bona, Carlos Kitchen, and Paparazzi Grill. I am running out of places to go with good food on this side of town."
4,"My wife always has an exceptional experience at the Red Salon and Spa. She see's Dessirae and she always does a fantastic job on her hair. I highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a constantly great service and great results. 

Happy wife = Happy life"
4,"I would give this place 3.5 stars. Not quite a 4, but not a 3 in my book (obviously since I wish I could give it a 3.5 on the scoring. It has bands from time to time, which is what makes it a 4. Not many places have an area that converts from a stage at night to tables during the day. I would give it a 3 for food. It's just your typical, everyday bar food. Nothing to write home about, but it's not necessarily bad. Just average. I've been here a couple of times, and I have always enjoyed myself. The service is also fantastic, which also helps its rating. I would recommend you stop at least once to try it out, especially if there is a band."
4,"Sooooo.... I wrote another review for a Denny's in Payson (that was not shining) but it reminded me how awesome this one is.

We (my family and I) have been to this location probably 2 dozen times. There have been a couple of issues here and there but its always very clean, the help is always great and the food is always good.

Very consistent."
4,"Filet Mignon, 8 oz. $33 ... very tender, great flavor, I ordered medium. Should have ordered medium rare. Medium arrived charred and crispy on the edges, but still perfect inside. Side garlic mashed potatoes ... perfect! 

Add-ons: Scallops $15 (3)... perfectly tender and large. Floating on unknown sauces. A little pricey in my opinion, but very tasty. Sauteed Mushrooms $5 ... worth the order. 

Side salad #1: Waverly's strawberry spinach salad $6 ... fresh strawberries, spiced pecans, fresh mushrooms, red onions with a poppy seed dressing. Clearly their specialty. This salad was perfect!
Side salad #2: wedge $6 ... not worth ordering. Watery raspberry ""house"" vinaigrette on plain iceberg lettuce with blue cheese crumbles, seedless cucumbers, Roma tomatoes, and red onions. Intent was good, but execution failed.

Try this: complimentary white chocolate walnut bread. Sweet, warm, tasty.

Somebody else commented about the out of place veggie and fruit murals. I had to post a picture. Just strange and odd. Very nice restaurant. I would get the filet and scallops again and not the wedge salad."
4,"I was in town on business and we were exhausted and starving. This place had good reviews so we gave it a go. We were blown away by how good everything was! The house seasoned wings were perfect, but the real star was the Irish Nachos. Reuben filling on top of hot waffle fries with Russian dressing? We still talk about how delicious they were. We're looking forward to visiting again the next time work brings me to Streetsboro."
4,Excellent food!  Great quality and large portions.  Everyone at the table was very pleased.  Also a very good beer selection.  Service was a little slow but wasn't a huge deal.  Everyone was very friendly.  Would definitely go back again!
4,"Tucked away from the many restaurants along Yonge and Finch, this is for sure one of the better kbbq places for a very reasonable price. Can get quite busy and may need to line up, and they don't take reservation. 

Came here for table cooking after hearing that they do kbbq quite well, and I have to agree. Serving size was very generous - a portion for 2 was almost enough for 3 people. We got the pork belly table cooking which was seasoned very well. TIP: you have to ask for lettuce wrap, they don't serve it with the sauce / garlic as other kbbq places do. The table cooking also came 2 bowls of rice and a tofu stew, which was quite spicy but went well to down those carbs. There's also a tonnn of side dishes they serve, which are refillable! 

If that wasn't filling enough, I recommend getting their pork bone soup! Definitely better than the majority of the MANY other korean restaurants I've been to."
4,We go to this outback quite often and can rarely find anything to complain about. Last nights steak was delicious and our server Tyler was friendly and quick. Great family place :)
4,"Amazing! The restaurant is pretty awesome!

If you like BBQ this is the place for you! The menu has great options and varieties. 

Along with the BBQ and giant cups, they offer free ice cream!! 

Sweet!"
4,"Great place to grab lunch on a beautiful day.

I had the French Quarter Salad w/ grilled chicken and it was fantastic. Service was good and the food came relatively fast for a lunch rush. The best part of the experience was eating outside on a beautiful day, when we went inside to pay it was pretty loud."
4,We stopped by Costco to fill up our gas tank before heading back to California and found this place. They have a amazing selection of freshly baked bread. From sourdough to pumpkin chocolate chip. We will definitely be coming back each time we are in Vegas.
4,Always amazed at the great prices for organic etc. I love the size of this store and having limited choices that are all pretty decent.
4,Superb food and service.  Our favorite server Darryl is always amazing.  Jovanni was great too.  Always attentive.  Manager Todd was great also.  My favorite was the shrimp pan roast.  Steak is always cooked to perfection!
4,"For someone who lives in a studio and can only cook in the microwave, on the George Foreman and well...that's basically it, Trader Joe's has been a life saver.  A great experience every time I go.  No matter what day or time, there seems to always be something new to sample.  Chunky brownie pieces sprinkled with sea salt? Would have never thought to try, but ended up buying a whole packet.  Frozen meal section is wonderful--love the crab cake cakes and already seasoned and stuffed fish fillets.  Very reasonable prices for my student budget and I've noticed that I've been slimming down as well.  Good bye Senior 30!"
4,"We were walking down Yonge St and saw this restaurant. This restaurant looks very small until you walk upstairs and see an additional 50 tables or so.  This place was packed, but we got seated quick.  We ordered the all you can eat for $18 or so.  At first the service was good and food came fast, but as the meal went on service suffered greatly and at times we had to refills our own water glasses and RICE, Yes I said RICE was hard to come by.  The value was good, the food tasted good, but overall the service was very poor.  This place would have been 5 stars if the service was just 50% percent better."
4,"came here after bad experience at ihop.  fast service, clean silverware, got the order right, good and fast cook, will come back here often"
4,Everything I've tried has been good but I only like hot dishes and California rolls (but the spicy rolls are yummy). The place is small but service is fast. I like to support the small business so I'll come here for takeout lunch and grab a boba drink next door.
4,"My husband and I have been here twice, the first time being the day they opened and the second time, exactly two weeks later. It looks great inside. You'd never know it was previously an Eat n Park. It's got a large bar and tons of huge televisions. Both times my husband got the Cuban and one time I got the reuben and the other got the Cuban. We also got the fried pickles. Everything has been delicious. Service was very prompt and unlike the other review it seems obvious to us you can sit at the bar or wait to be seated by the hostess since there's a hostess stand. My only gripe is the prices. They're a smidge high in my opinion. 

As for the remark about the decor being sparse...It's a sports bar (not a gastro pub)... There are neon bar signs and televisions everywhere. Exactly what most people would expect. 

There aren't many non-fast food restaurants in Streetsboro and there are even fewer that aren't chains. We are excited to continue coming to the Happy Moose!"
4,"We were in town for 36 hours and went here twice.

Lunch:
The fried zucchini was real good.

The moose salad with added chicken was wayyy too much chicken for me. But good. 

The soup was green chili. Good, not great.

Dinner: 
Different salad, Cobb? Very good. No tomato, no cheese. 

Pork sliders with fries. Favorite thing."
4,"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Hickory Tavern in the Northlake Mall area of Charlotte. This sports bar chain restaurant offers a wide variety of menu items from chicken wings to crab legs and steak, although they streamlined their menu since our last visit.

Dora here. Hickory Tavern is one of those go-to comfort restaurants for me. You know what I'm talking about, right? When you're tired, don't really know what you want to eat or you just don't want to cook, Hickory Tavern offers an eclectic variety of choices for the whole family. And with all the big screens located on every wall, you can almost kick your shoes off and just relax. Almost. lol.

As you can see, we're early eaters. Anybody else staring at the clock, ready to eat by eleven thirtyish? No? Okay, that's why we beat the rush. :)

The Shrimp Po' Boy features breaded fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickle, cajun remoulade served on a toasted hoagie roll with a side of my favorite tater tots. I don't often order a Po' Boy sandwich but after enjoying this one, it might just be back on my items to order more frequently. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but the Cajun remoulade is what pulled this entire sandwich together. 

Dora here. Not sure why hubby's short on words today. Hmmm. Anyway, the Chicken California Sandwich minus the mushrooms and avocado was moist and juicy and tender, and the bun soft and fresh. Delicious!

Reminded me why I like this place so much, and I admonished hubby that we need to come back more often. It's just a bit of a drive to make it a regular place. The food seemed to take awhile, but so long as the iced tea kept flowing, not a problem. :)

We would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.
~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"
4,We were getting a car wash so we walked over to get a bite to eat because we could smell the BBQ in the air. The guy at the counter gave suggestions and had a good sense of humor. The food was good. Can't complain.
4,"If you have never been to an Outback Stake House you are in for a treat....or maybe not.  I have visited Outbacks all over the county and there are a few thing a that are consistent .  The salads are good, the awesome blossom is good, the coconut shrimp are good, but the stakes are hit or miss.

On thing you can always be sure of is the Prime Rib.  It is always good...if they have any left.  Often I eat towards the end of the night and they will be out of Prime Rib.

This particular Outback was clean, fast, and our server was great.  They had Prime Rib and it was as good as always."
4,"Came here for dinner recently and what you'll find here is your basic Hawaiian dishes.  Kauai Cafe is located off Tropicana and Hualapai (the Westside).  Upon reviewing the menu, the one thing I noticed is their prices.  Price here isn't too bad.  Dinner for two will set you back only about $20, which is not bad in my opinion.  The selection is decent and it's pretty much what you'll find at other Hawaiian location.  However, the one issue with Hawaiian food out here is that there's a ton of them and I have my favorites already.  So let's get to the review. 

As for their food, I got their Loco Moco since it's one of my favorite dishes. Plus, I wanted something with a huge protein count.  In case you're not in the know, a Loco Moco consist of rice, hamburger, eggs, and gravy.  KC mixes their gravy with mushrooms, which was a good touch to be different.  Seems boring, but I have one word for this order...delicious.  This order filled me up, but I wasn't done. I always get a Spam Masubi or Katsu Masubi at least once when I hit up a new Hawaiian joint.  KC didn't have a Katsu Masubi, so a regular spam it is.  I was little disappointed with KC's spam masubi only because it was small, not as tightly wrapped, and the spam was a bit undercooked.  

The restaurant is small, cozy, and the staff is extremely nice.  The owner's dad even stopped at our table to chit chat for a little bit.  Okay, a lot of bit. But he's cool and just added to our dining experience.  

I want to say that Kauai Cafe is just okay, but I really haven't tried anything else.  I still have their Kalbi to try (even though I stole a bite from TR), their Katsu, their Heineken battered chicken, and Ahi Ahi (can't remember if they have that one).  From the minimal amount of reviews so far, it's their Kahlua Pork that they are known for.  It's going to be tough for me to judge that one since I don't eat much pork.  I'll still make my way back to try the other dishes I missed.  Who knows?  Maybe my rating drops to 3 or goes up to a 5 based on my next couple of visits.  But as of right now, I'm just a fan.

Loco Moco:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2yrhVS5ouE7MxvNx8gUIvQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

A must have if you're eating here:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Xiijz8zyiTaG76CdzGhOAg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ"
4,"The place is super packed, always have a line waiting at the door.
We got the samgyupsal and budae jeongul for 3 people.
The portions were really good, both dishes were meant for 2 people, so for 3 people is was definitely enough. But for two people, one dish would probably not enough.
Each dish was 39 dollars, which is a tiny bit expensive for two people, since its not really enough for two people, so you'll probably have to get another smaller dish to share. But the quality of the food was great.
Even though it was super packed and super busy, the waitresses still paid attention to us (especially since we were in the corner, i was afraid we'd be neglected).
I will definitely come back again with my husband, and i recommend anyone to come here!"
4,Excellent food great service great price too. Keep up the good work!  I had the grilled pork with vermicelli noodle salad with spring roll it was so delicious I ordered more to take home. Loved it!!!
4,"Trader Joe's is my go-to grocery store in Madison. While they don't have the inventory of a large grocery store, they have all your standards and some pretty good frozen food.

Some of my trusty TJ's standards are the pork pot stickers, penne arrabiata, madras lentis, cheese and 2 Buck Chuck. I love that they always have samples, too. 

I love everyone who works at Trader Joe's, especially the men. Most of the guys who work there are very cute and very friendly. I'm starting to think that they're paid to flirt with their customers which is fine by me."
4,"Got a standard Red Door Facial here.  Great atmosphere- relaxing, friendly staff, clean and upscale.  Skin looks great the day after my facial- extractions removed acne, no peeling or recovery and skin is glowing.  Got a scalp, face and hand massage during my ""facial"", which was a nice surprise.  Little pricey, but will definitely return!"
4,Great place if you're craving Italian food. The pasta is especially great here. And the service here is outstanding and they are always super friendly. Great place to go on a date!
4,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018 - 14/100

Although slightly skeptical trying pho here in Phoenix area (since I'm from LA), I decided to give this new place a try rather than defaulting to some of the other vietnamese places in the area. 

This small little Vietnamese place offers more than just pho, however it seems like this is what most people are here for. I like that their portions are just right, soup is not too salty, and didn't taste like there was a whole lot of MSG in it. 

Not bad at all! Best part is it's really close to my boyfriend's school. - can easily come here for a quick fix or for a hangover cure ;)"
4,"Really good place to go to lunch during the work week. Healthy options that are tasty, and a nice patio to eat on if weather permits. It's unfortunate that it isn't open on weekends."
4,"??,mark here, cheap and delicious! Good place to go with friends!!!     Good for group"
4,"Does anyone not like TJ's?  Everything is reasonably priced, nice selection of organic products, free samples, inexpensive flowers and herbs, freindly/helpful/knowledgeable staff, decent wine selection, good cheese selection, excellent frozen meals and entrees.

I only wish they wouldn't discontinue their products.  Every now and then I go in and find that one of my favorites is no longer available :("
4,"Good place. Alot cheaper than chako. 
No sushi tho"
4,"Not very often a vegan goes to a steak house but sometimes when dealing with a large group of people, that's where you end up. While waiting for our table (my only complaint... our table was not ready until 45 minutes after our reservation), the owner was walking around offering samples and chatting with the waiting patrons. At that point, I mentioned my special diet needs and discussed options with him. I also alerted the waiter when it came time to place our orders. Neither the owner nor the waiter seemed annoyed by my special requests and went out of their way to make sure that I had an enjoyable meal of pasta and fresh veggies. Thank you for going above and beyond."
4,"Mahalo Nicole for finding this place, and I have to say this place is a gem!    I have to admit, it was quite a drive from Henderson to get here, but I wasn't disappointed at all.

Kauai Cafe is tucked away next to a gas station at the Smith food and drug shopping center on Tropicana and Hualapai, and has one of the cleanest open kitchen I ever seen in Las Vegas.    

I made a big mistake of coming here after the gym, because I was damn hungry, and went off ordering a bunch of stuff.   One of the best things about Yelp is how our members will post menu of most establishments, and what caught my eye the most was their Kauai friend chicken.     Don't get me wrong, I almost change my mind a few time because of the other mixed plates specials, but I'm glad I didn't.

From what I notice, Kauai Cafe will let you make a choice between white rice, fried rice or fried noodles at no extra cost.    I ended up with the fried rice, and it was loaded with spam, char sui, peas, carrots, and green onions, and of course it was made to order.    The rice was a little too sticky, but hey...we're from Hawaii, and it was okay.     The mac salad was good, and ate of all of it, but the Kauai fried chicken was a HOME RUN!     Think of a Huihui brine Chicken, with a Manapua man fried chicken crust.    It was juicy, and had a slight huihui chicken sweetness to the meat, but how the Heineken beer was  infused into this recipe was ingenious.    I have to rate  this chicken a 5 star winner, and I would drive 30 miles one way just to eat this again.      

I also ordered the Portuguese bean soup ( $2.50)  and it was better than Island Flavor, it was okay but I wouldn't order it again.       

What dropped my rating down from a five to a four was the Madasada.   Don't get me wrong the bugga was good, and had the perfect crust (which is nearly the same as Leonard's in Honolulu) which had a slight crunch to it, and lightness for most of the madasada, but the very middle was still cold.    I believe they keep the madasada dough in the cold storage, and it  wasn't completely thawed out, but  I still enjoyed it, and for some reason the Madasada was still good and moist the next day.     Yes,if they fix this....watch out Island Sushi, there could be someone in Las Vegas who might top you folks on Hawaii's favorite doughnut.     Again, it's a very easy fix for them to do, and my rating will shoot to a high five if get let it sit for a little while.    

I'm a  fan of this place, and will make another drive to check them out again."
4,"ONO GRINDS!

The folks here are so nice!  
...and they like talk story too... so settle in... order some kaukau and talk story for a bit.

They also do take-out and ... NOTE... there's a 20% off coupon for ""carry out"" on the back of the Smith's receipt.  (Smith's is the anchor store in the strip mall where KC is located.) 

Ok.... back to the restaurant and the food.  So, it's family owned and run. Like I said really nice folks here.  

It's a pretty small place... I think there are about 7-8 tables of 4, so if you bring a huge group of friends or the whole fam damily... you might be crowded a bit if they are busy.

We lucked out tonight... wasn't super busy so our group of 7 was able to sit together... 
They did separate tickets for us too which is a plus!

I enjoyed the Kauai Chicken... now I don't normally like fried chicken but this was not your ordinary fried chicken.  The batter was super light and crispy and NOT greasy, and had a really good flavor and held the moisture to the chicken.  They give you 2 huge pieces of chicken so I took half of my meal home.  It also came with either steam rice, fried lice or fried noodles.... I opted for the noodles and it also came with a scoop of mac salad. Noodles were really good and could be their own meal all on their own.

Mom had the Oxtail Soup.  She was a happy mamma.  It was a big portion too.  AND it came with 2 scoops steamed rice and a scoop of mac salad.  So, I took one of her scoops of rice home too and she took 1/2 of her soup home.  I got a taste of the broth and it was rich and flavorful.  I can see why she likes this.  It's definitely comfort food.

And then there was the malasada.  They made them FRESH for us.  And they were only $1 each.  Did I mention they were FRESH as in hot out of the fryer?  Oh man... FRESH is the only way to enjoy these bad-boys.  Broke-da-mouth good.  :)

We'll totally be back.  :)"
4,"We came here on a Friday night and the place was busy!

The atmosphere is very laid-back, casual, bright... very much a classic Italian family restaurant. 

We ordered the fried calamari to start and it was a very large portion, as the price reflects it. The calamari was really crispy and delicious. We were also given some bread and oil/vinegar to start. I didn't like how the oil/vinegar is poured for you.. I had to ask for a bowl of just vinegar (just my preference..). Would have been nice if there were bottles at every table.

I ordered the Penza pasta and it was delicious. The sauce was very flavourful and rich.. there was also a lot of pancetta."
4,"My review is really based on takeout. This is not my favorite restaurant to sit and eat, but the to go is always good. My little family of three can eat for $20 and there be enough for my husband to take to work for lunch the following day. There are great specials and everything we've had has been hot and freshly prepared - or cold and freshly prepared, as far as sushi goes. We are definitely regulars and are thankful this location is just down the street."
4,"I have been here quite a few times, and I have tried different things. My all time fail-safe item to order is the turkey pesto grilled sandwich. The combination of flavors is quite difficult to not love. I've tried their pastrami sandwich and I've also ordered the plain grilled cheese which truth be told was disappointing. I love their pumpkin loaf!! I don't buy it because the time I did I ate the entire thing in one day :( it's that good. Their bread is all flavorful. I haven't had any that I didn't like. The baked bread changes on a daily basis but you know what to expect and when since they do have a sign as to what they bake on a weekly basis separated into everyday of the week. The decor is simply cute. Reminds me of an older generation house hold. The store front and restrooms are clean always. The only thing keeping me from rating the five stars are the girls working there. Not to say they don't do their job, they just don't seem to ever want to be there and are plain flat when talking to them. Again, the items are all amazing. I just wish the people employed there were more interactive."
4,"When I worked in uptown Charlotte, this used to be my lunch spot once a week. I used to go on Mondays, less busier than the rest of the week and get there before noon to get seated promptly.

Service: Fast and polite, the couple that runs the place are always charming and aim to get the most people in and out with a smile

My favs to order:
red beans and rice (monday's)
grilled chicken breast sandwich
chicken salad sandwich
sweet tea
cajun fish special (friday's)

Ambiance: It is a bit dark inside and table are tight but the food and service totally makes it worthwhile.

I miss this place during my lunchs in NYC!"
4,"I may be in bizaro world but this Denny's was great compared to all the Cleveland Denny's. The decor was actually new and clean.  Not overly packed for a Saturday after hours. Food was out quick and it all was cooked to order. I had the peaches and French toast breakfast. I left satisfied and ready to sleep to catch my flight the next morning. Oh, I forgot, it is morning. Hope I don't miss my flight. Phoenix, AZ is a place I could possibly move to.  Also the waitress offered us a free dessert because the friend I was with did not write in his gratuity correctly. After he thought it was her mistake he then realized it was his mistake. Wow, now that's customer service."
4,"My friend and I were meeting in the area and we got a recommendation for this place. Did not know it was open 24 hours! The place was insanely busy with people waiting outside for tables. We got there early so we didnt have to wait long (around 6:30pm), but by the time we were leaving, there were a lot of people waiting.

The inside is pretty cool with people eating hot pots, sharing food at the elevated tables so you need to take off your shoes, and a different area for shoes on. 

Our service was was quick and to the point. When we sat for a little too long for their taste, we were handed the bill on the table without words. HST is included - wow! 

I was surprised that the menu had simplified chinese on it, and thought maybe this place was run by mainland Chinese, but it's hard to tell if were because all the servers were korean and everything felt it (joint venture? Great marketing?)

My friend  had a dumpling soup ($8). The dumpling was just okay but the soup was really good. I had the kalbi (beef short ribs) ($19) and it came on a sizzling plate with scissors. The portion was large but i thought i wouldnt be able to finish everything when it came, but oh I totally did. 

Really liked the place!"
4,I happened to stop in during happy hour. You can't beat the pricing. One of my rolls was deep fried and it was a tad over done unfortunately. Other than that it was
4,"Food was quite good.  We ordered Korean bbq steak and it was very tender and tasty.  However, this restaurant desperately needed a ventilation system.  I deeply regretted wearing my cashmere coat tonight.  I will take it to dry clean."
4,"I love this place. It's great when you live with just one other person because the packages of food are a little smaller, and we waste less. I love that this location has dedicated, free parking and I don't even care that it's sometimes hard to get in and out of. 
I could write for days about the Trader Joe's products I love...but just take my word that they are all good. 
I would love to see a second, larger location built in Madison. This store is great!"
4,Very good! Both the service and the food were  exceptionally good. I got a Chicken Philly and it was cooked perfect. No problems what so ever. The prices also didn't break the bank.
4,This place is a must stop destination if traveling to or through Streetsboro.  Great ribs and the best wings I've had.  So much better that the chains.  It's a family owned sports bar and the pride in ownership shows.   If you decide to drop in and she's on duty ask to be seated in Sam's area.  Sam is knowledgeable regarding the menu and beverage choices and will see to it that you have a great experience.  You can't go wrong here
4,Nice atmosphere. Kid friendly. Love the rib nights. Reasonable prices.
4,Fast and great service... Good bar/Greek food... Great music selection... Will return
4,"Great spot for a quick, cheap lunch uptown. The daily specials are great as you get a full meal including a tea for around $10 with tip and tax. The restaurant is unbelievably fast as I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes before. The Shrimp Creole and Baked Chicken my 2 favorite lunch specials."
4,"Excellent Fare in a Friendly  Atmosphere

Came down to visit the Latta Arcade/Brevard Court and while we were here, to grab a quick lunch on a beaufiful Saturday. After walking up and down the venue and reviewing a number of tempting menus, we decided on French Quarter.

The narrow confines of Brevard Court does remind you somewhat of the narrow streets and alley of the French Quarter but the comparison stops there. Nothing on the menu to suggest anything from Bourbon St.

Still a nice Greek/American menu with something for everyone.

Walked in and were seated immediately and were given our choice of where to sit. We picked a table by the window overlooking College Street with Romare Bearden Park immediately across the street. 

Both our host and server were great and efficient along with the young man I assume to be the manager.

From the menu I chose the Corned Beef Sandwich with Fries. The sandwich was excellent and one of the best I have had in a long time.

The French Quarter Salad is worth the trip itself. Large bowl lined with Pita's with and a mound of lettuce in the center and not just lettuce but a bounty of tomatoes, cucumbers, large fresh Croutons and an incredible amount of Chicken.

My wife always complains to salad that are just about all lettuce and maybe one sliver of tomato but not this time.

Fun spot to hand out. With construction and  Jazz festival at the Park, parking can be a bear but we ended up in the parking garage next door. 

Three of four blocks from Bank of American Stadium, one block from the BB&T Ball Park and within walking distance of a number of Arts Venues and Museums, this could serve as a good place to grab a bit when you visit downtown."
4,"Always consistent food.  Nothing crazy awesome, but better than many other places.  Portions are large enough.  Picky, but wish they had a hotter wing sauce to choose from.  Their hottest sauce is barely hot in other restaurants.  

Service can be a little mixed.  Not unlike other places.  Last night we went in and had the best service we have ever had there.  I missed her name, but she was extremely attentive and checked on us multiple times to see if everything was okay.  This was nice to see as they weren't very busy.  Too many times, not being busy turns into bad service.  Not this time."
4,"Pretty good! Kalbi tang, sul lang tang, dul bok kee were all tasty and decent prices. Would go again."
4,"Brisket is ok, ribs are excellent.  Service was great.  Lady working waited for me to drive down to pick food even though they were closing.  Great customer service and even gave me extra sauce.  Thanks"
4,"Simple... and fabulous. Fresh bread, fast and friendly service and reasonable prices are what makes me go back to Great Harvest whenever I am hungry and in the area. 

When you enter Great Harvest, one of the friendly staffers will most likely offer you a free slice of bread. Can't beat free! 

The only food served here are sandwiches, although they do have some shelves with different spreads for their breads and yummy looking breakfast cereals. Sandwiches are ordered piece by piece... Meaning you pick your bread type, your cheese, your meat, and your toppings individually. 

They also have the best chocolate chip cookie I have had in a long, long time."
4,"Everyone deserves to indulge sometimes and if you're looking to do so - try the Red Door Spa. My latest appointment consisted of an eighty minute Desert Hot Stone massage with my fave girl- Lisa. 

As you walk in, the staff always give nice welcomes and is eager to show you around even if it's not your first time. The women's changing area is very clean and stocked with everything a person needs to refresh (e.g., mouthwash, hairspray, perfume). The lockers are easy to use which is a plus.

I truly enjoy my spa experiences each time I come here. Lisa is a great massage therapist - she is attentive to what you want out of the appointment (relaxation vs. super tense areas) and is always checking in during the massage. 

I do think some things could be better and will outline them here. 

- the locker area is small and with another person there simultaneously = very tight quarters 
- there is only one women's restroom
- there is not a lounging area for after your spa experience and having one would be nice 
- they offer a subpar biscotti as a snack with water 
- the lounging area available as you wait to get called back for your massage is not very inviting - perhaps a bigger space with more relaxed seating options 
- the prices are steep - expect to throw down when you come 

Overall, I enjoy coming to the Red Door Spa once in a while and I always call ahead to make an appointment with Lisa. Cheers till next time!"
4,"The staff rocks (and they tell me the food is good, too).  Forget your plans; you could wind up staying here all night."
4,"Not bad! I'm a vegetarian and had the fit fare veggie skillet and it was actually pretty good. I like how it's served on the skillet it's cooked on. I wouldn't say it's the best quality food since it's not organic or anything, but for what it is..not bad! The service and staff were super polite and helpful."
4,"I pick up Chicken Pho from here often. I can't speak to the dine-in experience but, I do enjoy the tasty food. Chicken is high quality and consistently great."
4,"I went to Waverly's at the Cannery Hotel & Casino with a group of three couples on New Year's Eve before seeing a really fine performance by Anthony and the Imperials accompanied by a live 12-piece orchestra inside The Club.  Dinner offerings were limited to what appeared on a special New Year's Eve menu, so what was served was a bit atypical from what Waverly's normally presents.  But the food was not that far removed from this restaurant's normal everyday fare, which consists of fancy steakhouse offerings and fairly high-end Continental cuisine.

An immediate hit this night was great fruit bread in a bread basket, which tasted like raisin bread but better.  Lobster Bisque was smooth and delicious, served in a bowl that contained a couple of big hunks of lobster which were tasty although lukewarm.  Unfortunately, the same was true of a generous helping of Roasted New York Strip Loin which was well-seasoned and tasty but not very hot.  But a warm Cabernet Wild Mushroom Demi-glace helped add some heat to the entree.  Immediately preceding the main course were deliberately cold crab cake and good shrimp served with greens, carrot pieces, cut cucumbers, a bottle-shaped red tomato, almonds, and bacon in an interesting array called Waverly's Chopped Salad with Shrimp.  Bacon Cheddar Au Gratin Potatoes were hot and cheesy, and good glistening green beans sufficed as a second fine side.

Service was good, with very fast Iced Tea refills.  Dessert was another unusual treat, which I will call ""The Dessert With No Name,"" since even the restaurant acknowledged upon being asked that it was a concoction Waverly's chef threw together, and did not name.  With pieces of apples and a creamy cannoli-like filling in a pastry shell resting on a plate that was drizzled with chocolate and caramel loops, it looked like apple crisp, and had ""2012"" artfully emblazoned on its top.  The dish fell apart quickly with a spoon, and tasted very good.

Overall, this was a fine meal that would have gleaned five stars if only the lobster chunks in the bisque, and my strip loin entree had been served hot.  I had never encountered this type of problem here before when meals were individually cooked to order rather than en masse on a holiday.  So, I still regard Waverly's as the pride of North Las Vegas for upscale cuisine."
4,"We were so excited when this place opened. We were disappointed the first time we went. Hubby said the bar stools were too low for him to be comfortable and I found myself sliding around on one all over the floor.  But, since then, we've made a few trips back. We sit at a table now since he is in a wheelchair. The staff and patrons always hold doors for us, when we come in and when we leave. The server doesn't even hesitate to move a chair out of the way so I can get the wheelchair under the table..  Drink service is fast.  When I asked what beer the server would recommend, she chose one for me that was perfect and I will order from now on. The dining room is bright and welcoming and the huge televisions on the wall are easy to see. We are becoming Sunday regulars there."
4,"The only reason that this is not a 5 star review is because their dining area is a little dreary looking. I don't know that I'd want to sit and eat. Everything else, however, was really great! I was promptly greeted and given a menu. I was pretty overwhelmed by the choices, but I remembered a Yelp email I'd received that said they had awesome fried chicken. Never one to doubt Yelp, I ordered the fried chicken platter with fried noodles and macaroni salad. ($9.95). I went to run a few errands and picked up my order shortly thereafter.

When I arrived at home and opened the box, I audibly exclaimed, ""Holy Moly, that's a lot of food!""  It was- a HUGE quarter of chicken (thigh and leg) and another thigh, a nice serving of noodles, and a little container of macaroni salad. 

Biting into the chicken, I think I actually gasped. This was seriously the best chicken I've had...maybe ever! The coating was amazing. Not too thick or bread-y, and it had a delicious, sweet flavor. The chicken inside was hot and juicy. The noodles were also pretty good, lots of cabbage with them. The macaroni salad was okay, but nothing to rave about. But that chicken!!!

I have plenty left, so I'll be chowing down on it today at lunch! I can't wait to try some of their other offerings in the future."
4,"What a great little Pho place to open up in just the right area! The service here was excellent, very friendly and informative. While simple, the decor was nice and the place wasn't too cramped or anything, just cozy. The prices were very fair and reasonable for what you get. Good, fresh tasting Pho, generous portions, fair prices and a great location. While not the absolute best Pho I've ever had it's certainly worth a visit, I doubt anyone would be disappointed!"
4,"This place is a hidden gem! We decided to try it the other night when Hawaiian turned out to be the compromise between Korean and Chinese (don't ask...) for the hubster and I, and we were in the area.

Hubster ordered the mixed grill, and I decided to try the kalua pork po' boy. (Spelled poor boy on the menu, but...you know? I just can't) We also got a spam masubi.

Everything we got was awesome! Hubster was super happy with the mixed grill, especially the teriyaki beef (I think that's what it was). I tried a bit of the mac salad, and I was thrilled to discover that it wasn't overly mayo'd - something I can't stand. It was awesome.

I also loved the slaw on my po' boy for the same reason - nicely tart, lightly mayo'd (if there was any at all). You can get fries, mac salad, or onion strings with the sandwiches, and the onion strings were dangerously addictive.

Overall - good stuff. Solid four stars (five if there were more than two booths!)"
4,"I like this place for fast BBQ.  I always get the pulled pork and the baked potato casserole.  Their rolls are terrific too.  They have 3 different kinds of sauce in self-serve warmers.  I prefer the sweet.  They also have free ice cream cones for after your dinner.  On Sundays, kids eat free.  I can feed my family of 5 for under $30 and that is with drinks."
4,Very humble little joint that is between full service and fast service sushi. Good fresh food at very modest prices. Chef Ben has a hit! The kind of place you can eat at a few times a week and not break the bank.
4,"$10 all you can eat meat cooked on fire? Korean Grill House's lunch menu provides about the best AYCE deal in Toronto. That it's available on weekends is worth an extra star. 

Yes, it's not really Korean BBQ. But if you just look at it as lots of meat cooked on fire, is there a problem here?

They now seem to offer vegetable sides you can grill up for an extra $3 but, I mean, vegetables? Anti-meat? Are you serious? 

Don't let the small main floor fool you. There's a much larger upstairs.

Service was quite good."
4,They had a pretty good selection of tap beers which is an automatic 4 stars.  The fact that they have pool and a plethora of TV's made it even better.  I'd visit again if ever in the area.
4,"I enjoyed my visit here, the pho was pretty good, but there was only one server working and she was pregnant so it was a bit slow at times and some things were forgotten, but she was super sweet & workers like that make me want to come back, and I would because prices are very reasonable and the food tastes great, and that's most important."
4,"Trader Joe's is not for your full shopping trip.  But it is an excellent place to find great buys on certain things.  Their produce usually looks great and they have really good sales.  Reading the flyer is the best way to find out what is new and on special.

I can always find a new WOW item that will be great for entertaining at home or a pot luck at work.  One of my WOW items that I can not live without is the concentrated coffee.  All I have to do in the morning is add water or milk and then boom, coffee.  Microwave it or over ice.  Put creamer in or add some in your hot chocolate for a ""mocha"" drink.  I dislike brewing coffee for myself so I will always come back to Trader Joe's for that."
4,"We were a group of 4 had dinner last night 3 had burgers 1 had the rib special,chicken nachos for an app.
Service was very good,all agreed food was also very good much better than our first experience here a year ago"
4,My family goes to Outback often and this is our favorite location.  The service is always great and they are more reliable on cooking steak.  It's always a great experience.
4,Extremely friendly staff with a family feel to the restaurant. The husband and wife team provide excellent food at very economical prices. My personal preference is the chicken teriyaki with no vegetables. It has became a weekly staple for my family. I highly recommend for a quick bite out or for take out.
4,"Dueces L&L. Aloha Kauai Cafe:)

So good. I was rollin solo so I only ordered the short ribs, awesome. Portions are really large, ate the other half the following day for dinner. Except the mac, cause my chunky butt loves it. 

By the looks of it, I'm assuming it's family owned, support your small biznazz. Everyone was super friendly and helpful.

Can't wait to be hungover again so I can be cured with their island love."
4,"Amazing food great prices (happy hour) nice environment friendly atmosphere, definitely enjoy the fresh sushi and beef teriyaki, now serving imported beer"
4,"Waverly's Steak House is very unassuming from the casino. It has a single double door at the casino and it looks like it would be small & lowbrow. Waverly's is nothing of the sort. When you walk in you can see it stretch to the side and back. There are trees on the outside that mask the size from the outside. The decor is very upscale. If you come in in jeans they treat you as well as if you came in in your tux and fine dress. Waverly's is a fine upscale restaurant.

Visit the link below to get a look at the menu. I decided to go with the Rib Eye on this visit. I started it off with a Caesar Salad which was delicious. I was surprised by it's size. Much larger than I would have thought. There was just the right amount of dressing & cheese, and the croutons were crunchy and had a lot of flavor to them. My steak was prepared just as I had ordered it. Medium rare all the way through. That taste was wonderful. Some times I have ordered steak and had to add some salt to give it some flavor. That was not the case with this Rib Eye. It was tender, juicy, and full of flavor the way a good steak should be.

I choose a Potatoes Au Gratin as my side dish. The potatoes were about an eight of an inch cubed. I am not used to potatoes being served that way. Especially an Au Gratin. I tell you though, this was one of the best Potatoes Au Gratin I have ever tasted. The cheese in the potatoes let you know it was there, but did not mask the taste of the perfectly cooked potato. The seasonings were just right. I did not have to add any extra seasonings. I do have to say, if the order were doubled, it still would not have been enough. And the order that came was not small.

My wife had the lamb and a side of mashed potatoes. My steak was so much I did not taste the lamb. I had a few bites of the mashed potatoes though. The potatoes were so fluffy and light. Whenever I have had potatoes that fluffy in the past, they were also watery. These were not like that at all. They were so light, fluffy and tasty they seemed as if they could just float away. My wife tells me me lamb was very tasty and cooked to a perfect medium rare. This evening my wife and I choose just to have water to drink. So, no info about the wines they have. Sorry.

The service was pretty good. It started off excellent, but at some point they might have gotten overwhelmed. There was a period of over ten minutes that no one came by our table to give me a refill on my water. I had to stop eating my steak while I waited. I needed a drink. A bus person finally walked by the table and I flagged him down. He did promptly get me a refill on my water. He was also very apologetic. That is what has saved them from a very low service score. I do have to add, that a lot of people came in at that time and all the servers were very busy seating and arranging tables. Maybe that is what happened this time. When I got back to my steak, luckily it was still warm and wonderful."
4,"A nice surprise. To be honest, we were not expecting much out in big box store territory - thought that all would be very plain. Grazie's was tasty with nicely blended & fresh ingredients. Good menu range, not just the standards. Service also very good. Linguine marinate v good, as one other reviewer mentioned."
4,"Really cool place! The salads are fantastic! 
Always have good new beers to try. Bartenders are very friendly. Servers are very nice too! Will be back!"
4,"TJ's is my primary grocery shopping store. This location is nice with free covered parking. It can be a bit confusing because the parking upstairs is not free... But if you enter the garage from the side of Monroe and Lawn, it's the freebie side!

There are several things I enjoy about shopping at Trader Joe's. Their philosophy is that too much selection (i.e., 8 kinds of ketchup to choose from) can be overwhelming for customers. So, TJ's typically carries one variety of each item. I am definitely one of those people who can be overwhelmed by choice - I have found myself in other grocery stores staring at the wall of 10,000 kinds of tomato sauce, paralyzed. But at TJ's I can just grab what I need, knowing that it will be good quality. There are times when I can't find a very specific item for a particular recipe, and those times I do sometimes stop somewhere else on the way home to pick up that item.

I also appreciate the customer service. There are many employees walking around the store asking whether customers need help and they will go out of their way to make sure you get what you're looking for! I have had employees go and check in the back, walk across the store to help me find an item, or run to grab a better item at checkout if I didn't notice a bruised apple or something like that. And they always do it with a smile! Seriously, people are cheerful here.

Pricing is a huge incentive for me too. The prices at TJ's are not lower for every single item, but overall my total grocery bill is lower here than if I shop elsewhere. 

I really like the ingredient lists of the food items at TJ's. There are organic foods available, but even for the non-organic items, the ingredients are simple and the list does not go on forever. It makes healthy eating a bit easier for me.

Whenever I shop at TJ's, I leave happy and excited to cook at home. It makes grocery shopping enjoyable instead of a huge chore. TJ's for the win!"
4,"Probably one of the best Korean restaurant in the area. Tucked west on Finch, it's always packed during dinner time and on weekends. Biggity big portions!"
4,"One of a Korean 24 hrs restaurant in North York. Pretty busy place. Friendly servers and owners. The service is speedy in my opinion. 
The price is reasonable and their fish soups are my probably my favorite Korean dish. :)
It lost one star because they haven't clean up the table next to mine during our mealtime. It attracts food flies close to our food as well. If they can improve it, definitely keep food hygiene and comfort environment for all patrons"
4,"Just happened to be walking around with my tummy growling and howling for some food.  Korean BBQ!?!?!  oOOoOOoOhhh...  Let me tell you, for an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ that you cook directly on your table...Not too shabby!

You sit down, they hand you a menu with a la carte items, or you can pick the all-you-can-eat options...there are several, depending if you want fish or not and so on.  But what a reasonable price to pay and on top of that, they really don't care if you leave items you ordered behind.  Order as much as you want and as often as you want.  Busy grills at the center of the table all around and pretty chic modernized buffet.

Service is good and always coming around to either change your grill plate or refill an empty glass."
4,Second time around i have to say the burger was pretty good. Definatly above standards. The wings are also very good. Will deffinatly go back. They only reason i didnt give 5 stars was the service was slow today. Otherwise happy Moose was impressive today. Kudos to the owner and his cooks!
4,A very good place to get Italian good up in Vaughn. Staff was incredibly friendly and quick with whatever you wanted. Food was also AMAZING and different from ordinary dishes you would normally see on a menu. They separated their menu into the different sauces that the dishes came with which made it easier to decide what to eat. All in all a very good place to bring your family for dinner!
4,Great Barbecue and laid back atmosphere. Fries are to die for and the rest of the sides are also delicious. Their sauce is the best. Free ice cream to boot.
4,"I love my Waverly's as usual Daryl has served perfection with service and entree's that are amazing, would've been 5 stars if the overbearing New manager wouldn't have tried to throw her weight around at the hostess podium and belittle the hostesses work."
4,"It was a tad embarrassing when the boy and I walked and started looking at the menu.  I gazed the menu board and hand held looking for some Hawaiian fare.  ""WTF"", I thought to myself as none could be located.  I sent the boy back outside to tell me what the front of the business said.  I asked the gentleman behind the counter, how long that had been around, he said, "" We have been here since 2004.  The boy came back inside and said, ""Dad, we are in the wrong place.""  It was then I realized we were in a China-a-gogo and not the Kauai Cafe.........Awkward.

Starting over again, we went one business over and ended up in the right place.  Now...I knew I was in the right place.  Cool tunes and good vibrations, we were able to eat.  It looks like a stand and order king of establishment but we were told to find a seat.  From them on we sat as our order was taken and drinks refilled.  The service was friendly and we hung out for a while chit chatting.

The menu looked awesome with all manner of tasty island eats.  The boy went Chicken Katsu.  It came with the Mac salad and rice, but you can get fried noodles instead.  The chicken was deliciously moist and well protected in it's crunchy panko shell.

It went with a Kauai Cafe signature dish called ""Da Surf Rider.""  This plate was awesome!  It contained coconut shrimp which were of decent  size.  One of the more tastier coconut shrimps I have eaten.  Continuing on the plate had macadamia nut crusted scallops.  These were not huge but also very tasty.  Then there is the teriyaki beef.  Thinly sliced and a true compliment to surf and turf presentation.  The mac was good and the fried noodles were da bomb! 

Absolutely looking forward to going back!"
4,"My family and I stopped in to grab some food and catch the Caps game. I was kind of shocked by how empty it was for a Friday evening, but I liked the mellow atmosphere. The service was fantastic and the food was typical bar food. Nothing to rave about, but it did the job. They have a great local beer selection, which was cool because we came down from MD. I  went with the chicken quesadilla app. Filling, but no guacamole, so kind of a buzz kill. The Garlic fries were bangin. Saturate those babies in ranch and you'll die happy. A great spot if your looking for sports, apps, and craft beer."
4,"Very good service and the food was actually pretty tasty. Oysters on the half shell, crab dip and shrimp and grits. We would eat here again!"
4,"Eat all the carbs!

I've been coming here for lunch recently and it doesn't disappoint. The turkey pesto sandwich is delish! Usually my sandwich is made quickly. But even if it's not, I'm always too busy enjoying my FREE bread sample to notice. Everything I've ever tried from here - bread, pastries, cookies and sandwiches - has been amazing! The service is very good and I used to have a punch card - get a free sandwich or loaf of bread after the 10th purchase. Now, I think they do it all using your phone number, which is great because it's one less card to carry in my wallet. They have a schedule that tells you which breads and pastries are available each day. I'm so happy we're in pumpkin season because the pumpkin chocolate chip is ridiculously good. I could eat a whole loaf in one day (maybe I have. You'll never know.)

If you're a bread lover like I am, you should be shopping and eating here!!!!"
4,"i had one of the best massages ever here, i think my masseuse was Omi (msp?). the red door signature mani and pedi felt great with the paraffin wax. only issues i have with this spa is that it is quite pricey  and does not have full spa amenities such as jacuzzi, steam room, or sauna."
4,The sushi is descent and cheap. The veggie roll tasting the freshest. Not so good teriyaki to salty.
4,"Comfortable atmosphere, good service, good food. Amanda was our server and she was just wonderful! I had the buffalo chicken dip appetizer and the jumbo pretzel sticks appetizer; both were delicious. They serve Pepsi products (I prefer Coke) but that wasn't enough to dampen my spirits. I'd definitely come back."
4,"Great pho! All I ask is that you get plastic chop sticks, wood is too rough when eating pho."
4,"Fun place to visit now and then, but not where I choose to do my main shopping. They have a great selection of food that isn't run of the mill, for a decent price. Clean, organized, and easy to navigate...unlike some stores.

I also love the fact that I can park in the garage, cause Monroe is a bugger to find parking, sometimes!

My faves include the curry chicken tenders, pretzel rolls, pistachio meats, and dried pears."
4,"Kauai Cafe is a new spot that had its Grand Opening today, specializing in Hawaii Local Food located in the corner of Tropicana and Hualapai, 

My family and I dropped in for an early dinner tonight, hungry of course, or as my dad likes to say...""we da Flemings and we HUNGRY!""...in that Clyde Klump voice. Lol. I think our family had a fair spread of the whole menu tonight. The menu isn't too big, yet its not too small. You have your breakfast items, your specialty items, main mix plate items, burgers and sandwiches, and sides. The prices weren't too bad either.

Dad and the lil bro had the ""Linaka's Mix Grill"" which consisted of Teri Pork, Char Siu Chicken and Kalbi. I didn't get to have any, but it looked really good, and of course will be my first pick when i go back. 

I had the ""Kauai Chicken"" which is  Quarter hind chicken dipped in Heinikein Beer batter, and deep fried. Ohhh man...this dish as we like to say in Hawaii, was 'Broke Da Mouth!"" meaning DELICIOUS! It was so juicy and crispy on the outside. I will def be back for the chicken. The mac salad was a little bland for me. It could've used a little more mayo i think, and since the rice was still cooking I got the fried noodles instead (which was pretty good). 

Most plate lunches comes with  your choice of Rice, Fried Rice or Fried Noodles and Mac Salad. 

 Out of everyone that was there with me, these were the only two that stuck with me, so I decided to share. The rest, well its up to you to find out. 

For the first day open, I believe they have a good thing going here, and down the line they can work out some kinks. But other than that, the staff is friendly, and food is ono, and I say E Komo Mai to this new Hawaiian Restaurant in Town. Aloha!"
4,"We were not planning on coming over here originally. We were supposed to go to the Korean restaurant beside this for chicken. It turned out that the hours posted in Yelp wasn't accurate, it wasn't open until 430 pm . Anyhow, this place was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting it to be so so like other 24hr Korean restaurants. When we came in the place was clean (unlike Owl of Minerva with the sticky floors and unpleasant odour or Kayagum with soiled seats and stinky tables). This place serves better banchan and they dont skimp. We ordered kalbi, it was a huge erving.  Tender and juicy meat paired with purple rice, bf was in meat heaven. I ordered my favorite gamjatang but didn't expect much. It turned out this was better than others I've tried. Meat was fall off the bone tender. I wish I requested for a spicier version. I'm curious to try other dishes. It's a good thing its  open 24 hours, I can give in to Korean food cravings anytime of the day or night for that matter."
4,"Our first time here and we were so pleasantly surprised. Excellent sushi rolls, spicy edamame, egg drop soup, reasonable happy hour prices and fast service. We will definitely be back soon!"
4,"I've eaten one of the tastiest yet cheapest meat in Toronto at this place. The steaks, chicken, lamb and, pork are marinated in sauces that make the dish simply delicious. No matter how much you cook it, the taste is still amazing because the sauce is perfect. I LOVE the steaks here... 

There is a few cons: 1) The sea food dishes, they did not really have anything special about them, taste was just OK, it lacks the perfect sauce the meat has and, 2) The salads are not worth the price and not tasty at all. Again though, the steaks are DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED."
4,"As a poor college student I truly value a place that allows me to stock up on produce and reasonably priced red wine for under twenty dollars. I never had to wait more than 5 minutes to check out, even when I wouldn't mind waiting there's always someone who is ready to get you out. Though I might not grocery shop here regularly since they don't provide a lot of other items that other grocery stores offer but what they do offer makes me look forward to shopping here."
4,"Great Sandwiches!  THE BEST Sweet Potato fries (with honey butter)!!!  Draft Beer specials on Thursday...we love to go get our 16oz Blue Moons and unwind.  The service is outstanding and always on time. Will definitely be back soon, especially since I live walking distance."

So we ditched the kids and had a date night in vegas, we were staying in the Cannery and figured we'd just see what was in the hotel. I was not expecting this.

First off there was a live piano which in and of itself is pretty impressive.  In fact I was wearing shorts and a T-shirt and honestly felt bad about my attire.  This feels like a really fancy restaurant that you'd be paying 50+ a plate to eat at even if the food isn't that fantastic.  Well being that it was date night I had to have a margarita (one of my favorite treats thanks to living in New Mexico for 20+ years) which was great.

Based on the reviews of a few other people we decided to get the Portobello Frites which were absolutely amazing, and I'd highly recommend them to anyone. I got a steak and it wasn't any better or worse than most other restaurants so I can't really say come here for the steak but it was exactly what I ordered.

The service was fantastic, I wish I'd gotten the name of my server (or rather I remembered it 2 months after my visit as I've slacked on finishing up this review) as he was by far the best part of the meal and is the reason I'm giving Waverly's 4 stars instead of 3.

I honestly had no expectations going into this meal other than hopefully a lovely meal with the wife, I was impressed with how nice the place looked (even if it's just a facade for the tourists) the staff were dressed to the nines, the live pianist and the other small touches all made for a surprisingly elegant feeling evening for a price far lower than I expected based of what they were trying to appear to be."
4,Service is always great. I've come here a few times and they always get my order right. The bloomin onion and the comp starter bread are great. My favorite item on the menu is the brownie a la mode. Warm and rich in flavor.
4,"I made a complete slob of myself in here the other night. 

Beef, chicken, lamb, squid, tongue, shrimp - how may I count the ways?"
4,"It was very good.
Service could've been better. The price was great.
I was truly impressed with their bucket of boat trash. Super cool. 
We ate wings and that. Had a pleasant time."
4,Best baked breads I have ever had. Great customer service. Chocolate chip scones are yummy.
4,"Loved the beer.
Loved the TV screens
The waitress was lovely and walked miles (what was her number?)
Food good!
Great place for a Brit to chill!"
4,"Grew up eating Dickey's in Texas. So excited there's a couple locations in Phoenix. After reading some of the reviews, I was happy that the service I had was good rather than abysmal.

Our order was taken quickly, food brought out a few minutes after, and none of the staff were acting unprofessional as far as I could see. I had the quarter plate with sliced brisket, potato salad, and cole slaw. I like the smaller portion of the quarter plate since the regular 1 meat plate is a bit much for me. Cole slaw isn't weighed down too heavily with mayonnaise which is nice. Potato salad is super creamy. Accompanying roll was soft and buttery.

Yum! If you like Texas style BBQ, try Dickey's."
4,"We stopped in for dinner at Kauai Café, the newest spot to serve up local island grindz.
Perusing the menu, they got your usual local standbys, but they also got a Specials board right outside before you enter that's worth checking out.

People also rave about this Heineken Beer Batter Fried Chicken, but a piece of paper popped out of the menu that sealed the deal for me. The Lau Lau Feast (Served Fridays and Saturdays) is a taste of Hawaii that is totally worth getting- Lau Lau, Kalua Pig, Rice, Mac Salad, Lomi Salmon, Ahi Poke, Squid Luau, Chicken Long Rice, Haupia, and of course, POI....Most definitely a feast for a king, or a ""Hungry Hawaiian"" in this case...;)

I killed it, but I just wish they gave more poi than a half full cup. Wifey ordered up a Surfrider Platter which she seemed to enjoy as well. Kauai Café probably ranks right up there with Island Style, Island Flavor, and 808 Mixed Plate. If you're in the area and your opu is itchin' for some onolicious kau kau, Kauai Café is the spot!......ALOHA!!!"
4,"Delicious! And the staff was nice.

I love the sauce on the food and can't seem to get enough of it. Smells GREAT! I had the beef brisket. I hope it was that... not that I think about. I can't recall exactly what the meat was. The bread was really good for some reason. Better than I would have expected. So the place is not bad. I haven't decided if I like Tom's BBQ's sauce better or not yet.

Plan on coming again to try some more variety of food."
4,We came here for the lunchtime AYCE bbq deal. It was super worth it for the price you pay! They also have a lot of side dishes they offer for free -- the spicy bean sprouts were so good!
4,"I have gone to two different Hickory Taverns within the last 3 weeks.  Not much different.  Big screens, TVs...a bar, and a decent menu.  The atmosphere was quiet during the day visit for lunch.  The night trip was also quiet...not too busy.  Service was typical for a bar restaurant.  The servers have to wait multiple tables....so not much interaction.   The food, especially the sweet potato fries, that were drizzled with honey and butter was good.  I ordered a salad with chicken.  I was surprised that the grilled chicken came out on the salad very cold....as if it was removed from freezer.  However the server was very quick to get a fresh salad topped with a very nicely grilled, chicken breast.  very good.  The other thing that provided the ""bar"" feel at one of the restaurants....was ordering bottled drinks (beers and coolers) and not being offerred a frosted mug or glass.  I thought that was fairly standard.  Should not have to ask...should have been offered.  I will return....with family and friends to see how larger crowds are handled.  good locations and good parking."
4,Orlando did an amazing job with my Keratin Complex treatment. Such a kind and caring professional!! He was so easy to talk to and listened so carefully. He even took the time to consult my cancer survivor daughter on hair extensions without an appointment!! He truly cares about his customers!! It was an amazing experience and we will definitely be back!!
4,"I love RED DOOR SPA.  It is a MUST trip at least 2x a year.  But this time I went to a different location to met up with my cousin.  We both had the milk and sugar body scrub, plus the 60 mins massage.  Love the location (upstairs).  Love the look of the place.  But the only thing missing was the bigger relaxation area and changing area.  Maybe because I am spoiled by the Wigwam location, but I like to lounge around a bit before and after my services.  Or course, the services is always top notch!!!"
4,"Really chill place, good service. The name is misleading to be honest- it is more Greek than Cajun. Still, we had a good time and will likely go back. Good beer selection, we didn't try the food, maybe next time."
4,"Been here a couple of times and the restaurant is usually busy during the weekends.

Went there on a Friday evening and had to wait 20mins for my table.
We order the following

-Basta Pasta, it's a cream sauce base with shrimp and green onions along with their homemade fettuccine is my all time favourite pasta ! I order it every time I'm there.

I can't stress enough how good their pasta is ! ( except the ravioli I had last time...Mmm..tasted frozen to me, therefore I prefer to order their fresh pasta instead from that moment on )

-Giovanni Pizza, Love how thin their pizza is and it's so crispy !!

-Had special of the day calamari, it was fresh ! nicely battered where the calamari was just nicely covered and fried, you can still taste how fresh the seafood is !

** Their bread that they serve is always a downside for me, because it tastes bland and not fresh**

Overall i would like coming here if I want a nice plate of pasta, but if you are a person who likes big portions beware this place doesn't serve big portions of pasta."
4,I had prime rib there and it was out of this world! Very worth the money..
4,"A group of 7 of us decided last night (a Saturday) to try to get into Marcello's, another Italian restaurant in the area. Bad idea...the wait time was over 1 1/2 hours....and this was at 5:30pm (fairly early for a dinner crowd). Opting not to stay, we decided to visit Grazie.

When we arrived, the place was busy, but the host spoke to his manager and a table was set up for us. We were seated after a 5 minute wait time and our server was over shortly thereafter. His name was Mathew and he introduced himself, took our drink order, explained the daily specials and off he went. He was spectacular....as many in our group can be a tad demanding on a server, he never lost his cool and was efficient, friendly, outgoing and attentive.
Breakdown of order for 7 ppl:
* Person 1 ordered the Giovanni Pizza (tomato sauce, pepperoni spicy sausage, red onion and pepper flakes)- he ate the entire pizza himself....said it was fantastic. Cost was $16
* Person 2 ordered the Steak Special - it was a massive hunk of meat....probably 12 oz, cooked to perfection and it smelled oh so good. It came on a bed of mushrooms, rapini and carrots. The person who ordered this loved it...said it was one of the best steaks he's ever had and his plate was clean when the bus person came to clear the table. Came with a hefty price tag...$38, but I thought it was reasonable considering the size and cut of meat....plus he polished it off...so you know it was good.
* Person 3 & 4 - they shared a Margherita Pizza ($11) and one had the steak (described above) and the other person ordered Penza (rigatoni in a spicy red vodka sauce). They both loved their meal.
* Person 5 & 6. One started with a Insalata de Mercato (mixed green with a balsamic dressing).She loved it. They then shared another one of the Specials...Seafood Pasta....spaghetti with mussels, calamari, etc. They loved it. Sopped up the sauce with their bread...we counted 14 mussels in the pasta..so there was lots of seafood in the dish. Our server said it was a big dish and best for sharing, which he was correct about.
* I had the Romana Pizza ($16) - Potatoes, rosemary, spicy pancetta, diced tomatoes with cheese (no tomato sauce). This used to be one of my favorite pizzas....but they've changed it. Before it used to be thinly sliced potatoes...now it is shredded potatoes with just a hint of rosemary. I don't think I'd order it again as it was lacking something. I asked for spicy olive oil (which helped), but is was a total let down over-all. My pancetta also had small pieces of bone in it...so every now and then I had to stick my fingers into my mouth to fish out a small bone (it was either that or spit it out into a napkin)....

So....6 ppl really enjoyed their meal with me being the odd man out. Service was fantastic (cheers to Mathew). It got very crowded just prior to our food coming out and there was a considerable line-up at the door when we were leaving. I'd go back to try their steak...it looked and smelled fantastic."
4,"This place is open late and is very popular. There's always a line up, however the wait time isn't that bad after 7 pm is 10 mins. The quality of food is good, the price is a bit high considering the service is quick bit all that attentive. I recommend this place it is a good alternative to the Korean eatery that is practically next door on Yonge St."
4,"Stopped in for a quick lunch and beer with a friend. They have specials pretty much any time you are there for food and drink. They also have  different food specials for each day of the week. They are all listed on the menu so you can plan ahead if you want to try something out. We went on a Tuesday and the specials are new Orleans themed. I expected this place to bigger but it is pretty small, though can fit a lot of people. It was pretty quaint though. I was a little disappointed at the menu options. This is mostly a salad, sandwich, and burger place. Our server was very attentive and friendly. The staff sat us right away as well and they were super nice too. Food was ok but I just got a club sandwich and fries. Friend for a burger and salad and said it was alright too. Would come here again if looking for somewhere fast and close, but I'm new to Charlotte and have so many other places to try!"
4,"Really good food although the service is not that great, some rude servers but overall a good experience. We ordered T1 ribs for two, and it was well enough for two people, meat was very good, tofu soup was great, and a lot of side dishes. The rice is not the best and we did not finish it."
4,"i come here often for the fresh bread. i love crazy things like sunflower seeds and flax all with wheat. i don't mind paying up to 6 dollars for a loaf of bread if i love it and that i do with this little bundle of carbs. (good carbs though! promise!) as soon as you walk in they offer you a slice (more like a chunk, but I'm not complaining!) of one of their breads offered that day.
my three favorites of the healthy loaves being flax oatbran, dakota, and the high 5 fiber. the cinnamon swirl always makes me want to buy a huge loaf of it and warm it up topped with some vanilla ice cream. i'm sure it would be good right now with the holidays! i would go and try a chunk of it if i were you. they have sweet and savory breads, so whatever your little tastebuds desire that day you can get your fix!
i have never had any of their sandwiches made in shop, but i can only imagine the love i would have for them. also make a note that they are closed on sundays.
happy loafing! be sure to get a punch card because i am sure you'll be back."
4,"Just when I thought I couldn't feel any fatter, I went to eat at the Korean Grill House.  Maybe I was challenging myself when I ordered the all you can eat Korean BBQ, but it was worth it.  The food was excellent and well priced and the wait staff was awesome.  The kimchi, radish, bean sprouts and tofu leave you feeling like you've even eaten a few vegetables.  We loved this place, especially my kids.  They had a blast watching the food cook before their eyes and we will definitely be back!

Kids 2 and under are free!

 Most likely if you have stomach issues after you leave, it just means you stuffed yourself with too much meat. . ."
4,Huge portions! Good for sharing. Really reminds me of my meals in Kauai & the big Islands. Laulau feast has a lot of selection. Some sides were too salty though. Oxtail soup is very good (comparable to the one at California casino). Huge hit with the kids!!! Will be back.
4,"Stopped in here on our way from Glendale, AZ to Salt Lake City, UT.  Grabbed gas and found this place open and ready for customers.

The woman inside answered my silly questions and gave us samples of a few items.  
Everything was great!

I had a small piece of blueberry cake and should have bought the whole cake.
My breadwise companion had a slice of bread with butter.  What kind, I do not know exactly, but it was tasty and we should have purchased more.

I heartily a-proof of this place.

Proof, yeah I said it.  You'll either get the joke or not.  
Rise up to the challenge, knead it over in your breadbox a while."
4,"Was recommended this place by a couple of friends, who also joined me - have been craving some authentic Italian all holiday season. 

ATMOSPHERE:

The way the tables were structured made the place feel a bit cramped, but it also allowed more seating for what is clearly a pretty popular place. We were lucky to get a table in the corner, and the servers were able enough to get to us when they needed to. The dining area had a nice buzz going on, but still quiet enough to have some dinner conversation. 

SERVICE:

Our food was fairly quick, and our waiter came to us when we needed. It seems as though most of the server's here are actually Italian - our waiter was at least, as he clearly demonstrated when ""showing me up"" with the proper pronunciation of ""Bruschetta"" lol.

FOOD:

Started out with the Bruschetta, which was fair. The bread could have been a bit crustier, though there was a decent amount of seasoned tomatoes on top. 

Although this place had a decent selection of pizzas, I went with the ""Penza,"" which is a Rigatoni with vodka, pancetta, green onions and chili pepper. The ingredients were fresh, the pasta was cooked well, and the pancetta really brought out the flavour of the dish. The creamy tomato sauce was among the best I've had.

VERDICT:

I'll be back to try some of the other pastas. Place has a decent drink selection as well."
4,"I went there with my boyfriend yesterday for dinner. The place is really nice and clean but seems constantly queuing up. We had our seat at the traditional Korean table where you have to curl your legs to seat. It is an interesting dining experience but a little bit uncomfortable. We ordered a beef BBQ combo and a seafood pancake. The seafood pancake is soooo good! The pancake was made with lots of seafood, green onion and eggs and the pancake sauce is so yummy. The Beef BBQ came with a spicy tofu soup and two bowl of rice. The beef is very fresh and the portion is enough for two ppl. Btw, Their beef intestine BBQ looks so yummy as well as the spicy seafood stew. I will definitely come back and try soon!! 

And the best part is this restaurant is just beside the Coco tea shop!! So you can takeout some bubble tea while you are queuing up for the seat. I ordered a large milk green tea with pudding ( all-time favorite). And their new Yakult bubble tea is a great choice after the grease BBQ meal."
4,Ordered food from here the first time through Postmates and the artichoke dip was amazinggggg and so was the other food i ended up going again the other day with a coworker and dined in and had the fried Calamari it was to die for first time trying it and loved it the blackened fish sandwich on the other hand was mediocre but overall good experience
4,"Don't be scared off by the cannery ...this is indeed a darn good steak house in a very mediocre casino. once we got over a reservation snafu when we first arrived  ..it was onward and upward from there. food and service are first rate. what makes cannery even extra special is that prices aren't nearly whats charged for similar food out on the strip. I had a delicious 16 oz. rib eye served perfectly medium..my wife had what she termed ""award winning"" blackened salmon and my son had a nice slab of prime rib. potatoes come with all the entrees. our waiter and his helper worked their butts off on a very crowded evening. Even the hostess/manager was assisting with delivery of meals. a true team effort. cocktails were potent...restaurant has an attractive ambiance....its all pretty positive and a very good value. After dinner we wandered outside to see America in 100 degree heat. great evening!"
4,"Refreshing after eating at Island Flop.  I was eating at another Hawaiian Food place when one of the employees told me about them.  Hard to find at first, they are on the west side corner of Hualapai and Trop.  Avoid the poke like any other place they just use frozen tuna and mix some things in there.  Whatever not worth mentioning.

Great that they provide a choice between rice, fried rice and noodles as your starch.  On weekends they have a Hawaiian plate special with everything.  Chicken Long Rice and Squid Luau could have been a little better, but still they put the effort in with Lau Lau, Kalua Pork, Lomi Salmon and Poi!

Menu is small, but the food is good enough to eat there once a week.  Definite difference in quality here as opposed to other places.  

Prices reasonable for good food and the service was friendly."
4,"Cheap wine.  Booya!  I came from WA where it was dubbed 3-buck Chuck and was actually $3.99 but here, it is actually $2.99!!  Yessssss, solid win for Wisconsin here.

I do have to say, I have to mentally prepare myself for parking.  You can either pay for the small lot right by TJ's or fight out a spot in the lot below where every turn makes your wheels squeal and the spots are for cars you could probably throw because they are so small.

After you make it through parking, usually you have to fight the mob of people.  This location is small.  I kind of enjoy my grocery shopping experience and take in what the store has to offer but everyone here is bustling and I feel like I am always in someone's way.  

But...it's Trader Joes.  They have some fun food.  Their juices are awesome.  Beer selection is pretty legit.  Produce is on par.  I love their chocolate covered coffee beans.  Yeah, I walk through and do find great items to snack on but they also have great options for actual meals.

I have never had an issue with the staff.  I have also never really asked them any questions or needed help."
4,"Vibe:
The restaurant was clean. I like how they have tables and area that u can seat on a pad for a more Korean dining experience. 
The service was good. Greeting when enter and water filled frequently.
Food:
Bulgogi plate was good but pork bone hot pot was average. 
Price:
Low-medium"
4,"Had the Thursday lunch special of baked chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy and broccoli and it was very, very good. Portions were good size and the food was HOT. Very friendly staff and great service. I'll be back.  Bargain for the price!"
4,"Perfect hot soup for battling strep and a fever. Ordered the pho with chicken, shrimp and beef added veggies ( broccoli, cabbage, bok Choy, and carrots) for an additional 2.00. The homemade hot sauce spicy red chili and I believe lemon grass. Prices are reasonable, it's a clean restaurant and the staff is super friendly and accommodating. They have small plates and large bowls and you can order less noodles if you need to. I love the idea of doing so less waste. Great new pho place near my home."
4,"The Marks St store has moved next door to a larger space, and it makes a difference. There's more merchandise on display, more accessible and attractive than before. It seems like employees are more attentive to customers too. 

This time I got the flax oat bran bread ($6.95/loaf), which was very good. There's still too much sodium and prices are still too high, but overall, an improvement at this branch, so I'm upping my rating to four stars."
4,"My husband proclaimed, ""I want to get you liquored up tonight!""...so off we went to Happy Moose. The parking lot was packed but we were able to get a couple seats at the bar. A number of drinks containing 3 Olives cherry and some apple pie moonshine shots and I was toast. The fried pickles were delicious and that's not the booze talking. We had pretty good service too! Of course we will be returning!"
4,"Finally, a Hawaiian spot in South Summerlin!  

I was a little afraid to try this place.  The location was previously inhabited by two failed Mexican restaurants.  I figured the spot must be cursed. But, rejoice all, I think this place will last.   

Although sparse and plain, the cafe serves up some pretty decent Hawaiian fare.  The menu is nowhere near as large as places like Island Flavor or Aloha Kitchen, but they seem to have a handle on the classics. If you're looking for Lau Lau, however, you're out of luck.

I tried the Kalua Pork & Cabbage ($10.95) which came with two scoops of rice and mac salad. Unfortunately, I found the rice a tad wet and mushy.  Maybe they need a new rice cooker?  But, otherwise, I thought the pork and cabbage was divinely moist and flavorful.  Just add a little Hawaiian chili water and dig in.  I also appreciated the macaroni salad that wasn't caked in mayo.

I also ordered the spam musubi which came freshly made and piping hot.  I would definitely order it again (it was a pretty big brick for $2.00). Prett-eh tasty.

I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed that they start serving Lau Lau (hint, hint, nudge, nudge, Kauai Cafe). Then I'm in trouble."
4,"As another Yelper said, don't be alarmed that this establishment is in a casino, it is worth the trip there. The service from Fredrick was exceptional, all we're on point! Food was fabulous, we were a party of four and everyone was very pleased with their meals. We will be back, the only downfall of the evening was wading through the sea of smoke to and from the restaurant, but Waverlys itself is smile free."
4,"Most of my family lives in California, where everyone simply buys everything at Joe's.  I only wish I lived closer to this one.  The prices are good, and it's good quality stuff.  Have I liked everything I've tried here?  No.  But the worst loser of a product won't set you back much here, and once you know what you like it's usually there.

The only thing I don't care for is the amount of packaging, especially on the produce.  It's mostly not even recyclable here.  Okay, also there have been some not-quite-fresh bakery items.

Other than that, wonderful.  The people who work here seem genuinely enthusiastic, which makes this a pleasant place to shop."
4,"Enjoyed a quick but cute Valentine's Day dinner (I say quick because I wanted to catch the all-star game.. so I wanted to eat, get back into sweats, and watch the game!!! 

Waited for 20 mins to get a table no problem grabbed a drink by the bar and we chatted with the friendly bartender. 

When we sat down, our waiter came over and offered to read the specials of the night. we both ordered the special soup- potato,brie and bacon soup and it was sooo good. 

I ordered the Penza pasta added chicken and it was flavourful and creamy. My bf had the pizza and it looked really good, he said the crust was perfect and the toppings were very flavourful. 

knocking off 1 point because of the music.... it was a little loud and too euro.. it would have been nice to listen to some smooth jazz or something a little soft."
4,"Sushi is good and quick. It's certainly not the best of the best bit it's solid. 

The best part is they have yummy offerings for the non sushi eaters in my life.

Service is always quick and friendly."
4,"Reasonable AYCE menu - we opted for $17.95/person which included lamb and shrimp. This did include small selection of panchan. Could add $3 extra for veggies, but we did not. Standouts were lamb, beef ribs, tongue, and liver. Basic service. Decor was super casual."
4,"We were here tonight for dinner with a bunch of work colleagues, we're pleasantly surprised at the menu and all of the different choices.  

We each ordered a different kind of pasta that all came out quickly and perfectly cooked. The noodles taste as though they were homemade.  

The servers were all quick and courteous, and the host sar us immediately when we walked in the door.  

The restaurants decor reminds me of Italy, has a lot of authentic pieces and paintings.  Lots of room to seat large parties as well as an outdoor patio."
4,"Fried onion rings on my salad??? These people know how to make this girl happy!
This is my 1st visit to a Dickie's, it looks like it's right out of OKC. Instead of our traditional salsa bar they have a ""sauce bar"" complete with 4 flavors and an ICE CREAM MACHINE!

Yes, I ordered the Smokehouse Salad in a BBQ place. They were kind enough to substitute chicken for brisket and it was all white moist breast meat on fresh crisp romaine.  Very nice. Came with a delicious, albeit unhealthy white roll slathered in butter. 

I'd come back!"
4,"Orange Chicken, Guacamole, Three Buck Chuck, Frozen Brown Rice, Naan, Frozen Indian Dinners, Consume, Return, Repeat. 

I love this place so much. Just go there and eat all the things. You will be happy you did."
4,We tried the 3 course meal specials. I had the snapper and wife had the prime rib. Both were good. The appetizers were also delicious but portions were small. The waiters was excellent and friendly. The ambiance was nice.
4,"We had to change our plans since the haboob was heading our way.  A friend's daughter was working near by so decided to give this new place a try.  I am always skeptical when a Chinese joint trying to do Japanese food.  This place is hidden behind Applebee's and next to a donut shop. 

They have a good selection of bento boxes. I had the bento #3 that came with California rolls, Teriyaki chicken, and dumplings. They even have $1 off of all bento boxes. Place is charming, staff is very friendly, and prices quite reasonable.  I'll definitely try this place again."
4,This place has good Italian food and the bonus is that trey deliver. I ordered a pizza with bocconcini and ham and it was good other than the fact the pizza arrived cold. It was good after I warmed it up. Will order again but will ensure the don't take too long for delivery!
4,Contacted Aaron Pools per my home warranty. Receptionist was very pleasant scheduling an appointment. Service technician A.J. did a great job. Fixed the leaks in my system and my pump is now running great. Lucky everything was covered in the warranty.
4,Been here a bunch of times and the food has been consistently good! nice ambiance and service was always good as well.
4,"For what you pay, its pretty good sushi. I get the Happy Hour with a Jalapeno Roll and then ask for a suggestion for my second roll with miso soup for $9. I go 2-3 times a month and they now recognize me which I love. Always friendly."
4,"If it is wasn't for the haboob, the girls that came to visit sickie me would have eaten in the East side.  They stayed on the West side and we decided to go to Chef Ben's because a friend's daughter works there and it is her first job.  Us Aunts wanted to say hello and give her a hard time.  he he he!  

It was cute & clean place.  They have a mix of Japanese and Chinese food.  I ordered the double chicken (panko & grilled) with teriyaki!  The teriyaki was sweeter than I like but it was good.  The service staff was good.  The prices are reasonable.  I would come back to visit again!"
4,"I've been to the Yonge and Eg location as well as this one.  Love both, prefer this one simply cause I can actually get a table upon walking in without waiting.  The food is excellent.  Always super fresh and made to order.  Very tasty, and the menu has variety.  Knocked off a star because it's overpriced for a casual dining place. And because our waiter gives us looks when we don't order wine :) They balk at menu changes but if you smile, they'll do it for you.  I'd eat here every week if they knocked a few dollars off the menu items."
4,"We decided on take out for a night at home with the fam and this little nugget popped up in the neighborhood recently.  We investigated the menu online and our DD arrived with dinner shortly thereafter.  

OOH LA LA  - I love a pleasant surprise!! It was a win!!!
5 of us dined for $50 so a wee above average prices.  

Mom had an island burger and said through muffled bites, ""this is a pretty darn good burger!""  Dad was quite pleased with his juicy burger and fries as well.  The fries are homemade so they are a hybrid fry/chip.  They are greasy but good.  The burger is stuffed with cheese.  I would have like to try a bite but sadly, there were no remains.

As for the rest of us, we shared the staples....kahlua pig with cabbage, kalbi, and kauai chicken with fried rice, noodles, mac salad, and white rice.  It was unanimous that the mac salad was the BEST we have ever had.  The white rice was delightful (which some may think is silly for white rice - but it is the good starchy short grain stuff).  The fried rice was very good; little treasures mixed in such as spam.  The noodles were meh.  I wouldn't order them next time.  The kahlua pig was perfect, the kalbi was fatty, tender and flavorful and the chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The chicken was described as beer battered but it has a very sweet crunchy batter.  I'm not sure what kind of glaze they add.  It was good - but a surprise.  

I haven't seen the inside yet but I'm familiar with the small location in a little strip mall in front of Smith's.  A perfect spot for a diamond in the rough.  Our food getter did say she had to wait around 20 minutes for food.  I don't mind a wait if quality results are produced.  I considered stopping there last night on my way home from work but thought it might be too soon.  Like an addict...determining the appropriate time frame before hitting the sauce again.

Maybe tonight?  Yum!"
4,The food is pretty awesome. Highly recommend the  grilled pork entrails. But the service is just ok cuz only one waiter in service.
4,"Pork BBQ also comes with a tofu soup and rice. The price is reasonable for $30. They have traditional korean table. We also ordered pork bone soup, it is very good! The great thing is they open 24 hours."
4,"I come to Hug Ga Ne whenever I visit Toronto. They open 24 hours! Their Sun dae guk (Korean soup made of pork blood and noodle sausages) makes me think of my hometown. It is a food I would love to eat after flying for hours. Very mild comfy food, but if you add hot paste, it is also excellent. 
They also serve Korean BBQ, which is great. But I found their ventilation is not good enough for Korean BBQ. Many people make table BBQ in evenings, so I prefer to go in the morning to eat Sun dae guk."
4,"Haven't been here in a while, but we used to eat here every other month. They have really good steaks that you can cut through with a butter knife.  Also if your a fan of sweet potatoes, this is your spot!"
4,Decent spot. Was in town for a meeting and had some hot wings that were pretty good. The beer selection was great as well. They have quite a bit so a good beer menu would be nice. The waitress was really attentive and she had a ton of customers so she did really well. I would definitely head back.
4,"I thought it was a delicious experience. We had a large take out order and brought it home. I thought the chicken was a bit dry but the ribs were spot on. 
The sauce they gave us was gluten free but I don't think they had a gluten free kitchen (and they weren't pretending too). 
I will return."
4,"Heard about this place through meandering the Yelp pages and decided to make the trek over to Kauai Cafe!  Buggah is close to da' mountains!  Only far!

But luckily was worth it for some local Hawaii kine grinds!  Seriously ONO eats.  You like Island Style, Island Flavor, Aloha Specialties?  Kauai Cafe is right up your alley especially if you live in this remote part of town.  Westside!  

Came here with the wifey for a nice dinner out.  Because it is kinda on the outskirts of town, it was relatively empty in the restaurant with mainly folks coming in for take-out orders.  But don't let this fool you, majority of Kauai Cafe's patrons come in during breakfast and the lunch rush, and from what I hear keep the place busy.  

Back to the food.  It was a Friday night, and I really should have got the Aloha Friday Special...the Lau Lau Feast!  With lau lau, kalua pig, lomi lomi salmon, chicken long rice, squid luau, ahi poke, macaroni salad, 2 scoops rice, and haupia..all for $16...how could I have gone wrong?  But I wasn't THAT hungry!  Ah, next time, next time!  

I settled for Linaka's Mix Grill, which is a combo plate of kalbi ribs, char siu chicken, and teriyaki pork with 2 scoops or rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  Buggah was pretty ono!  Kalbi was marinated good with a nice hint of sweet and fat, char siu chicken really had that char siu red going on, and the teriyaki pork was juicy.  And my rice was cooked just right to absorb all of those lovely meat juices!  With some shoyu, pepper, and Tabasco on my macaroni salad I went to town.  Finished all of it.  The wifey had their much talked about Heineken Beer Batter Fried Chicken, and she wasn't sorry.  Wow!  I had a bite and almost didn't stop.  That Heineken really adds a nice punch to the batter, and helps keep the chicken nice and moist!  Good stuff.  I just wish it came with 2 hind quarters instead of just 1!

Hopefully the Kauai Cafe keeps on with a good clip of people so they can stay in business.  Seeing that we live kind of far away from this restaurant, I don't think I could make the drive there on a weekly basis.  There is a lot of stuff on the menu at Kauai Cafe that I still want to try, especially their oxtail soup!  I just gotta go back eventually.

Keep grindin' away Kauai Cafe...I will return!  Take me back...back to da kine..."
4,"Decent Korean foods that open 24/7. Came here at 1AM and I was really surprised that it was full house. We ordered the Soondae Guk (Korean sausage stew) and Kalbi Tang (beef ribs soup). The broth both were good enough, especially it is one of the few restaurants that open at midnight. The sausage portion was generous, it was also tasty and quite spicy. Kalbi tang has the flavor of the beef broth that was quite light but it was good enough.  I love that they also give generous amount of side dishes, including fish cakes, seaweed salad, kimchi, etc... 
A lot of other people around me had table cooking, either K-bbq or Hotpot, made me wonder if their table cooking are that delicious. Service was efficient as we got our goods after 5 minutes. Waitresses are very nice. 

Overall, I recommend this restaurant and will come back again. One of the better options at night time in the area instead of any other fast-food restaurant."
4,"I'm in town as a former KSU football player and I enjoyed the company of both the bartenders and patrons... It was  both enjoyable and clean place to patronize.  I would rate higher if I ate , but I was not hungry and cannot rate the food without trying it.   I will definitely return when I'm in the area again... Go Flashes !"
4,"Although it's not my main grocery store, I pop in to TJ's at least once a week as it's within a stone's throw of my workplace. It's always a nice little respite, with everyone always being extremely friendly and helpful and of course I don't mind the ever-present sampling area. I've sometimes picked up a package of the offering of the day, and have tried new products that way. But usually I grab a bag of beet chips and/or dark chocolate peanut butter cups for a delicious, not too unhealthy pick-me-up treat that doesn't break the bank. They may not be organic, but the ingredients are basic and healthy-ish without chemical additives and artificial colors, etc. At Christmas time, they are one stop shopping for amazingly low priced seasonal greenery -- wreaths and poinsettias and anything else you need or want to make a festive holiday home. The prices on everything are amazingly low here considering the high quality. Cheese, beer, wine, all kinds of grab and go or frozen, easy to make or ready to eat items. The only reason I don't give Trader Joe's five stars is that they don't typically offer organic fruits and vegetables per piece, as they do with their conventional produce. I would like to enjoy an even healthier snack like an orange or banana, but I'm not down with chemical agriculture. The organics are only sold in bulk bags or bunches. Bummer. But four stars for everything else!"
4,"If you enjoy Whiting fish which is known as the fish of the poor......... You gotta try their Merluzzo salad. It's incredibe! Their pasta is made to order therefore it comes to your table piping hot and fresh! They have an excellent staff, great wine selections, and decadent desserts."
4,"Great prices and ridiculously friendly staff. 

My favorite things there are: mini whole-wheat pita, free samples, garlic hummus, kettle corn popcorn (pink bag), frozen fettuccine alfredo and charles shaw wine! ($3 and super tasty!) 

Least favorite things: chaotic parking lot (the top lot is metered and underground parking is free but cramped, usually bike there though so don't have to deal with this), the packaging on the produce- so wasteful. 

The prices are great for the quality of food, I don't do all my shopping there but there are items that I come just to TJ's to get."
4,My wife and I went for lunch while we were way out east. We ordered a Cuban and a chicken parm sandwich.  They were above average for pub fair and I would definitely return next time I'm in the area.
4,"I think this is my new favorite Hawaiian spot. They do all your local favorites, but they put a slight twist. The chicken katsu had furikake  in the breading!! It added a level of complexity that I've never had from any other Hawaiian joint. Macadamia but crusted scallops... YUM!! The mahi mahi plate was big. Only problem was they don't provide enough tartar sauce. Or maybe they just give too many pieces of fish. More tartar sauce please. The island burger is massive!! Not only is it big, but that thing tastes onolicious!! The Hawaiian plate served on Friday/Saturday is gigantic. Appropriately named the feast. I went to island flavor a couple of weeks back and has their Hawaiian plate. Doesn't even come close to Kauai cafe. Lau Lau, kalua pig, haupia, chicken long rice, lomi lomi salmon, poi, squid luau. Everything you could ask for all on one plate!! Everyone is always very friendly, I really like this place."
4,"This chain is a ""one of a kind"".  They have a small sort of different items.  Some items are very unique and can only be found here.  It is very small and loads of locals here pushing their way through the crowd.  It is a little on the high side of pricing...but you are getting local and small business items that are only found at TJ's."
4,"Korean BBQ on a chilly spring day really hits the spot.  Korean Grill House is located just a block north of Yonge & Dundas square; there are two floors of grilling goodness.  When you arrive and are seated, you have the option of ordering from the a la carte or the all-you-can-eat menus.  We opted to go for the $9.99 AYCE lunch menu which gave us chicken, beef, squid and fish to grill (they had pork as well but we were going kosher today).

Alongside the unlimited access to meat, they have rice, soup and korean side dishes that can be replenished as well!

Service is ok, our waiter had his hands full with the packed first floor.

Korean Grill House is on the revisit list for cheap AYCE eats!"
4,"Been here so many times but haven't got time to write them a decent review, so here it is!

It's always my go-to restaurant for Korean BBQ. The restaurant is big and clean. It's divided into 2 sections: half is regular seating and the rest is ground seating. This place is always a full house, especially during dinner. And since this place opens 24/7, be aware that you may have to line up and wait for seating. 

But trust me, their BBQ won't let you down. Don't let the $40 - $45/dish (table cooking on the menu) shock you because the portion is very decent and generous! It's definitely now for 2 but enough for 3 or 4. Their BBQ was well seasoned. Remember to ask for lettuce and sauce because normally they won't serve you like other Korean BBQ restaurants. It also comes with rice and spicy soup on the side. Don't even get me started on their side dishes. They are fresh, tasty and refillable of course. 

The service is hit and miss but I'm not blaming them. They have to run other tables as well.

Highly recommend this place for Korean BBQ!!!"
4,"I love freshly baked bread. This place is tucked away, so most of the time it is not busy. The honey whole wheat and the walnut coconut bread (only offered on Saturdays) are my favorites. They also offer a selection of honey, including cinnamon honey, and vanilla honey, which are pretty good although a little pricey.

The staff are pleasant and helpful, just remember to look at what bread is offered each day, as not all breads are offered each day throughout the week. I made the mistake of coming in for walnut coconut bread on a Tuesday, and was promptly rejected as it is only offered on Saturday. Also, closed on Sunday, kids."
4,Fast and fresh. This is a family owned restaurant.  Ben does exist and he is the head chef. They are always willing to listen and make things how you would like them. A good tip is if you think the hot is too hot and the mild is too mild ask them to mix the two during the cooking. The chicken is good. The veggies are always fresh and perfectly cooked. Yum.
4,Good place to eat on the west side. I ordered a pho with sliced beef #17 with a grilled pork sandwich. It was good by most standards. Sandwich bread was better than most. I'm just glad to more varieties of places to eat here on the west side.
4,"If you can't really afford to go to a high end, food snob, steak house and you're craving a steak, where do you go?  Yup, Outback.  We went early on a Saturday evening and our service was great.  Our drink orders were taken promptly and drinks were brought along with bread.  I had not eaten all day so I was hungry.  Our server suggesed some ""Aussie Fries"" as an appetizer.  Ok, I love fries, so sue me.  And these were covered with cheese and bacon!!!  OMG!  So yummy!  They have a good kids menu with many choices so my daughter loved it.  I ordered a special that they were having, a tuscan style steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The steak was juicy, tender, and cooked medium well with just a little pink in the middle.  It was great!  The potatoes were ok but the green beans were done to perfection, still a little crunchy.  All in all I enjoyed my dinner and so did my daughter.  Our server came back several times to check on us and took the time to talk to my daughter as well.  Will we be back?  You bet!"
4,"I stopped in here for lunch the other day. I was the only one in the restaurant at 1pm. I got the mixed plate meal ($14) which had teriyaki pork, char sui pork, and kalbi ribs. Two large scoops of rice, and a small scoop of macaroni salad. 

Overall it was pretty tasty, and large portions. I liked it way better than L&L. They do have some cool menu items that I will go back to try. It's a nice place, clean, with some decorations. Staff was friendly. 

Support your local businesses and give them a try. Located on Trop at Hualapai. You can get ice cream from Handels afterwards if you have room."
4,"The thought of having to cook my own meal was a very interesting motion. So my first time at Korean Grill House I was excited to try something new.

I really like the selection of meat there is quite a variety to chose from, plus there are vegetables you can pick as well, I love veggies!! Especially with grilled or BBQ meat. The atmosphere of the place is a nice on great for groups of friends or family as it is quite fun to sit there and grill your meat selection. I recommend this place. 

#30daysofyelp"
4,Ate there for the first time today and I will definitely be going back. Had the Chicken Katsu some for the best I've had. All the food is authentic and just as good as in the islands.
4,I had the turkey pesto sandwich with provolone cheese. A great blend of flavours. The service is great. You fill out an order card and pay. Sit down and relax then they bring you your sandwich. A great place to chill and have a bite to eat with friends. It's bit small so fills up pretty quickly but it doesn't seem overcrowded because the tables are spaced nicely.
4,"Second trip to Grazie. Got the Penza (again!), baked goat cheese phyllo pastry and the Milano.

The Penza is hands down delicious! Creamy vodka and tomato sauce, Smokey pancetta, green onions, pasta al dente just ties it all together. It doesn't feel heavy for a creamy dish. Love it!

The phyllo baked goat cheese salad was a beauty! It was baked inside a phy?lo pastry dough - flaky, with warm goat cheese, mushrooms and pepper. It comes with side salad of urugula, tomatoes, olives and pesto that helps to cut the dense cheese. 

Milano..was ok. 

Service is friendly, fast and attentive. 4.5 overall rating!"
4,"Love this place because it's open 24 hours. Most of the times we came its been full. There would always be a short wait. It's a typical Korean restaurant but has both floor seating and regular table seating. You must take off your shoes for floor seating. 

I've always ordered from the kbbq section of the menu, never actually ordered anything else. The BBQ sets usually come with the regular set of side dishes, two bowls of rice, a bowl of soup, some lettuce, two different sauces and the plate of meat. I find that the meat they have here is higher quality than most places. The beef is usually marbled and soft. The soup is strong and flavourful. I prefer the soybean soup over the other choice. The set is very filling for two people. 

I would really recommend this place as it's one of my favourites!"
4,"This place deserves a solid 4 stars. Every single time I go, its packed with people. The food has never disappointed me and prices are affordable. 

My recommendations include their kimchi chigae (prob had that like 8 times by now) and makchang gui. 

Only critique is their waitresses' attitude. Theyre not really the smiley type but they try their best to get their job done. Its quite chaotic cause there are so many customers and not that much walking space.

Dont know about you but I rather have great food at great prices if it means foregoing a super friendly server."
4,"Trader Joes has great ideas at a fair price for groceries, especially for young people shopping for themselves. So many unique healthy frozen options! The staff is always smiling and generally enthusiastic about their employment. The only downfall is elbowing through hoards of people to pick up the essentials. Seriously, does anyone know when this store is not busy?"
4,"Had their Capri pasta and a glass of Pinot Noir wine. 
I may be prejudiced because I was starving but the Capri pasta was really good. It was served hot. Shrimps, clams and tomatoes in it tasted delicious! They provide a complimentary basket of bread with butter and balsamic vinegar.

Their menu is extensive; they have so many pastas to choose from. The service was good but not outstanding. At the end of our meal, the waiter gave us our bills; took them away; then printed us new ones. I am not sure why he had to print them again as my first one and the second one were two exactly same bills, lol. The atmosphere here in the Vaughan location is actually nicer than the midtown location. There are lots of tables, more space in general, and a nice patio outside whereas the midtown location is cramped and doesn't have a patio."
4,Really excellent. My only complaints is that in some Pho places they have a 'build your own' and that's lacking here. But what they do have is excellent. The broth was awesome and the service was really nice as well. I'll be back.
4,"Mmm Great Harvest!!  Fresh, yummy bread and free samples.  Does it get any better?  

Pumpkin bread, sour dough bread, cinnamon raisin bread... it's all good.  But really, my favorite is just their standard light wheat bread.  So soft and delicious and I don't feel quite so guilty eating all those carbs when I know it's made from super fresh ingredients and no preservatives.

The only thing that keeps me from giving Great Harvest 5 stars is their sandwich prices.  Don't get me wrong... their sandwiches are really fresh and delicious, but they're smallish and are pretty much just like something you'd easily throw together at home.  For $6-$7?  That's pretty steep!  Even with fresh-made bread holding it together!"
4,"Whenever I feel like going ""tanning"" (that's my term for eating Kam Ja Tang), Huh Ga Ne, is always my go-to place. Food is great, service is fast and prices are affordable. Also, their Sam gyop sal and seafood pancake is pretty good too. 

Now the only downside to this place this that it's ALWAYS packed so expect a 15-30 minute line up during dinner. Another thing, half of the tables are the low tables where one must seat cross-legged. So it might not be the most comfortable but it certainly is somewhat authentic."
4,One of my go to Korean places when I'm in the area. Food is great and service is pretty face usually. Love how the restaurant is open 24/7 almost every day of the year. One thing is that the restaurant is very popular and wait times can be quite long if visited during peak hours.
4,"Good food for the price and generous amount of side dishes provided! Come here when you have late night cravings for Korean food, they are open 24hrs."
4,"We love Trader Joe's, wish parking was better but what can you do Monroe Street. Its also a smaller space for parking and in the store in general. I try to avoid the place on weekends. The staff are always friendly and helpful.

I like that they have affordable organic produce. They also have a nice selection of different foods you might not find other places.

I really like a lot if their frozen, prepackaged meals like their vegan and non vegan chicken tikka masala. I hear their Mac and cheese is good but have not tried it myself. Its nice when I'm on the go and then I dont feel too guilty about eating a frozen meal as I trust their quality and they have a good variety of healthier options.

I also love their frozen veggies section. Lots of nice organic choices. They have a good variety of frozen fruit for my smoothies too. I love the pre-cooked frozen edamame for my son. They also have soy and coconut ice cream that is better than most other brands out there and it is super affordable."
4,"3.5/5, +.5 for service

We want to Grazie for our company Christmas lunch after a recommendation from one of my colleagues. I'm not too familiar with Italian food, but I do love me pizza and pasta!

I won't comment on what my coworkers ordered as they all seemed to enjoy their food regardless. For me, I ordered the Napoletena, which was linguine with tomato sauce, shrimp, and clams.

The linguine was cooked perfectly and I found the shrimp to be very good. The clams, however, had minor sand in them. The tomato sauce was also quite well done, although it felt a little watery at the bottom. The parmesan cheese added to the food was a wonderful attention; gotta love cheese in general!

Service was excellent. We had to wait a good 30 minutes for the full party to show up, but the server was very appreciative and told us to take as long as we need. The restaurant in general was also very accommodating of the fact we had a wheelchair coworker with us.

I was told after there were a lot of great Italian restaurants around the Vaughan Mills area...should come back here more often!"
4,"Breakfast was good..but what made our visit so nice was our waitress, Krista. She was very professional and on top of things. Haven't had such a good waitress in quite awhile."
4,"I would even go as far as 4 1/2.  I went once years ago before they moved spots and wasn't pleased, but tried it again recently.  Wow, big improvement.  I will no longer wait 45 minutes for Marcellos, this place is as good or better without any wait time.  I love the mussels appetizer and the penne a la vodka is great, bursting with flavor."
4,"Service was great. Shrimp cocktail came with huge shrimp!! Crab cakes were ok...but good nonetheless. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the crust was so flavorful. The au jus was very good too. Only thing I thought was ok was the seafood Mac and cheese, crab cakes, and potato side dish."
4,"My family has eaten at Chef Ben many times.  The food is consistently good, whether it is from the sushi menu or a teriyaki bowl selection.  The prices are very reasonable, as well.
The watresses are also very friendly."
4,"All was consummated to the crowning last slice. I had so much meat, I could'nt tell what i was chewing anymore. An addendum, figuratively, of 3$ if one should have a penchant for vegetables. Odd."
4,"Good location, price, and food (just avoid hot pot menus if you're looking for the authentic korean hot pot experience, because it just doesn't taste the same). My go-to dishes are Soondae, Cold noodles, Spicy rice cake, and K-bbq. Staffs are friendly and it does get busy on the friday and weekend dinners. Close to the TTC and parking spaces are available."
4,"Next best thing to a neighborhood bakery.  The specialty breads are good. The simple sandwiches are elevated because of the fresh bread. Customer service is great...can't go wrong with young, nice, pretty girls."
4,"I had placed this review originally as a 2 star. However. There is something to be said for integrity. I appreciate Ms Kim for her prompt response and help in the situation. You do not find many owners going above and beyond or leaving it to the minions to handle. I love their bread and sandwiches - sugar cookies are scrumptious. My new found favorite bread is the Cheddar Garlic. They only make it on Fridays but it is so yummy and makes me think it will go awesome with some really nice soup. I am single and cannot always finish a loaf - just do not eat enough bread in a week and to me - never freezes well. But the rolls freeze great. Going to try the rolls on Friday - now have to plan what soup to have with them. In addition, I like the accessories they have in store and I have been thinking if making up some Christmas packages that may do well.  Thanks again for your help and continued service in our valley - bread rules!"
4,"Good value for express sushi.  Attentive service, nice decor."
4,I was a little worried when the technician came out and didn't fix my pump that sounded like a jet engine.  We called the office and they were GREAT!  They apologized and even went way above and beyond what they had too.  Highly recommend them!!!
4,"Solid four stars. Teriyaki beef to go, very tasty and good size portion. Rice and Mac salad was good too. I could have gone for two scoops of rice though for the price, and a little extra teriyaki sauce would have been nice. Oh and some hot sauce other than Tabasco would have been good. Other than those very nitpicky things, the plate was good. I'll be back."
4,"Gracie is a very popular Italian restaurant. The wait for this restaurant is always minimum 30 minutes unless you have supper at 5:30pm. The service is good, staff is friendly and their food is superb. I had the mussels in white wine and it was delicious. I highly recommend their pastas as they are all very good! If you don't like to wait for a spot, this restaurant is not for you because it is ALWAYS busy."
4,Grilled pork banh mi was very delicious! I think I could easily eat two of them and will definitely be coming back for more. We also tried the #19 pho beef with flank which was also good. It didn't contain a whole lot of meat but was still pretty filling.
4,"Came here with a girlfriend and got seated right away. As some others have said they gave us cold bread. And this blows my mind everytime I go to an Italian bread and get cold bread! What is with that?! We tried two pasta dishes, one if them with cream sauce. Their names escape me but they were good! They were tasty and portions were enough. The staff were nice and accommodating."
4,"I went there last weekend and had a pretty good meal. The meat tasted kinda same, since the sauces in beef, pork, beef ribs were similar, but they were still good. The service was nice, the waiter asked if I want more food and drinks very often. And the price was accetpable, especially comparing to other places at downtown area. I will go back again in the future!"
4,"Last week had my second facial treatment from Lucy.  She is amazing...and I am not only saying this because we are both Polish.

My skin looked flawless and my pores have never been so clean! The advice Lucy gave has changed my skin and I finally figured out what I was doing wrong. EVERYTHING.  (cider vinegar is GOOD for my skin? who knew!?)

I can't wait to get back this summer and have another treatment at the Red Door.   I just hope Lucy isn't booked."
4,"I eat Vietnamese food all over this valley, this one is being close to me is a good choice.  They have a limited menu especially when if comes to seafood.  I have asked a few times for squid, but they say that no one asks for it (except me, so I must be no one  lol) so that's why they don't have it on the menu.  I will still continue to go but I would go a lot more often if they expanded their seafood dishes."
4,"We've got delivery twice from them before they decided we were too far (boo), and we did like the dishes we got. Wish they would reconsider their delivery area as no other asian restaurant serves where I live and they would make a killing. Some of their stuff can be a bit greasy, which is why I knocked off one star, but they're overall good."
4,"i LOVE this place! Their pastas are all amazinggg. I had the Trapini (Spaghetti with grilled eggplant, fresh peppers & zucchini).  Super fresh, yummy tomato sauce, good portion, just GREAT.  But the highlight for me is the pasta my friend had. Tasca (pasta filled with ricotta, spinach, mushrooms & brie baked in a creamy tomato porcini sauce).  my.goddddd.  I had a bite and legit wanted to steal her entire plate.  The mix of everything together is perfect! Fair warning though if you don't like mushrooms you will prob hate this dish because the mushroom flavour is overwhelmingly good.  I have been thinking about it non stop and I'm going back this week to eat it again :)

They give you free bread to start, but its pretty hard and nothing exciting.  We also got the appetizer special that day which was octopus.  Pretty fresh and it came with some  cold veggies with feta and mash on the bottom.  The mash was a little sour which I didn't really like but that's not the highlight of the dish anyways.  

I want to come back n eat all the pastas haha. This place is a MUST try!"
4,"So since I left my initial review, I received a call from one of the manager's at the spa.  Lynn was absolutely awesome.  She listened to my concerns and genuinely seemed concerned and anxious to fix it for me.  I went back in yesterday and Desiree was AMAZING!!!  She fixed my hair and it looks so much better now.  Plus she does an amazing scalp massage.  If you want your hair colored by a true professional, ask for Desiree.  You won't be disappointed."
4,"This place was completely empty when we came to place an order for take out around 5pm on a Tuesday night.. I hope business picks up for them... The menu has all your standard Hawaiian favorites like Katsu plate and spam musubi! But what caught my eye was the juicy burger.. Which is a burger that is grilled with the cheese inside the meat.. I've been wanting to try something like this after reading James K & Jenny D's reviews about the famous Juicy Lucys in Minnesota~!  the food took like 5 minutes since we were the only ones there .. I really like how the kitchen is open so I can see them cook my food~ 

The Katsu was pretty good can't go wrong with deepfried goodness haha & the Mac salad wasn't overly creamy.. 

Spam Musubi like most places are premade.. I thought the rice was too mushy so I'll probably pass on this next time..

The juicy burger was pretty juicy! You definitely need to like cheese to enjoy this dish! And I do! I LOVE cheese which i guess means I enjoyed this burger haha it came with what I thought were potato chips but turned out to be garlic waffle fries YUMMMMO ~ I'm sure this Kauai juicy burger is not as good as the original in Minnesota but I'm also sure it will satisfy your cravings for the time being~!"
4,"Its pretty spacious so even if it gets busy it won't be a ridiculous wait. I was able to make a reservation but I think it depends on time day and number of people...so probably not during it's busiest dinner hours. We had to wait for a few friends who came a bit later and they didnt rush us to order. It leans towards a more traditional setting? to the best of my knowledge of Korean food which I admit is pretty limited. They have purple rice though! They have very decently priced main dishes like PBS for $9 which they don't charge additional tax. We tried the table top cooking of pork belly bbq and Army Stew! It was great and a very happy warm atmosphere :) We also had japchae and seafood pancake! Among 7 people, the bill was $15 per person (they dont charge additional tax on top of menu prices) + tips! We were all full and finished all the food, yum!

ps on friday and weekends they dont allow you to split the bill; luckily we went on a thurs otherwise its be frustrating with larger groups"
4,"Red beans and rice perfection. Now, I have a high standard for thus dish because no one's is better than my auntie's but the French Quarter's come close. I had the andouille sausage on the side, just in case they weren't right but I was pleasantly surprised. They had the right amount of kick so I added them to the rice.

The portion was crazy. I thought it was going to be a side dish, nope, it was a dinner plate portion. So if you order it you won't be eating anything else. Plus it came with a slice of garlic bread that was crispy and soft, as garlic bread should be.

Loved this lunch and its my first meal in Charlotte. This is the start of a beautiful vacation."
4,"I stopped at this cute little shop while passing through Phoenix on my way to Tucson. I had a mad craving for sushi -- but I wanted it fast. I didn't have time to stay in Phoenix for long. 

I had never heard of nor been to Chef Ben, and when I walked inside I was already a bit timid. No one other than the staff and chef were inside. But it was that halo period between lunch and dinner, so I figured, ""Meh,"" and walked up to place my order. 

This is not a fancy formal place. It really is fast sushi -- no, not fast food sushi, just fast. You can place your order at the counter or take a seat in the dining hall. 

Because this is speedy sushi, I was surprised by the menu. It was fuller than I expected. I went with the small sushi bowl and one of their specialty rolls. 

The bowl came with your usual suspects: Salmon, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp.... I was slightly disappointed -- until I began eating. 

Freshness! 

They may skimp a little on variety and on the size of the cut, but the fish was very fresh and had the correct oil-to-firmness ratio. The sushi rice also was quite nice -- as though it were a batch the chef had just made. 
 
The specialty roll also was quite nice. Called the dragon roll, it was made with eel, crab, cucumber and avocado. What I appreciated was its lightness. The roll wasn't drenched in some dreadful sauce, but served as rolled. 

Perfect. 

I was pleased. I imagine I will stop in time to time while driving through Phoenix. It's a good price for quick, fresh sushi."
4,"So yummy! I ordered the bulgogi bbq and it tasted AMAZING. ON the menu, it says it serves two people, but you can actually serve 3 and still have a little leftover. This may be because they spoil you with around 10 side dishes including assorted kimchi and veggies as well as a seafood soup and purple glutinous rice. I also ordered a beef soup with glass noodles and was disappointed with how bland it tasted. Our bulgogi was cooked for us by some staff and the food came out really fast. Good service, good pricing, and will visit again in the near future:)"
4,"The food was very good in general which is the most important thing for me in Italian Restaurant and thats why its a 4 stars. 
If you like soft crust in pizza you should request 'not well done' because their default is a well done crunchy crust.
The drinks had too much ice in them but where pretty good in general. 
The service was solid except the fact you had to ask for water refills instead of them paying attention."
4,"I was referred here to see Dr. Sabori for Glaucoma.  He is very pleasant young man. Explains and takes his time. Staff are very good. Why a 4 star? Coffee not fresh, lobby music too loud. Sorry."
4,"Been here three or four times and we have always had great food and service.  Recently we had Fredrick and Jonathan attending to us and both are friendly and all over their duties.  The steak and salads have always been great, bread and lavish are great also.  I didn't want mashed potatoes with my steak so they gave me some grilled veggies that were awesome.  The only negative thing I would say is that their asparagus isn't that great.  They are large and come with a sauce that I don't care for.  I think it'd be better with a garlic sauce and cooked a bit more.  Just my preference."
4,"We have been to Ben's a couple times now and glad we have found a local place to get Teriyaki close by (after moving from Seattle to PHX, it's hard to find here...).
We have ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and the spicy Chicken Teriyaki Yakasoba and enjoyed both.  The regular Teriyaki is a little sweeter than we are ""used to"" but not so much so that we wouldn't keep ordering it.  I like that they are willing to customize your order and have been very friendly.  We'll keep coming back!"
4,"I always have had a great experience at TJ's  The staff really go out of their way to help you and keep you wanting to come back. I highly recommend this store. For fruits and veggies I go to another, but I still shop at TJ's once a week.  I am a fan!"
4,Great sushi spot far out in the West Valley.  There are so many options on the menu. Many bento options  and lots of specials including chefs selections. I can say the sushi is fantastic and beautifully presented.  The place is small and very quaint feels like family. We will visit often.
4,Great harvest is amazing. Their items are a little pricey or at least they were a few months back when I went but if you have no problem spending $10 on a single layer standard size sandwich then they are worth it.
4,"Love it! I always find at least a few new things to try, parking is somewhat of a challenge, however."
4,"The service here can be a little slow sometimes considering how busy the place is, because there aren't enough servers. But aside from that, the food here is the bomb! The dukbokki, tonkatsu and soondae stew are all delish! Best part is that it's open 24 hours for those who want a quick meal late at night!"
4,Very good bar food! Good beer selection and service has always been friendly and quick! Nice place to catch a game! Will be back
4,"Pretty great value. Great boba however the bang mi was really lacking a lot of stuff in the bread, even though the quality of the ingredients was pretty good."
4,"I eat lunch here frequently.  Their manager's lunch special is a great bargain... sandwich, side, coke, and a ice cream cone for under $10, all in.  Granted this isn't exactly Arthur Bryant's or Smoque, and it doesn't pretend to be.  For a quick lunchtime BBQ fix at a fair price this place is dependable and tasty."
4,"Yay! A Hawaiian place super close to home.  I've been eyeballing the wonton min since I've been sick with this flu. My hubby decided to get to go and they said 10 minutes till its ready! My kind of joint! 

I got the wonton min and the hubby got the chicken katsu with rice and Mac salad. He also ordered some spam musubis! The wonton min was tasty, but I wish there was just a lil more noodles. Chicken katsu was ok, not that big of a fan of katsu but my husband enjoyed it.  The katsu sauce wasn't in our bag so make sure you ask/check for it.  The spam musubi has that mayo like sauce which is in sushi so it was a bit different but good. 

The menu is simple, but I know we will be back to try other things like the juicy burger. Pricing matches other Hawaiian restaurants."
4,Solid Vietnamese for Phoenix and Arizona. Nice people. Typical mom-pop Pho place you'd find anywhere. Nothing truly negative. Comfort food.
4,Came here to spend time with family and watch game  started of with appetizer platter for $12.99 we had tasty ribs that fell off bones and mozzarella wedges and chicken tenders. We were able to choose the sauce we wanted. Also had potato skins but they were on greasy side.  At half time we ordered food   chicken quesedia and pulled pork sliders and Asian chicken salad.   Food good and service was attentive.  The game outcome on the other hand. ..
4,"This place has its positives and its areas that could use improvement. 

As far a positives: they have live music, billiard tables, $3 draft pints and tater tots. Who doesn't love a good tater? We also had great service. 

Negatives: the burger didn't have much flavor."
4,"I have had the baked Chicken (Thursday special) and it is WONDERFUL!. A great change from all the chain and fast food restaurants downtown. It does get very crowded and little awkward when it is that way. 
The food comes fast and is delicious. I have only been here for weekday lunches, usually Thursday. My coworkers love the other specials too. 
If you are looking for a change from the everyday, this place is a great one to start!"
4,Whenever possible I love to eat here. their steaks are tender and flavorful and their escargot is awesome. Great selection of liquor also.
4,This is one of my local favorites. I can call in Sushi and spend about the same amount of money as the crappy fast food places. They recently started a rewards program where you get something free every 5th visit. I have had two hot dishes chicken teriyaki (not so good) and beef yakisoba which was slightly better. I prefer the rolls! I frequently order the spicy onion and spicy salmon. Both are quite tasty! Enough so that I didn't dock pints for the sea-saltless edamame. The service is fast and friendly. The rolls are on the smaller side but well worth it for the price and taste! I recently took my friend because I figured she would appreciate some help finding great places being new to this part of town. She loves it and goes at least once a week with her daughters!
4,"I love the pumpkin bread !! Sooo good!!
Chocolate cookies to die for ! 
Thank for making fresh bread daily"
4,"Trader Joe's is pretty much amazing. Everything is healthy and affordable, and there are so many unique products that you can't find anywhere else. 

They also always have samples of at least one food item and one beverage. (Warning: if you try the samples, there is a good chance you'll be leaving with a bag, box, or bottle of whatever it was.)

The frozen prepackaged meals can be hit or miss. It's not that they are gross, if anything, just lacking in flavor. When in doubt, hit up the samples table! If you visit enough, over time, you'll probably be able to try just about everything before you buy.

The parking garage is a little tight, so I like going on foot to avoid having to park, but it's doable."
4,"What a great ""hidden"" gem.  I have seen the sign for years, finally made my way up there and checked it out.  The staff is friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable. Can't wait to go back."
4,"For some weird reason, I always thought Trader Joe's was just a place to pick up some specialty items. I never thought it was a place where I could get the majority of what I needed on my grocery list. Well, I was wrong, seriously wrong! I work on campus and sometimes I'd just drop by TJs to pick up a few things. But today I needed more than just a few things. I ended up getting everything on my grocery list :-) and that included some really awesome vegan meatless meatballs; yeah you heard me right! Now, I will say that I am NOT all about the Two Buck Chuck wine, however I did pick up some really nice Tempranillo for only $3.99 ( in fact, I'm sipping on it while I type this review).  Sure the produce department leaves a little to be desired, but I picked up some awesome organic avocados for only a buck apiece. Back in the day when we had a gaggle of kids at home, I don't think TJ's would suit what I needed, however this is the place if you're just shopping for a small family!"
4,"The place would have gotten a 5 star from me however, they didn't have the noddles for the day.  The have the tables as a sit down where you order.  It might be busier if they had it like a number system.  I don't know if people like coming and getting served.  I personally like it but overall people may like the number system.  Just my thought in that.
Now the important part, I was planning to go to the cal club but it is 30 minutes away from us.  So we looked up his place and was pleasantly surprised.  The pinion rings were so delicious.  I would order this and put it into my hamburger if I ever get one here.  The mix plate looked pretty good, my son are all if it!  So I assumed he liked it or he was famished.  The chicken katsu was too alot of food and delicious.  The katsu sauce was watery but still tasty.  Da surf rider was good but the four little scallops was a 
Little disappointed in size but tasty.  The coconut shrimp as pretty good and the beef teriyaki was tasty and tender.  A definite recommend and we will be back.  The owner cooks and the wife will check on your thoughts.  The server was attentive."
4,"Was uptown Charlotte, going to a show, and wanted a quick bite.  Unable to decide, and this place not showing up on Yelp, and other search site.  We were on our way to one place, then I saw the blue awning, and decide to go to the French Quarter.  The place was hopping, and we were seated quickly .  Service was good and so was the food.  Why the four stars is because  of the owner and his son--really nice people!  They take a lot of pride in their place, very personable, greeting everyone.
It was warm and inviting."
4,"Late Tuesday night dinner.  Blackened fish sandwich was surprisingly huge!  Good flavor, same true for the charred, extra crispy wings w honey hot sauce. Fries were chunky and yet crisp. Friend got the Ruben, and really liked it.
I believe this locations food is hit or miss. We went last week for a late Saturday night dinner. The mini filet steak and shrimp for 19.00 was a serious disappointment. Steak flavorless, over cooked (med rare) and the shrimp had no seasoning & a freezer flavor! Nasty 
But always like their burgers."
4,Food was very inexpensive for the quality.  I had a ribeye with an au poivre sauce with several side dishes.  The creamed corn and bacon scalloped potatoes were tasty.  I took two pieces of cheesecake and a chocolate cake home.  The desserts looked and tasted like they were bought frozen.  Everything but the desserts were very good.  I will definitely go back for the food
4,"I am a little in love with Trader Joes in general, but the Madison location is especially great. I work very nearby and stop in several times a week for midday snacks in addition to my standard grocery run. Per all TJs, the prices are great--this is NOT whole foods! Most items, like milk and eggs, are cheaper than at the supermarket. The meat selection isn't the greatest, but for every other food item, TJs is my go-to.

As for this particular location, it's nicely sized and always clean and organized. The employees are all extremely friendly and helpful. The only downside is that the parking is TERRIBLE. Since I work nearby I usually just walk, but the few times I have tried to navigate the underground parking lot have been disastrous. There are many huge concrete poles and no loop, so you have to back out and turn around--especially dangerous if you come in, realise there are no spaces, and have to leave. Really, it's worth finding 2 hr street parking and walking--the lot is free, but it's a real nightmare. Serious design flaws."
4,"We stopped by for lunch today. We were seated and served right away. We ordered 1. Calamari 2. The branca-fior di latte, tomato, olives in olive oil 3. Penza - rigatoni in a vodka sauce with pancetta, green onions and chili flakes 4. Tusca-fresh pasta with spinach, ricotta, mushrooms and brie in a creamy porcini sauce. We asked for ground sausage on top. 5. Caesar salad with a side of salmon

My fave: penza! Hands down delish! ...hearty tomato creamy sauce with a bit of heat and the crispiness of pancetta and green onions added texture and flavor.
The tusca was good too but a bit too rich, one note and soupy looking for me. My sister enjoyed it though.
The branca was ok...i prefer buffalo mozzarella to fior di latte..so it might just be me. I wouldn't order it again.
Calamari was nice and lightly breaded so you got to taste it vs it being all batter.

I'll go back to try some of their other dishes."
4,"Found this unique place on a recommendation from a friend.... And although we didn't have dinner,, we had drinks..... Staff could not have been nicer... Even recommended a few Italian restaurants in area.... Hats off to this place...."
4,"Heaven! That's where it feels like you've gone after having a Brandied Pear and Marshmallow Melt body treatment ($135). It's a seasonal treatment, so you'll have to look out for it during the winter time. First, your technician will scrub you down from neck to toe with a pear-infused brandy and sea salt scrub. Once you are super smooth, you will rinse off in an in-room shower. Then you will get a specialized massaged while an amazing smelling marshmallow shea butter is applied.

I would give this a full 5 star review if I hadn't been to some of the other Elizabeth Arden Red Door spas. Although the Biltmore location is very clean and relaxing, once you have your treatment that's kind of it. There are no jacuzzis, saunas, lap pools or any of the things I would typically think of when I think of Red Door spas. If you aren't super interested in anything other than the service you're getting, I would 100% recommend the Biltmore location. However, if you are looking for a full day spa experience, I would suggest making the drive to the Wigwam location."
4,"Unlimited meat for $24, I'm in! Service is very quick. I mean they servers aren't doing the cooking (the customers are), but they are quick to keep the water glasses full, bringing the raw meats and bringing the check. The place is quite big and usually don't need reservations unless there's a big party going. Bathrooms are downstairs and are fair. There are some seats downstairs as well. The decor is not good, but the food is tasty and worth it."
4,"This place is great Will definitely come back wings, chicken and beef sliders!!!! My son said the Buffalo chicken sliders wasn't that good!!!!!!! Buffalo chicken wrap was good !!!!!!!!"
4,"Of course, this TJs has all the classic staples (we love to snack on the blue cheese pecan dip and corn chips). But this TJ stands out from the others due to their awesome customer service! Very nice, friendly and helpful staff. Also, it's in a very convenient location with underground parking. Next time we're in Madison, we'll definitely come back to the Monroe Trader Joe's!"
4,"Came in and orderd ""da Surf Rider"" with the macaroni salad.The macaroni salad had a bit of spicyness to it which I wasn't expecting ( Yummy).  I placed a to go order due to having a busy  day but wish I would have stayed and dined there. The staff seems very friendly & the Overall vibe of the cafe is what I loved the best.  I will defenitly be coming back again"
4,"We are driving from AZ up to Portland and decided to stay for our first night in a Best Western Plus in N Las Vegas, since we aren't gamblers.  Found the Cannery casino and figured they would have a nice steakhouse.  We weren't disappointed!
Our waiter Darryl was wonderful!  We heard the specials and after I asked about it, he directed me to their steaks.  Yay! I had a Ribeye done perfectly.  My husband had Prime Rib.  Yum - we'll have steak bites for our next day's drive north.  Escargots were in mushrooms but very good as an app.
Mississippi Mud pie was ok, similar to  Baskin Robbin's Jamaica Almond Fudge.
Overall, a fine dining establishment, but the clientele is tacky...don't bother dressing up for this place!"
4,"A good experience.  I love the spirit each time I visit.  They provide plenty of healthy options.  Read the labels.  Pricing is very fair.  Everything from regular groceries to your wine and cheese gatherings.  Charles Shaw wine is available along with a fine seletion of other labels and price points.  I have always had a pleasant experience at the checkout.  Everybody is friendly, talkative and willing to help."
4,"I had a gift certificate from Christmas I needed to use here.  I was a bit reluctant as I think our last experience several years ago hadn't been memorable.  However I was pleased with a very friendly staff and made to feel welcome and comfortable.  This isn't at all the experience I have at my usual salon - no vibrating chairs or vigorous massage but a bit like pedicure meets podiatrist.  I had an ingrown that was well taken care of as were my calloused heels.  Then had a fabulous mani that even my teen daughter noticed!   Again, super staff and comfy setting.  Note:  while we were getting manis (my mom was with me) a very cranky old man came in.  The manicurist was soooo patient with him and he relaxed and was taken care of. Turns out his wife makes him come in once a month to get his nails taken care of and they take care of him.  Very patient and kind staff.  Seriously.  Lovely staff."
4,"I am so glad Madison has a Trader Joe's. I stop there every Friday on my way home from work to pick up some goodies. They offer food that is healthy and affordable. I love their cheese selection, their Bavarian Hefeweizen, Dolmas and Plaintain Chips. Very friendly staff too."
4,There is the old school Denny's that have been there forever and then there is the new Denny's. This is a new one. Very clean and modern. Always full. Always friendly and fast service.
4,"Amazing Korean foods at a 24hrs place, how is that possible! Got there at 7 and the place was pack. People were lining out to the door, waiting to be seated. We had a party of 7, waited about 30mins was not bad at all. Ordered the short rib, pork belly, for Korean bbq. The entree comes with rice and a full size soup, option of seafood or tofu.  Pork bone soup was good, but we could have skip it since the soup that come with the entree was a full size. Appetizer we ordered pancake and that was amazing, not too starchy, just brought scallion and seafoods. Their jap chae was kinda on the wet side but the taste was not ruined. The sides that comes with the entree also was good with all the traditional Korean bbq side, but refills was not fast enough for us. For such a crowed busy place, 5 workers was not enough, therefore it did effect their services. Felt rush, when our beef short rib came out, they didn't let us cook it as we go, but she literally dumped the beef all right onto the grill grrrr! When your sides are done, you have to request for refills and that was not great! She literally took our old plate and put more into the same plate, hmm not sure about that service there lol. Giving this place a 4stars for the foods, and wish there a separate rating for services cause they should only get a 1 for it."
4,"Popping into this Korean joint for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised! The serving portions are huge and the food came out quite quickly. The menu offers a variety of choices from the standard main dishes like bibimbap, fried rice and some stews. However, if you're feeling the chills from our current winter weather, there are also stews that are shareable between two people (or more). I also thought it was cute for them to have two types of sitting -- basic chair and table or table and mats. :) 

I ordered the chicken fried rice which came with lots of bits of chicken and purple rice (my fav). I instantly thought it would taste good and yeh dish definitely did not fail me. I ate half and packed away the rest but if you're fairly hungry, one plate would be a good serving size for one or a good shareable plate if you ordered a few things from the menu. 

Overall, I would definitely come back! There were lots of side dishes which can be refilled when requested. :)"
4,I have been to grazie a few times and it is always great. The portions and prices are great value . It is well managed and the servers are very friendly. Keep up the great work grazie!
4,"Went in for the first time about an hour before they closed, small restaurant but very cute, I love hawaiian food, I love the people and was excited to try it. Starting placing my order and as I was the short thing of a man came up to me and introduced himself, he was the owner and was so excited I was there and started pointing out all the family members working there. I felt like I was in their home rather than a restaurant. While I waited (sorry cant remember his name) sat down and started talking to me and asking me if I had ever been to Kauai and since I hadnt he was giving me a bunch of places to go. I know this may not be typical situation in most restaurants but it was a memorable experience and Ill never forget it. And Yes the food was phenomenal BBQ was probably the most flavorable tender chicken I have ever had. It sounds cliche but I could taste the love and was so Ono :)"
4,"I have been to the Red Door several times but my most recent visit was the most memorable. 

Tracy was my aesthetician and she was so nice. I booked the signature facial. She really answered my unique skin care needs and was just the right amount of small talk like with a girlfriend ( we were sharing our mutual love/ hate for finding great things at last chance) and super relaxing. 

I loved the pumpkin enzyme she started out with, it smelled amazing. My hands were massaged with lotion and then wrapped and snuggled into little heated mitts. So comforting. The pressure point reflexology towards the end of the facial put me to sleep. 

She has been in the industry for many years. I appreciated her kindness as we all know, some aestheticians at other spas can make you feel embarrassed about blackheads or tend to be a bit judgmental! But she was super sweet and knowledgable. I hope to go back and see Tracy soon. 

I also booked an 80 minute signature massage with Sarah and she really knew what she was doing. One of my best massages in a long time. I normally go for deep tissue, but wanted to go a more relaxing route the day of my services. She was amazing! I had no idea how tight my muscles were and she worked some maaaaajor knots out of me. I definitely plan on booking another massage with her again, and soon!!"
4,"This is a great place to get together with friends and enjoy a very good meal. Ive been to the Eglinton location many times, but this location is way bigger. Went there after some good tennis at Veneto in Woodbridge. Had to wait about 45 mins for a table (arrived at about 8pm peak - long waiting list) but we had a great time waiting at the bar, so it was ok, and worth the wait.

Food - excellent (we ordered 4 mains and shared - all of them were excellent - no complains at all - pastas were made to perfection aldente!!
Ambience - very nice - nicer compared to the Eglinton location, had a very long and big bar for waiting - nice music from salsa to slow euro house - dress code is from casual to smart casual / dressy
Service - was very good, some waiters were from the Eglinton location!
Price point - reasonable - good for the quality and portion

Definitely will go back there - probably again after a tennis game."
4,"It is unfortunate that this chain got low rating. Been here couple times a year and never had problems. One time my awesome blossom looked dark and I gave them a feedback. The manager asked if I'd want another one but I was almost finished, so I said it was ok, just a feedback. The manager instantly took it off my tab and offered me a dessert. I didn't take it bc we don't do dessert. She insisted that I take it home after dinner. I felt awful bc that was not my intention. I don't know about the management now bc I haven't been there in the past 6 months."
4,"OMG!! If you are looking for a good steak and baby back ribs you should definitely try The Outback Steakhouse it is reasonably Price & Mum, Mum Good."
4,"Dr. Wellish did an excellent job on my eyes. Very friendly, knowledgeable, and patient; he's an excellent doctor. If I had to do it over, I'd still use Dr. Wellish. 

But I have a warning: If you don't qualify for LASIK, or you're right on the cusp, they'll suggest PRK to you. They'll tell you how there's slightly more discomfort than with LASIK, and the healing time is a little longer. While that's true, it doesn't tell the whole story. It's more the difference between getting a vasectomy (LASIK) and having an angry gorilla tear off your testicles (PRK.) The only sane solution when offered PRK is to say, ""I'll come back when I can afford the implantable contact lenses."" Oh, and, with PRK, you won't be able to see jack shit for MONTHS. LASIK or implantable contact lenses - don't do PRK.

Other than that, they're awesome."
4,"Great island food! I really enjoyed eating there.  The service is great, the portions are definitely island style, and the food tastes yummy.  If you're craving island food, check this place out.  It's awesome."
4,"Whenever I'm craving Italian food, I always go to Grazie Ristorante because not only are they nearby, they have so many different kinds of fresh pastas and pizzas to choose from. I like this location because there's always space and I never have to wait for a seat.

Once seated, they start you off with a basket of bread (pretty hard so be careful) and a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The only pizza I've tried from their menu is 'Giovanni' which contains tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, spicy sausage, red onion and hot peppers ($16). The pizza comes out very fresh and I really like the thinness of their crust. One pizza can be shared among 2-3 people if you're also getting a pasta. 

For their pastas, I highly recommend 'Penza', rigatoni with vodka, spicy pancetta, green onions & chili pepper ($16.50); 'Catrina', spinach linguine with grilled chicken, spicy pancetta, diced onions & black peppercorn ($16.50); and 'Capri', linguine with shrimp, clams & diced tomatoes ($17). All the pastas I've tried are very delicious but the only thing I would adjust is the amount of salt they put in the sauce, especially for the dishes that contain pancetta since that itself is salty. But aside from the saltiness, I do recommend Grazie because their dishes are fairly priced and you will definitely fulfill your pasta cravings."
4,"I went with a friend and we had a blast cooking on the grill.  I love k dramas, running man so I always wanted to try kbbq. I'm sure it's better in korea but hey this place is close by and it's funner then just waiting for 60 + minutes for your food to be cooked at a normal restaurant. You can chat with friends while cooking and eating  (since this stuff cooks really quick!) . The waiter served us the meat within like 5 mins.  AWESOME!!"
4,"A few coworkers suggested this place to take my boyfriend out for a surprise, and I'm glad I did. It was a different experience for him since he has never enjoyed the concept of ""paying to cook your own meal"". We both had AYCE BBQ which included;
1. Pork
2. Beef
3. Chicken
4. Beef Ribs
5. Ox Tongue
6. Ox Liver
7. Salmon
8. Squid
9. Fish fillet
10. Sausage 

... and there was free bonuses that came along with the AYCE, kimchi, radish, potato, beef soup (broth only), rice and few others. Also their fountain drinks comes with free refills (bonus!)

We kept it simple and only ordered the pork, beef, chicken, beef ribs and sausage. The quality of these meats were amazing. My favorite was the beef ribs. Mmmmm delicious! The staff was super friendly, however slightly slow. On multiple occasions we had to get up to get the waiters attention, the restaurant has a currently flow of customers (which is def a GOOD sign), overall we had a good time/experience, and more than likely we'll go back again soon!"
4,"Dropped in here today with the family, was glad to find out they have a kids eat free on Sunday. 

All the different things we tried were: Pulled Pork, Hot Links, Sliced Brisket, Fries, Jalepano Beans, Cole Slaw, Potatoe Casserole, and Onion Rings. 

My Family and I enjoyed all the food. 

We did not have any problem with the customer service. 

I would come back."
4,"On a trip to see friends, we stumbled upon Korean Grill House after karaoke-ing across the street. It' definitely one of the gems on Yonge. And even though it is not authentic Korean, it still is good food at an affordable price!"
4,"Huh Ga Ne is my go-to korean restaurant in Toronto. It's a 24/7 restaurant however it's always extremely busy around 6-8pm. 

PROS 
- lots of delicious side dishes - I would say they give more and better side dishes than other korean restaurants
- purple rice! 
- inexpensive - table cooking for 2 people is ~$30, other korean dishes are ~$10-15
- fast service - they bring out your food almost within 5 minutes after you order

CONS 
- does not take reservations, super long line if you go during dinner time
- staff are not very polite but you can see that they are all working their butts off because it's so busy 

My favourite is their pork bone soup ($9) and the pork belly table cooking ($30)! Highly recommended!!!"
4,"There was 6 of us for dinner. Food was very good. 3 burgers, 1 fish sandwich, wings and a salad. All of us were pleased. The only reason it did not get a 5 was the service. The place was not very busy but our server made us feel very rushed. The place was not even half full. Will be back but will order takeout"
4,"Outback is a perfect example of why chain restaurants work - you always know what you are getting....but the staff makes all the difference.

Dinner on a Tuesday night is never a major deal, and we were seated quickly, and had prompt service.

I ordered my usual ""lady"" steak - the Victoria (7 oz) medium rare - and I love the fact that I've never had a problem getting my steak cooked right - so many places bring me completely rare, or much worse - medium well steaks.  But this was perfect, and pared with a loaded potato, a delicious cliché on a plate!

The real selling point for me is the bread.  That lovely, warm, soft, chewy brown bread.  I have been trying to figure out how to go and just eat that. 

The portions were such that I skipped dessert, but it was a tasty meal with the comfort of knowing what to expect."
4,Very delicious Steak on the barbi I had with my lovely wife. Would recommend to all this establishment.
4,"I called my home warranty company to request work for an issue with the pool pump. The work order was assigned to Aaron Pools on a Sunday evening. I got a call Monday morning from a friendly and helpful woman who scheduled a tech to come out  the next day. She gave me an idea of when the tech would be there, but advised that she'd call me back between 3-5pm to let me know the 'real' time once the schedule was set. She followed up and the tech was at my house within the window given. The tech (Mike) looked at the pump and identified the issue. I had done my homework so I had an idea of what needed replacement. The part had to be picked up so he left to get it, allowing me to get to work, and he came back, replaced the part, tested the system, and left a receipt. I checked everything out when I got home and the pump seems to work better than it has since I moved into the house six months ago. This was a trouble-free experience for me."
4,"They have a system here of pre-cut meats/fish placed on small plastic trays so when you order lamb, beef, pork or fish it is all layed out for you.  The price is quite reasonable.  It is fun to grill things yourself.  

The only complaint is that it was very hard to get the waiter's attention.  He paid no attention to the people in the restaurant.  I had to almost to go to the kitchen just to get more water.  It got no better so I had to get up a second time to get more water.  It was much easier to get and pay the bill.  There, he paid attention."
4,"Visited this restaurant for the first time. I thoroughly enjoyed their food, very tasty. I will definitely be returning."
4,"The restaurant is clean and accommodating for large groups of people. Servers are pretty Korean, as in they are more comfortable speaking Korean. Regardless, everything on the menu has an english translation. 

They offer a large variety of Korean food. Mainly hot soups, and traditional favorites like bibimbap and ddukbokki. 

Pretty good side dishes~ 
I recommend the mackerel dish. 
Bulgogi jungol is very delicious. So is the soondae guk. 
Rice is purple and yummy.
More than good enough for the price!

Come with someone who knows Korean so you can flag the waitresses down for refills."
4,"If I don't make it into Trader Joe's every other week, something is wrong. They have a great cheese selection that is reasonably priced compared to other stores in town for your party needs (or just your individual needs.) The frozen dinner selection (Indian especially) is terrific. I'm still working up the nerve to try some of the meat selection, which I was told is not very good, but I would like to give it half a chance.

The only reason I lopped off a star is that if it is after 5 pm or on the weekend, it can get insanely crowded and it can be hard to move in the store. Added to the mix are a slew of small kiddos, each pushing a pint-sized cart into your legs while their handler is off looking at produce. Also the parking situation, even with the parking ramp taking some of the load off the street parking can be less than fun. I'd take the bus or bicycle on over."
4,This place has a really good lunch special with two rolls and miso soup for less than $10. Good sushi and good prices.
4,We order take out regularly here. They always get our food right. Hot and fresh and tasting just like if we were sitting at the resturant. The service is always prompt and friendly. However remend them to give utensils they ALWAYS forget. The potato soup is awesome!
4,"Wanted Korean late in the evening when most places are closed so decided to come to this 24 hour restaurant. The restaurant is busy even at midnight it was full.

There menu is quite large you can get anything from soup with rice, to individual dishes to table cooking. I was feeling tofu soup my friend got the beef tendon soup. The tofu soup is pretty standard like most Korean restaurants. For those that never had it, the soup is spicy it has tofu and most places you choice beef or seafood. You can ask them no spice. The beef tendon soup is very clean with a clear broth not spicy.

I like how the restaurant is 24 hours and still serves good food at all times. The servers Korean ladies were very friendly and attentive even at that hour. Bring in Korean town there alot of choices in the area so i would give it 4 stars."
4,Stopped here after the Spartan Pittsburg. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was good not great. Had the wings with the smoke rub and the irish nachos. My son had the texas boy. All were neither a hit or miss. Next time I'm in town I will be back to try some different wings.
4,Had the she crab soup and the 8 Oz. fillet mingnon medium rare with the cheddar bacon potato. Steaks were cooked perfectly and the potato were very good. The truffle sauce that came with the steak was excellent.  This was my first visit and will defenatly come back.
4,"We love this Outback and go there very often.  Perfectly Grilled Salmon was my favor dish. Food is always good and consistent, service was good too. 

If you don't want to wait...go there for lunch."
4,"We all know TJ's is awesome for it's uniqueness, so after years of shopping at TJ's (in 3 states) and never reviewing them I thought a tried and true TJ's item recipe would be a nice idea:

TJ's frozen chicken tenderloins (sauté in TJ's olive oil and TJ's minced garlic)
Add
1 sauteed onion and 1 container TJ's sauteed Portobello mushrooms
1 jar TJ's Thai Curry Sauce (the green sauce)

While you are making the above, make TJ's Basmati Rice Medley and steam TJ's frozen broccoli.

Wine: Viognier or Chardonnay, both in the TJ's wine section.

Yes, the parking is not fun, but you should try the one in Santa Monica, CA! I must say though that it would be very nice of them (and logical) if they could validate the parking when parked in the lot right next to the front door. (minus 1 star for this)

I love that they hide stuffed animals for the little kids at this location. And their orchids are a great last minute gift.

I was a fan, am a fan, and will always be a fan."
4,"Good vibe and atmosphere. Waiter was attentive and nice. The food was above average. Would have liked more options on the entrees, if you aren't in the mood for pasta, tough place to eat, limited on other things."
4,"I love the pumpkin bread !! Sooo good!!
Chocolate cookies to die for ! 
Thank for making fresh bread"
4,"I have a soft spot for macaroni salad and white rice.  With that said, the macaroni salad did not disappoint.   I would have enjoyed another scoop.   A weird observation, I wish they would serve the food on a larger plate.  The sauce of the meats ran all over the macaroni salad and rice.  I know, ticky tack....but for some reason it just bothered me.  The service was good!"
4,"Always a pleasurable dining experience at Waverly's! If you enjoy seafood, you must try the pan fried rock snapper. You'll have foodgasm in your mouth. Service is 5 stars!"
4,Great local bar with very fine bloody Mary's and a very welcoming and able bartender.  Great vibe.
4,"My boyfriend and I went here this weekend and had so much fun. The meat was good (shrimp is messy so eat it first) we got a bottle of soju for 20 bucks. I'm a light weight so mixed with ginger ale. Overall had fun and ate well left super full for relatively cheap. 

Will go again :)"
4,Good place for Korean bbq  in downtown core. I ordered all beef..sometimes fish and chicken. Good food and prices.
4,"Pho with beef was very good.  The broth was tasty and had good body.  Nice to know that this place is in this part of Glendale, AZ."
4,"A great little restaurant with quick service, a great spot for lunch during the work week. My favorite items on the menu are the steak sandwich (to die for) and the she crab bisque which they have on Fridays. The salads are simple but still very good. I would recommend for a quick bite to eat but definitely not for a nice dinner out. The bar area is also very small but old school and gives the entire restaurant a cool vibe. Definitely resembles an eatery in the New Orleans area."
4,"I'm sure most of you will know that this is not actually Korean BBQ. But as there is Korean style Chinese food (Jjajangmyeon and Jjamppong), I can accept Chinese style Korean food.

I've visited several different locations under this franchise, and I'm pretty confident that all of the food is the same. They must use the same recipes for the sauces. The thing I find weird about this franchise is that everything tastes the same. Even the kimchi and the bean sprouts all taste like BBQ. It's weird.

Unlike, say AYCE sushi, KBBQ is very generous with its ""all you can eat,"" moniker. In several of my visits, the plates get replenished readily, and often, staff walk around with trays full of plates of raw meat, asking if you want more refills.

Eventually, I stop eating because I get tired of eating the same flavour, and not because I'm actually full...maybe they do that on purpose!

I can't deny that it's a fun time with a group of friends.

Some tips:
Ask for a new grill when your food starts to all taste like burnt stuff
When cooking fish, place it on top of a piece of beef so that it doesn't stick to the grill."
4,"I live about 2 minutes away from this place and I am so happy (and mad) that I found this place! Happy because they have so much tasty treats and mad because I literally want to come here everyday and eat all the yummy treats and spend all my money! Seriously though...the struggle.

I absolutely love the yard bird salad! I have found this place place less than a week ago and already at the salad 3 Times. First two times were fresh and delicious! Third time it was not fresh at all and leaves were wilted and soggy (which is why I took one star off). I was pretty unhappy about that since I was so excited to eat it before studying only to find it it wasn't fresh!

I also ordered the turkey pesto sandwich which was just okay. First of all, the sandwich and salad took I while to make (which I'm ok with since it's fresh). The sandwich contained a lot of turkey but not enough pesto! 

The salted caramel cookies are to die for. I literally cannot but then because I can eat those huge cookies by myself :( also, they let you taste bread as soon as you walk in and it is amazing! I tried the pumpkin bread with whipped butter and it was delicious. They sell the whipped butter there which is one amazing thing in its self. 

They have delicious looking cinnamon rolls which I haven't tried yet (watching my waistline), delicious loaves and cookie!

Just know that when you walk in there, you will probably spend more money then you intended. Also, if I were to give a suggestion, it would probably to be to have more caffeine options!"
4,"I still remember when they were building Trader Joe's like it was yesterday! I can't believe they have been in Madison for about 10 years now. 

To begin with, they have a bounty of paid parking in the upper and lower sections of the building. In addition, there are plenty of street and metered parking around it. I adore how close it is to other businesses on Monroe Street, and how it's a quick stop on the way home from the west side of Madison. 

In continuation, they have a wide variety of organic and conventional produce and foods for your budget needs! I love how I can get a week or a little more worth of groceries for about $75! I also love the wide variety of alcohol they have at this Trader Joe's as well!

Finally, the staff is impeccable. They are friendly and ready to help when you have a question! They also always have a smile on their face which is amazing!"
4,"Great Harvest was one of my regular places I went in the Seattle/Tacoma area to get my husband his sandwich bread.  They were also a permanent staple at the Federal Way farmers market, where we used to frequent.

We decided to come here on the way to Costco, to see if they had any of the same cheddar garlic bread that they used to sell in Federal Way.  I was very sad that this was not one of the breads at this location, and the only reason I marked this business down a star.  However, they had some really lovely alternatives for my husband, and some decent multi grain, seeded bread for me.  I have not tried any of the sandwiches here, so I cannot comment on them, but I imagine they are good on such fresh bread.  

Nowadays I have been visiting the Molto Mario farmers market for the wonderful sour bread and rye bread they have, but if I find another location closer to the SW area, I'll probably be back."
4,"Tea beer cheese & chocolate.  Heaven

I love the selection of store brand snacks, treats, and beer.  It's always an experience shopping here with great people watching.  Can be really crowded and cramped, especially at the check outs."
4,"My favorite place. The foods are good. Price is so cheap and many side dishes. I like the fish and peanut side dish, but seem like they don't have it now. Busy in the dinner time but reasonable."
4,Love this place!  My facial was superb and pedicure was great (although I can't say it was extraordinarily better than the $25 pedicure I normally get).  I just wish spas (not just Elizabeth Arden) wouldn't push their product so much at the end of the treatment.  It takes away from the overall comfort and relaxation of the day.
4,"They grill their wings after the fryer and season their baked potatoes....little things go a long way, my food was better then expected for being at the local watering hole while away for work. Oh, and the bartender w sexy glasses is a good thing too."
4,"This is one of my favorite spots to go to in Willowdale! I like the fact that they are open 24 hours so they can satisfy your Korean needs. The first time I came, they had the tables near the floor where seats are needed and that was cool. I got the bimbim naengmyeon and it was pretty tasty. The side dishes were really really good, I enjoyed the anchovies. I also tried dolsot bimbimbap, the portion was smaller than other places and it tasted okay. Other than that, I do like coming here as service is attentive and quick."
4,"For the Cannery Casino...A plus! The staff in the restaurant is good The food is good! Nice to go there when they run specials, or expect a pricier menu...Not sure why the entire casino can't be run the way Waverley's is..."
4,"Would I shop for all my groceries here?  Probably not.  But they do have have a good selection of frozen appetizers, entrees, etc. for a night when you are too lazy or busy to cook.  Their cheese selection is also underrated and we typically can find something to purchase."
4,"Hickory Tavern is a local chain with several locations in the area. All the locations have many TVs and a full bar. The food is very good. Their wings are top-notch and they have a grilled version where they are finished on the grill. Two complaints I have though is that they don't have an habenero or extra hot sauce. They also don't give you very many celery sticks with the wings. With that said they have a diverse menu and their food is really good for a sports bar. If you're in the mood for seafood they have ""bucket of boat trash"" and steamed oysters. They also have fish and fish tacos. On Thursdays the oysters are on special for one dollar each and it's also three dollar draft beer night. That's why Thursday is my go to Hickory Tavern day!"
4,"I LOVE Trader's Joe, or at least this location. Nice customer service and affordable healthy option. Their storebrand products such as wine,  green tea, gluten-free, vegan and Asian fusion, are nice and delicious as well. This store is about 10 minutes away from our parents' house, so we made this our routines whenever we are at home."
4,"My husband and I both had LASIK done here and we had VERY different experiences. He went first, and I went 2 months later...

First off, I live in Summerlin, and the Wellish main office is a 45 minute drive each way. So add an hour and a half to each appointment time. Here is a quick run down of all of your appointments:
1) 1 hour consultation to see if you are even a candidate for the surgery.  
2) 3 hour pre-op testing
3) 1 hour LASIK surgery
4) 1 hour day-after post-op 
5) 1 hour week-after post-op
6) 1 hour month-after post-op
So as you can see, if you do not have a flexible schedule this will be very annoying to the other people in your life that have to adjust to your 6 appointment times all within a month. My husband was lucky and these affected no one, however I have 25 clients and a 2 year old that all depend on me being at a certain place at a certain time. 

Secondly, my scheduled surgery day was canceled on me the-day-of and moved to the following day. Annoying, yes, but what can I do? Nothing. Did this happen to my husband? No, of course not. 

Finally, operation day!!! When you check in to the office they make it very clear that you must power off your cell phones. That's fine, after all, who do I think I am, Alec Baldwin? So while waiting for my 2 Valium to kick in, they send me to the ""quiet"" room to try and relax. I'm in there no more than a minute when a cell phone alarm of church bells starts ringing for 5 consecutive minutes. My anxiety is now through the roof as I blindly (because I'm not wearing my glasses) feel my way out of the room and into an employee break room to shut the darn thing off. I later found out this was Dr. Welish's phone which he chooses to keep on. I guess his cell phone frequency goes off his own special waves. What was my husbands experience like while waiting for his Valium to kick in? ""Zen-like"" were his exact word. Good for him. 

Finally, operation time!!! As I stumble in like a drunk lady with lead feet, I quickly remind the staff that my husband would like to watch the surgery through the glass from the waiting room (as I did 2 months prior for his). They assured me that they were aware of my request. The surgery was uncomfortable and felt like it took forever. I got bubbles under my flaps which had to be smoothed out, which was not at all fun. Did my husband have bubbles under his flaps? Nope, why would he? So I am now ushered back into the waiting room where my husband is eagerly awaiting me and the first thing I ask is what he thought of watching the surgery? Oh, they forgot to open the blinds until it was over half way over. Seriously? Just fabulous. I was beyond upset that they couldn't be bothered to meet my very simple request. Because of course they remembered to do it for him! 

A full week later, I have 20/25 vision, which is not yet perfect. But they say it can take up to a month. I required tear duct plugs to keep my eyes more moist. It's an uncomfortable process. Did he? No. And in case you're wondering, my husbands vision was 20/15 the very next day. That's better than perfect. 

I write this review as a combination of both of our experiences. Obviously his would have been 5-stars. I do think the staff there is extremely friendly and knowledgable. As for Dr. Wellish himself, he seems a little like The Great and Powerful Oz. You never meet him until moments before he slices your cornea open and shoots beams of lasers into your retina. He's ok with last minute schedule changes, not abiding by his own cell phone policy, and disregarding patients simple requests. But he will happily take your hard earned $4,000. He wouldn't know who I was if I passed him on the street tomorrow, and he did my surgery a week ago. So thank you Dr. Oz, I mean Wellish, I hope at my month post-op I do have 20/20."
4,"This is not your typical healthy eating store.  They have created a unique set of grocery selections that to my mind will appeal to a modern lifestyle.   If someone is health conscious they carry products that align with a variety of healthy eating philosophies.  But they also cater to people who want value added frozen foods and carry a large selection of what look like delicious prepared dinners.
On top of this they carry a good selection of delicious chocolate bars and cookies.  And they are all at terrific prices.   The cookie aisle at my regular grocery is all national brands, overpriced and of awful flavor.  But TJs cookies are the bomb.  They taste great and the price is right.
They carry a large selection of floral bouquets that are inexpensive.  I would just go here for the flowers.
They had lower prices on a number of items that I usually buy at my local grocery.
They are unfortunately situated in a crowded part of Monroe street and the parking garage is rather dark and cramped.  Still it makes parking convenient as you just go up the elevator and you are right there.  I think it is great for the neighborhood to have this nice store there.
The staff has always been pleasant and helpful here. 
The cheese department is a bit small for my tastes.
Overall the positives of this store keep bringing me back and it gets my recommendation for anyone who wants to supplement their grocery shopping with some unique additions for a great price."
4,"Delicious food, attentive and fast service. We ordered a Branca salad, Giuseppe pizza, Napoletana pasta ( w shrimps & clams) to share. The server was thoughtfully enough to separate the pasta dish into two portions which should deserve a good tip! Ordered their famous and scrumptious Tiramisu. Yummy! Bread served at the beginning was a little cold, would be perfect if it's freshly baked. Overall Highly recommend this rest !! Got there at 6:15 pm on Friday night and there was table available for 2, but big tables were already gone. the place also got a lot busier when we left around 8pm. No reservation for dinner."
4,I've been here before twice with my fiance and my cousin. Once in 2010 and another in 2011. I love the food and how you GEF to cook it how you like. It was a bit packed inside and service was lacking the 2nd time around which is why I'm knocking it to 4 stars. I would definitely come again though.
4,"Quaint, cozy spot, run by a very friendly family from Hawaii. 
Let's just get to the food, since that's why you're reading this, right?

Da Surfrider- 4 star. The coconut shrimp is SOO DANG GOOD. It was way better that Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and other places. 
The breaded mahi mahi was OK for me, and the mac scallops were alright. The bulgogi was a bit on the salty side for me, but, that shrimp tho. The garlic aioli sauce was out of the world good, though I thought it was tar tar sauce the entire time. I stand corrected. 

Saimin- 5 star. I think this is the best simian I've ever had...and that's comparing to many food spots in Honolulu, including Zippy's. I don't know if that's even a compliment. 

Oxtail soup- 2 star. I was a bit disappointed with the dish. The broth was a bit too salty, maybe too much bouillon cubes in there, I'm not sure. The oxtail was a bit hard, and wasn't as soft and tender as I had hoped. 

Chicken katsu- 5 star. The batter was good, and it was crispy golden brown without burning...I was impressed. This might be one of the best chicken katsu's I've ever had. 

Spam musubi- 5 stars here. 

I'm giving this place a solid 4 stars for now. I think ordering the kalua pork meal is most likely the gold here. Next time."
4,"I've been to this place twice before I give them an honest review because both times have been take out orders so it's less customer service and interactions. Both times I've walked in to order and then wait for my food there. The place is relatively small so I'm assuming it might get crowded during busy hours.

I ordered off the ""happy hour"" (which is all day, and applies for take out orders also) menu and got the sushi. You can either chose a soup or salad. I opted with miso soup both times. The sushi rolls are full sized rolls as you would get if you ordered off the menu. I've gotten the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and Hawaii roll. The both spicy rolls are very typical that you would find from any other restaurant. The Hawaii roll is a little more deluxe and dressed up. The sweet sauce they drizzle over the roll is not a favorite of mine, it kind of messes with the sushi taste I think. 

The prices are VERY fair; much cheaper than you would get anywhere else you go -especially for sushi.

I have not tried their cooked plated entree's so I cannot speak for that. But as for the sushi, I would return time after time because its tasty and cheap."
4,"The place we originally wanted to go to closed down so we ended up coming here. First impressions weren't great I'll say this now. The staff seemed indifferent, the layout was kinda cramped, and a lot of the meat dishes seemed a bit pricey. 

Once we ordered however, (I got the dolsot bibimbap, my mom got the pork cutlet (don katsu)) my opinion of this place slowly changed. There were plenty of side dishes and the waitresses seemed happy to attend you as long as you get their attention. The portions seemed small, especially considering the price, but don't be fooled because by the end of it I couldn't have another bite if I'd wanted to. The bibimbap was nice and hot packed with all the goodies and the don katsu was rather tender unlike most other places (the sauce was pretty subpar and they don't give you enough rice though). 

All in all it took some time for me to warm up to this place however that initial impression I got ultimately prevents this place from getting that 5th star. 

I'd suggest getting the non-bbq dishes as you get more bang for your buck however if you've got the money to spend and looking for some good grilling you can't go wrong here."
4,Place was good! Service was super friendly! I sold fireworks for my kids out front and they even delivered my food! Ate here 3 out of the 5 days I was doing it!
4,"Eaten here 4 times now. Get tuna on salad!  It's worth the $6!!
Nice, classy place to enjoy a meal with a bar and pool table option. I think it's a local chain. Really good food too with vegetarian-friendly options"
4,"Went there because Chilis was too crowded, only regret was they didn't serve beer. The staff was great and the food was delicious. I had the California Club and don't remember what my wife's sandwich was called. This was our first time having dinner there."
4,Always an awesome place to meet and hang out w/ friends for a good time.  The food is fantastic for what is really primarily a bar....go for the fish tacos!!
4,"Service is always excellent, I love the macaroni and cheese! Great atmosphere, and have never been disappointed!"
4,"Ate this twice while in the city. I was told this is a go to spot to watch the game. 

Food was good and the menu was very decent. I'm a picky eater and was able to find something here."
4,"I don't understand the bad reviews here?  They have a nice beer list, lots of food options, and a great bar area.  Our server was attentive and was actually enjoying working; the prices were good.  I'd come back!"
4,"Your standard Trader Joe's -- all the usual merchandise and friendly staff plus parking. When I visited on a weekday in early evening, I was in and out, except for a couple who decided to play some game and toss items into their cart (the guy missed a few times). That wasn't fun to walk through, but whatever."
4,"Let's set the stage for my state of mind on my inaugural trip to French Quarter. 

Some combination of delirium from hunger (I hadn't eaten a solitary real food, unless wheatgrass and jerky are real foods)  and general anger from having to work an actual full day on a Friday compelled me to wings. 

I recalled a claim on the side of a wall at the latta arcade that this place had the city's best of those. Game on. 

French Quarter is one of those places that's description will change based on whom you ask about it. Some will call it a quaint little spot in the heart of the city. Others, a cool dive with a solid gimmick. Here's my take. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd walked into a ""confederacy of dunces"" era speakeasy (literary reference game over 9000). Very old New Orleans vibe. A little dark, despite the huge floor to ceiling windows and open door, but that's what happens when you enter a place with that much wood and stained glass. 

Let's talk service. There didn't seem to be a hostess or host to greet you at the door, and the bar was full, which is to be expected for a Friday happy hour. One of the wait staff - the little blonde one - saw this and made haste to seat me. The other one served me. 

I always take note of how long it takes to get your order in, and from there how long it takes the kitchen to hop to. they were especially on the ball. I only had to wait the exact amount of time it took me to peruse the menu and make selections to put in my order  

The food seemed to be out at the very moment the thought seed was planted in my head that I was waiting for my food.

It was out quick is what I'm saying. 

I have to mention the steak. It was puzzling. Don't get me wrong, I was satisfied with it, but I have to note that they add this steak sauce. You're either gonna love it or hate it. Me? The first bite was remarkable, full of flavors that my brain wasn't ready to experience. I made an audible exclamation. Every other bite was conflict. I know I didn't dislike the sauce, but I also felt like I could very quickly grow tired  of it. I kept taking bites, compelled to come to a decision.

Long story short, I finished the steak.

The wings. They came out mid steak. It was at this point I noticed the sun. He was on the wall, cutting his eyes at me. He had an American flag print on his face and color changing lights. I don't know why that caught my eye, but I appreciate art installations, so bonus points.

The wings. Alright, so the claim that these are the best wings in the city is heard to quantify. I got their famous salt and pepper wings. They have some really funky bleu cheese dressing. To me, that's a good thing, suggestive of the house made quality of all the food. I'll admit, the crispness, the size, the flavor despite their simplicity (not to mention how well they pair with that funky funky cheese sauce) make these some solid A to A- wings, but I'll need a bigger sample size before I can crown them. 

Definitely recommend if you're just looking for a nice place to share a couple drinks and eat some wings with friends."
4,"After passing by Kauai Cafe on a number of occasions, i finally got a chance to try them out today. 

We were greeted warmly and almost everything on the menu looked great. I decided on the kalbi plate and you get mac salad and a choice of fried rice, steamed rice or fried noodles, I chose steamed rice. My dining companion opted for katsu chicken. 

While we waited our server came out and chatted with us for quite a while and he was so nice and personable. Our food came out soon after and our jaws dropped at the generous portions. I enjoyed every bite and I had more than half my meal packed up to take home with me. I was stuffed and so was my dinner partner. 

Great big portions of delicious homemade food for such a low price, I look forward tk coming back soon."
4,"A decent size Trader Joe's (TJ) located on the floor level along with residences upstairs. One downside about this location is probably their metered parking lot. Theres some street parking available but is very limited. In fact, I saw someone got a ticket because they didnt or forgot to pay for parking. This is REALLY inconvenient.

Just your average TJ store. Nothing stands out really. I always come here for their dried fruits and also their frozen food selection. Theyre very affordable and is pretty good. On the days you dont want to go out or cook, these ready-to-eat frozen meals will save you some time. All you have to do is heat it up.

The staff here were extremely nice! Inside the store is clean and neat, always stocking the empty shelves and helping customers all around.

Theres also restrooms available by the juice bar in the back!"
4,"Twice a year, the spa industry goes gaga over the idea of $50 spa services for Spa Week.  I appreciate it and try to take advantage of this great offer to visit Spas throughout the Valley of the Sun that I normally wouldn't have thought to schedule with.

I arrived at the elegant Red Door Salon & Spa at the Biltmore and was greeted at the Front Desk by two smiling associates.  I was then escorted back to the men's locker room / bathroom to change into a robe and place my clothing in a locker.  The comfortable waiting area was quiet and empty!  ( I scheduled my appointment midweek and early in the day.)

Melanie is an excellent Massage Therapist, in fact, we had worked together a few years ago at the Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Paradise Valley.  The massage techniques were right on target and the room had a perfect atmosphere.  (I'm not a fan of head massages or scalp rubs though and will mention it next time, was too blissed out to care).

Insider Tip: Never schedule your appointments on a Friday evening or a Saturday."
4,"This is a reasonable Denny's and my husband likes to go here.  We usually get good service, but periodically not.

The food is typical and nothing out of the ordinary.  My husband does love their Lumberjack breakfast, which is a lot of food.  It's easier to go here to eat rather than make all this stuff, which I did once.  

Anyway, it's fine.  No real stand out complaints but no real stand out praises either.  It's convenient and periodically we will eat here, maybe 2-3 times a year."
4,"I enjoyed my recent visit to Pho KC!! I was so excited to see a new phone place, especially in the area that I work! I was greeted promptly, seated and given water, the restaurant was clean, I loved that...I ordered the pho Dac Viet and egg rolls. I was really impressed with how quick my food came out. It's very flavorful and they had bigger portions too, so for the price of an average bowl of pho. It was a good amount I got for less than 9 bucks! What a deal! I went up to pay and the cashier had a full on conversation with me, which is very rare, knowing the Viet culture. She was very friendly!! I will definitely be back to support this business and try all my favorite Viet dishes!!!!!"
4,I had lunch here today and was very impressed. Service was great and fast. I ate the Took Baeki Bulgoki and it was very good.Side dishes were plentiful. I would go back again
4,"The wings were good, the beer selection was respectable, and the menu featured a nice build your own salad option which was nice to see. The service was friendly and sassy for a bunch on a work trip. I noticed a nice outside seating area and a party room that was in use for a work function. Is it special? Not particularly, but it is a solid option if you are in the mood for that type of fare, good for family, friends, work, the game, etc. I would come here for the game before i would bww."
4,"Have passed by Grazie a million times, and was never interested in going inside.  My neighbour recommended that I give it a try, so I did.  The lovely interior does not match the exterior, and I am glad that I gave it a try.  We ordered a lovely Malbec to share, while we enjoyed the complimentary bread which was delicious! To dip they provided both the oil & vinegar as well as a spicy oil mixed with Parmesan cheese.   I wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered the soup of the day which was kale with Italian sausage.  It was just the right amount of spice.  For dessert we shared the Tiramisu which is definitely a share plate as it is quite a lot.  It was nice and light and was a nice end to a delicious dinner.  I plan to go back to try the pizza and some pasta."
4,"We've been to Grazie several times in the last year and it has yet to disappoint. Service has always been above average and food has always been consistently good. 
We've run the gambit of pastas to daily specials to pizza to salads. My personal fave is the potato pizza.
You do get bread to start...ask for the spicy oil...and have them leave so you can drizzle it on your food......wow.
Next to Marcello's...this is one of my fave restaurants in the area....although typical for the neighbourhood...the wait to get in can be long. 
Does no one eat at home in Woodbridge? Not with places like this......"
4,"Stopped by for lunch. Ordered Won Ton and left happy and full.  Staff is friendly and helpful and am eager to go back on Friday because they said they would have the ""feast"" available.  According to them it includes LauLau, Kahlua and Poke along with other things too.  It's close to my work and they do take out so I'm excited to go back and see what else they have to offer. Prices were doable for a good quick meal."
4,"My friends and I had had been looking for a Korean BBQ place and happened upon this place. Luckily we got there early, cause within 15-20 min after there was a line out the door. 
We all got the AYCE BBQ, and so glad we did. The staff was very helpful, despite all the reviews I read here. They were constantly filling our water and green tea, and walking by to see if we wanted to order more. And to top it off they were extremely pleasant which made out experience at this place even more worth it. We all enjoyed the grilling experience, and the food was delicious. 
They don't rush you out of the place, we were almost there for three hours. It does get a little loud in the restaurant after a while."
4,"I ordered the special of the day... Spicy mango roll and it was delicious. I am from the Pacific Northwest so I enjoy my sushi. If you are looking for a quick bite, that is relatively cheap I'd recommend Chef Ben's. The one downfall was the miso soup which should be called miso broth. The flavor was right on just no green onions or tofu. If we were passing through again we'd stop for some sushi. Also, the service was friendly and my order was ready within five minutes."
4,Service was great: prompt and pleasant. This was our first Pho experience and we enjoyed it thoroughly. They give you a side of vegetables and herbs to toss in which added flavor to the dish. They have a selection of sauces to choose from which can make or break the dish. I went with their house made chili paste and loved it. My SO got the hoisin sauce and we left happy. We will definitely be back!
4,"Waverley's is a reasonably priced steak house in the Northside Cannery. The atmosphere is nice, service was friendly, and the food was very good. 

First, their bread basket is really yummy, with a nice variety of warm breads served with whipped butter.  Onion soup was excellent with a rich broth and plenty of luscious melted cheese on top. My Filet and Lobster entree was wonderful and cooked perfectly. My date's prime rib (end cut) was also outstanding.

For sides, we really enjoyed their creamed corn and sauteed mushrooms. The only thing I didn't love was the sauvignon potatoes, which were slightly undercooked.

While not THE most amazing dining experience, it was a solid meal and a pleasant experience, and I would happily return."
4,"Everything at Waverly's is so delicious. Never a disappointment!

The service level of the entire staff is non-comparable to any high end restaurant.
The food is amazing Chef Andres is the best.

Todd Land is the manager goes above and beyond not only for his customers but he is a great manager to his staff! (That goes a long way with me!)

The value at Waverly's is never a question. You get what you pay for and here it's well worth it."
4,"This place is always packed at lunch so go early, late or plan to wait! Their weekly lunch specials are probably some of the best priced around. My personal favorite is Thursday's baked chicken w/broccoli and cauliflower and mashed potatos. Portions are large so ask for a box of you eat light. In the warmer months they have outside seating."
4,"Best Chicken Katsu I've tasted in town. Katsu was extra crispy, tasty and done with dark meat."
4,"This place was a surprise saw them on a previous trip to the Starbucks next door, and made a mental note of were they where (we don't live near here but go to EJS Auctions down the street.
The ambience was very nice, the music playing was very relaxing, very friendly staff, and the food flavorful.  The only thing bad I would say was the egg rolls were supper small and where pricey for the quantity.   

Will keep this place in mind, the next time we are in the are and in the mood for PHO"
4,"Ordered to go order, pretty fast and very friendly staff. The only downside is that they don't serve soup after 10pm lol. Anyways what more do you need to know about dennys. Go get you fill at any hour!"
4,"Ode to Trader Joe's,
I've loved to visit your shop,
to give my pantry and cooking a pop!
Some basics you've had for years,
And now you even have wine and good beers.
Black Olive tapenade and Flax Seed Chips are my faves,
Pick up my top ten, I can throw a party and still save.
Keep up the good work, hawaiian shirts and local foods,
And you'll stay in my heart, wallet and never be boo'ed.
Love,
Me, 
Loyal customer for over 15 years."
4,"Came here for a casual dinner and that's what we got.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful.  The breads were great and came with an in-house made lavash which was OUTSTANDING!  I ordered a ribeye, oscar style and it was pretty darn good.  Steak was cooked a perfect medium and the crab with sauce was awesome.  The asparagus was slightly under cooked for my liking but that's just me.  Wife's steak was a filet, well done, and it was moist and juicy.  We both ordered bacon cheddar potatoes.  They were thinly sliced (scallop style) and good.  Good price for a local steakhouse with quality and atmosphere and food 10x better than Outback for a few bucks more."
4,"Super attentive guest service.  Reps properly trained. 

Food quality - five swirly large lollipops. . 

Great spot for a healthy lunch.  It just takes a tad longer for good handmade food."
4,"Food was good, beer was cold!  Ask for Jessica as your server if she's not available ask for Justin."
4,"All I can say is WOW!

I found out about this place when I first moved here but never got around to trying it until finally last week! I'm always the last to try things! 

We came in the late afternoon and the store was empty just the way I like! I don't like anyone hovering over me especially when I'm in a new place and want to explore it! My eyes went straight to their loaves of bread! OMG! I've never seen such beautiful looking bread in my life! It is so puffy and soft! It feels like pillows of heaven! 

Also, they have baked goods which can get you in trouble too! My mom was so blown away by the free slice of bread you get! She was only expecting a tiny sliver of bread but got a whole slice of bread AND butter!! My mom said the coconut bread was too die for! I also took home a loaf of Light Wheat bread to give to my sister when we went to California and she absolutely loved it! 

They also have sandwiches and I can only imagine how crack they are! I picked up a menu for the month and OMG,every kind of option you can think of! I can't wait to come back and try other stuff! I'm a fan! ^___^"
4,"My boyfriend suggested Huh Ga Ne for dinner because he mentioned whenever his friends passed by, there would always be a long line up for a table. Where the lines were, it should be where the good food is at haha. It was true! We enjoyed our dinner here! We chose to sit at the tatami area (you sit on the floor and it's heated!) Service was great, our server came back regularly to cook our kalbi meat for us.

We ordered the:
* KALBI - Table cooking for two ($40):
(It comes with 6 different side dishes, garlic, sauce and lettuce; plus a choice of seafood soup / tofu soup)

I think the whole set was really worth it. The portion was perfect for two people. I loved the kalbi meat. It was marinated nicely and full of flavour. It wasn't that oily because the shape of the cooking pot curved inwards, so the oil was drained out pretty quickly.

The tofu soup that came with the dinner set was also very delicious. Regular flavour isn't too spicy. 

I'd recommend this restaurant for those looking for something to warm their tummies on a cold winter day! The line built up pretty quickly (at around 7 pm) so either book in advance or go early for a table (We came here at around 6 pm)."
4,"I love breakfast food. Which is why I end up at Denny's so often. I'm not really big on chains and growing up I never liked Denny's, and I have even gotten an upset stomach from going to certain Denny's.
This Denny's is the best one I have been to however. Their food is always fresh and fast, the service is always great, and I have never felt at all sick after eating here."
4,"This place is a sports bar atmosphere with some pretty good bar food!  The portions are always HUGE! 
Some of my favorites to order here are:

Smoked Wings- The dry rub is AMAZING! Salty and crunchy and so darn good!
Any Salad - The salads are so big and come with so many toppings! I always have leftovers!
Any Burger - The burgers have some really good toppings and are always good.  They come with fries (or you can substitute any side). The fries are soft and delicious perfect with vinegar!

Not the most specific, but really every meal I've had here has been good! I don't think you can really go wrong!"
4,"solid 3.5..
Went to the French Quarter for Dinner Friday before a concert.

Very pub-like - kind of has that neighborhood bar feel to it. Upon looking at the menu I wondered ""What kind of restaurant IS French Quarter?"" I wasn't sure what they were trying to be as they had pub fair, Greek, Mexican, Creole/Southern ...it was just an odd mix and right away that had me wondering.

Against my own better judgment I went for the salt and pepper wings. I decided on this for one reason only as that was dubbed their ""famous"" item. I figured if it could be famous it had to be great right? Let me first say I am a harsh critic of wings (having lived in Buffalo) - but salt & pepper wasn't exactly Buffalo style so I thought these could stand a chance. I was wrong. They were terrible! The wings were crispy but lacked flavor. ( the ranch paired with it was great though) - I decided to ask for some Buffalo sauce as I didn't want to be eating globs of ranch. I was really surprised with how great the  Buffalo wing sauce was! 
All in all I think I will branch out and try something else next time-but I wasn't disappointed..

Also, it was CHEAP - $15 dinner for two, really can't beat that."
4,"Great food, fun atmosphere on a Saturday night. Hostess and wait staff a little off, but overall everything was great."
4,My brother took me there for Father's day. Service was fast and my meal came out just right. So did everybody else's meals. The best part. I didn't even have to see or pay the bill!
4,"Stopped here on my own to try their pho, I usually go to Angelina's but since they increased their prices I would like to find a more 'budget friendly' place for my occasional pho fix.

The service was very good, Kim was very nice and friendly, and she acknowledged that I was a new customer, very impressive.

This is a very small place in a strip mall, and they have plenty of parking. Right next to Starbucks.

I thought the pho was good, but the broth was not very tasty. I will have to come back one more time to see if that is the rule or if it was an off day.

These are other things that I liked:

They provided plenty of herbs and sprouts.

I usually have the pho dac biet without noodles, Kim suggested cabbage instead of noodles and that was a nice idea.

I do not love the meatballs, so I was happy to see they have an option with only thing beef, tendons and tripe (my favorite items from the pho dac biet).

Overall a good experience, and a very reasonable price."
4,"Awesome Korean BBQ!   We had the ""all you can eat"" and boy did we eat!    Multiple servings of side dishes,  lots of good meat selections!    Really tasty.

The only downside of the meal was that the cookers are mounted a little low in the tables so you had to lean forward more than I would have liked to cook the food.

Plan to drink lots of water though - lots of sodium here!"
4,Good and very authentic korean place in the area! I tried dolsot bibimbab and kimchi stew and couldn't finish neither. Good portion sizes and fresh food. Love the side dishes.
4,"It's hard for me to be objective about this place because my favorite thing about it is that it reminds me so much of home.  With that said, I think we can all pretty much agree that this is  not and will hever be the kind of place where you will do all your shopping.  It will however be the type of place where you go for things that you can only get a Trader Joe's.  Things like Orangina, and pretty kickass one person dinners.  The help here is definitely not as attentive as they are in other places but that doesn't take aware from my love of this place.

One more thing that I love about this place is that even though it is a small little thing I have seriously somehow managed to spend over an hour in it, on several occasions.  This place will always be one of my faves!  They are always adding new things so it makes shopping here almost like an adventure. Did I mention that they also have samples.  Not Costco status by any means but a little something to snack on it always popping in the back.  

Trades Joe's, keep doing what your doing!"
4,"""My 24/7 buddy""

What time we arrived/Wait time?
I'm korean so I've been here like a billion times when I'm craving my foods but I'm too lazy to cook haha. It's usually busy when I go for dinner. Lunch is a bit better. But try to go on off times.

Atmosphere?
It's nice! You maaaay smell after you leave though since some people order samgyupsal which is table top cooking so just beware! This ain't a super fancy place. It's nice though with the chandelier and floor sitting area. 

Service/Staff?
Very fast and efficient. They just want you to get in and get out! Nothing new here haha

Food/Menu?
The soonduboo is pretty good here. The ddukmandoogook is good here. The Jyukbokum is amazing here. The side dishes are okay (kinda not fresh because its 24/7 place). The donkatsu is good here. Everything is pretty good here considering it's 24/7 and it's a good all around cool place to try out if you're exploring korean food."
4,"Simple Korean favourites at affordable prices, with floor seats (think cushions down and no shoes) or regular seats. There's even Korean TV airing some talk shows or variety shows, to complete the mood. If you're not into the casualness, it may be a huge culture shock, but otherwise it's a great spot for a small group! Lots of people were grilling and enjoying hotpots, and there was a steady waiting line throughout the weekday evening. 

We got the glass noodles, rice cakes in hot sauce, and fried dumplings. This was plenty of food and made the next day's dinner for me! The glass noodles are a sizeable portion, and there were lots of fried dumplings that gave merit to the price tag. The rice cakes were tasty - though I couldn't have many due to my weak spice tolerance.

Come for the food and atmosphere, be ready to flag someone down for service or be super patient, and if you're ok with floor seats you'll get seated much faster!"
4,"Korean Grill House is a chain. And as some of the other reviews have mentioned, it's not really Korean. It's Korean-style BBQ. This particular branch has 2 stories. Most of the seating is on the 2nd floor. Wait staff is attentive and friendly. 

The food is good. The all-you-can-eat dinner is $12.95 Canadian dollars. Comes with thinly-sliced beef, BBQ ribs, pork, salmon, and squid. Also comes with side dishes. The kimchi is good, but the rest are just OK. 

Had the mango sticky rice for dessert, which was terrible. The mango was unripe, and the sauce was way too sour."
4,"This place has always been clean when I come in. Everyone is nice, even the patrons, and the service is fast. 
Good breakfast+Nice waitresses=Good start of day"
4,"There is free parking underground! I repeat there is free parking underground! You just have to wrap around the building when you are driving down Monroe and you will see the entrance off of the main street. I see so many reviews on here complaining of the parking situation and it's a shame cause TJ's is nice enough to provide free parking and for some reason many don't know even though there is a big sign as you are walking into the store stating free parking. 

TJ's sells many addicting items. For example the best shrimp cocktail sauce in the world. Also why settle for freezer meals from a regular grocery store when you can bring a chicken vindaloo freezer meal to lunch at work for only about $3. Their salted chocolate covered almonds. Their nut and dried fruit section is awesome and nicely priced for the amount that you get. 

They almost always are sampling something at their sample station when I make a visit. Last week was the their turkey chili  from a can which was actually pretty amazing. So I appreciate them sampling things that I would not normally pick up. Also they always sample a beverage at the same time, always nice to have to help wash down the food sample. 

The only thing that I'm not a huge fan of is the produce. I prefer to go elsewhere for produce. 

They have a decent alcohol selection too. Great place to pick up drinks, snacks, etc. for a pot luck or a party. You'll most likely be able to find score easily at finding something yummy that many people will like."
4,"Finally found a place for authentic Pho !
Service was fast and pleasant. Pho was delicious. 
Would be 5 stars if ambience was nicer, but price was reasonable, so there you go."
4,"Went to Grazie last night to finally try them out for the first time. I used to live near the Yonge and Eglinton location but everytime I tried to go it was always super busy and had a long wait to get in.

The ambiance is just ok... feel they could have done a better job here. Also serving the butter packets with the bread kinda cheapened the experience but they also gave this dip (balsamic, spicy oil & parmesan cheese) which was very tasty for the bread!

The wine list was very reasonable with some great options at reasonable prices.

I ordered the Baked Goat Cheese salad ($12) to start which was super tasty and something I would definitely reccomend. Basically it is goat cheese wrapped in phylo pastry served on a bed of greens w/ tomatoes on the side. A good sized portion! For my main I had the Nonna Franca pasta ($14.50) which at first I felt was just okay, but as I kept eating it and getting more of the flavour in there it was quite delicious! I really liked the sweet/savoury combo in this pasta.

All in all my meal came to $80 after tax, tip, a 1/2 litre of wine and a caffe latte and I think it was worth it.  

All in all I would say it is probably a 3.5/5 for the category it is in and definitely worth trying. I just wish they had a caprese salad on the menu, though the goat cheese was quite awesome!"
4,The budae stew (army base) was good but one of the waitresses literally harassed me for not giving a 10% tip and was really trying to fight me (I tipped using the exact $ option). I give the food 4 stars but the waitress' attitude 0 stars. Most customers won't come again after being harassed for tips... my friend and I are just still students (unemployed) and our hoodies weren't exactly designer... not sure why the waitress thought we're made of money lol
4,"I have to admit if I had done this review a month ago I would have done 2 stars. We have been to this location several times and each time we have gone they have been out of prime rib. Tonight we got our dinner to go and it was late 9:15 when we ordered so I expected them not to have prime rib, but.... They did! They cooked everything perfect the gal at curbside was super awesome! Will definitely be back to give it another shot!"
4,"After a girls day of shopping at Vaughn Mills, we decided to pop in for dinner at Grazie.
Take in mind this place doesn't take reservations so if you don't get in for dinner before 6pm you're going to be waiting for a table.  Usually the wait time is 30min.
Luckily we slipped in around 5:50 and we got a table right away.

The staff are really friendly and we had the most entertaining waiter.  He was flirtatious, but he made our stay very fun.  Jokingly insulting us because we wanted separate bills and making comments about us in general.  Good way to gain tips because he was very likable. 

2 of my girls ended up with pizza which was a generous size and they book took home a doggie bag. 
 I ended up with the Tasca pasta -  spinach, mushrooms and brie baked in a surrounding noodle and then smothered in their creamy tomato sauce.  SOOOO good.  Highly recommend! 
Prices are reasonable - roughtly $14-16 for your main meal.
To end off the night we shared a Tiramasu.  Creamy and very rich.  Just hit the right spot.
I left the restaurant full and satisfyed. 

Random note - they have a basket of boxed matches for you to take beside the main door.
Who gives out matches anymore?...  I stole about 6 boxes.. don't tell anyone :P"
4,"Pretty happy, we were placed into a corner, where we could never get any service, because nobody saw us.

I swear the server probably forgot we were there, that's okay.

Food was good, pretty fast to come
Service was good, (when we actually received service).
All in all, I liked it."
4,Meal was tasty and service was blazing fast. Portions were reasonable for the price. restroom was clean.
4,"We weren't sure what to expect, but we left happy! They have an assortment of breads, sweet baked goods (cinnamon rolls/cookies/etc), and create-your-own sandwiches.

We both got sandwiches and were happy (~$6 per sandwich). He had a grilled sandwich on white bread; I had a cold light wheat sandwich. Mmm, I love wheat  bread!"
4,"Just an update to my older review.  Great Harvest recently moved from the small pad next to Starbucks to a space twice the size on the corner of the same building.  It feels much more open and there is quite a bit more seating.  They also now have a Coke Freestyle machine.  Same great food, better location."
4,"Oh, TJ's - you are a dangerous one. Whenever I wander in to ""pick up a few things"" without a list, I inevitably walk out with a random bagful of items that racked up a pretty penny at the checkout. Lots of items are really reasonably priced (or, frankly, downright cheap), but once you throw a few ""ooooh, that sounds yummy"" items in your basket it can add up quickly. That's my own fault, though - you can't blame the geniuses who invented Cookie Butter. 

Some things that I'd suggest trying, in addition to the aforementioned addiction in a jar, are the Meatless Meatballs, Soyrizo, Cherry Chocolate Chip Soy Creamy frozen dessert, and the Ginger Almond Granola. I am not vegetarian or vegan or dairy/gluten-free, I just think those items are delicious. They've got a lot of stuff for you to expand your horizons on. 

If you're on a budget, make a list. If you've got some extra cash, poke around and try something new!"
4,"Came here last week for a date with my wife due to gift cards we had for YEARS lol and Outback didn't disappoint! We both ordered sirloin steaks with baked potato, broccoli and side salad. The steak was cooked medium just as I had requested and the potato was very flavorful. The broccoli was easy to eat and not hard/chewy like you get at other places. The bread they gave before the meals was also pretty good compared to other restaurants. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful.

I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best steak place around, but it's definitely not a bad option."
4,Love TJ its right by my house I just walk over there. The prices are great. Sometimes products are not there that you had but that's the business.
4,I like this store and their triple ginger snaps. The only reason I am removing a star is because of the parking lot; but that is really just first world problems.
4,"Always consistent seevice and food. Ive been loving this place, however lately due to this restaurant being popular and being somewhat small restaurant, i couldn't dine here(busy 6-8pm)
Imo this place is best to go @ yonge&finch late night tho"
4,"Lunch all you can eat meats for $8.99? Sign me up... 

Service is pretty much non-existant, but I don't really expect a lot of service at what amounts to a buffet, but topping up the kimchi, rice, and drinks without being asked couldn't hurt..."
4,"The French Quarter is one of the best restaurants in uptown Charlotte. I worked for the Charlotte Chamber for 13 years (it is right around the corner) and used to eat there at least once a week. Now my office is right off of Morehead Street but still get up there at least once a month. The prices area affordable, food is always good and the service is on spot. Not too many places uptown that you can order and eat with in one hour. Even if you have to wait you still make it out within the hour. There is typically is a line around noon, get there around 11:45 and you will be all good.

Steve Caldwell"
4,Visited for a quick meal before the Belk Bowl.  Service was great.  The Host was right on track getting us in and seated as soon as possible even though it was a game day crowd and they were extremely busy.  Our waitress was good and friendly.  We had 4 people in our group and we had a variety of burgers and sandwiches and everyone was very pleased with the quality and taste of the food.  Corned Beef Sandwich was excellent.  Only complaint in the whole meal is that the Burger Bun kinda sucked.  Crumbled and fell apart.  It was a great tasting burger too so it made me sad that the bun sucked.  I'd recommend this place.  They had a great beer selection too.  I had a Jalapeno Pale Ale from Birdsong that was pretty unique.
4,I love barbeque.  Dickey's delivers a great meal for a great price.  The pork sandwiches are lean and delicious.  I also love the free ice cream cones.
4,"Pasta dishes were flavorable and noodles al dente, octupus app was very good, and nice selection of dessert"
4,"You know what.  There's a REASON why three buck chuck costs $3 (and I'm PISSED that it's $3 and not $2 like everywhere else in the country).

But if you're drinking a $3 wine, do you HONESTLY expect it to taste good?  DO YOU? 

It's actually not *that* bad.  

I take that back.  It is.  Unless you, say, use it for a sangria, and mix it with fruit, brandy, cognac, and THEN we're talking (it acts more like a carrier than anything).

But I LOVE TJ's, love their cheeses, love their brand, their fruit selection could be bigger, LOVE the location (it's less than a mile from me, so I walk), and love having more excuses to go to Monroe...

I'd say TJ's is the BEST neighbourhood grocer.  

PSA.  Parking is in the bottom, entry by Spooner.  Not perpendicular to Ancora, they charge.  Boo on them."
4,"So had too try another local style 808 because REALLY can never get enough local food in life!! It amazing thinking about close twenty years ago first moved Vegas could count with two hands local style restaurants in the Valley outside of downtown (California Hotel). Now too many too keep track of and talk about competitive market. The best part is not only competitive but spread across the Valley and blessed think now have few options in my area. Kauai Cafe is the latest one. It just recently opened so the signage out front is work in progress. Never judge book from its cover because once you get inside feeling the Aloha spirit and literally family run business (The dad/son run the kitchen; his daughter runs the front). Decor inside tell Hawaii pride from the Hawaii state flag and kealii reichel pictures. If you from Hawaii know who Kealii Reichel.

The food since first time not sure what I wanted but ended up going for the Kalua Pork Poor Boy with Portuguese bean soup for my side. I ordered side of fried noodles just because wanted try more...The Portuguese bean soup was good. Talk about hearty soup. So much of the good stuff Portuguese sausage, noodles, beans, and vegetables quite literally one spoonful of broth. The fried noodles I could have just had whole plate of noodles. Just like back home with the charsu action, the noodles, and great sauce. The Kalua Pork Poor Boy talk about mean sandwich. I had my reservations because Kalua Pork is Kaiua Pork and Cabbage. I happy that went outside the box. It stole the show, The Kalua Pork was nice moist, topped with bbq sauce, and the citrus walnut slaw brought it all together. I know might thinking pulled pork sandwich but I felt like nothing like it. Sure sandwich would order again again.

The staff or family truly exemplifies the aloha spirit. John the dad presence very much felt outside talking too customers. He checked up on me next thing know talking stories about they use too run same place in small town outside of Seatttle, WA. Got tired of the weather whole family moved too Vegas. His son is the chef of the kitchen, daughter takes care of the front of the house, and his daughter best friend one of the servers. Truly not only feel the aloha spirit, just the passion they have for the food, and making it authentic local food. Also like is signature dishes that will make return visit. It authentic but with their own touch. The portion sizes any other local plate nice size and nothing more bang for your buck then local food. 

Without doubt will be coming back because lot more local food need too try at Kauai Cafe."
4,"Great service!  Had the ""perfect pastrami"" sandwich on asiago sourdough (homemade ). Very tasty!  Perfect lunch portions. You may also purchase homemade bread here of all sorts!"
4,"- 24hr spot with GOOD food (rare)
- Cheap and will definately fill you up
- Service isn't friendly but FAST. Need to be assertive when asking a server to come by. 
- Pork Bone Soup most common order. 
- The korean side dishes are excellent"
4,"Having frequented Trader Joe's on the west coast, I was elated when a TJ's opened in Madison.  Trader Joes is great for wine, cheese, eggs, dairy, meats and fish, juices, and many other basics, with an eclectic variety of specialty foods, most of which is sold under the Trader Joe's label.

Some of the packaged and frozen items can be hit or miss, and you probably wouldn't want to do all your shopping at TJ's, but it's a great alternative to your standard supermarket and has more reasonable prices than Whole Foods (aka ""Whole Paycheck"").  Staff can be good sources for recommendations, and there's usually a free sample booth for featured products.  Just be careful--it's all too easy to go in for just a few things and walk out with a lot more!"
4,"On a recent return to Waverly's, after dipping into the Bread Basket, I enjoyed an interesting Escargot with Mushroom Sauce, a nice alternative to the traditional Escargot Bourguignon or Escargot with Garlic Butter Sauce.  This was followed by a tasty and cheesy French Onion Soup with a large, fast deconstructing crouton.

For an entree I paired a very good medium-rare Petite Filet enhanced by good house-made Bearnaise Sauce, with a fairly sweet Lobster Tail and Au Gratin Potatoes that were quite yummy.  This time there were no temperature problems with the food; everything was served hot.

Service was fine and friendly, and seating was comfortable in wooden armchairs with uphostered seats.  A large scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream was a great counterpoint to an excellent, rich Molten Lava Cake.

This was a delightful 4-1/2 star experience!"
4,"If I had been Yelpin' for the past 5 years I'd have some crazy badges for dining here. I love Grazie. Its casual, its simple, its pasta its Italian and its delicious! 

Basta Basta Basta! Best pasta ever. I've tried almost everything on their menu in the pasta section but keep coming to that. The service is usually pretty good. If you're in North York or Vaughan, do pay Grazie a visit.

Im a Tiramisu destroyer - and the Tiramisu here is in my books the best! I hate it when restaurants serve tiramisu as a cake - its not a cake damnit! Grazie serves them in three scoops - which is perfect for sharing. Its light fluffy not too sweet not too strong and just melts in your mouth. Mmmmm I want me some more"
4,"My three favorite things about entering a Great Harvest are: the warm greeting on initial entrance, the delicious smell lofting in the air, and the thick slice of fresh bread offered at the counter. 

The way Great Harvest prepares their breads is one of the reasons why it is worth every penny. When you break into any of their loaves, the bounty of ingredients is clearly visible. For sandwiches, I love to get their cheddar garlic and have them slice it up. With bread like this, it is unnecessary to add any cheese to the sandwich or anything besides protein and veggies. I could make a meal out of it on it's own. Then follow it with some of their Sin Amen Swirl."
4,"I read through some of these reviews and came to the conclusion that some people don't understand how the rating scale works. 

Tonight after making a purchase at a near by store one of the employees made the suggestion to try Dickey's when we asked him what was good to eat in the area. I'm glad we took his advice. The pulled pork is good, albeit slightly chewy. The coleslaw has great flavor, and the mac and cheese was decent. It didn't have any flavor besides cheese, but obviously that's what I expect mac and cheese to taste like. The bbq sauces are thin, but still pack enough tang. I also tried my boyfriends mashed potatoes and waffle fries, both were great. Maybe some Scottsdale locals are just used to eating in fancy restaurants, and expect the cheaper food to taste just as good? Who knows. This place did fine by me."
4,Brunch menu && $4 mimosas/bloody mary's on Sunday. Perfect for a quiet Sunday meal && some football.
4,"Ok, look, it's Denny's I just can't give a Denny's a five star review well, because it's Denny's. 

Keeping that in mind, I stop in here from time to time, usually for breakfast. I must say my visit yesterday exceeded my expectations. The service was great, the food came out perfectly. And the manager (I think he's a new manager here) was very nice and making sure everyone was taken care of. 

Good job everyone. If every Denny's ran like this one, they'd have a better rep."
4,"I was truly afraid of this location (and Outback in general) given reviews.  Very surprised when we visited!  Reasonable prices, good service, good selection of appetizers and drinks, and a complementary Bloomin' Onion which was supposed to have been a ""taste.""  Didn't eat any steak since my husband cooks the ""best"" at home, though he ordered a ribeye and said it was good.  Lots of food for the money.  Dinner for two was around $50 (plus tip) for four appetizers, three drinks and one entree.  We left with a shopping bag of leftovers."
4,Good stuff.... I always have more sides than I should. ( mac and cheese is awesome) quick and tastey place for lunch.
4,"Salads are good, but this place's secret is their Thursday special, Baked Chicken.  French Quarter is busy for lunch every day.  Indoor seating is limited, but creates good atmosphere for this place.  They are usually open before Panther games. 

Tip:
To avoid the weekday lunch rush, I recommend arriving no later than 11:30 a.m., or you'll stand in line to get in.  They offer outside seating when the weather is nice."
4,"Three friends and I dropped by here for lunch today. We all shared the all-you-can-eat meat portion (I'm not sure what it's called, but it was the first thing on the menu). The rice was perfectly cooked, and the meat was of superb quality. The servers were quick to bring everything over and offer refills, too. Definitely worth a try!"
4,"where else can you get sooo much delicious meat in delicious sauce!

I love this place when I'm craving a huge meal and have a lot of time. 

their service is great but the soometimes don't bring every single thing you ordered (I think they forget) but I never quite get upset because I think it's understandable."
4,"Small bologna and salami sandwich, toasted with cheese, mustard, and mayo. Very cheap and good. They also have good pickles, and soda made the old fashioned way. Really cool little shop. Check it out."
4,"After a late breakfast at Faberge , decided to walk around and discover this pretty street called Fairmont! Saw this spot looked retro,dated! I had to go in! First Thing  I noticed was books for sale for a buck! I then saw a counter and people and I realized that I was a restaurant / grab n go spot! 

Since I wasn't hungry I opted for a strawberry milkshake! It was only 2.17$ !!!

The place is cool in it's own way! I love places where there's history! The walls were jam packed with that. 

Staff was extremely nice! Family owned I like I like

As for the milkshake is was basic no fuss and hit the spot! I have to definitely go back for their sandwiches!

By the way there's only stools at the counter and sits about 10-15 people! If you are in the area and it's still open check it out!"
4,"This place is awesome and cheap. 4 of us ate for $22. Recommend the chicken tacos and the paisano burrito. 

Keep in mind this is a literal liquor and casino store but there are some tables to sit outside. Typical taco truck type situation where you usually order food to go. 

Food was awesome, authentic, and cheap. Love this place!"
4,"I was craving a big juicy burger and decided to give Burger Factory a try. 
When we arrived there was only one other guest. Ordering was a breeze, location was clean. The food took about 10 minutes, but who cares if its hot & fresh...right??

And OMG...they were both hot and fresh!! The fries were perfectly crispy, hot and salty....delish. The burger with a bunch of topping was big, hot and not so juicy but hit the spot.

My son ordered the #1 combo and I had the #5 combo, both with fries. 

We will definitely be back with hopefully room in our bellys for funnel cake!!"
4,"Fast and easy check out, placed my order and paid pretty quick. I went around noon and it wasn't too busy. 

This place actually had pretty good food and is ready pretty quick so I really appreciate that when I'm on the go. Only thing that could improve is the rice to meat ratio. For the $7 I pay I get way too much rice but other than that it's pretty good!

Also ordered veggie spring rolls and they were super yummy and fresh!"
4,"Great lunch option. My friend and I ordered the do it yourself rolls, and a bowl of chicken curry vermicelli noodles. The rolls were filling and fun, (but messy!) we were actually so full after sharing the roll plate that we only dipped into the noodle bowl. Impressive for two growing girls.  The chicken curry was pleasantly spicy (not overwhelming) with lovely cooked onions. The dish was warm, however there was not a lot of meat in the bowl.

My real negative? The bathroom downstairs had a HUGE spider. Trying to pee while being watched by Charlotte, was sort of frightening. People should NOT downplay the importance of bathroom situation in the overall dining experience.

We paid $24 with tax and tip for the two dishes, with complimentary tea at the table, and left with a take out container for lunch today!"
4,On y va pour la nostalgie. Je prends toujours le classique sandwich grillé avec muff anglais avec salami et baloney
4,"This hospital isn't too bad.  I wasn't there for anything for myself, but I was there a lot over this last weekend and I didn't get sick of it or irritated with anything.

The hospital is well set up with a logical set up clearly used by other hospitals, but with a ""cleaner"" look.

Doesn't smell like a hospital. :-)  And I was fasting at the time, so my sense of smell was impeccable.

Lobby is nice looking... the only thing is the elevators.  You get in them and you feel like they are going to fall apart.  They creak and groan and shriek... ick.  Nobody likes a freaky elevator.  And I used a number of them in that building.

In the surgical services waiting room, they have these nice flat panel tv's to watch the news on... so much better than other waiting rooms where there is nothing.  And there was PLENTY of room so you didn't have to cram right next to someone who needs their space, or even if you need your space.

I know in Banner Thunderbird, I lost my cell phone signal, but not in this one... it was excellent in there. :) Hope that doesn't come across as shallow... but when you have a loved one in there for a sudden appendectomy like the poor lady that was next to my loved one, you need that cell phone reception.

The RN assigned to my family member was great.  He worked with us quite a bit... his name is Rick, so if you ever get him, he's great. :)  A few of the CNA's were great too... Charlie (who was funny as HELL), Jaime... and there was another who worked nights whom I don't remember her name. They were good.  A couple were weird... some CNA's don't know their boundaries (playfully attempting to touch the bandage where you have been stapled that same day is not a fun game) and others just don't know how to stick a fricken needle in my partner's arm less than 5 times.

Other than that... they were great.  It was clean and well maintained, everything worked.

I know they used to get a bad rep a few years ago, but that seems to have changed as we were not affected by anything negative.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because nothing about it made me say ""wow"" either."
4,A nice night out wifey.  Catch 23 Improv was great. Some talented comedians. Overall a good night out for the price of movie night.  Definitely do it again.
4,"Visiting from USA, late night decided to chow out. Stop at this place 10 mins before closing. Great staff, didn't showed any frustration on making late large order. Excellent burgers. JUICY LUCK ON FIRE IS A must try. Kids loved it."
4,"The special with swiss is the way to go to my mind.  They have been doing it forever.  The owner said though that they've been selling way more with cheddar since the mind of a chef show was there.  But swiss, for sure the swiss.  Also go with the full sour pickles as well.  Don't even mess with the half sour, because who wants a half strength picked?  

Lots of childhood memories come back with the special.  Not because I've been here before but I remember by dad making grilled balcony and cheese sandwiches.  So on that level this place might rock your world if it tricks some childhood issues.  

But how do you rate an Institution with such a long history that awakens nostalgia?  Really , you probably can't and be honest.  Part of you will want to rate high just because of the history and the fact that it is a very damn fine sandwich.  And there is probably some small part of you whispering to try and not rate it high due to some food snobbery or other issues or just being contrary.  For me, this place is something everyone should try once no matter what.  For some of you it will be 5 star and bring back childhood memories and for others you might not understand.  That is fine, but like I said everyone should go at least once.  But why 4 stars and not 5?  For me 5 has to be transcendent or reproducibly great.  I've only been once.  When I go back, I'll bump them up to 5 stars.  Not like this one review is going to make or break them.  But go before the neighbor hood changes or the next generation gets crazy ideas."
4,"This place is a family owned restaurant. I really enjoy their wraps which comes with a very large platter of toppings ranging from greens to pig ears. The pho, mun and rice dishes are good too. I also particularly enjoy the cane shrimps. 

My #1 recommendation for Vietnamese food in Chinatown."
4,"Very surprised by the quality of food. 

I hadn't heard anything about jacksons burger and just happened to be walking past and decided to give it a try. The burger was really good. Not as good as a burgers priest or burgernator but a lot better than typical fast food or chain restaurants. 

The best part of the combo though were the fries. Not only were they great tasting and quality they hook you up with so much. A whole box full. I'm usually disappointed with burger joints fries. Either too little, not good quality or both but this place gets it right."
4,When eating at Pho restaurants 99% of the time I will order vermicelli with grilled pork and a spring roll (bun thit nuong). With that being said Anh Dao is at top of my list.  Cash only.
4,"Wilensky's is a tough place to review. While in Montreal, I ate at Joe Beef and Au Pied du Cochon. To review those places in the same frame of mind as Wilensky's is unfair. They are striving to accomplish different goals. Here, you'll get an unpretentious, straightforward lunch at incredible speed. You'll enjoy the vibe. The food isn't mind blowing, but is very tasty, in a simple, no frills sort of way.

First, the neighborhood Wilensky's is in is awesome. If you're a tourist in Montreal, come here and walk around for a non tourist vibe. Enjoy a special, grab a coffee at Arts Cafe, and then eat again at Fairmont Bagel. 

Next, the food and drink. The Wilensky Special is salami and bologna served on a toasted roll, topped with mustard. It's a simple sandwich, but it will hit you in all the right spots. It's ready in less than a minute, and you'll likely want two. Order a cherry soda with it - Wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda, and it's very tasty, even if you don't drink soda.

Finally, the ambiance. This place is a classic - 1930's era posters cover the wall, all seats are at a bar facing the griddle. Sitting at the bar, chatting with the owner (who is very nice, and patiently answered two questions about Anthony Bourdain while I was there), gives a very relaxing, small town feeling.

Come here and enjoy the sandwich. But more so, enjoy the classic, friendly neighborhood vibe it gives off. It'll set the tone for your day."
4,Excellent old school burger restaurant.   I highly recommend  it. Fresh cut fries and home made burger patties never lie.
4,"Peggy was a wonderful personable server that assisted us rookies on the menu. We sampled our way with  quesomole, drinks, beer, mama bear and wedge. No room for desserts, but she made them sound really yummy too.  Brisket was the winner and pulled pork was a close second. He loved the beans, I was not a fan. Plenty of food, hope you get a good guide. We will be back soon."
4,"I heard Toronto is famous for their pho so of course we had to try at least one Viet restaurant during our time here. This was the first Viet restaurant that we came across while walking on Spadina Ave toward Chinatown so we decided to give it a try for lunch. It was good! The broth was super flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. Really liked the assortment of meats. The BBQ pork over rice was spectacular as well. Spring rolls were very crispy and delicious. The place itself is a little old and run down, which seems to be the case with a lot of the restaurants in Toronto. It seems to be a family run business. Who I'm assuming to be the father wasn't that friendly but the son, who took our order, was a lot nicer. Prices were excellent! I think it was like $7.50 CAD for a bowl of pho, which equates to a little less than $6 USD. That's insane considering a bowl of pho in NYC can go up to $15! Overall, solid and affordable option for Viet food in the area."
4,"Went here with my girlfriend on a Friday night.  

Overall: For the price it is worth it, a good cheap way to have some fun outside the house.

Service/Ordering: (4 stars)
We ordered tickets online, so when we got there we just had to show the receipt (on the phone is fine) and we given the real tickets.  The tickets online are a bit cheaper ($8 instead of $10) than at the door, but the main reason to get them is that the show usually sell out.  At least that is what I was told.  The show we went to, was about 3/4 full. 

Show (4 stars):
The show we chose was Forever Jung.  It was 6 stand up comics that do their bit, then get analyzed by a in-house therapist.  The stand up comics were varying in quality. The performers were:

Dena Jackson - (5 stars) - definitely the best performer of the night.  She really got into the roll she was portraying.  
John Mostyn (4.5 stars) - the opening comic, talked about him being Scottish and how he was trying to become part of Canadian society.
Jen Sakato (4 stars) - Talked about her previous relationships, and her half white, half Japanese family.  
Marc Hallworth - (3 stars) Kept having the same joke over and over again, with a very slightly different twist. 
Jess Salomon (4 star) - Talked about her trying to support minorities, fighting the power.  
Anasimone George (1 star) - did not find her funny, talked about her being brown, and interactions with a white boyfriend.  (But was more telling stories, then jokes/funny) 

Food and Drinks: (2.5 stars)
We did not want to get any food as we wanted to eat out after, but we got a few beers.  Each beer was $7.  They accept credit cards and cash. The server at the bar, served the waitress cutting line instead of the customers waiting in line. At least use a separate area to server the waitresses, do not but in front of customers."
4,"Fun place with an inclusive menu that has vegetarian options. They also have a great selection of local beers. The patio is cute and the bar area is very inviting. I got vegetable tacos and they were cooked to perfection. Their side dish selection is superb, with tons of vegetables cooked in different styles. Definitely a great find in Mayfield!"
4,Delicious burgers - a little cramped - pleasant staff - I order ahead of time to avoid long wait times. Tried the Cheese burgers only and they were really good the both times I visited.
4,"4.8/5 I love everything about this place! EVERYTHING! Once you walk in to this little gem, I felt instantly transported back in time! With the old school swivel stools, the worn out table, house made sodas, the retro decor and them salami bologna sandwich! 

Don't feel intimidated when you first walk in... go straight to the front and ask for the Wilensky special! Add a pickle on the side and grab one of their homemade sodas! 
I had to take off one star because I'm not a big fan of the cornmeal dusted bread. I would preferred everything about the bread minus the cornmeal. But BRAVO for everything else!

Eat it on the go or if it's not busy grab a seat! You won't be disappointed!"
4,"As a burger and fries place I give it 2 stars.  Thin, over-cooked burger patties and fries cut too small.   I know this is their classic style but I don't like it.

Their frozen custard is first rate though.

My advice is just go there for the FC."
4,Best nachos! I was able to put all the ingredients i wanted  and the meat was seasoned really good. They provided fast service. Since i went in my lunch break
4,"Pretty darned good! Tried the make it yourself rolls. The food here was really really good. The service, could use a good bit of help though. From the perspective of ""oh, hey, its about a 30 minute wait for pho type foods"" and the ""why don't we bring out the appetizer quicklier if it takes a while to prep the main plate.

But, That's not super important as what matters more is the food. The fried rolls were good. Served traditionally with the stuff on the side to make your happy roll taco, but lacking noodles.

The make your own rolls with the grilled pork was very tasty and came with plenty of toppings. The only downside is that the skewers were one large honking slice of meat, and no fork was provided. I'm unsure of how other people get the meat off the skewer and into the roll without making a huge mess. I...made a huge mess...and felt really bad about it, but whatever! Tummy Supper Yummy =)"
4,"I've been looking forward to eating here for the longest time.  Finally got to try out this pho place which is among the best in Toronto.

We ordered 79. Famous Beef Noodle Soup Rice Noodles, 124. BBQ Pork & Imperial Rolls, and 02. Fried Imperial Rolls (2).

The pho here was excellent.  Very tasty and flavourful.  Number 79 had a mixed variety of meat : beef tripe, beef balls, beef brisket, sliced beef.  The imperial rolls were fantastic, filled with pork and chives.  The BBQ pork dish was super, better than Pho Pasteur.

Noticed the restaurant was quite small.  We were sitting very crowded next to the table beside us.  Wish it was open till late or 24 hr like Pho Pasteur.

My tummy is happy now from the yummy meal.  Loved the food here.  Will definitely come back to Anh Dao next time I'm in the area!"
4,"Wow, really good custard.  Love, love, love it.  

The burgers are pretty good too.  Don't let their thinness fool you, they are filling.  The fires are kinda a pain though.  Their so skinny, they are hard to pick up and dunk in ketchup!  

Sizes of the drinks and ice cream items are small.  But lets face it, do we really need all of those extra sugars?  However, given their size, I would have liked to see lower prices.  Matter of fact, prices are the only reason I can think of that this place didn't get 5 stars from me."
4,"Best burger I've had in ages.  I took my husband back...he's not a burger person, but he really liked it too.  The burgers are thin and a bit crispy on the edges.  The fries were good, and the fry sauce was great. The turtleneck sundae was excellent. Now I'm having trouble NOT going there every day!"
4,"The patty melt and a chocolate malt. My favorite ""cheat day"" (or ""cheap day"") indulgence."
4,"As a fan of time travel, this place fits my needs perfectly. When you walk into this deli you are transported into a 30s? 50s? 60s? style deli with classic stools and counter top. Their signature sandwich is great for a snack and is perfect to satisfy the hunger of those who are not well read in historical interior decorations. 

Seating was limited but I got mine to go as there are plenty of outdoor seating in the neighborhood and I was here during a nice fall day and was not given any indication that the weather in Montreal will not always be pleasant, so I assume that this is year round.

 My only gripe is that this place was not fully embracing their historical decor and offering soda for nickel and candy for a copper... and giving 1 cent coins in change."
4,"Ordered pho, papaya salad, and fresh rolls.  The rolls are freshly made.  Pho is decent although they are skimpy on meat and noodles hence the $1 for extra noodles.  Salad looks beautiful and tasted fresh and delicious.

Service as noted in other reviews is indeed  curt, indifferent, and he don't really give a rats arse.  Someone should try to make funny faces at him and see if he cracks a smile.  I think a career change is in order for him."
4,"This place was packed on a cold Friday night in the dead of a Toronto winter when most  people would just rather find some place warm and quiet after a week of work and slogging it home every day in -18 c weather. So that's a good sign.

The concept is pretty simple. There's a bar side and a small theatrer side. You can congregate with your friends before the show in the bar and then bring your drinks and foods into the theater for the show. 

It's a mite confusing for the first time visitor and staff seems to assume you know the set up. 

Food and drinks, there's nothing too surprising save for Sapporo beer on tap (Go University of Sapporo Vikings! Victory over the Shimamatsu Red Skins forever! Boys, be ambitious!). 

Foodwise the menu offers a surprise: a Montreal-style steamie ($5 including slaw). I don't get out much but this is the first time I've ever seen that Montreal delicacy on a Toronto menu.

More about steamies here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_hot_dog

The theater seating is pretty minimal. Mostly low rent banquet style chairs and a few bar type tables. You probably want to finish your grub.

The entertainment appears to be mostly small improv acts cutting their teeth in the world of stage comedy. It's a mixed bag but always refreshing to see comedy not ready for the Comedy channel.

The crowd is young and are mostly there to laugh. It's a pretty supportive atmosphere over all for the young comedians."
4,"Anh Dao - my go-to for pho near campus. 

Given the huge selection of Viet restaurants around these parts, too many are surprisingly sub-par. I have always preferred Anh Dao over the others, but up until this year they lacked sizing options completely! One size does not fit all when it comes to food, never did and never will. In years past, it forced me over to Pho Hung where MSG overdose sometimes made me feel very jittery (I'm not usually sensitive to MSG, btw). But I digress, and it shall be made clear that sizes still do not exist. Rather, one can add $1 for extra noodles or $4 for extra meat. The former option is fine with me. 

The owners of this family business are very nice. The noodles are slightly chewy, and the meat as expected. The broth is flavourful and always boiling hot. Undercooked bean sprouts are my pet peeve, but that's never a problem at Anh Dao. The food is not exceptional, but beating out the competition is all it takes when I'm trapped in the vacuum of good food known as UofT St. George. Anh Dao manages this handily."
4,Over excellent value. Good fresh and hot food in good quantity. My only complaint is their noodles are too soft.
4,"Learned of this place off of Groupon. Pretty good deal. $20 for two general admissions with $20 worth of food. Got the chicken sandwich and perogies. The perogies were very delicious and filling as well. 

I watched Helder Brum and friends in the cabaret room. It was very tiny but the way it was set up was very intimate and it felt like you were a part of something fun, not just an audience member at a  show. There was only one booth at the very back with a table so we had to eat our food out of take out containers on our laps. That part could have been better but it wasn't a huge problem for us. 

Our favourite part was the lamb chops puppet show! Hilarious and very entertaining. The comedians that were featured that night (Dec 19) were all pretty funny. Got some good laughs out of us. The music performances were nice and soothing. I didn't quite get the humor in the storytelling portion. It was more awkward than funny for me but maybe that's what they were going for. 

Overall, I enjoyed it and would consider returning without the Groupon deal. Their food was very reasonably priced. Want to go back for the perogies :)"
4,"I come for the BeerProv.  Nothing fancy about this place, chairs aren't even that comfortable, space is kind of cramped but I like it.   Excellent crowd, great staff and decent enough beer to keep you happy.  If you like Improv  and some really funny Canadian content please support this space."
4,"Very nice and friendly local florist. Beautiful arrangements made as well.
I've been here several times and the prices are good, the service is excellent too.
I'd rather go to a local florist than deal with 800-flowers. That place sucks.
Owner is extremely friendly and helpful.
Tip I learned, keep your flowers in the fridge if you are at work all day. It will keep them longer!"
4,"This place is pretty good, but the burgers are kinda small. The meat is smashed and grilled to smitherines sometimes. Great fry sauce though and great seasoning for the fries."
4,"i absolutely love the burgers here. I have also tried their custard, and enjoyed it. The only minor complaint I have is that the tables inside tend to be dirty when I go in."
4,"These guys are great. A little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native East Coast (that have delis inside) . These guys have a taco stand inside that has some of the best mexican food around IMO. The ingredients they use are top notch. Very tasty, very clean. Diamond in the rough."
4,"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise! 
We had driven past it a couple of times and it had a rustic appeal so we decided to try it out. 
Upon first walking in it was very quaint but very cold in the dining room. If you are typically cold like myself, bring a sweater in if you don't plan on eating on the patio. There is a very nice patio area actually. 
They had a decent menu for drinks. They have a limited happy hour that we didn't take advantage of that time. 
We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we chose the meal where you get try all 4 meats and it was worth it. 
A large portion and you also get a side; more than enough to share!
The Mac and cheese was exceptional and so was the brisket! 
All in all, solid BBQ for a reasonable price."
4,"For a fast food joint, I don't really have much to complain about. The price is equal to the value of your meal, in my opinion. 

The patties are unique to other burger patties because they have this layer of what looks like a burnt top--hard to describe--but it creates a nice texture and the flavor is good for the most part. 

The only complaint I would have is that their foods are too salty."
4,"I grew up eating the Yoshinoya beef bowl and still enjoy eating it. My friends and I stopped by Yoshinoya to grab dinner before driving back home to LA. Maybe it's because I haven't had rice in a couple days, but the beef bowl was ON POINT!

My order:
- beef bowl
- clam chowder
- asian wings

BEEF BOWL: first time here? Then get the beef bowl! I absolutely love their beef bowl. Make sure to put some seasoning on it and ask for a lot of ginger packs! The ginger complements the bowl VERY well. I think I end up eating at least 5 packs of ginger for my bowl.

CLAM CHOWDER: You're probably thinking.. clam chowder?! That's not even something Asian! I thought the same and honestly still wonder why they have clam chowder at Yoshinoya. BUT! It's so good. It's always nice to have some kind of soup when eating rice and the clam chowder is surprisingly very satisfying. (My friends like to pour some of the soup onto their bowl. I haven't tried it yet but they do mention how amazing it is.)

ASIAN WINGS: It's a bit sweet for my taste.. I personally don't like it but I don't think there's anything terribly wrong with it."
4,"I was soooooooooooo drunk.  Cheapest thing I did in Vegas was buy a beef bowl.  

I don't care what anyone says. I used to hit up Yoshinoya's whenever I was in SoCal.... emerging from a smoke-filled car, and I'll continue to come here,  inebriated every time.

4 stars.... minus 1 star because I'm not an alcoholic or drug addict. This is definite tweaker food."
4,"I came here for a show while visiting Toronto for the first time and I really enjoyed it. The bar staff was really friendly and the drinks were much more reasonably priced than I expected. 

Like everyone else has said in their reviews, the actual stage space is pretty small. It's set up with two tables to a row, with three chairs at each and a narrow aisle in between. If you want to get a front row seat, definitely show up early. The show I saw was pretty packed and people were lining up 30 mins in advance, but since this was my first time here I'm not sure if that's the norm. 

The bar area is bigger and there are plenty of tables around the room. It's kind of split into two sections, with the bar somewhat in the middle. They had a TV (maybe two, I don't exactly remember) on one side with sports on. 

Overall I really enjoyed Comedy Bar and would definitely recommend stopping in for some good standup. One of the locals I chatted with said it's a pretty well known venue for comedy, so I'm sure you'll get a good show!"
4,"For years I have been going to the strip mall aka food court mall near the north west corner of Eglington and Dixie.  I've seen some businesses come and go through that time and because of that you get the new place every once in a while.  The Burger Factory has been here for a while now and although I hadn't been, I knew it was there.  The fact is this area of Dixie road between Eglinton and Matheson has MANY places to eat.  If I were a new business in this area with this much competition I'd probably be like, yikes!  Still it's a busy enough area to warrant the kind of dense concentration and saturation of restaurants I suppose.  

The Burger Factory is part of the north end of the strip mall, opposite the long time mainstays like Bamiyan Kabob and Chang & Huang's which are on the south side.  My family just had an early dinner and Chang's and my brother was telling me that the Burger Factory has funnel cakes and that we should go for it as a group dessert.  I was like OK, sure.  That sounds like a plan.

A short walk across the parking lot brought us into the Burger Factory which seemed to be somewhat busy with people eating their burgers and some waiting for their take out.  Waiting in line allowed me to have a look at their menu which basically look like a nice selection of burger choices some of which look to be larger such as doubles and even triples.  One notable thing is that this place is Halal much like many of the other establishments in the surrounding area.

We had just eaten but looking at their selection I'd come back for a burger.  My brother ate there before and said it was good.  I'd probably be interested in that Juicy Lucy which is a Minneapolis thing, basically a burger stuffed with cheese that melts inside... yum!  

Although we were just there for a funnel cake I didn't have to wait very long.  What an attractive serving.  With the strawberry topping and tax it came out to about 10 bucks.  Icing sugar, hot, crunchy, doughy and just plain good.  It was a perfect dessert to share after having a spicy and savory meal across the parking lot.

As for the burgers that'll have to be another visit but I'm already looking forward to it."
4,"Great place to really experience the history of Montreal, the history of Canada, and food that has been made the same for over 70 years. 

Special with Kraft was delicious. In front of me within 1 minute of my order. 
Not too salty and light on the mustard. I added more mustard and it hit the spot.

Chatted with the owner about the show being on The Mind of A Chef with David Chang. We talked about the history of the place and it was clear the amount of pride the family takes in running the shop. 

The big surprise for me was the original soda fountain they have. 
Best pineappple soda I ever had. Cherry looked amazing as well. 

A definite must-visit, if going to Montreal."
4,"#YELPGTA #YELPBURGER #YELPBURGERBINGE #JUICYLUCY

I've known this place to be around. Never thought I'd ever visit it because it isn't appealing on the outside - small and overcrowded, always. However, surprise surprise, this made it to the top of my to-try list for the Yelp Burger Binge week. And boy, am I glad! 

Burger Factory is a small joint as mentioned above, with little seating and I can't honestly say it's the cleanest. Avoid washrooms. The service is slow. I don't have anything positive to note about this place other than the Juicy Lucy burger. It was quite the burger! Some places advertise cheese stuffed patties but you never really see the cheese?! Juicy Lucy is quite different. One bite and there's cheese oozing out of the lovely tender patty. It's a wonderful sight, and you really taste it. My friend complained that halal is always a little dry - but the cheese really made a difference! 

Clearly, I am a fan. And I'll be back!"
4,"My girl was upset that I never give her flowers, (even though when we first met, she told me she didn't like flowers)  So I came here and was very impressed by their selection."
4,Came here to meet some business associates for happy hour.  We were seated promptly and waitress took our drink orders quickly.  It was taco Tuesday so I tried a couple of their tacos. The tacos were so good I ordered a couple of more. They had a lot of different kinds of tacos on the menu also.  They have a few local beers on tap.  Overall a good place.
4,"Fellow Yelper Tim K. told me about this amazing place called Wilensky's where you can get a super cheap sandwich. He talked it up so much, I have to say I was disappointed. But what the food lacked, the place made up for in charm. The place has been around forever and it seems like the staff has, too. We talked about all the cool stuff on their walls, like the low prices of housing in the 30's. My family is from Montreal, so I'm pretty sure my grandparents hung out here in their childhood, so it's pretty cool that it's still around."
4,"They really go the extra step to accommodate customers desires at The Dancing Dandelion Flower Shop.  I've picked up flowers here on numerous occasions and always had a great experience!  The staff is knowledgeable and genuinely helpful.  DDFS was easily able to accommodate special requests for me on a couple of instances. Even when they didn't have what I was looking for they willfully pointed me in a helpful direction.  

Customer service is top notch...as another example, for a nominal fee they will even clean-up and prepare potted plants purchased from Plant Nurseries, Home Depot, etc. making them gift ready.  Prices are slightly above average for flower shops, but spot on when you consider the quality product and service that accompanies your orders.  

They deserve a very strong 4 Stars in my book.  The shop is on the small side and their on-hand inventory is a little limited because of this, but if you can give them a couple of days the sky's the limit."
4,"I've been really addicted to Vietnamese foods lately so I decided to try out the small family run Vietnamese Restaurant ""Anh Dao"" on Spadina. I've heard around that this place was famous for it's Nem Nuong (BBQ Pork Sausages) so I decided to try it out. Turned out to be the best sensation my taste buds have ever experienced! This special dish that you can't find at most Vietnamese restaurants (because it's very time consuming to make) consisted of rice paper (you have to wet it in the warm water, to soften it up), which you use to wrap the BBQ Pork Sausages in along with vermicelli and choice of vegetables/herbs. After you complete your very own roll, you get to dip it in the tasty Vietnamese sauce, which makes it taste AMAZING! Vegetables and herbs came in a bunch with a lot of variety and it was soooo crisp and fresh! I also ordered the Grilled Shrimp on Sugar Cane which was also very tasty in the wrap and the Vietnamese pancake that turned out to be crunchier then I expected (thumbs up for that!). Really good hands on-food experience and will most definitely come back when I'm feeling creative and hungry!"
4,We tried this place on a recommendation from a friend in montreal. It is very old school. And it is very simple. Need to go there once. Soda and pickles was delicious. Sandwich was okay.
4,The burgers and fries are excellent for the price.  It takes a little while to get your burger if its busy.
4,Went there with the fam and we chose a lil bit of everything and We all thought the food was really good especially coming from a CA perspective.
4,"Great experience for an emergency surgery. Everyone was great including Surgeon, Hospitalist, Nurses,Aides,Volunteers. I hope to stay out of the hospital, but would not hesitate to return to Arrowhead Hospital."
4,"#YelpGTABBW #YelpBurgerBinge #BurgerBingeWeek

The place has been on my bookmarks for some time now... then came the Yelp Burger Binge Week with halal friendly options. So I thought what better week to try this place. 

So I made my way to the place... the restaurant itself is quite small and has very limited seating. The staff looked tired and a bit slow but it was all about the burgers. 

I went with the Juicy Lucy selling for $5 in the burger bing week but is actually $7. Well let me tell you that Lucy was very Juicy... The beef patty is of a nice size and is cooked well. Inside the middle of the patty there is cheese in the burger. The topping are great and plenty to choose from.

I also got the 5oz Hamburger. The burger is pretty much the same but doesn't have cheese in between. But I really enjoyed their Poutine as they gravy was very taste. 

Over all if you exclude the presentation of the burgers.... the patty itself is quite good and enjoyable. 

Will I go back... definitely, I still have to try their ""The Compressor""!


For my Muslim Folks - The serve halal meat as stated on their site ""ALL OUR MEAT & PRODUCTS ARE 100% HALAL"" plus halal signs in the store."
4,"- Ordered ""Juicy Lucy"" combo
- Took about 15 minutes
- Good portions. I was thoroughly full.
- Patty was not salted so better to put the sauces and topping to get some taste
- Cheese in the middle of patty a good touch
- If you are into burgers, this is a good place
- A little on the expensive side @ $11+ per combo"
4,"A coworker and I stopped in and had lunch around 12:30 a couple Thursdays ago. I had never been here before so I wasnt sure what to expect. We were greated by a cheerful and friendly young lady who helped me with the menu. We both ordered burgers and fries. Our food was ready quickly and was cooked as ordered and looked yummy. Freddy's food comes in a plastic basket and the atmosphere is kind of retro burger joint. Seating and tables were comfy. The place was busy, but not super packed. I wasn't sure about the extra skinny shoestring fries at first, but they're really good. My coworker had ranted about about Freddy's special sauce and it is good! I think you'll be happy you ate here! This is not just another fast food place! And when we visited a crew from the fire department and public works were there too! That to me is an extra star those guys know good food places! We're definitely going back for more!"
4,I love the sketch comedy nights! Food is not so great. Drinks are average prices. Good venue.
4,"Yoshinoya has a certain flavor that I cant seem to find in any other teriyaki place. I have tried pretty much everything on their menu and I gotta say, I it is all decent. The only thing negative that I can say is that their veggies are a bit starchy. Other than that, their own special blend of cayenne spices and pickled ginger gives your meal that extra flavor. 

This location is pretty spacious and they keep it pretty clean, including the bathroom.
This is the only Yoshinoya in Vegas compared to dozens in Southern Cali. There used to be another location but that was closed down due to I assume not enough business."
4,"Been here many many times for lunch with a large work group (8-12 people depending on the day). Food is almost always impeccable with some awesome values on the special menu. Service and correct orders vary based on the day, how busy it is, and who is serving. Today with Peggy is by far the best service we have ever had. She was quick, efficient, accurate and super friendly. We're hoping she's here every time we return. Thanks Peggy and thanks kitchen for a great meal."
4,"Great burger and even better seasoned fries and special dipping sauce for the fries.  The frozen custard is good and a must have if stopping in.  Personally I like the ""other"" chain's frozen custard better."
4,"Best Vietnamese restaurant for fresh rice paper wraps. You have a variety of meat choices with plenty of veggies to wrap with. Pretty much the only thing I eat there. There are two dipping sauces, both of which are delicious."
4,"I used to date a Vietnamese guy and he knew the best Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal and Toronto and Anh Dao is one of the better places in Toronto.  I do like Pho Hung across the street -- the place with the cow-head on the logo -- but you can't get the speciality do-it-yourself rolls that you can at Ahn Dao.  

You can get a plate of various grilled meats to roll in rice paper with various leafy vegetables and pickled assortments.  Do-it-yourself rolls are fun and makes you feel as though you've accomplished something when you've finished your meal.  They also have a wonderful sour soup; not for everyone but super tasty for those who like sour soup (me!).

You can get a decent sized meal for $10-$15.  Of course they also have the usual Pho (soup) and Bun (vermecelli) but if you find yourself seated in this tiny restaurant, opt for adventure and go for the do-it-yourself rolls!"
4,Love the poutine!!! I ordered.the juicy lucy and  make it as combo. You.must try the poutine. However the lucy was little bit dry.
4,"Been here a few times without much advanced planning. Easy for a fun (aka funny) night out without effort. They have several timeslots with different themes and styles and priced accordingly. Usually the comedians are good. I prefer standup over skits.

Drinks can be bought at their bar, self serve. Would be cool if they offered table service for food too. That would make them five stars in my books."
4,"I got the Fat Hefner sandwich, really good ! But I got wings to take home & they were to ""rubbery"" for my liking"
4,"First time going to the Comedy Bar to see the Notorious show and I must say that I was very impressed! Notorious is a hip hop improv comedy show and throughout the show, the comedians ( I believe they called themselves the MobiCocks? ... can't remember clearly) were so funny and creative."
4,always good to take a beef bowl home ....its aways good hot or cold not to mention the best hangover cure!
4,Juicy Meaty taste without the hangover. Caramalized onions are a must! Definately coming back.
4,"delicious for a quick burger joint! get the double though, as the parties are thin. awesome sized serving of fries. and the concretes can't be beat by any ice cream place around."
4,"Wow !! I was not expecting that !!! ... Most people think burgers and fries = fast food.. That was not the case here, true to their word burgers were fresh, juicy and tasty! The wait was well worth it. I had the cheesy Lucy with most toppings on it, with a side of onion rings, my boyfriend had the chicken fillet with most toppings and a side of fries. I do want to come back soon to try some of the other burgers as well funnel cake and when I do I let you guys know how that was."
4,"Holy crap.  Nicest Yoshi's that I've ever frequented.  

Modern decor and easily accessible from Maryland Parkway.  Right across the street from UNLV --- lucky bastards.  

Atmosphere was great, but the Bowl itself was OK.  Rice was a bit dry --- not as moist as other Yoshi's.  But I'll take it.  Cheap, sweet beef.  I can't complain.  

Showed up on a Thursday at 11:30 a.m.  Not crowded at all."
4,"YES? it was a great place. YES, it is closed. I saw some one asked why. I got the chance talked with owner when they moved out. The owner said that few people like this place, it is not making any money , so he decided to close it."
4,"I love how there's only one yoshinoya in Vegas because I get to appreciate it so much more when I finally get to have it! It's always been on point here as far as service and quality goes. I've never had to wait that long for my food or to order and they always have all the condiments as far as the peppers, soy sauce and ginger filled. Their rice is cooked just right every time and their veggies always look and smell so good. I normally order the combo bowl and both the beef and the chicken is cooked just right and tastes so comforting! I also love how they have the peach iced tea in their fountain and I'm not much of a sweet tooth but their flan is a must! :)"
4,"Envie de voir des stand up à Toronto? Le comedy bar est l'une des institutions où de nombreux comiques viennent faire leurs armes. Vous pouvez soit vous rendre au shows gratuits ayant lieu une fois par semaine ou bien il y a les shows réguliers payants.
Possibilité de se poser au bar en attendant le spectacle.

Craving for stand up sessions in Toronto? The Comedy bar is one of the must go places where many comedians come. You can either go to the free shows which happen once a week or the regular shows which will cost you around 10$.
Possibility to enjoy a nice drink at the bar while waiting for the next show."
4,"After just returning from three months living in Japan I was missing my weekly Yoshinoya trips. Driving down Maryland Parkway the other day I almost caused a collision when I saw a Yoshinoya.

Now, obviously, compared to the Yoshinoyas I visited in Japan this is not the same thing. The busy, fast-paced lunch counter atmosphere in Japan is replaced by a bit of an empty, American fast food environment. This is disappointing (though expected) because sitting elbow-to-elbow with some stranger while you both slurp up shaved beef is half the fun of Yoshinoya. Anyhow, the only thing on the menu that looked vaguely similar to the Japanese version was the gyudon (beef bowl) which was exactly what I was after. Sadly this Yoshinoya doesnt offer any of the Japanese-style add-ons like raw egg, BUT there was a large tub of shredded ginger.

So after ordering a large beef bowl, with nothing else (no veggies, no sides, just the beef) I closed my eyes and indulged. I have to say... If I didnt hear the obnoxious UNLV kids next to me talking about Jay-Z I would have easily convinced myself I was back in Japan. The taste is very close and really good. This will definitely satisfy my gyudon cravings. I would just stick to the original, beef-only bowl and you are set. So excited to see this here!"
4,"The burger is pretty yummy, fries not so much unless you get the tornado fries which is a better choice. If you plan on going there make sure you take out as it isn't really a dine-in place. Juicy burgers, there is one with cheese inside the patty.. the idea seems cool but I rather have the cheese on top of my patty so I can taste it. The customer service was reaalllyy good!

Finally happy to find a good burger joint (bonus it is halal!)"
4,"Love the beef bowl they serve.  Been hooked since I was a kid and trying it at one of their many locations in SoCal.

This location looks like it is a bit worn down, but the food is still good.  I only wished they have a location on the West side of the I-15, so I don't have to drive 20-30 minutes to satisfied my gyudon fixing. But hey, it is better than driving 2-3 hours to California for one :)

Decor:  2/5  Looking old and tired.

Food:  4/5 for the beef bowl/gyudon, it is better than the microwaved?! gyudon that I was served at Shuseki.  Not a fan of their chicken bowl.  Skip the combo, I don't like their veggies. 

Price Value:  3/5  It is what it is.

Location:  Only on the East side of Vegas.  Great for UNLV students, not so good for me.

I still love Yoshinoya, so 4 stars."
4,"Great burgers (better than hero burgers). Small sit in area, great poutine too."
4,"Fast, cheap, yet really delicious at its price. Nothing really to complain as this is a place you want a quick cheap bite. As for the service, I feel the owner(or just the chef?) are pretty chill with what they are doing, not super hospitality but it was not rude at all. So if you are expecting super attentive service here, you won't get any of that. But if you would prefer no one bothers you while you are eating, then yeah..

Cash only, which can be a bummer sometimes......"
4,"11:00pm is a bit late late for a 12-year old boy to be working as a server. But then again, the service he provided was better than that of someone with 12 years of experience. Plus, I've been very wrong at guessing ages.

Broth here is absolutely, superbly delicious."
4,"I've had many many many good experiences here... The only reason they got 4 stars is they have messed my order up several times but always very quick to fix! ( I get the patty melt which is sour dough and Swiss but I switch to Texas toast and provolone as Swiss doesn't sit right with me) other than that always nice staff and always fast service (does slow it down when they make it wrong but it's well worth the wait) I would get a concrete every visit if the small wasn't so expensive .. So sadly I do not get it often! 

In any case love this place!!!!"
4,"The best Nam Nuong (Vietnamese pork sausage) downtown hands down. 
 
If you come here for any else, you might not be impressed. Actually, I'm just gonna say it, don't come here for anything else people.  Just come here for the Nam Nuong and you won't be disappointed. I always get the Nam Nuong dish that comes with the rice paper, veggies so you can roll it yourself. You can customize your roll just the way you like it. I always load up on the veggies and less of the vermicelli noodles.  It's kinda fun to see who can roll the best. The taste of the Nam Nuong is always consistent, juicy, tender with just the right amount of spices. This is my go to place whenever I crave for Nam Nuong. 

They are closed on Wednesday!"
4,"This place has great burgers, a friendly staff, and gluten-free buns. Can't lose. Try the Canada Eh.

Note that the fries are not gluten-free. They also didn't know the manufacturer of the gluten-free buns, nor whether the buns contained milk products. They thought Udi's, but they didn't look or taste like Udi's to me (they were soft and delicious, nevertheless)."
4,Excellent and freshly grilled burgers. Better than hero burger for sure. Not to great.  Seating area very casual.
4,"First time trying g this place, ordered on the Ritual app. When I got there with a friend, food was ready and hot. Ordered the Burgerrito and a large poutine. 

Burger was amazing. Cooked well, beef was delicious, went nicely with the condiments and vegetables/avacado. Added a tomato on it. 

Poutine was average, a bit small for a large. Friend had the Canada burger, said it was good. 

Overall, good atmosphere, good service, really good burgers, but pricey."
4,"This place was pretty good. We ordered the mama bear which had 1/2 lb of each meat - ribs, pork and brisket. Then we ordered the jalapeño cheddar sausage el jefe style. That just came with guac, jalapeños and a couple tortillas. I liked all the meats except I did not care for the sausage. I did however loved the tortilla that came with it and I wanted more. 

We were going to get the papa bear originally but then noticed that the price was more expensive than ordering the maps bear and the jalapeño sausage separate plus you got to choose a different style and got the awesome tortillas! 

There was an issue with the price when we got the check and the waiter corrected the issue. I guess they changed their menu and forgot to change the price of the sausage in the computer as well."
4,"We like coming here in the fall/winter time for something warm and hearty. We will usually order the rare beef pho with beef balls, well-done beef brisket and tripe. They have a lot of other authentic Vietnamese dishes and some that have a modern twist as well, so there's good variety here. 

Prices are good with respect to the portions and quality of the dishes. 

We were never disappointed with the quality of food, everything tasted really flavourful, broth is great and they are generous with the other ingredients as well such as the mint and bean sprouts. Sometimes we even share one bowl because it is quite a large portion. 

Atmosphere is very cosy, intimate and comfortable. It's a family owned business so it feels homey. It is a small restaurant as well; very quiet. Nothing much going on with decor but really the food speaks for itself. 

Service is quite slow which is why I give it 4 stars. Not only that but the waiters don't really come around that much to refill water or anything, we usually have to raise our hand to ask. To pay we also had to walk up to the counter ourselves and tell them we were ready to get our bills and pay. Still, I think they are understaffed which is probably why service is slower than normal. 

Definitely recommend!"
4,"Some friends really wanted to go to a comedy bar, so I got to searching around, looking up different places, reading the reviews, and ultimately chose this place. The drinks are cheap, the food seemed like a decent price, though I didn't order anything so I can't speak for the quality, and I would say it was a successful night. None of us had every been to an improv show (only stand up comedy), and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it was definitely an enjoyable night.  I wasn't in stitches the whole time, but I *was* wiping tears of laughter from my face more than once over the course of the 2 hours. At $10 a ticket, it's totally reasonable."
4,"I'm originally from California. So to find a yoshinoya near unlv is amazing. The first time I came here, yes it was very outdated. I came here for lunch today and it has been completely remodeled. Very modern and clean. $7 for a beef, chicken, and vegetable bowl is a steal. Idk why yelp says it closed on days it's not. So call ahead"
4,"Have had a couple of instances where we needed to be here... things have always turned out ok for the random ER visit. I had an emergency gallbladder surgery here too. 
 
For the visit that started with acute pancreatitis and turned into gallbladder removal surgery, the nurses were sweet. I was breastfeeding at the time and they provided a pump for me and a private room. Couldn't have asked for more."
4,"We had a fantastic time here. I liked the setup... it looks like a normal bar, then you go through some doors and BAM. Comedy club. 

The atmosphere is relaxed, the service friendly and the drinks prices on par with any other place (nice to not get hosed at a performance venue)

We saw a Friday night improv show ($10 at the door - cheaper than a movie!) which was a ton of fun, despite the fact that I'm really not a huge fan of improv. Seating was comfortable enough and the audience section was dark, which I appreciate, since I get self conscious about not laughing enough, or laughing too much. 

We'll definitely be back. This is a great place to check out during the terrible winter months of Toronto."
4,"Pretty great food but a little pricy for what it is. We got a couple of menu items and wound up spending almost 30$. That being said the burgers fries and concretes are all great. The staff is REALLY friendly. On a slow day the cashier chatted with us until our meal came out and double checked to make sure our order was exactly how we wanted. 

Now to the important thing: the food. Smashed steak burgers that are reminiscent of cheese steak sandwiches. The paties are thin which means that every bite is browned and yummy. The fries are just regular fries but they are great holders for the Freddy's fry sauce which is addicting."
4,"Wilensky's is definitely worth visiting for the nostalgic factor. Opens since 1932 and still family own and run by the Wilensky's!

And of course we need to order their famous SPECIAL ($3.90)! which is a grilled beef salami and beef bologna sandwich with mustard on a kaiser roll, pressed flat from the grill!

As the sign in the restaurant announces:

""When ordering a Special,
you should know a thing or two.
It is always served with mustard;
it is never cut in two.
Don't ask us why; just understand
that this is nothing new.
This is the way that it's been done
since 1932.""

So we ended up having our own SPECIAL since it is the way it has to be and luckily I love mustard!!

The Special is great for a snack and it is so hot!! So be careful when you bite into it!

The made to order fountain drinks with quite a few different flavours: even a chocolate one!! definitely worth ordering and believe me would go well with your sandwich!

No tips necessary but if you do, it will be put into donation box for the Heart and Stroke Foundation! So do leave whatever change you want to on the counter!

."
4,"Oh I used to go to this place in my early 20's and it was amazing! I'm vietnamese and for years didn't like vietnamese cuisine that much because I was really into italian food and also growing up eating westernized cuisine made me shy away from anything asian but this place changes anyone's mind, it is so good, try the rolls that you wrap yourself and you will in heaven : )"
4,"Have heard from several people that this place was the go to for some good, quick street tacos and the burritos were huge. Ordered a burrito to share and a few tacos. We did steak, but the meat was cold and not cooked fully, it was nice to add on all the fresh toppings!!! We also ordered a burrito, that burrito was pippin hot to the touch and was delicious. I will be back I got a brownie, realized when I got home it was expired. A little disappointed by that but even with that I will be back!!!"
4,This place was very good!  It reminded me of steak and shakes which I frequented while I lived in Texas!  Their burgers were good and I loved the turtle frozen custard! I will definitely go back again!
4,Good authentic burgers in an area filled with chains. Pretty juicy burgers if you get their special juicy Lucy patties. They're thick patties with the right amount of doneness. They also have great toppings like sriracha and grilled onions and their special sauce.
4,I've been coming here since I was a little girl... Mainly for pork sausage rolls. It's super delish here! Im assuming they recently renovated their restaurant because it looks quite different than from the last time I came which was a little while ago. I highly recommend this place if you wanna try some special rolls :) there are other meats but i forget what they're called
4,"The ER was great I was seen within 10 minutes. Everyone was very nice and professional and knowledgeable.  Dr. Kang was in the ER and very thorough with with asking me about my health and concerns.  Then explained that after the test and MRI cane back I needed to be admitted fir a few days.  I have never been admitted to this hospital before. But I do not think I will ever come back again to be admitted.  They did not have me down for any meals. The nurse was very snappy. But some of the others were nice. 

UPDATE: Chief Nurse Robin read my review and came into my room to discuss it with me. First I want to say it is so nice to see that companies really read what people write and take time to talk to them. Robin sat and listened to my concerns and reassured me that this was not typical nor acceptable of the hospital. Robin is a patient advocate and represents herself as a kind and caring person.  Thank you for your immediate response."
4,"Really yummy burger joint. Definitely order ahead as there is a major wait time for any type of order. Did the cheese stuffed burger (cheesy Lucy) and it tasted amazing! Fries were excellent also! No complaints with the food, just make sure you order ahead to ensure you're not waiting 20 or more minutes for food."
4,"Small venue, only been once. Russell Howard was brilliant, opening comedians were OK. The queue was unexpectedly long and there's not much room inside when waiting. The seats aren't great for watching a show.

Besides the queue and the seats, we had good time and it is a nice little comedy bar."
4,I came here because there is a meat grinder right by the window and it caught my eye and appetite!  They have many trendy options for burgers.  I ordered the regular burger which they make on a flat top.  The burger was well prepared with care.  It tasted great and it was well seasoned.  I'd recommend getting a bigger burger option than the regular since it is small.  The prices are average for a freshly made ground beef burger.
4,"we decided to try something different, and it was great. What a different thing to do for date night. They were very XXX rated, but super funny."
4,"Japanese Ad featuring Matsui (baseball player) 

http://youtube.com/watch?v=hIaBeQcZdCM


OK Y'all, so I'm not sure why the ratings for this place are so low. 

This is certainly not 100% equivalent to the ones in Japan, but I keep myself from reviewing sushi places in SF by comparing them to ones in Japan. 

So.... 
A lovely warm beef bowl (regular size) sets you back less then $5 here. That, plus a soda, and you're set for a meal and half, if not more. 

Side order options (not very OG): 
Macaroni Salad (odd, not an option in japan) 
Cheesecake 
Caramel Flan
Chocolate Cake

From an excerpt from the Japan Times: 
""It was delicious,"" said Tadashi Ishigami, 23, one of the first to mark the return of the dish, downing a bowl at an outlet in Tokyo's Yurakucho district. ""I don't care (about the safety of the beef) as long as I can eat it.""

You see, there was a momentary ban on US Beef (insert joke here) to Japan back in 2006, and GyuDon returned to its glory days in Fall of 2006. 

But I digress. 
Sure, they should add curry rice. Sure, they should be open 24 hours and have these orange 'noren'/curtains that welcome you thru the doors. But they don't, and that's okay. 

Gyu-don of my childhood, available in Rasu Begasu. 
But not in SF. (-_-) 

Oh, and yes, the dorktastic part of me spent about 10-15 minutes looking at the black and white photos of yoshinoya shops in the early 1900s. 

Whenever I drive past one of these.. the old commercial runs thru my head.. 

Nice to Know Ya, Yoshinoya!

I think there's one in San Jose... road trip?

4,"I will go ahead and declare that this is my favourite and probably the best bun thit nuong I will eat in Toronto. At this point I have lost track of how many times I've ordered this dish here (I even joke that this is one of the pillars of my friendship with one of my best friends who also feels the same way as I do about Anh Dao and their bun). 

Despite the ridiculously long itemized menu they have here, it is the only thing I ever order (and is probably the only thing I ever WILL order, it's 123 or 124 on the menu- the only difference being with or without imperial roll). It is cheap, satisfying (it could be two meals); they do a good balance of the herbs and the nuoc cham sauce is done well.

I like that this place has been around forever and has probably changed very little since the 70s (though they actually did recently re-do their menus). I hope they never raise the price or change the way they make this perfect bun! My aunt used to go here as a teen and the owner still recognizes her. Maybe one day the owner's son or even his kids will recognize me as well and refer to me as ""white bun-lovin' lady"" or something similar."
4,"Very good barbeque.  We had two combo plates - brisket, pulled pork, sausage.   Definatly satisfied the BBQ craving."
4,"Huge burrito, only $6, they make it the way you want it.  Rice, beans, salsa, cilantro, onion, cheese, lettuce, etc, you can have it all if you choose.  This could be your favorite burrito and it would be mine if not for the carne asada.  Now I'm not from SoCal so I might not know what's good (apparently if I was from there I would definitely know and be sure to let you hear about it) but that's not the carne asada I'm used to - it's unlike steak and it's incredibly salty.  Still though, it was a really good burrito (again, not from SoCal so take that with a grain or two) but wonder what could've been with better carne."
4,"Very good food. Reasonable prices as well, you get a lot for so little. This place is a hidden gem. It is so good! I'm always impressed every time I go there. The food is cooked and served fresh. Everything is made to order. I love it here."
4,"For only $4.99, you can get a 100% fresh beef burger that is hormone free, antibiotic free ! A price for such quality meat is rare. The service was great and so was the food. Let's support a business that actually is there making good quality food for accessible prices!"
4,"MEMORIES!! 

OK so this place is just like an ASIAN style fast food joint! I FREAKEN LOVE yoshinoya! It brings back memories of all my childhood times & they only have this one location in Vegas! 

The staff are quick & just do their job. You order your food & then you pick up your food at the counter. 

LARGE BEEF BOWL $7.89 - This is only like 50 cents more than the regular size.. so OBVIOUSLY being the fatty I am I get the LARGE one... white rice topped w/ thinly marinated beef brisket slices & onions. If I want a quick simple simple meal this is what I crave. Plus I add some green onions & it just tastes that much better. 

CHEESECAKE $2.29 - I LOVE their cheesecake for some reason... it is so smooth in texture & just melts in your mouth. Ahahhaha 

This place may be strictly a childhood memory favorite but I hope they never change & never go out of business because if I become a mom & don't wanna cook & just grab a simple meal that I KNOW my child will eat... this will probably be my go to over McDonald's or any other fast food joint."
4,"I thought that this place was pretty good. The store was very clean and the staff was extremely nice and helpful. Everything came out really fast as well. I really liked the milkshake, you could make it however you wanted which was nice. The fries were also good. The burger was good, I didn't really care for how thin the patties were. It was good once but I don't think I'll come here again, stick with smashburger or in and out."
4,Great burgers. Not the normal fast food burger. The fries are small cut and sometimes are over done.
4,"After being thoroughly disappointed by Cox for 3 months now, we decided to take the risk and switch to Century Link.  The install went smoothly - the technician was helpful and nice.  He tacked down all the wiring that the Cox guys just left loose.  He did leave our phones unhooked so I had to connect them after he left, which was a little bit of a nuisance.  

So far we're enjoying the Century Link service.  Phone: no issues.  Television: I like the guide and some of the options so much more than Cox.  It's a little annoying that the main box doesn't have the time on it.  I took that for granted with all the cable companies in the past.  Internet: good speed for surfing, etc and have not had any disruptions yet.  But I've noticed it's a little slow if I'm trying to watch a clip or video on youtube or something (and I opted for the fastest internet they offered).  That's been a little frustrating but I don't watch things often enough where it's really affected me yet.  

I have yet to receive the bonus incentive, which isn't slated to get here for a few months.  Also, the salesperson at CenturyLink, who was very nice, offered to credit us the amount of the installation, which I won't see until we get our first bill.  So I'll update my review at that time and I'm sure I'll have some more real experience with Century Link then.  But so far, so good."
4,"Good burgers here. Not much filler added - which is a bonus for me. Really good beefy flavor. Their house sauce tastes almost like Mac sauce? Not as sour. 

Fries are really, really good and cooked fresh. Hidden in what seems like a sketched out plaza but when you drive in, there is an abundance of other restaurants there so you feel a bit safer. Definitely would recommend but I mean its not like Burgers Priest or Holy Chuck but it still holds up on its own if you are in the area. It's just a really tasty and reasonably priced straight up classic burger; I prefer normal simple well-made burgers anyway. Contemporary  burgers with truffles, diamonds and pearls and all of that jazz just isn't what a burger is suppose to be. I think bold and unique flavors isn't necessarily a bad thing and I wouldn't mind spending over $100 on a burger *cough chokes BYMARK, but that type of spending should be a rarity.  But this place is reasonable for day to day beef cravings."
4,"I only come here for the daily specials since I think their regular burgers are a little overpriced. That said, the daily specials are an EXCELLENT deal for what you get. I've made it a life goal to hit every single one at least once. Current favorites are the Burgerrito and Fish Burger. Wait times can be a little long, even during non-rush hours, but if you're not in a rush, definitely worth the wait."
4,"I used to live right behind this restaurant so I frequented it pretty often. Teriyaki chicken and beef bowls always hit the spot! Fast, friendly service in a nice modern atmosphere. Pretty cheap too."
4,"Very tasty pho, broth was flavorful with very generous amount of meat. Quick service."
4,"I gave their new grilled fish plate a try. It was a good-sized piece of fish, properly cooked. For the side I had vegetables, which are their regular vegetables simmered in chicken broth.

A decent amount of food, a good price, and much better than Long John's try at grilled fish."
4,"I really wish this place was here when I was in UNLV.  This would have been a great compliment to the Aloha Kitchen right across the street from it.  I had never had Yoshinoya before but someone at work told me they were big in Cali, it's kind of like Japanese home cooking.

I got around to finally visiting one night.  Wow, not bad at all!  I know, for the low prices you shouldn't expect 5 star gourmet cuisine but for what it was it wasn't bad at all.  It really got me wishin' this place was here when I was in college.  Imagine all the drunken nights, then getting a nice bowl to satisfy the munchies?  It would have been great I think.

This place isn't the cleanest of places (check the bathroom) but at least the dining room is clean right before a late night food rush.  You see where I'm getting?  This place is popular with the college folk!  In case you didn't know, Yoshinoya serves Japanese food bowls, almost like ramen but instead with rice and meat.  Their claim to fame is the 'Yoshinoya Beef Bowl'.  But they've added chicken since opening its doors back in California.

I LOVE the chicken and beef combo bowl (around $7).  It's got steamed rice on the bottom and is topped with their teriyaki chicken, fatty sliced beef (so yum! It's like the beef in sukiyaki), and a veggie mix (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage).  Their sauce makes it soooo good!  This hits the spot when you need a quick meal.  I almost forgot, you get a drink with the combo, and a side dish as well!  You can choose from a green salad, macaroni salad, soup, caramel flan, cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake or cookies.  So many choices!  I usually end up getting the green salad because on the desserts they actually include the nutritional info, leaving me feeling a little guilty.  If you eat in, on your table you have the choice of soy sauce, seasoning, and pickled ginger.  All you can eat pickled ginger!  I love the stuff and I eat a buttload of it with my meal every time.  It goes well with the sweet sauce of the dishes.  Prices for everything else are very reasonable and the food is filling.  I can get away with spending less than $20 for my gf and I, and we get entree, drink and side of salad or dessert.  

The customer service was friendly, even when they were busy with lots of college students.  Umm...half drunk college students...*tear* oh the memories!  They were completing orders quickly because it wasn't too hard to assemble one of their bowls or combos.  My only gripe here is that they serve Pepsi instead of COKE, ugh.  Boo.  I can't stand Pepsi.  I was born in Georgia....go Coke!  Coke is it!

And if you're a college student at UNLV, lucky you.  Yoshinoya has a special college meal, I think it's a beef bowl and a drink...all for $2.99!  But you gotta show your UNLV ID to get it.  No wonder the place was full of students that night.  Sure beats having to go to the DC (Dining Commons to you UNLV folk, Deadly Cuisine to my old college pal...ha ha) and figuring out what you're eating.  

Oh yeah, one last tip.  DO NOT save this stuff for leftovers the next day...it can be NASTY!  I think it could be the soggy rice.  It just doesn't taste right unless you eat it the same day you buy it.  Or maybe I added WAY too much ginger?  Anyway, just make sure you eat it all or throw away what you got left.  

But try this place if you're near UNLV and in a pinch for something to eat.  If you're not in the In-N-Out mood, give Yoshinoya a shot.  It's good, filling food.  Just don't blame me for a sore tummy if you eat your leftovers the next day!"
4,"Well I just started using CenturyLink's 10meg Internet and so far so good. It was super easy to get signed (almost too easy). I called and told the lady what I wanted and she asked a couple of questions and said she'd call me in 30 mins which she did (her names Ivy, she's super nice!). So she called and we set up a date for it to be turned on, I picked up my equipment which saves you install money and I was in and out before you knew it.
Now getting the modem set up was a lil tricky even for someone like me who's pretty tech savvy. We had to end up hard resetting the modem and eventually the router but in the end everything seems peachy. Even thinking about getting the Prism TV. I'll keep you updated!!!"
4,"Very nice burgers.  They aren't crazy greasy and it was juicy and everything you imagine a good burger to be. I had the burgerziki. All the flavours went perfectly together. It was also the buy on get one free special. My only complaints are that the burger was smaller than I expected. They pictures make them look so much bigger than they really are. I don't think the burgers are worth their full price because for the size (I'm strictly taking about the specialty burgers). However, the small fries make up for the lack of size in the burger. They were so big and equally good. I liked that it has little salt. They were quite thin, like McDonald's fries but much crispier and better. Also, bun was still slightly cold to the touch. They really should toast them. Will come again to try the rest of the menu."
4,"Came for the funny, it delivered!

Comedy Bar is a 2 room comedy club that usually offers a few different shows each night.
The one thing that makes this place a bit of a wild card is that there is little consistency in knowing what to expect. Whereas a lot of comedy clubs have an early show and late show the same night with the same comedians, Comedy Bar has 7pm, 9pm, and 11pm show start times but each show will be completely different acts.

The main room recently added tables to every other row, so you don't actually have to hold your drink the whole time anymore. The bar menu is decent with a few draught and tall boy craft beer options to choose from. 

It's good having a decent spot in the west end for some laughs, so this place gets 4 stars!"
4,"So decided to take the whole family out for a Saturday BBQ lunch at some place we have not been.  Showed up at noon just after they opened and we were the frist ones there. Greeted right away with a very friendly server that help out with are 2 little ones under 2.  The menu looked very good i wanted to try one of everything but obviously that would mot work.  So we decided on the bbq brisket poutine, my wife got the special which was a 20oz beef rib with a side (choose the brussel sprouts), i got the pick 4 meat plate with mixed brisket (burnt ends and sliced) pulled pork, smoked sausage and spare ribs with a side of mac and cheese.  The poutine was first it was a huge portion plenty for 3 maybe 4 people, it had a very nice gravy, fries were great and the house pickles i could eat a jar or 2 of them.  My only complaints with it was it was a touch on the salty side and there was almost a half inch of cheese on top that had to be cut with a knife (more is not always better) it took away from the other flavors of the poutine.  Mains came out shortly after my meat plate had a very generous portion of all the meats i ordered, mac looked very good and it also came with more house pickles :)  pickled red onions and sweet pickled jalapeno oh a roll and slaw.  All the meats had good flavor but again a touch to salty, my favorite was the sliced brisket least favorite was the smoked sausage.  The sausage was dry and was not spicy and least seasoned. Burnt end were second least favorite very salty not much fat and they were mostly jerky from over cooking.  Pulled pork was third and had a very nicely balanced flavor and was nice and juicey. Went very well with there regular bbq sauce which is vinager based :) my favorite was the sliced brisket which is the first time in a very long time i had good sliced brisket at a bbq place in ohio.  Nice smoke ring and flavor also very moist and had just the right amout of resistance on the pull test :).  Oh and i cant for get my wifes beef rib which was by far the best of all flavor was amazing and it melted in my mouth. As far as the sides go the sprouts were delicious well seasoned and perfectly cooked tender center with a slight crispy exterior.  My mac and cheese was very good after i removed the excessive amount of cheese at least a 1/4"" or more, once threw that there was this warm creamy gooey perfectly cooked mac that was to die for. (Again more is not better it would be perfect with a very light sprinkle for the golden crust)  anyway over all it was a good experience service was a 5 food was a 3.5 leaning towards 4, some restraint with salt and cheese and what i had today would be 5 star BBQ!!"
4,Overall good value for the food. Ordered Nem Nuong and it was good. It was very busy when I went but the service was quick. Usually more than enough for 1 person.
4,"The food was good, so was the custard but I'll will probably never go back due to the price. I got a number 1, a kids hamburger which is 5.95, kids grilled cheese 3.99, 2 mini custard with m&ms and a medium custard with snickers that was just thrown on in a big clump. Total 28.99"
4,"Our first trip after seeing them on Fox 8 in the Morning.  The space is on the smallish side, but nicely appointed.  Service was prompt and pleasant.  We built a meal out of a few apps and a salad.....all were pleasing, with special praise for the Brisket ""Poutine""...a big plate of hand-cut fries smothered in beef brisket, melted cheese and pickles.  The cornbread was delicious, as well.  Plump smoked wings and a chopped salad rounded it out, and we were satisfactorily stuffed at meal's end.  Nice selection of beer, wine, and spirits, too.  The overall experience was par for a Quagliata restaurant, and we will return."
4,"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  The beef is growth hormone/anti biotic free, from paradise farms in Ontario.  It's AAA black angus, some of the best quality meat you can get and  the quality is apparent when you take a bite.  The owner showed me his cheese, it's also expensive.  I can tell you hes not making much money at $4.99 a burger. For those who complain about the price, go to McDonalds and eat GMO.  You get what you pay for.  This burger should really sell for closer to $8.

The fries were delicious, fresh cut and properly blanched.  

The owner is just getting started so there are a few things he will need to fix along the way like putting a timer on the fries to make sure they are always piping hot.

He is experimenting with recipes and he fried me up an eggplant , cheese and mushroom patty to try. Yum!

Try the home made Jackson sauce.

I will be going back here instead of 5 guys."
4,"Great old time place with only a few stools. Make sure to try some of their home-made sodas...fantastic and you can mix flavours!

Also, this place discourages tipping."
4,"Really like this place! The cheese burgers are tasty, custard (concrete's) are awesome and their french fries w/fry sauce **yes i said fry sauce** are DELICIOUS! 

Food - 4 stars
Service - 5 stars
Desserts - 4 stars

If you are in the area and are looking for a quick yummy burger than go no further. 

(Tis the season for Pumpkin Pie......Freddy's has an out of this world Pumpkin Pie Concrete that i would highly recommend.)"
4,"Brought in a family member to ER, nurses were nice.  Especially Nurse Shelly....Transferred to 2nd floor North Tower and Dr.'s, nurses, aides (Marina) and staff were also great with her. Great people, great hospital..."
4,"The BBQ Pork Bún at Anh Dao ($5.75) consists of a huge bowl of vermicelli noodles topped with a heap of BBQ pork as well as fresh cucumber and lettuce. I love the contrast in taste and texture between the fresh vegetables, vermicelli, and pork. Delicious and an amazing deal.

Bonus points for clearly indicating on the menu which spring rolls are fried and which are fresh. I went for the fresh shrimp and pork spring rolls ($3.75 for 2). Again both delicious and huge; these suckers are at least 8 inches long (feel free to insert a crude joke here if you wish). The sauce the rolls came with was also tasty and even had a little extra protein** thrown in for good measure.

One of my new favourite spots in Chinatown.

**A rather large fly had apparently drowned in my spring roll sauce. I wasn't sure if this was unintentional or was some sort of bonus for particularly good customers. Perhaps I'd get good luck if I ate it. Or, at the very least, it would provide some extra protein. In the end I decided it was best to put the fly aside and return to the main meal. In any case, a bug or two in my food never bothers me."
4,"Been there more than a few times, but never ordered food.....until now. I stopped in late about 9pm after class one day and ordered a carne asada burrito and drinky-drank to sip on. I saw no other customers, so I wasn't sure if they were still serving food, but one of the guys there said he'll be right with me. I ordered my food and after he was finished cooking the meat, he let me pick and choose what I wanted inside my burrito too. 

Well good thing I got there when I did, because when I was finished paying the line was already 7 people deep and bustling with customers. 

Service: The cook, cashier and a random worker were all friendly and didn't get creepy vibe at all.. haha

Food: I wish I took a picture before I started but it was huge! I ate half and saved the rest for lunch the next day. 

This place is good any time of day and not just for those late night after partying food cravings...well maybe that too:)"
4,"Nothing fancy, but fricken amazing!

They may have other items, but for years -- it's all about the Wilensky's fried bologna sandwich.  Mustard, cheese, on crappy white bread and then pressed together kinda of like a panini.  OMG - so dang good!!!

Make sure to order 2 of them...you'll want one for dessert after you've inhaled the first one.  

I don't know how or why they are so good...I've tried to make them, and it is just missing that certain jenesequa.

When I am in Montreal to see my family, I have a short-list of must haves when I am in town -- and this is one critical stop!"
4,"First time for us here and it was fantastic.  Service was fast, food was hot and beverages were refilled promptly. We got the ""pick 2"" meats and we chose pulled pork and brisket. You get a choice of slices of brisket, chopped or burnt ends.  The briskets was very tasty and tender.  The pulled pork was sweet but also mildly spicy.  Very delicious.  The house cut fries are to die for.  You also get a small dish of slaw and a soft sweet dinner roll.  I highly recommend this place and am looking forward to ribs next time.  We were there on a Friday night and we did not even have to wait for a table.  Make the drive and try them out!!"
4,"Before the Toronto Burger Wars started, this place was the only good spot in the neighbourhood to get a fresh ground beef burger.

The burgers are good and the price is reasonable. My only negative is that I think there are just too many toppings/options, which can take away from a quality burger."
4,The food is great for fast food. The beef bowl is great and comes with veggies. It would stick to their beef bowl as their chicken wasn't spectacular.
4,"Great night out. Cheap and great stand up. Get here early as the shows tend to sell out on a sat night!

My buddy Jonathan Schabl.. You were brilliant!!"
4,"i have been craving this place for years since moving from california to georgia.  now i am back on the westcoast i found the one and only yoshinoya in las vegas.

let me start off by saying the prices are extremely high compared to california prices.  you may as well go to a japenese restaurant and sit down and you probably would come out cheaper.  none the less i won't go here as often as i would like because of the high prices.

but in spite of the prices the food was deeeelicious.  of course the food was fresh and the beef was so tender and good.  the service was pretty good and prompt.  it was kind of crowded so i guess everyone was having a craving like i was or needed to get out of this 115 degree weather today."
4,"Went here for lunch the other day. Got the beef bowl. It was good though the meat was a little fatty. I like Yoshinoya because it has atypical fast food (I.e., not the standard burgers or tacos)."
4,"A solid 4.5 for this place.  

Let me start off by saying the customer service here is phenomenal.  I bought a Groupon and stupidly left it until December to use.  Of course things got busy and unfortunately it expired.  I contacted one of the owners (James), to ask him how I go about using the purchase price of the Groupon ($20) since it had expired.  He quickly wrote me back offering me a chance to use the entire Groupon (which had a value of $40) as long as it was within a reasonable amount of time from expiry because he'd rather we come and have fun.  Impressive.  He recommended the Catch 23 show since we were newcomers.  A great suggestion, but I will get to that later.

We decided not to eat here (kind of regretting that now after seeing the food).  The menu looks pretty good with a variety of pub fare - nachos, wings, wraps, sandwiches, salads, Mac and cheese, shepards's pie etc. You can eat in the bar before the show, or actually bring the food in to the theatre as well.  Be careful if you're eating something that requires utensils though because there are only a couple of tables, most of the seats are typical fold out chairs in rows.  The food look really tasty and with large portions.

Getting to the show that we saw, Catch 23 is an improv show with 3 teams performing 4 skits each.  There is audience participation as they vote on the quality of the scenes and a winner is crowned (or belted in this case - you'll get it when you see the show) at the end.  The show was absolutely hilarious and was a great recommendation.

Looking at the calendar of events, This place has a wide variety of shows - both improv and stand up - on two different stages, every night of the week.  Ticket prices vary, but none of them were expensive. 

This place is very easy to get too as well, right on the subway line at Ossington station.

The half star is removed because it was hard to find a seat in the bar when we first got there.  That being said, when we left our show and the people for the next show were coming in, I could see why they wouldn't want much seating because se the place was packed.  In the theatre itself, I found that the seating was kind of tight.  And like I mentioned, not many seats if you had food that would be hard to eat on your lap.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend coming to this place over and over again.  A cheap, HILARIOUS way to start off the night, or even stay for both shows and make a whole night of it.  I will be back, 100%"
4,"Mmmmm! Yoshinoya!!
This place is delicious! 
I've been going for years in LA and was soooooo happy when they made one here. 
I adore both the beef and chicken teriyaki bowl. I can't figure out which I like best. So what to do? Get both with the combo bowl. 
The beef is soooooo delicious. I like the beef better than the chicken but the teriyaki sauce on the chicken is heavenly.
I also tried the yakisoba recently and it was so good. I'm getting it more often. 
I love everything about this place but my favorite thing here is the creamy cheesecake. OMG that thing is good. It's my absolutely favorite dessert on earth. I usually get two or three to eat later."
4,"Really really good food, especially the Juicy Lucy and the Utility. Fries and gravy are a must with any meal! Only issue is with the female order taker / cashier - I'm not being racist as I'm a different shade of brown but seems like if you're not her shade of brown the courtesy and manners are out the door. Her attitude needs an adjustment because this is a multi-cultural city and definitely bad business practice."
4,"I loved the vibe, and yes I would def. come again.

I went to Comedy Bar on a weeknight.  It wasn't packed, but the performances were fun to watch nonetheless.
Audience interaction.  Small venue, kind of a dive but nobody seemed to care.

Admission was very reasonable - tickets tend to be $8-$5/person.  Length of the show that I went to was a little over an hour.

(p.s. for fellow veg-heads: How fantastic is it that they're veg friendly?!  They served more than a token salad or veg soup...  Given that their menu isn't as expansive as some non-fast food joints, pretty impressive that close to half of the items were vegetarian).

If the bar is packed, just come back during the show.  Won't take long at all to get the bartender's attention then.  * Note, the kitchen closes 15 minutes after the start of the last show.

For weekend shows, try to secure tickets in advance; these are the tix that tend to sell out.  I found their phone # useless; better to head there in person around 7 pm to buy tickets at least 24 hours in advance."
4,Love the juicy Lucy. Only thing is very cramped space and slow service. But great burgers and funnel cakes as well.
4,"Awesome burger.
I'm really picky when it comes to fries , these fries were great right amount of salt and fried nice ^^ will be back!"
4,"My go to spot for comedy in Toronto! Yes I know Second City gets all the attention but Comedy Bar showcases a wider variety of talents and shows, a lot of up and coming comedy groups delight audiences.

4 stars vs. 5 because the I'm never a fan of how jam packed it gets when crowds collide in the bar area between shows as the train of post show people come out and the ""line"" to get in can't get in either. It's especially frustrating when you have a 10:30pm show that is yet to start letting people in around 20 or 30 mins prior to showtime (doesn't always happen, but yeah I've had a few late starts that have been frustratingly slow to get going once you've been standing up smooshed up against strangers.

But then the sort of flip side to that is that the crowds that frequent this hole in the wall in the basement are really easy going and always in a chill mood. It's very easy to start conversations with strangers and booze and comedy is always a perfect catalyst for social interactions IMO. 

As I've mentioned before some groups that perform here are still trying to perfect the art of improv, so best go in knowing that. Unless of course you're going to watch a stand up routine by a headliner that these guys manage to secure every so often. 

I think any comedy fan should not give Comedy Bar multiple visits, shows are also super affordable and makes for a great night out! 

PS - don't rely on them to provide a good dinner, while they do have a food menu, it's pretty lacking. I'm not going to hold that against them too much since that's now why people should be coming here for."
4,"My favourite place to eat pho  in Dt Toronto !

The pricing is amazing, broth is very flavourful, and the food they offer is fresh. 

This family owned business oozes with authentic and for sure is a nice family atmosphere I'd say. They are a very casual place, offer fast meals that have many bold and aromatic flavours. 

Usually order the grilled chicken that is topped with a bed of scallions,onions and chills !

Pho with rare beef

Fresh rolls as well. 

Gotta try if you are around spadina and Nassau"
4,"Visited the Comedy Bar last Saturday as I was looking for something different to do. For $12 I was able to see four stand-up performers including their headliner who apparently starred in a movie with that quite famous guy who host the Oscars (?). All the acts were pretty good and the venue not bad at all. 
There is a bar you can grab drinks before you head into the stage area-grab a couple or you will need to get up during the show to get a refill. 
Overall not a bad night, I can't be too hard on any of the performers as they have a tough job trying to make us laugh and overall they were good! 
I would recommend this to anyone looking for something different to do than the normal Saturday bar-hopping escapde."
4,"Nice old school burger and shake place.  The burgers are juicy and they taste even better with Freddy's special sauce on them.  The ice cream is delicious as well.  It would be nice if they also offered thicker fries but I get that thin fries are basically part of their signature  meal.  Their prices  are a bit high but it's still fun to go every now and then when you are in a  ""diet be damned, I'm eating something tasty!"" mood. Oh, and props to the employees for always being cheerful and helpful."
4,"Came to Comedy for an Improv Night hosted by a friend of mine!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I loved the intimate lay-out and feel of the Cabernet Room where I show took place. Will definitely be returning for future events and will remember to come hungry, as a few people raved about the food while we were there."
4,This is a perfect spot. Low key. Locals. The comedy is up coming local people trying to come up.. it was 5 to get in. They have a side area for comedy. Just locals trying to come up and have a good time. They have a bar. Drinks are like a normal bar. The crowed is friendly. I enjoyed the stop.
4,"When I rolled up to this Freddy's the parking lot was empty and I couldn't see anyone inside. I figured - location, location, location and this poor little buddy went down because it didn't have a good location or something. I stammered in anyways and to my dismay they were indeed open - the workers all kind of looked like they were bored out of their mind. I was thinking, maybe they are indeed hurting for business.

I ordered the #1 and it was delicious. Their fries were little shoe-strings that were browned just right. Perfect. I generally like the opposite end of the fry spectrum - big meaty potato wedges, but these were really, really good. I was impressed.

The burger was equally good. I am a big fan of ""old school"" hamburgers that feel like they were made out of raw meat and thrown on a grill. These may have not been made out of raw meat, but they seemed like it. I will warn you though, even the double patty deal was about the same thickness as a single 1/4lb patty elsewhere. So yes, these patties are thin, almost crumbly. So if you're hungry you might want to order a second or just really concentrate on the fries (which they seemed to give a lot of). This is a little odd but I really liked that they gave a whole dill pickle slice for the pickle. I love pickles so they won my heart on that front.

I had never had custard before (gasp from the gallery, I know) so I wanted to try that before I left. how bad could it possibly be? I already love ice-cream, gelato, fro-yo, and shaved ice so how could I not like frozen custard? Well, it too was a win. I ended up eating it all even though I was pretty full. We got the Chocolate Brownie Delight.

On a total random note I really liked the ""fry sauce"" which I think was just ketchup and mayo mixed. I reminded me of the middle-school days when we would mix up the two and eat it on everything on our plate.

I'll give this place a 4.5/5. It was good but I really wished that the fries were a little more beefy. I felt like I had to go grabbing 300 times to eat my portion and I'd rather be lazy and rach 15 times and eat the same amount. LOL."
4,"Food was good, service was great. decent price, enjoyed my lunch"
4,"The Special doesn't seem all that special--what, surprise luncheon meat grilled with some mustard and maybe cheese? But damn is it good, and the hand-mixed soda with it. It's small and not very filling, though, true to the name of the restaurant. Munch on one of those little Slim Jim-lookin' things too, while you're at it.

Mustard-haters, don't worry about the strict requirement that the mustard goes in your sandwich. They don't put in enough to clear the sinuses of a baby hamster."
4,"When it's 11PM in Mississauga on a Sunday night I usually get stuck stopping at either Pizza Nova or Pizza Pizza, which isn't a terrible thing, but sometimes it's just not what I want. Luckily, I stumbled across the Burger Factory and it has officially changed everything! When I came in the place had a group of people and it took the employee a few minutes to acknowledge me, but hey, she was alone and she had burgers to make so I ain't mad. I ended up ordering a cheeseburger with onions, ketchup, tomato, and lettuce. I expected a pretty basic bland burger but what I got was an absolutely delicious, scrumptious, and juicy piece of meat between 2 patties that left me kind of sad I didn't get a second for the next day! This place is a little more expensive then some of the other fast burger places, but it's also a better quality burger. This place definitely far exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to come back again to try a different style of burger!"
4,Delicious just like I remembered as a kid. Fast and friendly service. So glad Vegas had a location.
4,Fresh toppings... Hormone and antibiotic free DELICIOUS patty fried crispy on a hot griddle. Excellent value!
4,"Mmmmm mmmm mmm!

I went for the first time today with a friend who happens to be pregnant and all I had for breakfast earlier that day was a small muffin.  I'm telling you this because between the two of us we made a really respectable dent on a whole lot of food.

We got a small order of the DIY rice paper rolls with satay beef.  The small order had two generously sized satay beef skewers and plenty of bean sprouts and herbs.  So very, very good.  Once you soak your wrapper you gotta wrap quickly or else you'll end up with a sticky mess!

I had a taste of the noodle soup with beef.  Very nice broth.  I'm not a soup connoisseur so I'll leave it at that.

The crispy fried spring rolls were perfectly crunchy.  And the crepe was fun to eat.  We broke it apart and stuffed the pieces and the cooked bean sprouts into a lettuce wrap.  My friend had a mango shake which was very thick.

It was $38 for the two of us, which I don't imagine is normal.  We probably could have done without one of the dishes and been just fine. 

Definite revisit.  Also it was clean, cool and calm inside."
4,"Just had their daily deal - buy 1 get 1 free burger. It was the burgeritto, Mexican inspired styled burger with a fried avacado patty with salsa. The burgers were hand made - you can see the chef making them. It takes a bit longer than a fast-food joint, but totally worth it. Good quality meats for a decent price.

Tip - 2 burgers are too much for a normal person. Bring a friend and pay only $5 for a premium burger."
4,Great place for a quick bite to eat!! Really convenient being close to UNLV
4,"Good burgers here. Not much filler added - which is a bonus for me. Really good beefy flavor. Their house sauce tastes almost like Mac sauce? Not as sour. 

Fries are really, really good and cooked fresh. Hidden in what seems like a sketched out plaza but when you drive in there is an abundance of other restaurants there so you feel a bit safer. Definitely would recommend but I mean its not like burgers priest or holy chuck but it still holds up on its own if you are in the area. It's just a really tasty and reasonably price straight up burger. I prefer normal classic well made burgers anyway. Contemporary  burgers with truffles and diamond and pearls and all of that jazz just isn't what a burger is suppose to be. I think good and unique flavors are always good and I wouldn't mind spending over $100 on a burger *cough chokes BYMARK but this place is reasonable for day to day beef cravings."
4,"This place is close to where my friend lives so we decided to pop over on a Friday night to check it out.

The layout of the building is not entirely clear once I walked in, but wandering about and observing the crowd can give you an indicator of where to go.  The ticket booth attendant was very friendly and helpful with telling me when the show started and where to go in.

I ordered some drinks to tide us over until the show started, and I was very pleased to see that a Long Island Iced Tea comes in a LARGE glass (unlike the tiny little cups that most restaurants and some bars serve).  The price of drinks is average (not cheap, but not insane), and for a large iced tea I'm happy to pay for it.

The theatre is small, maybe fitting 50 or so visitors?  There are just seats lined up beside one another (like a regular theatre would have) and there is an elevated area at the back with some round tables and tall bar stools.

I didn't know what to expect, but I do enjoy sketch comedy, and that's what was playing that night.  It was enjoyable and I did laugh quite a bit at some of the bits.  (The build-up to the punch lines is pretty good and some of them are quite creative.)

I'd definitely come back here again, as it's a fun night out.  (Of course, I wouldn't drive down to the city for the express purpose of visiting the Comedy Bar.  Having a friend who lives close is definitely part of the reason why I'd return.)"
4,"I had came here upon ""researching"" on yelp to find flowers for my best friend for Valentines Day. I came here about a week before the date to place an order. I knew my best friend loves purple so i tried my best to find close to it. 

The workers are super nice and tried to help me find what i wanted. I've always liked lilies and i thought it was a nice that they had an arrangement with roses and lillies. Its not the purple i had in mind but it worked out in the end. The lilies were white edged with a purple that was fairly close to the roses. They helped suggest what would look best (especially since i asked for purple roses) and what not (hey i havent bought anyone nice flowers in ages ! so i asked quite a bit of questions to make sure they know what i wanted and i knew what i was getting). The guy said they had a limited amount of purple roses but guaranteed they would have enough for my order. *crosses fingers* 

Order was placed and paid for and they said i can pick it up any time day of. 

Our plan was, we had dinner scheduled at 6pm so i'd pick it up as close as i could to it. I found out they closed at 4pm on Saturdays but they said they'd be open longer for pick ups. I didn't want to be THAT guy who holds up the entire store from getting off work so i picked up the flowers at 3:30. Originally on order, i had asked for a wrapped bouquet but when i picked it up, it was in a water filled glass vase. Oh man how am i gonna give it to her at dinner? Lol But they recommended this would keep its shape the best so i went with it. 

The flowers held up in the car. the owner? suggested how to put it in the car and how to make it stay put in the seat. The flowers sat in the car with some windows cracked open (oh man they smelled strong XD especially in a ""confined"" space like a car) XD o well. luckily my nose didnt go FUUUUU! lol XD They held up all night and next day til she went home. 

Only downside about lilies is they didnt last as long as the roses and the pistils? tend to fall off and stain whatever they fall on :( sad face ! hope she liked the flowers XD 

Overall back to the store. Great customer service ! :D"
4,"We were looking to experience Toronto's comedy scene, so we headed for the cheapest establishment that we could find with some reputation. The Comedy Bar is a relatively small spot along Bloor St with two show rooms (from what I could tell), a bar, and a kitchen. If we're talking about space and size, I'd characterize it as intimate. Not to say that it's romantic or anything like that. Just cozy.

The show that we saw was called the BeerProv. The premise is a tournament where 12 or so local comics battle it out in several varying themed improv rounds to ultimately find the funniest performer. The ""beer"" portion essentially only comes into play for the winner who wins a sizeable glass/jar of beer. I was happy to find that the quality of the comedy was generally pretty high. The comics fed off of each other often seamlessly, and consistently had the crowd and I laughing out loud. With that many comics though, not everyone is going to be funny, and one or two of them fell short fairly often.
Hats off to Rob Norman and Chelsea Larkin for making it to the finals and being genuinely amoung the funniest of the group. From the get go, I though Rob Norman specifically was one of the wittiest and straight up funniest. Love this guy.

It's worth mentioning that I ordered some finger food. I got the Junkyard, which is an obviously ironic name since it's a veggie plate with hummus. Specifically, you get kettle chips, in-house hummus, baby carrots, broccoli, cherry tomatoes, red pepper slices, and cucumber slices. It's a nice snack to keep your hunger at bay while respecting your waist line. Know though that the ""kettle chips"" could pass for something out of a bag of Lay's, and that the in-house hummus could have been served out of a grocery store tub. Neither was bad, but they have no right bragging about them.

Lastly, I'll note that the Comedy Bar has a much more young/millennial vibe than something like The Second City. Maybe because I'm part of that demographic I found the jokes to hit much more frequently, but I'd say that most people would find the Bar a little more of an entertaining experience.

I'd definitely suggest the Comedy Bar to anyone looking for good laughs in Toronto."
4,"I'm a fan of Freddy's custard. It's the best! Make sure you get the mini size, they are regular size in the real world. I would highly recommend the turtle sundae. Loss of star because I am not a fan of their regular food, always just come for dessert. This place is right across from Teakwoods, go there for dinner and come here for dessert :-)"
4,"I used to live a few blocks from here and miss being so close! Their vermicelli dishes are great, flavour ratios are perfect. Their Pho is always delicious, too. The beef is never too stringy, and whether you ask for mild or spicy, they will make it to your liking. The service is always great. I've gone for takeout, too, and the employees always offer great customer service and very quick preparation time. If I ever ask to adjust a menu item (by substituting something, removing something, or adding something) they never hesitate and fulfill my requests with a smile. The decor/overall aesthetic may not be anything fancy, but the prices are perfectly reasonable and the overall experience - from food to customer service - is always wonderful."
4,"I have to admit, I am a fan. Just entering there, you know that time has stopped in place many, many years ago. 

It certainly is not a classy place. It is not gourmet at all. And its name doesn't suit the place at all: it is NOT a light lunch. However, it a true Montreal institution and a classic.

When you go there, there is only thing to order, really: the Wilensky Special. Bread with salami and bologna and mustard. You take two of those along with a cherry coke and a sour pickle and you're good to go. It's open from 10am to 4pm, weekdays only. 

And you have to remember the rules:

""When ordering a special
You should know a thing or two
They are always served with mustard
They are never cut in two
Don't ask us why, just understand
That this is nothing new
This is the way that it's been done since 1932."" 

Oh, and don't dare you give them some tip."
4,"Love, love, love this place!  They have the best french fries of any restaurant!  I'm generally not a fan of thin burgers, but I do love these.  Onion rings were terrific.  I tried the new mushroom / swiss burger which was fantastic (order it with easy sauce).  Some of the best, most friendly staff you'll ever meet in a restaurant.  My only complaint, get rid of Pepsi and bring in Coke! Otherwise, great place to eat."
4,"Nice enough place. Good comedy shows at a fair price. Guinness at 8 a glass. Chairs aren't too great, but serve their purpose."
4,This place has the best wings and best quesadilla. And that along with their outstanding alcohol prices. This is the place to buy alcohol in Tempe. All bottles are under what other places tend to charge. And you can accrue points also with a card? How you can you beat that? You can't. This is the place to get your late night food n bottles
4,"The service is slow and (slightly incompetent).  The washroom stinks a little.  But the food is the best vietnamese food in Chinatown right now, so close to my mom's home cooking."
4,"I've been here twice before to watch live improv shows. I think it's a great venue to watch comedic talent on the stage. The tickets are under $10 and you catch some of the most creative, brilliant, sharp-tongued minds in improv. I've seen groups that formed during and after Impatient Theatre imploded and I'm never disappointed. It's a good hour and a half of entertainment. 

The place itself seems a bit rundown, with signed posters decorating its walls. But it's all part of the admission fee & charm right? Although they have a good selection of beer, it can run out on a sold out night! The bartenders are quick and friendly. I think this is a good place to go out on a cold winter's day."
4,"Fellow Yelpers, Thank you for the reviews.  The reason why I tried this restaurant was because of the reviews you've all entered.  

First impressions were it was small but clean looking.  For those who have young children, they do not have high chairs however they do have booster seats for those with toddlers. 

As far as the menu, quite the selection.  Despite most of the reviews indication the roll ups were the way to go, I instead, ordered the rice with BBQ pork and was happy with the taste and portions.  Others in my group ordered the bamboo noodle soup and the beef noodle soup and were also happy with the taste and portions. 

Overall I was quite happy with having tried this restaurant.  Due to the fact I'm not a native Torontonian, I can't compare others to this Vietnamese restaurant.  What I can say is that its a great place to eat."
4,"Excellent food. Good service. Friendly staff. Put this on your list of Favs!  So much flavor, you will have an exceptional experience"
4,"A simple but great comedy club.

I was here for JFL42 recently, it's a really intimate space for a show. There's 2 spaces for the show the ""main space"" and the cabaret space with a smaller capacity. 

I've never been in the cabaret space, but the main space is incredibly intimate with capacity for about 100 people. 

In the very back there's tables if you were to order food. In the front there's multiple rows of seats, and a slightly elevated stage. 

Comedy Bar is simple and do book some great up and coming comedians and the occasional big name. 

I'd definitely come back!"
4,"I told my son that he could pick anywhere he wanted to eat dinner last night because he had a good week in school. He wanted some Freddy's action which I was not about to argue because I wanted to try the Chicago dog and chili cheese fries. I didn't care too much for the Chicago dog but not because of the quality, turns out it's just not my thing but I'm glad I tried it. The chili cheese fries were frickin awesome though. For $3.30 you get this huge basket with the perfect amount of chili, cheese and onions. Certainly not a heathly choice but c'mon you don't go to a place like Freddy's for a salad
I love their double California burger and the Dirt and Worms custard. Two grabtastically thumbs up!"
4,"Legit vietnamese ""homestyle"" food! Had the papaya salad, good portion. Serve with boiled shrimp and pork, crushed peanut garnish and rau gem(?).. Exactly how my mom makes it at home! 
The pho my boyfriend had however was a little different to who he is use to, but he still slurp it up. 
My entree was the grill shrimp wrap with beef. May I say Amazing!!! The ratio of serving is how it's suppose to be! lots of herb and leafy greens, served with Banh hoi, MmMmm... You need to know how to roll the wraps otherwise it will be a messy meal. So far, every dish was good. Had the Vietnamese coffee (too much milk for me). 
Service?... 1 star. Reason??? Had to write our own order. arkward... The male waiter there was not friendly. Always seem pist off and doesn't seem to want to serve.. Seems like one of those asian kid that their parents force to work for free until they grow up, but it seems like he was stuck there and never got out... :-T 
Overall. I would come back here if I ever visit Toronto again :-D"
4,"This place I am a fan of. It's close to where I live. Fun thing to do on any night of the week. I like all kinds of comedy.

There was a crazy lady laughing veyr loud at everything which was funny in itself. I recommend checking this place out on a Friday when they do more of the Improv (Catch 23) but I would also want to check it out on other days to see the things they have to offer."
4,"Man you can't beat Yoshinoya when it comes to finding a great value. You can get yourself a chicken bowl or a beef bowl for around $5 and have change left over for whatever else. 

I'm comparing this one to the one in L.A and I gotta say this location's chicken taste better because its crispier. I think because you have the grilled skin still on their. 

Pretty big location. 
Prices slightly higher than L.A"
4,"Checked out Comedy Bar for the first time last Monday night. 

Rob Delaney was in town for TIFF and scheduled two shows (Sunday and Monday night), at $10 it was a steal. Plus super talented, insanely funny Kathleen Phillps (from Toronto) opened the show. 

The venue is much smaller than I anticipated, down a short flight of stairs you enter into a small foyer with a box office. This opens up into a bar with a small side room with a bunch of tables to sit at. 

Drinks are very reasonable ($5 for pint), service was great (even though the place was packed).

To the left of the bar is a doorway into the theatre, a long narrow space with a small aisle down the centre and a small stage at the front.

What more do you need in a Comedy Club? A great night out."
4,Been here multiple times and always get the same thing. The beef bowl with side of extra beef and onions. So good!
4,Solid place. I always get the hotdog hamburger combo. The buns are nicely toasted. The fries are a little annoying due to the fact that they are small. Custard is also good. Haven't had anything bad here. The fry sauce is decent as well.
4,"So complaining nicely really does pay off! I was comped two tickets to Superstars of Comedy by the host/headliner/showrunner? because I told him about my bad experience here. We've been back again since (NXNE) and they seem to have gotten their aggressive security guard and ticket issues sorted out. It's a great little place that's a bit dive baresque but totally worth it for the great shows they put on. 

I hope the staff keep up their good work and don't succumb to overbooking and swearing at me."
4,Great real Mexican food joint. Tucked away little spot. Gets pretty packed at night but never takes to long. Chicken taco are amazing! While you are there you can also pick up all kinds of munchies and alcohol. Kind of the perfect stop for your way home after the bar or a party.
4,Not sure what all the hate is on this place. The food is very good for Cleveland BBQ. Quesomole is outstanding. I went with the Momma Bear which was great. The brisket was a personal favorite. I would agree that the AC was blasting inside for good reason...meat sweats. The service however was a bit slow. Go give it a try.
4,Good burger.  I had the juicy juicy (the hot version).   The burger was stuffed with cheese and jalapeños.   While I did not like the fries they were fresh cut not packaged frozen.
4,"So this place is not only a food joint but a market that sells just about everything short of car parts.

I'd say the tacos are pretty good not the best but the price and the experience of feeling like you are a part of some food spiritual experience with the Multicultural and diverse clientele Shirleen experience everyone should have will passing through Tempe Shady Eastern neighborhood.

I definitely like the food enough to come again and do recommend the other hipster Foodies."
4,"I love their bugerrito burger! I've tried most of their specialty burgers in the promo deal, but this one is my favorite. I'm not sure what's with the negative reviews, but this place is far better than any other burger joint in the area, especially with the 2-for-1 deal. The patties might be somewhat thin, but the unique burger combinations make up for it. I'll definitely be back!"
4,Had the burgetta burger. Very different but very good! And got tons of fries (enough to share)
4,"Frozen Custard is a MUST try! Whether it's a pint or a sundae, it's never a disappointment because their thick, creamy and flavorful plain or mix-ins. One of my favs is the Hawaiian because strawberries, pineapples, coconut flakes and macadamia nuts are great mixture. The burgers are different from patties, but good. They are drier and thinner due to being smashed grounded steak meat. Not your usual thick juicy patties used to eating, but flavor is good. Just don't expect to get fully satisfied with the meal, especially when the fries are the thin shoestrings. Room for dessert then!"
4,"I only ordered the vegetables and the miso soup to go, so I still have a great deal to explore about this place. As far as location and interior goes, it is considered to be in a little bit of a ""rundown area"" but don't be so quick to judge a book by its cover. The interior is clean, modern, and my service experience was fairly friendly at best. The two side items I ordered was made in little less than 5 minutes, and was piping hot, so the quality of the food here is great. Good stop for college students in the area if they're looking for something different than Chipotle, In-N-Out, or Smashburger."
4,"Si cute ! Si charmant ! 

Le décor ancestral date du début du 20e siècle et la charmante dame de 91 ans qui sert derrière son comptoir est la femme du défunt propriétaire. J'adore l'endroit. C'est tout petit, tout intime, Je recommande le fameux Wilensky's special, qui consiste en : du baloney, de la moutarde jaune (obligé d'en mettre!!), fromage et du pain hamburger, le tout pressé, écrasé comme un vieux grilled cheese. A déguster avec un ""lemon soda"" qui est vert pomme et délicieusement sucré.

C'est plus qu'un petit resto de quartier, c'est une institution, carrément !"
4,Very unique burger. For fast food in out is great and my favorite. But this is a close second. Fries are thin and crispy and the dipping sauce is killer. The wait staff is friendly and proficient   Would definitely go back
4,"Pros: 
-fresh ingredients=fresh tasting burger and fries
-good selection of free condiments and toppings

Cons: 
-at this price range none

Bottom line- Probably best tasting burger place in the area and an unbeatable value for quality ingredients.

Other yelp reviews are pretty accurate on this place. Their standard beef burgers are fresh, tasty and definitely great value for the money at $4.99. The meat is fresher than Five guys and hands down tastier. Yes they use Wonder bread buns but for the price how can you complain. I would definitely choose this place over other gourmet burger places I have tried. The ratio of meat to bun to condiments was just right. Not too much meat and not too much bread.

This burger joint is definitely serious about preparing fresh food and it shows in the taste. The meat patties are freshly prepared and even their fries are freshly cut-despite not being entirely crispy were still great tasting fries. 

Will have to come back to try their fried fish burger which I noticed was prepared fresh as well. They have a buy one get one free special everyday but probably only for limited time since they are fairly new."
4,"Its been 5 looong years since I last ate at Yoshi.So to my tastbuds delight this has been a real treat.
Ordered the large beef bowl and nothing else.
Place was empty except for the staffs and a couple of take outs.
Will go back to have my beef bowl fix before I leave."
4,"We heard the longtime Fisher' Tavern was to be remodeled into a new place a few months ago. Later we learned it would be a BBQ spot and just recently found it would be connected to the Quagliata family of restaurants. The result is a fine new interior with a pleasant assemblage of foods. 

Smokin' Q's meats are a touch spicier than most of the BBQ spots opening in Cleveland. The sauce (on each table in a pedestrian plastic bottle with a masking tape label handwritten, ""Sauce"") is calmer. The result is a richer meat flavor and we found ourselves using less sauces. The Brisket was excellent (remember to order a mix and chop those slices for a better taste!) and while I thought the Pulled Pork was a touch dry, my wife enjoyed it fully. Liked the Potato Salad and Lettuce Wedge as well. What was interesting is that the entrée was available Traditional or with Tortillas. This was a clever twist and one will likely try next visit. 

I noticed a number of lower ratings here, likely due to the cost. This is among the costlier BBQ spots in Cleveland. I can't give the food bad marks, but would advise prospective diners to check out the menu and understand your tab in advance."
4,"I was born in the Midwest and grew up on Steak N Shake steak burgers. Pressed thin and cooked on a table top grill, they were unrivaled especially compared to your traditional chains like McD and BK. Freddy's is very reminiscent of those steak burgers and skinny fries. 

The menu is far from overwhelming; they stick to what they're good at. Order a single steak burger and skinny fries. Don't count calories because you will lose count. If there's any room left try a custard concrete mixer (think DQ Blizzard) - turtle is their go-to flavor. 

Staff is friendly enough and drive through is pretty expedient. Prices are on the higher end for what you'd expect from ""fast food"" but it's worth the treat."
4,"I have been going to Anh Dao for years and without a doubt this place has the best Nem Nuong in Toronto.  I would often ask for extra rice paper & a little knife to slice my sausage in half (length wise).  By doing this, I get more rolls & am able to use all of the vegetables that accompany it.  I tried their sour soup & found it wasn't sour enough to my liking (Bun Saigon further south on Spadina makes the best soup).    

Owned & operated by a nice family, the food there is truly authentic.  Though high end restaurant is nice for special occasions.  For 'everyday' eats, Anh Dao is on my short list. 

BTW Susan C, I believe plantain is the fruit that you are looking for."
4,"Pour un excellent sandwich salami et Bologne, je vous recommande vivement ce restaurant. Un décor des années 30, on a vraiment l'impression de remonter dans le temps. Ne cherchez pas le confort, vous trouverez pas. Cet endroit est un resto rapide. Je vous recommande, ne serait-ce que pour l'expérience !"
4,"This place has pretty consistently good shows and it's pretty cheap for a night of entertainment. 

I've seen improv and standup here and both were funny. I don't like this place as much as second city but it's still pretty good. 

The one downside is that it's pretty small and the bar area gets pretty crowded before a show."
4,"Saw this place on Mind of a Chef just the night before while we were visiting Montreal so we had to hit it up! They serve only one thing, but they serve it right. Had already visited the infamous Schwart's days prior and although I know they're two different sandwiches, Wilensky's sandwich tasted WAY better. The place is outdated, but full of character. There's maybe like 10 stools at the bar and you eat there. Up close and personal to the servers who are wonderful people. The sandwich looks dinky and lame but the bun is WARM (unlike Schwart's) and when you bite into it...oh man is it tasty. We even ordered one to bring back to Vancouver (since we were leaving that day)! A must-visit!"
4,Small and quiet. Ordered their fresh roll plate. Wasnt able to finish it all.. the portions are huge! I'll be visiting here soon for vietnamese food again
4,"I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant. There were all sorts of western decorations and BBQ themed items on the walls. I had the pulled pork, it was a little dry but still delicious. The brisket was the best meat we ordered, I would go back for just that! The entrees come with pickles which were awesome. The homemade bread made the meal. We also tried the Mac and cheese which I would skip next time. Great all Ohio beer selection. I would definitely try this place again!"
4,"Very messy burgers but fun. I'm not a stacked to the sky condiments type of guy but a decent burger for $7 and WAY BETTER then the chains. They serve Halal too.
Small place but worth a visit."
4,"Great comedy venue.

Almost all of the seats are on the same level, so it can be difficult to see around people. Anyone who is shorter should look for a seat at the front

The sound system is very loud. Bring ear plugs as it can be a bit overwhelming if you have sensitive ears.

The service is great. In my experience they are very good at organizing the venue, dealing with lines, ticket purchase, etc.

One of the best selling points of Comedy Bar is that it's a legit fun atmosphere to hang out in after the show. It's much more tempting to stick around here and chat to people than elsewhere."
4,"Came here on a Friday night w some girlfriends.... The evening and first show started off a bit slow... But soon we were all rolling on the floor, crying from laughter!  The second show was particularly amazing, and they asked for audience participation during intermission by writing things on paper for them to use. $10 for a night of entertainment and laughs is a steal! Plus, the drinks were well priced. Some of the best improv I've seen :)

Will definitely be back!!!"
4,"Simple, but good!

Interior appears to be a dated, original soda shop counter with some charm to it.  Apparently things have been the same, including the menu, since 1932!

There isn't too much on the menu, only a few selections so it makes things easier for indecisive people.

I ordered The Special with a Cherry Cola.  It was delicious and just-under $5!  So great for a ""Lite Lunch"" as this place is named or a snack.  I was pretty full after 1 sandwich though.

A definite recommend if you're in the Mont Royale area, e.g. across the street from Kem Coba. ;)"
4,"Awesome Pho, definitely going again.
Not an expert with Asian cuisine but I know good food when I taste it."
4,"Per Susan C's review, I do in fact give this my ""White People Don't Eat Here"" seal of approval!

You definitely come here for the Nem Nuong, which is a Vietnamese pork sausage with some serious DIY veg and other random stuff I've never seen before.  Throw all that goodness in a rice paper roll with sausage and inhale through mouth.  Fantastic.

Pho was decent, above average, but nothing that wow'ed me.

Banh beo, which is tough to get at sit down restaurants, were a disappointment.  You're better off crossing the street and picking these bad boys up at the banh mi shops."
4,"Coming back for a second time could not have been better. They have definitely improved the taste of their burgers. The patty now has a crisp char and size has grown.

My burger: cheddar cheese burger with extra Jackson sauce, jalapeño, pickles, tomato. Try it for yourself.

I work near by, so I'll back soon."
4,"Firstly the service was good. Not spectacular but pleasant enough. I had the Triple Threat Burger which was sooo amazing. The bacon and the patty were cooked to order so the food was nice and fresh. That's one of the biggest pluses for me.

The fries were sub-par over-cooked and a little soggy with oil. Which is why they lost a star in this review. 

They have a wide range of great toppings. I would definitely go back for another burger. Overall I would say it was a good experience."
4,"For my short trip in AZ I knew I had to get late night Mexican food, so my friend from high school took me here after hitting up bars on Mill. It seems like these hole in the wall places are always the best. As far as late night food goes, this place was not greasy or frozen like fast food. My breakfast burrito was made fresh and right in front of me. I got mine with eggs, cheese, tomatoes, and red salsa. 

Fast service and the employees were helpful. The only thing is they should offer bacon for the breakfast burrito. Is it just me or is having chicken with egg just wrong?"
4,"They have a dude making burritos, pipes, booze, condoms, beanies, and more. They put the convenient in convenience store.

I just wrote their jingle."
4,"I've been coming here for years as a recommendation from Vietnamese friends, I don't think I can go wrong... when the locals recommend it... 

When you come here, you're not looking for decor and/or atmosphere.. you're simply coming for the food..no expectations for seating and decor.. 

I usually order the beef pho here and I'm never disappointed in the bold soup base, spring rolls work well as a side dish..when I come here with more people, it is good to share the rice paper rolls where you do it yourself...its somewhat interesting as I don't see this as often in other Vietnamese restaurants..

You can never go wrong with the Pho here as it's as good as it gets....pricing is reasonable for the size and quality that you get..."
4,"Best burgers in Mississauga .. Philly steak sandwich simply amazing. Amazing variety of toppings .. place too small is the only drawback, otherwise they know their burgers very well."
4,"I love their burgers and of course their fry sauce which I believe is mayo, ketchup, and their french fry seasoning not sure. Any how I wish they would make the fries bigger but other than that so good!"
4,"Woohoo!  Another fun local BBQ joint has opened. I'm liking this trend.  I have been here a few times since opening week.  Each visit I've noticed that they have been making changes in a good way.  One of the most recent changes include lunch specials.  Thank you for doing that because most customers don't want to spend over $20 on lunch.

I've had most of the meat offerings including the brisket, pulled pork, baby back rib and sausage.  What stands out?  The ribs for sure.  Seasoned well with a nice peppery bark, meaty and tender.  Should you choose, a couple varieties of house made BBQ sauce are on the table.  When deciding on an appetizer, definitely try the wings.  We requested a couple sauces to be served on the side so we could have some variety.

I'm liking what I'm seeing so far.  Offering daily specials unique from their regular menu.  Great food and service.  Happy hour beer specials and a nice atmosphere."
4,"I really like to give it a 3.5, but I'll be nice and since Yelp doesn't have 1/2 star ratings, I'll give it the 4 star.

I've been there a handful of times and always enjoy the food.  I have tried the Juicy Lucy, the cheeseburger and the Utility (Philly Cheese steak sandwich).  

The Utility was just tried today, and although it tasted great and the meat was cooked well, it soaked through the bun by the time I walked across the street to get back to work, so it was a complete mess to eat.  I'd eat it to stay next time, cause again, it was delicious.

Their burger meat is of above average quality, but its not great.  I have tasted better, but I'd definitely recommend this place to the burger lover that is in this area, I wouldn't go out of my way to try em though.  

The fries are hand cut, fresh fries.  A little on the thick side, but they are done well.  I do enjoy them

I am a huge poutine lover, and the burger factory's poutine is not made with cheese curds, rather just shredded mozz. so its not a traditional poutine, but the one thing that makes this place is the gravy.  This is by far the best gravy I have ever tasted from any restaurant I have ever been too.  I do consider myself a gravy aficionado and I take my gravy seriously.  I will not go to some places because they don't have gravy or its not good enough if they do.  For example, I love 'Five Guys' burgers, but they don't have gravy so I don't go often. 

The gravy alone keeps me going back, and was worth the extra .5 of a star for the rating.

Price is fair, and comparable to most fast food places for their higher end sandwiches, but the quality is far above a fast food joint."
4,"Okay. Gyudon is like one of my fave Japanese food. I have had Yoshinoya in Japan many times as well as in the ghettos of California. Haha. They had one in Vegas! Yay! Plus it was a rainy, wintery day so gyudon sounded amazing. We get to Yoshinoya and I am automatically thinking (or not thinking since I may have been too hungry) I will get a large beef gyudon. Of course the husband warned me but I did it anyway. I order the large. My husband also got a large but with vegetables and beef. It is so interesting how the menu at the restaurant has the amount of calories in each meal. Good and not good. I just happened to ignore those signs that day. Anyways, we got home and I thought I had accidentally bought a catering tray of meat and rice for a party but no, it was the large. Thank goodness for my teenage nephew who helped me finish. I absolutely love Yoshinoya. The taste is super consistent from Las Vegas to Japan (of course in Japan there are more ethnic peoples preparing the meals). I love the thin beef with lots of rice. It was so 'ono' as we say in Hawaii for delicious!"
4,"I suppose there is a common trend building with my reviews here on Yelp. But when a girl likes comedy...she really likes comedy! 
I'm super happy to give Comedy Bar hi-fives all around. The food is cheap and cheerful (who doesn't like coleslaw now that our parents aren't forcing us to eat it?), and the kitchen is open late. There are comedy shows (often two) every single night, and space available for rent for rehearsals or pow wows during the day. I like the peeps that hang around (some girl I didn't even know bought me a pint last night just because), and love that the space was built by most of the people who perform there now. I like a community! Call me simple...but I totally dig it.
Check out Sunday Night Luve (on Sundays...obviously), Catch23 (Mondays), Project! Project! (Wednesdays), Impromptu Splendor (Thursdays), and other special events like the Oscar Party this Sunday (22nd), and The Subway Series on April 26th (a co pro with GhostJail Theatre and Sunday Night Live)!!!"
4,Had the compressor and it was pretty good. Bun was not too thick and beef tasted fresh. Burger was actually very hot to eat so had to be careful. Solid flavour. Wish they had malt vinegar. I will be back.
4,"I'm super in love with this Burger joint. I would look at Jackson's Burger as a more sophisticated alternative to the conventional fast food joint. 

Burgers here are made with high quality beef.i know this instantly from my first bite into the burger. You can actually taste the beef and notice the chewy texture of the ground beef. 

Don't get me started on the poutine. They make amazing fusion style poutine that is loaded with cheese curds and gravy sauce. My favourite was the Jerk Chicken Poutine. The fries retained their crisp and the sauce was really jerky."
4,"Had a great dinner last night. Started with the brisket poutine as an appetizer and it was sooooo good. Got a 3 meat mix with chicken, pork ribs and sausage and a brisket with tips and slices with a side of baked bean cassoulet so we could try a wide variety and we were not disappointed. The beans were amazing. Next time we bring more people to share the appetizer so we don't end up bringing half our meals home. Brisket and scrambled eggs this morning ;)"
4,"The food I've tried here so far was delicious and authentic. The nem nuong (pork, rice noodles, bean sprouts, fresh veggies and herbs rolled into rice paper) here is delicious. The pho broth is also really good, but they skimp out a bit on the meat and noodles, so I'm not sure why they charge more than other places. Either way, I'm definitely going to be back to try more of the menu! Lunch gets pretty busy but service is quick.

Cash only."
4,"UberEats + El Paisano in the wee hours of the morning is both the single best and worst decision I've ever made. 

When you get a call from the Uber driver saying ""I'm here... bring a friend... or a wheelbarrow..."" you know you have a problem. 

I'm from Bakersfield. Hi. We know good tacos. 

Wait. Surprised? Well, we do. Not to start WWIII here (I'll leave that to our President) but we make some mighty fine tacos in the Central Valley. 

So after a long night of drinking, there's only one thing I crave: TACOS! 

And at 3 am, there are very few taco options in the fancy little chic town of Scottsdale. 

Enter: UberEats. 

El Paisano Market (inside Laila's Check Cashing... you read that right) was somehow rated the best of the best. My Tito's fueled-self proceeded to order every single thing on the menu. 

You heard me right. 

Every.
Single.
Thing.

To be honest, most of the food wasn't very memorable, but you don't really come here (or order Uber Eats from here) for that. It's the massive portions and the prices. Oh - and the fact that they are open late. 

Bye Bye Hangover. 

It's hands down one of the more gangster things I've ever done. Think it isn't? Come back to me when you've filled your hotel room with tacos and burritos like a boss. #lifegoals"
4,"This will be the most useless review you'll ever read on Yelp:

Go here. Get the special. Enjoy.

The end."
4,"Been here twice now and really digging it, lots of different menu options than the average T-dot Vietnamese restaurant.

Last night we tried the ""Tom Bo Nuong Lui"" which was an absolutely massive plate of big shrimp wrapped in beef on skewers, with vermicelli, veggies, lettuce, mint & coriander which you wrap DIY style in rice paper. We had a large for $24 and it was enough to feed 3 peeps.

On my first visit I shared a catfish sweet & sour type soup and the Nem Nuong pork sausage dish mentioned in other reviews. Both were awesome. I liked the soup as it was loaded with veggies and had no noodles (hasta la vista, carbs!)

I was about to give Anh Dao 5 stars, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews - the veggies on my plate both times were not very fresh. Soggy beansprouts are kind of gross and my lettuce had dirt on it."
4,"Tiny little bar right by Ossington station. I came here with my friend on a Groupon and it was definitely worth it! I had a voucher for tickets and food and the perogies were surprisingly really good! I really enjoyed the service, people were super nice and welcoming. It's a bit of a dive bar and kinda small but I like that feel since it makes it very intimate. The comedians were hilarious! They really knew how to read the crowd. I would definitely be back."
4,"Ordered a dry pho with soup on the side, stir fry noodle and Vietnamese coffee. The food portions were a generous amount which was a bonus. The food was average, nothing spectacular. However the Vietnamese coffee was so delicious! It brought back memories when I was in Vietnam for a week. Their coffee was strong and addictive. The coffee takes its sweet ass time to drip but it's worth the wait!"
4,"I was told that this is a MUST on every first timer's trip to Montreal so I had to stop by.
I was pleasantly surprised by such a simple yet delicious meal. Although I would never eat bologna as an adult, it was somehow okay in this sandwich. The sandwich itself is nothing special, I think all the hype is about the location and ambiance. I was able to get a seat at the counter and the staff and regulars were very nice. It's definitely an interesting place if you are in the area."
4,"Juicy Lucy on Fire.
Great name for a burger.  I wouldn't consider the burger really hot, but i am a fan of spicy foods so your mileage may vary.
The burger was well prepared, nicely seasoned and of course juicy, but not too much so.  The fries were thicker cut than you normally see.  At first thought the fry portion was small, but I ended up reasonably full after the meal.  I guess girth does factor in.
Place was clean and the staff friendly, overall an enjoyable experience."
4,3 Bucks for a Sm. Spicy Chix Bowl.  'Nuff Said.
4,"Le 4 étoiles ici est pour l'expérience globale. J'ai passé de nombreuses fois devant ce restaurant, car il est à côté de la piste cyclable, sans jamais le remarquer. 

J'ai vu les chefs David Chang et ceux de Joe Beef y passer dans l'émission ""Mind of a chef"" et j'étais très curieux d'essayer. 

En rentrant dans le restaurant, on a l'impression d'être à une autre époque avec le décor qui ne semble pas avoir été changé. 

Il était 10h30, alors j'étais le seul client. L'accueil était sympathique. Sharon Wilensky était souriante. On m'a proposé les deux types de cornichons, on a amené des saucissons.

Côté nourriture, c'est plus du ""confort food"" qu'autre chose. La nourriture est bonne, le Bologne est coupé au fur et à mesure. Le pain Kaiser est pressé dans un grill style panini. Il manque un peu de goût, j'ai ajouté de la moutarde, malgré qu'il en avait déjà. Les à côté comme les chips Miss Vickie's sont 1$, très abordable. La root beer est disponible. 

Une belle place pour y aller entre amis après une journée de travail"
4,I'm really torn. The sides were phenomenal. The Mac and cheese is literally the best I have ever tasted. The meat was competently smoked but didn't stand out. For Cleveland it's about as good you find though.
4,"One of my students this work term is a devout Muslim. When we went out for lunch with my other student the other week, she couldn't eat anything but fries. The food wasn't halal.

Last Friday, she asked if we were going out for lunch on Friday. I said that we could, but asked that she suggest a place that was halal. She recommended Burger Factory, which is a five-minute drive away from work.

I drove us over there. I got a parking spot right outside the door. We went in at around noon. It wasn't too busy.

I ordered the juicy Lucy burger. It's essentially chunks of cheddar cheese inside the beef patty. I got it as a combo with onion rings and a Diet Coke.

I recommend doing a combo. You save a bit.

On the screen, you pick your toppings. The Factory sauce contains mayo, relish, and spices. I went with it, along with tomatoes and onions.

I paid (credit and debit cards, and cash are accepted), got a receipt with my number, and waited for it to be called.

We waited a good fifteen minutes before our orders were ready. The place makes your order fresh. I read my receipt. You can order ahead and pick up. It's a good tip.

When I first looked at my burger, it looked cute and small. Looks are deceiving, folks! I took one bite and had the cheddar ooze out of the burger patty. The burger was flavourful and delicious. The bun was soft and yummy. I loved the Factory sauce. Everything was fresh.

My onion rings were perfect. They were crispy and crunchy, and not oily. 

One of my students got a cheeseburger. The other got the chicken burger. The latter is not breaded. Both looked good. They got fries and loved them.

I will come back. The food is so good.

4,"Lets start by saying I dont come here for the atmosphere.  Its on the drab side, not the most inspiring place..  but then again, not a lot of comedy venues are anything more than black walls and chairs.

But what these folks have done for the improv scene in Toronto is amazing. Ive seen 8-10 shows here now, and the majority have been really strong.  The long form shows are particularly great:  Whedonesque, Poinsettia, and Provocateur, all very strong enjoyable shows, as is Sunday Night Live when the host and musical act are bearable!

Would be great if the shows would start on time, and I agree with other reviewers that a bit of adjustment to the main stage space (small risers, more comfy chairs) would make a difference - but this is a cheap venue with inexpensive shows making comedy more accessible - and making it possible for more actors to get on stage.  So I give them some slack and some props.

Second City is to Broadway as Comedy Bar is to Off-Broadway.  Some gems are to be found."
4,"this place is pretty much about as authentic as you can get for vietnamese food.

definately try the nem nuong.  it might take a little practice to perfect the roll, but once you get it, you won't be able to stop stuffing your face.

i would've given them 5/5 if their vegetables were a bit fresher."
4,"Their  chocolate and vanilla custard is yummy!
I preferred the hard to take home rather than the soft serveI. I LOVE the shoestring  fries!  The special sauce they give you to go with them is amazing. If I'm willing to wait  an extra few minutes, they are always happy to give me a fresh batch of fries. I like them piping hot!!!

After I watch the documentary What the Health on Netflix I choose not to eat either one but noT because  they are not tasty! 

I personally didn't like the steak burgers or the hotdogs even when I ate meat but they deserve four stars just for the custard and fries!"
4,"HALAL! BURGERS! POUTINE! FUNNEL CAKE!

All this under one roof! Must I say more? The burgers here are amazing. Fresh meat, perfectly cooked, great tasting...this is what this place has. 

The only reason they don't get a 5 star rating is for their customer service. Do not expect to be treated like a customer or ""the customer is always right"" kind of treatment. This is simply and order, eat, and walk out joint."
4,"This is a cute, historic restaurant that makes you feel like you're stepping back in time when you enter. Sit at the counter and get a Wilensky's Special (grilled sandwich with salami, beef bologna, mustard, and cheese), which they've been making since 1932. We each got one along with a sour pickle and also shared an old-fashioned cream soda. The sandwich is pretty good, and the staff is very friendly. We're glad we went."
4,"When your Vietnamese dry cleaner tells you that Anh Dao is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown, you go ASAP. I went there for lunch with Neil ""Vietnamese Food Nazi"" T. and he gave it his ""White People Don't Eat Here"" seal of approval.

FOOD
Their specialty is Nem Nuong ($9.95), rice-paper rolls that you assemble yourself at the table, featuring Anh Dao's famous BBQ pork sausage. You get 8 discs of dried rice paper, each slightly larger than a DVD; moisten one briefly in the bowl of warm water; load it up with fillings and roll it up like a burrito. The amount of fixings is enough to fill a horse trough; way too much for the number of rice paper wraps. But we only got 7 links of sausage which meant that my last bundle was without sausage:( I secretly think Neil got greedy and pinched an extra link for himself when I wasn't looking. 

***ETA: Neil says there were only 7 wraps and 6 sausages and that I should quit blaming him for missing food. Yup. Sounds guilty to me.***

Oh, man, the rolls were like snap, crackle, and shazam! My favorite combination in the wrap was a layer of vermicelli noodles, sausage, bean sprouts, cucumber, mint, cilantro, basil, Asian chives, and some slices of unidentified exotic fruit[1] that looked like a small Granny Smith apple but was drier and less sweet-tart. It's served with Anh Dao's ""signature house sauce,"" a thick, hoisin-based sauce. I loved the play of contrasts: hot-cold, smooth-crunchy, sweet-salty; and all the ingredients were like fresh from the garden.

The banh beo ($5.75), however, had that not-so-fresh feeling. The little rice cakes were not steamed to order, and the dollops of mung bean puree had the tell-tale crustiness of having been left out too long. Blech.

And just because we had to try their pho, we ordered the Special Beef Noodle Soup ($6.25 for one size) The broth was fragrant without being too rich, however, the noodles are dried, not fresh. I don't like quite so many ingredients in my pho (rare beef, brisket, beef balls, tripe, ""etc."") so next time I'm going to try it with just two max.

SERVICE
Stick to the pen-and-paper ordering method to avoid confusion or speak to the owners' teenaged sons who are fluent in English. Each dish hits the table as soon as its ready.

VIBE
Much nicer than the usual pho joints on Spadina; the Buddhist alter behind the cash register and chattering of the Vietnamese clientele will transport you to Saigon.

BOTTOM LINE
Get the Nem Nuong (or any dish with the house sausage) and keep an eye on Neil T. when dining with him.

[1] I still have no clue what this fruit was. I did an image search; it's not guava, soursop, or jackfruit. Any idea?"
4,"My husband and I have stopped in here twice for dinner and have been pleased both times. The food and drinks were very good! The atmosphere is laid back and if you catch them on a busy night you feel packed in there. They do have a nice little patio that we enjoyed sitting on the first time we were there.
 Both times our service was great and the servers had recommendations which I like, it helps me decide quicker. We started off with the smokey bbq wings (which were delicious) and for dinner I had the ""The Hot Chick"", BBQ chicken breast sandwich, slaw, sauce, guac, pickles...it was awesome! My husband really enjoyed the ""The Fat Hefer"", chopped brisket, buttermilk fried onion, queso, slaw, pickles house sauce. Needless to say, we left there full and ready for a nap!! Great place!"
4,"Great Burgers and Fries! Happy Tummy! I will eat here anytime I have that ""need a big juicy Burger"" feeling! No prefab Burgers for this chickie!"
4,"Un classique du Mile-End ! On se replonge dans le passé chez Wilensky, on prend un spécial + un cherry coke, effectivement, c'est bon et pas cher. Ils ont aussi des hot-dogs."
4,"Went there for lunch, beautiful interior and nice bar area.  Had the pulled pork 'el jefe' style, very tasty but they could have done a little better pulling some of the fat out.  Friendly wait staff and reasonable prices otherwise."
4,"The burgers are made here fresh everyday from scratch. No additives or preservatives. Halal meat, slaughtered in the most swift and conscious way possible.

Its got that home made taste to it. The buns are a bit soft which makes it a mess to eat. 

Clean restaurant with lots of booth seating. Good for a quick sit in eat, or take out.


Id recommend this joint."
4,"We went to the monthly Comedy Uncovered show, which was advertised as ""Headlined by Sandra Battaglini (Just for Laughs, JFL42, voted NOW's ?Best Female Standup?), stand up by Sam Burns (Just for Laughs Homegrown Comedy Competition), features a performance by Kris Siddiqi, improv by all-star improv hot shots Sarah & Liz (combined credits of the Winner for Now Magazine's Best Female Improviser + regular performers at Bad Dog Theatre), and host Marito Lopez (Hubcap Comedy Festival, NXNE, JFL42, MTV)!""

The funniest person, by far, was the talented Marito Lopez. He was the host and had great comedic timing, a quick wit, and great observations. We really enjoyed him. Sam Burns was fun, although his set seemed too short. He left me wanting more, so maybe that's good? Sarah & Liz were cute and silly with their improv, however; the scenarios they used were audience members' stories that Marito literally just discussed moments before they went on, which was a little annoying since the girls weren't paying any attention backstage. They made up for it with their genuine talent (quick thinking and smart). The real bummer for my husband and I was the headliner, Sandra Battaglini. She was ill prepared and  had more slightly funny observations than real comedic chops. This show was well worth the $12 per ticket we paid in advance, and a great date night activity. My one suggestion would to get a server in the main room so people don't have to get up to get a drink."
4,"Stopped in for lunch while in town for the jazz fest.

The Special was as advertised: cheap and delicious. And they make it super fast--like 10 seconds fast. So good I got one for the road. And the phat Slim Jim beef jerky thing was awesome for 60 cents, too.

Overall, a Montreal institution for 80 years that's well worth checking out. Will definitely be back."
4,"Came here on Sunday for lunch. They don't open until 12 pm so we were waiting briefly outside until they opened. We were the first I the restaurant and sat in the dark for a few minutes as they were getting things set up. 

Ordered rare beef pho and shrimp/pork spring roll. Pho was great, broth was rich in flavour, noodles were al dente and there were fresh red onions, green onions and cilantro as garnish.

Spring roll had fresh ingredients, quite enjoyed the freshness.

My husband got the vermicelli with grilled pork sausage. Sausage was tasty, the rest were pretty standard.

Service wise it was a bit slow. There was one server and one chef for the restaurant. We got our entrees and finished it before we got our appetizer spring roll. 

Aside from the service, the food was good, you get what you pay for in terms of quality (was a little on the expensive side compared to other pho places). I'd come back though."
4,"The burgers were decent, I still prefer this over McDonald's, Wendy's, or burger King. But however I like In N Out better. The Fries tasted okay by them selves but with their seasoning and Freddy's Fry Sauce they were really good! The custard was pretty delicious!"
4,Had a lot of fun here! Fun place to grab a few drinks and have some laughs.
4,"Just had dinner at Anh Dao for the first time tonight. It was really a great surprise! I had the shrimp and chicken fresh rolls and the vegetarian tofu and vegetable soup.......hot, fresh and very flavourful! The fresh rolls also had a few unexpected flavours. 

The atmosphere was pleasant, much less noisy than many restaurants these days and I was able to hear my dinner guest (bonus!) 
Service was great, friendly and attentive!

To top it off, I forgot my reading glasses at the restaurant and they were delivered to my house just a few minutes ago!!!! If that is not GREAT service, I don't know what is!!!

I will be going back often!!
Thanks again for the special delivery!!"
4,"Last time I was here was about a year ago. Got the veggie burger, was very good. Staff was very nice and the quality was great,  tasty food.  Would for sure go again."
4,"First off, don't come here expecting high gastronomy. This is a workers lunch and it's pretty clear. If you accept this and that this is not a healthy lunch, you can be satisfied with the lunch at wilensky's.

I walked there from my office and took it to go. I had 2 special wilensky's sandwich, one with Swiss cheese and one with no cheese. If you are hesitating between the two, my answer is simple: go with the one with cheese. The standard one is a good comfort food but the one with cheese is so much better. The cheese melts completely and the taste of Swiss goes really well with the salami if the sandwich.

Also try their soft drink. They are homemade and tastes really good. One warning though, don't expect it to taste like your commercial version of the drinks like Coca-Cola or Pepsi.the taste is different but it's really good"
4,Wow! What a hidden gem! This is a convenience store with a good selection of beer and they make quality fast mexican food in the store. The chicken street tacos are great for late night. Good portions of very good quality ingredients. They serve 'til 2:00am!
4,"My experience at Abrazo Arrowhead Campus was very positive.  I entered the emergency room with severe kidney stone pain, saw a doctor within 15 minutes and had an IV and pain meds within 45 minutes.  I received a CAT scan and knew the results almost immediately.  My urologist was contacted promptly and surgery was scheduled for the next day.  I did have to wait for an inpatient bed, but the wait was not long.  The floor care was also very professional and their direct dial to nurse/CNA really cuts response time.  I would recommend this as our neighborhood hospital for routine care."
4,"How have I never noticed this place before? 

I came here for a quick dinner with a fellow Yelper Avitania since I was craving pho and wanted an inexpensive dinner. We ordered a bowl of pho and the nem nuong, since a few people have reviewed it very well. I'd never had nem nuong before and I really enjoyed it. To be fair, if you pour enough nuoc cham on a phone book, I'd probably eat it. The food was delicious and came out quickly. It was a little more expensive than most Vietnamese places, but the quality seemed to make up for it. 

The service was very good and the whole place looked and smelled like an old Asian person's house.. Asian spices, mothballs and incense with a whiff of air freshener. It transported me right back to being 7 and eating lunch at my friend's mom's house."
4,"Burritos as big as your head! This corner shop in a tiny little shopping center with a shawarma restaurant and Chen's Noodle House is a blend of Mexican fast food, convenience store and bong shop. 

While the store looks drab and dingy on the outside it was a pleasant surprise to step inside and see that while it was a bit cramped from stocking as much as they could in a small space, everything was very tidy and well kept. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that there is good A/C and ventilation here for such a small space selling freshly grilled greasy gustatory delights. No need to worry about emanating eau de burrito after ordering here!

The menu here has a mix of Mexican food and some American classics like burgers and chicken wings. I was craving a breakfast burrito so I ordered that with chicken. It's basically a regular burrito but they stick a few griddled eggs in it. After the huge tortilla, meat and eggs were cooked on the griddle, I got to choose my fillings. Selections include pico de gallo, cilantro, onions, 3 different salsas, sour cream, corn, cheese and lettuce. The cook then wrapped it all up. My jaw dropped when I saw the size of my mega burrito. It barely fit into the styrofoam container! I was curious so I weighed it afterwards, along with a pasiano burrito we also ordered. The chicken breakfast burrito was over 1.5 lbs and the paisano burrito was nearly 2 lbs! 

The taste was pretty good. They pack so much stuff in that tortilla! Unfortunately the corn I requested was scooped into my burrito with all the liquid it was sitting in so it ended up being a bit soggy when I ate it at home, and got soggier over time. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the chicken was a very generous portion though. 

The other nice aspect of this shop is that it's open until 2 AM, so go get your late night giganto burrito here!"
4,Yummy burgers!  Good crispy fries.  Nom nom nom.  The custard was equally delicious.  Be sure to save room.
4,I went there last night with the wife and was seen within 20 minutes!!!  Great service and the staff seemed to care. A lot better than other ER's I had been in before.
4,"Went here for a surprise 2 Kids 1 Hall dress rehearsal show. I won't critique the show itself, which was pretty damn funny, if still very much a rehearsal, but I will say that the venue was great. Hidden away just down the street from 'the New York Gentleman's Club' (how much do you want to hang out there with Tony and Pussy et al?) this nondescript club has the air of being a real comedy gem; the kind of place where lots of Toronto comics paid their dues. Is that even true? Comedy aficionados will be able to speak to it more than I - but if *felt* that way.

Ticket booth was on the left hand side after descending the stairs and ahead is a spacious bar with another sitting/mingling area off to the right. Beer was fairly priced and if you showed up Sunday-Thursday pitchers were crazy inexpensive (for a comedy club). Pitchers of Amsterdam mind, so guaranteed hangover, but pitchers of beer nonetheless.

The venue turns over between each show, or at least did the night we were there, so a door beside the ticket booth opens up and everyone pours out into the bar. This means that if you come for a show, you can come for just that show without watching an hour of crummy opening acts and still get good seats.

The actual show space is small but cozy - lending itself well to making you feel comfortable laughing really hard and getting engaged with the show.

All in all a great experience. A bit outside of my regular bubble, but maybe that's part of the charm. I'd definitely advise people to check it out."
4,"Halal meat is served here, per signs on the restaurant. Went here recently for lunch after Jummah.  Tight space inside for seating.  Tried the ""Juicy Lucy on Fire"" which is a Halal Beef Patty stuffed with Mozarella Cheese and Jalapenos.  Also had Poutine on the side. Everything was very good.  The only thing which was slightly off was the bun, it was not strong enough for all the toppings and juiciness so got pretty soggy at the bottom.  If they are able to get better (stronger) buns, then this would be a near perfect burger!  The prices are a little on the high side, but the burgers are huge, so you do get your money's worth."
4,"One of my go to places for takeout for a quick dinner when I am not in the mood to cook!  The flavor is always good and consistent and the size of the big bowls are great I always have leftovers for my lunch the next day.

I love the large Beef Bowl with Veggies I also love to add the crushed peppers and a little bit of soy sauce.   My boyfriend likes the mixed bowl so he gets the Chicken, Beef and mixed veggies.  On a very hungry day we will add the Gyoza.  None of this is gourmet it is a fast food place but for a filling good flavored dinner it is perfect.

The staff is always friendly and fast with the service and the food. This will continue to be a great, fast take out dinner place for me!"
4,"They've only been open a month, but I think it might be a Yonge Street Keeper. You really can't beat the $4.99 price for a beef burger. For that price, it was darn good; it had the perfect juicyness and moistness. My stomach didn't feel overly heavy after eating it. Apparently their burgers are a lot healthier than most places and they use extremely high quality product. 
The fries weren't half bad either. I have had better elsewhere, but they give you a ginormous portion for just $3.99. Seriously, I should've shared my ""small"" fries.

The boss guy is so nice and talkative. He took the time to explain what he uses in the burgers and the importance of quality. He seems to really know his stuff and I sense that he is quite experienced with the food/restaurant industry. He was patient with me and my friends as we ordered too.
(Gluten-free people: they offer gluten-free buns)

I will definitely be back :)"
4,Food was great!  Manager needs to get a handle on the wait staff.  I sat at the bar for a hour and watched three waitresses literally do nothing but complain to each other while doing no work.  You have one waitress bringing down the rest of the crew with the complaining.
4,"One of the best authentic vietnamese joints in town. Wish they had something like this in the East end where I live.

All food options (pho, com, bun) are excellent and flavourful and fast. Two people can get stuffed for under 20 bucks.

If you come not expecting impeccable service but simple tasty food at a great price you'll be a happy camper.

Rule of thumb when it comes to viet food: good if owner is viet, mediocre if owner is chinese-viet, and run away if owner is hongkongnese.
And stay well west of yonge."
4,The pho was pretty decent and it came out in less than 5 minutes. The broth was hot enough as well. Slightly more pricey than I'm used to compared to my usual spots in downtown toronto.
4,"Authentic Chettinad food! 

Chettinad, is a region of southern Tamil Nadu state in India, which is world famous for its culinary delicacies. The food is essentially spicy, with the usual full meal (thali) consisting of cooked dhal, eggplant (brinjal) curry, drumstick sambar (""kara kolambu"" is a highly regarded south Indian sambar), ghee for flavouring rice, and sweet dishes like payasam. You can get all of these from this restaurant, especially if you go for their buffet. 

The buffet includes tasty non-vegetation dishes as well... imo, the hot hot fish curry (if you don't mind burning your mouth) is awesome!

They have a good value lunch buffet (priced below $10) on every weekday (except on holidays)  from 11.30am to 3pm."
4,Great south Indian food. Parathas and curries are good. Surprising their Chinese is pretty good too. Certainly recommend it.
4,"Simple chain steakhouse. Not a knock on their food which is still great. Interior is a mock Texas style steakhouse (obviously) large interior though, they can accommodate plenty of hungry patrons. I went with my wife and sons we went at which was probably the busiest time on a Friday. There were about 10-15 other people waiting for tables when we made it in. We were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. It was only 5 due to how large the building is. They also have complimentary peanuts up front and at each table which is pretty cool. 

Upon being seated we quickly met our server who brought us their tasty buttery dinner rolls. The rolls come with this, sweet cinnamon butter spread which was delightful. We all enjoyed especially my younger son. They have a pretty sizable children's menu as well. Which we ordered a hot dog for my older son and the steak tips for my younger son. I went old fashioned and got a burger and my wife ordered a ribs and steak combo. Their ribs were great, and the burger definitely had an excellent beef flavor. It definitely had a great juicy hand prepared taste in it. And my goodness the steak tips that my son had? He devoured them. He yelled at me because I was taking too long giving him his meal. 

This hadn't been my first time at Texas Roadhouse, but it had been my first time in my adult life. I honestly don't remember them being this good when I was younger. Maybe I was just a picky eater. But it's a great place for families, and they even great birthday parties very well... I say this because for some reason, the day we went there just happened to be 3 people celebrating birthdays. So we heard YEEEHHHAAWWW a couple of times. It's cool though, they actually care that someone says to them ""Hey it's my friends birthday today"""
4,Very good steaks! Place is always busy but they turn the tables quickly. Always have had a great experience.
4,"Karaikudi has a special place on our weekly roster thanks to their Fried Fish (King fish). Wifey loves it and doesn't share! :(

Our server is a pleasant guy (every time the same person) and dumb that I am sometimes, I always forget to take his name.

The places itself is nestled away in comfortable area with plenty of parking and on weekends there's a wait. 

Food itself is appealing. Standard items like Dosas, Idly, Vada and appetizers are fairly good. We recently tried Kothu Roti which was very filling and worth every penny. The Mutton Biryaani is one the best in eastern hemisphere so give it a shot.

They recently upgraded and now they take orders on a tab. Adds to the glamour quotient. I know, I'm a sucker for technology!"
4,"Absolutely delicious sandwiches. I still have pleasant memories of my Capastrami...loaded with pastrami,swiss cheese,russian dressing and cole slaw. yummy! My son really enjoyed his Italian and my wife loved her turkey on whole wheat. The ingredients really taste fresh and the bread was excellent. The ladies working here were friendly enough and seemed very efficient. Very solid sandwich shop."
4,"Our go to Pho place, we order for pick up and call ahead and they are very quick. Have moved out of the area but can't find another Pho that compares."
4,"This is the ever-changing restaurant as I would call it. It seems as though every single restaurant that takes up this space fails to last. This space once was some sort of western style restaurant, then it turned into a AYCE sushi place, eventually into an a la cart sushi restaurant and now finally a HK Style Cafe. It's almost like this space is cursed.

Anyhow with the history lesson aside let's begin! My disclaimer is that I never had great expectations prior to going in and you shouldn't either. The very idea of HK Syle Cafe equates to affordable and decent tasting food that is served fast. And with that I believe this place delivers. I won't say the food is mind blowing in any way but it does the job. Some dishes are strong (like stir fried noodles and rice) while others are a bit weak (baked rice, soup noodles..etc) but what this place does have is variety. The menu is vast and very creative with enough variety to satisfy anyone. Another plus is the affordability; you get enormous portions for Scarborough prices. As if that's not enough of an incentive, they offer all guests a free dessert at the end of your meal. The desserts they serve are not the rejects either (unlike most places where they serve those red bean/green bean porridge crap that noone touches).

The service is attentive and pleasant the last few times I have been there. No complaints. I just hope this one is here to stay and break the string of bad luck this space has endured.

If you're hungry and need your HK Cafe fix, stop by."
4,"Really love the food here! I was a HUGE fan of Valdez until it closed, so when I heard that the same group is opening up Baro I thought PERFECT! A continuation of Valdez! to be honest, just not the same. Different vibe all together and I found the menu to be better at Valdez. But still the food here is great; creative and fresh. Will definitely return!"
4,"If you haven't been before, Sierra Gold is a upscale version of the PT's you find everywhere else in the valley. There are a couple locations around town but each spot is a pretty consistent experience.

The first thing you will notice about Sierra Gold is that the place is huge. There is a massive bar along with several dining tables and high tops to accommodate a party of any size. Plenty of TVs around the walls and even in the bathroom mirrors make it a great place to catch the game. 

SG gets extra points for the fact that you can reserve out a little spot for a small party all to yourselves. I came in with a group of around 25 people and it was great to have our own area sectioned off with appetizers and assigned servers. The pub is also a bit more upscale that your average PTs but still has the same prices and specials. It does get busy during happy hour (5-7pm and 12-2am) especially on the weekends."
4,"Overall I liked this place, it's a sports bar so expect it to be loud!  I decided to have appetizers for my dinner because I wanted to try a couple of different things.  I had the small order of bee sting wings and the sloppy Joseph waffle fries.  The waffle fries were outstanding, the flavor combination of the sweet sloppy Joe with the spicy jalapeños and queso was a winning combination.  The wings were average, good but nothing special.  I was disappointed with the blue cheese, it was very runny and thin with no chunks of blue cheese to be found.  I am looking forward to coming back and trying some of the entrées."
4,"I've been dying to try out Baro and my dinner went even better than I dreamed it would! The last time I came here, we didn't make reservations so we had to go up to the lounge area (still pretty awesome). It was a ladies night type dinner for my group, so we decided to go all out on the menu. We ordered the tradito ceviche, chips & guac, duck confit chaufa, picada and pulpo. Everything came out like a quick fire! I was so impressed on how fast the first dish made it to our table with a full house of diners. 

I LOVE chips that aren't just your regular potatoes. Here they use purple yams, taros and all sorts do root vegetables served with fresh salsa and guac. Even if you're in the upstairs lounge, you HAVE to order one of these!

Pretty much everything we tried was beyond expectations. The pulpo was so tender and flavourful, the tradito ceviche was beautifully plated as well as refreshing. The duck confit chaufa is a MUST experience here! I was wow-ed by the size of that rice bowl when it landed on our table. Seriously, a much larger portion than you would expect, pictures do not do it justice. There's a whole flavour trip with these dishes, so you need to come try them yourself.

The only personal thing I would say is to not order the picada if you can't handle it. You really need to be in a big appetite mood and on a cheat month to order it! The menu states it clearly it's everything you want to indulge in (deep fried wings, GIANT PIECES OF PORK BELLY, croquettes). It's really good but definitely have the capability first to order it! 

One thing I love about Baro is how bright and refreshing the space is. This isn't your typical dimmed lighting dining space, this is a well lit and fun dinner space. It almost feels like you're eating on a patio with beautiful plants but you're really inside a narrow restaurant.

I've tried two cocktails here and I have to say the prices are worth the splurge. I've had the mojito ($10) and five flower ($15). The mojito was ordinary but the five flower had such depth and indescribably rich flavour to it. Come for an excellent dinner and stay for a fun night upstairs!"
4,"Had my favorite smothered chicken and it was righteous, yet again.  Have you tried it yet?"
4,"When we arrived on Friday night we didn't have a reservation and we were 6 people. The restaurant was busy but the manager and hostesses accommodated our group with a smile.

After being seated the service, drinks and food were just as impressive. When I go out it's usually with clients so I don't have too many opportunities to visit in spots. This was a nice change of pace. 

I would definitely return and recommend this restaurant to others."
4,"Very good service and variety of foods you can get from what you paid for. If you want a decent hotspot experience, this place will satisfy you"
4,Best thing about this place is the call ahead seating. We had virtually no wait! The cinnamon butter bread was on point. Service was good and the waiter even got us a free appetizer for buying a spare cut of meat. My only real complaint is that the side dishes are truely an after thought! But this place is purely about the meat and on that end the delivered!
4,"YOU CAN PUT YOUR NAME ON THE LIST WHILE YOU'R STILL AT HOME! So much for wait times lol. But seriously they allow you to call ahead and put your name on the list and avoid the wait, which is super convenient for people with children who cant be without paw patrol for 5 minutes!

But okay to the food!

Arrived on a packed friday night, no meat for lent my booty! this place was PACKED. Surprisingly we got seated right away. They actually have this really awesome system that lets the hostess know when a table has received their check to speed up wait times. Very cool very cool.

Bloomin' onion for the win. Ours came out perfectly fried with the horseradish sauce to compliment it. They also give you endless bread rolls with this pretty tasty cinnamon butter spread.
I ordered a steak and rib combo, complete with cheese and bacon fries. it took 35 minutes to come out, and by this time i was annoyed because other tables around me who had gotten there well after me received their food before me.

Pricing wise it is your standard franchise menu, $15 for combo meals, full steaks were a little pricier but for fair market value.

Atmosphere was extremely loud, and they do this really annoying and over the top birthday thing like i literally had to cover my little ones ears. He has a sensory disorder and the restaurant should give people a heads up that this occurs otherwise it just ends with an upset toddler.

Staff was friendly and fast, the food was decent and exactly what you would expect from a franchise place."
4,"It was my first time at Morals last night, we had been wait for 1 hr for the table. The food was average, would go back if I'm in that area again."
4,Pretty good food. Service is great. Went there on opening day and for a lounge experience on the second floor. It was packed and quickly got claustrophobic. Getting a drink on the second floor is a battle when it gets packed. Would come here for food but not for anything else in the future till it's run a little bit better.
4,"Best Chinese food in Madison. Orange beef is great. Can be crazy at peak hours. Capacity of the place is high, but the front of the house and back get overwhelmed. The gas station next-door must be affiliated because you can buy chinese food items there too. Like BBQ pork etc."
4,"3.5 stars here. 
Tandori chicken was really good! The spicy chicken dipped in cooking yoghurt made me crave for more. 
Extra large 'crepe like thing was ok. Wasnt a fan of the dips that they offered with it. Though loved the presentation and crisp of the crepe. 
Mango lassi was delicious too.
Rasmalay was great though my gf didnt like the texture too much. Expensive though for 2 pcs$5
Service was slow, there was only 1 server/hostess when we arrived. 2 more staff cane after , spacious and clean looking place. Worth going 
Collect point of every dollar spent. $200 =$-10 . 

Would go back to try other items."
4,"I've had my work Truck in here a few times.  They are reasonably priced and all the work on the truck is still going strong a year later.  They overhauled the AC with a new compressor, condenser, orifice tube and various other bits.  Nice and cool in the truck now.  

I dropped off the truck with an electrical problem with the blinkers that they couldn't solve in a day and a half.  They were very busy and I had to have the truck back the next day.  They really just didn't have enough time.  They told me what they had discovered so far and didn't charge me.  I took it home and found the problem after two hours of digging.  To be fair they had eliminated half the areas for me to look.  I'm confident they would have fixed it if they would have had the proper time.

They are honest and do good work.  I fix alot on my own vehicles but will take them here when I don't have a lot of time."
4,"New renovation, beef and lamb are excellent. Must try. However it's pretty pricy especially for Weekend. $2 extra, and soup is extra cost too For the hotpot. For two people you are looking at 80$+. Also they don't take credit card, make sure you bring enough cash or have enough funds in your debit."
4,"We were staying at the Boulders and in the mood for Chinese food.  I checked it out on Yelp and the Sesame Inn came up.  We actually walked over from the Boulders and were seated right away.  We started with potstickers and then I moved on to an egg roll and chicken with string beans - it was absolutely delicious.  I am actually craving this dish as I write this review.  Next time we stay at the Boulders, we'll definitely be back!"
4,First time here and it was very delicious!  I expected the waffles to be a lot crispier but overall the meal was pretty tasty.
4,Some good stuff. We were visiting Red Rock and decided to try this place. I remember the bread was soft and good flavors.
4,I have to say that my first experience with capriottis was not a good one. Not necessarily a bad one either but it didn't make me want to come back again. I have to say I am glad I gave it another try. My first visit was just not impressive. The food was ok but I could have made a better sandwich at home is honestly what I was thinking. But this last time I went. I had a philly cheese steak sandwich. Yum! Gotta say I liked it. And I am super picky about my steak sandwiches. Prolly because they first time I had a Philly was when my bf's grandpa made them with some really expensive steak. I was spoiled and ruined for any other philly I ate there after lol anyways although it was not even comparable to the philly my bf's grandpa made it was still quite good :)
4,"This place is delicious. We love the bread and the kothu roti please the restaurant is nice and clean. One down thing is the service, it is terrible"
4,Food was better than expected. Customer service was great considering they only had two people. The two ladies were very attentive and helpful. Can get rather pricey though if you're not drinking the drinks that are on special.  Will definitely return. If nothing else because they have Stella on draft. LOL
4,"Julep is a new fusion/southern spot on E Washington, along with a couple other new spots. 

It's in a nice hallway-like venue with A-OK and Barolo. So it's pretty awesome if there is a wait since you can just pop into these business next door and even bring your drink with you when your table is ready!

The setup is not what you would normally expect with what comes with a southern diner (this is not a diner but a hip yet homely atmosphere). 

The drinks list is very well executed, with a wide choice of Bourbon and other spirits (port/sherry, etc). Very good southern-inspired cocktails as well. I tried the house julep with Rose Bourbon, mint and it was wonderful. 

The small plates and appetizers menu has very interesting/alternative choices. We tried the grilled oysters and pimento cheese which are nicely done with a lot of character. Tried the pot roast entrée, it's tender and juicy.

Definitely coming back to try the other dishes on the menu!"
4,Went in on a weeknight as I was craving for some hk style food and was in the neighbourhood. The menu had a huge selection on items which was good but it was very hard for me to choose since I wanted to try everything. Tried the chef recommendation which was the shrimp fried rice for $13 and it was good. The portion was ginormous which i had to take home as the waitress told me this can feed for 3 people. Also ordered the chicken skewers and they were alright. I really enjoyed everything about it except that it closes early. Will be back for round 2!
4,nice for those evenings when you just don't feel like cooking.
4,"Brunch opening week. Tried their pancakes and the Ranchero. The Ranchero had so much variety and was full of flavour! Their pancakes were MASSIVE!! Definitely to be shared. Perfect mix of 2 fluffy pancakes, queso fresco and guava sweetness! 

Both dishes were delicious! Our waitress was very attentive and helpful in providing recommendations. Love the atmosphere! Will definitely return for more."
4,"Just came for drinks before dinner.  Friends had reserved a booth on 2nd level.  Cool looking place, nice looking crowd.  Service was good, even though so busy.  Main floor is narrow and really busy and loud.  Glad I wasn't on that level."
4,"Great atmosphere & food. Absolutely love the 2nd floor lounge & workers there. Bartender in the speakeasy part (Escobar) refused to serve drinks to people who wouldn't start a tab (""I don't want to keep having to process one by one""). And wasn't keen on providing water to DD drivers (I guess for lack of tip). Disappointing and Strange, so that's why not 5*."
4,"Dumpling Restaurant (what a generic name!) is a must come everytime we're in TO. They have good sized portions, tasty food, and inexpensive! What more can you ask for?! 

We decided to get :
Kimchi Fried Rice 
Stir Fry Beef & Onion
Young Pea Shoots (super good!!)
Hot & Sour Soup
Potstickers
Assorted Steamed Dumplings

Everything was solid - customer service is typical for an Asian place and enough parking to go around!"
4,"Great place for wings, chili bowl, burgers. The bar staff is amazing. They stay on top of all their customers even when the bar is full. Great atmosphere. Everyone seems to be having fun. Bathrooms are clean and well stocked. Good place to come for football."
4,"Sooooo good!! I'd give them 5 stars but the service was quite slow for a Thursday afternoon. The food was worth the wait, though, and our server was super sweet. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with the spinach and goat cheese style option - wow it was delicious! My chicken was a bit more burned on the outside than I would have liked, but I pulled off some of the pieces and was able to enjoy it none-the-less. The hubs got the foot long hot dog southern style which he inhaled. We both got the pasta salad side which was very good - lots of veggies and lightly dressed so it's not your typical pasta salad (at least from a Jersey perspective). I liked this place a lot and wish we didn't have to rush to the airport to return home - I would have happily stayed for another round of drinks and maybe even dessert. Thank you, Yelp, for pointing this place out! We wouldn't have known about it otherwise."
4,"This place gets super busy even at 9pm on a Sunday! They serve large portions for very reasonable prices. $8 for 14 dumplings, $7 for veggie plates that typically cost $9+ at other places, wow amazing. Service is pretty standard, we had no problems and our food came reasonably fast. Tons of large tables too, so it's great for groups. Be aware, it is cash only!"
4,"Mayworth is a classy edition to the Cramerton area. The space has been resurrected in an all new exciting way. Rich, dark woods everywhere you look. Mid sized bar and a ton of flat screens. Best of all are the beer selections that include rotating seasonals from NODA, Triple C, and Sugar Creek on tap, plus an extensive list of bottled beer. Lots of great appetizers, including mussels steamed with chorizo, garlic and fresh basil. There's a really neat build your own salad section. Looking forward to trying the burger with Mac and cheese with bacon next visit!!! Yes they put it on the burger!! The Beef on Weck also looks killer!!"
4,"I'm usually a fan of all Sierra Gold/PT locations.  They have great specials and although you are able to smoke there, it's not a smokey place at all.  

Tonight we visited this place to finish off the birthday extranvaganza.  Our server was Rachel.  She was super sweet and made our experience tonight, a good one!  It was awesome that she had our best interest in mind.  For instance, I ordered a vodka soda with a lime.  She said that for $0.50 more, you can get Belvedere vodka instead of the well brand.  

We also got the italian sausage pizza for $16.99 (half off after midnight).  There was a lot sausage on the pizza, and the crust was thin and crunchy.  Always a fan.  Topped with ranch and I've got a great meal.  

To end my birthday extranvaganza, Rachel bought our whole table Washington Apple shots.  Every place I've been this weekend has given me a nice birthday surprise, and Sierra Gold was no different.  Thanks for a wonderful end to my birthday extranvaganza!!"
4,"The food we tried was VERY GOOD and VERY ABOVE AVERAGE and I am sure to return. This restaurant has five star potential.

I liked that they serve you complimentary hot tea with your meal.

The menu is somewhat assorted Asian and offers many Chinese Favorites, some not so common Chinese, some Thai and a few other Asian dishes. The pricing does run on the high side and portions that we had were small but the food we tried was VERY GOOD and was close to authentic style and this is a rare find!

I had the Spicy Chicken and Cucumber Salad. The moist tender white meat chicken was poached to perfection and the cucumbers were carefully deseeded and trimmed. They were in a tasty not too spicy gingery, garlicky sauce. This was a delicious refreshing light meal. It reminded me of a Chinese/Hawaiian dish I tried called Cold Ginger Chicken that this dish was very similar to.

My husband had the Szechuan Spicy Beef. The beef was very tender and had been twice cooked. This dish had some heat but wasn't as spicy as Szechuan. The sauce was close to  authentic style and lacked sweetness and the thick texture that your used too in Americanized Chinese Food. This dish was very good.

I was expecting just ok but was pleasantly surprised to find a very good restaurant that serves up very good Asian Food.

This place might be a gem!"
4,"Our son moved into RP late Aug. 2015 from out of state.  I found Mandy to be most helpful in providing us all the information prior to actually seeing the place.  I was a little concerned about having to pay a full month's rent when he didn't actually move in until the last week in Aug. and hope that they would consider a pro-rated plan in the future.  I also would prefer not to have to sign a full year's lease, in case he needs to move out or if he decides to come home for the summer, we will still have to pay through July.  When we arrived to see the place we were pleasantly surprised that they include a free shuttle (which they plan to expand to other locations besides the campus soon, yea!), and that they had a very nice pool, fitness center, conference rooms and even computers with printers, in addition to having your own private bedroom and bathroom.  Everything looked very clean and was well presented.  We were able to take a tour of the ""model units"" however, I do wish they would have explained a few things prior that I will share with you.  It would be helpful to know in advance that there is no TV provided in the units (even though they are fully furnished this is one item that does not come with it).  Also, even though they do include Wi-Fi, you still need your own router and for the most part a good one that will allow you to stay connected etc. will run you close to $100.00.  The down side to this was we were not able to see his unit prior to signing our lease agreement, and they need to give the current tenant 24 hour notice that you will be moving in.   Once inside the unit I have to say I was a shocked because the common area that they share was very dirty.  Now, I do need to note that our son's 1 roommate was still living here but had gone home for the entire summer vacation, so he was not aware of this, and apparently 2 of the old roommates had moved out and left the place a mess.  The issue was that somehow the unit was not properly inspected after the move out and we came into a mess.  The good news is I contacted the property manager, Desiree and discussed everything with her.  She diligently made sure that each and every items was addressed.  Yes, it was an inconvenience to have to have my son move in and then work around the cleaning etc., but it did get done and Desiree made sure we were properly compensated for our troubles.   Desiree is new to RP, but not new to this industry and has been a property manager for over 13 years.  She knows what she is doing and is working very hard to make this place a safe, comfortable place to live in.  She has already made changes to security and has been working with her staff so that the correct policies are in place.  Her responses to both email and phone calls are quick and she has excellent follow through skills.  I am giving RP 4 stars only because of the problems we encountered during the initial move in, but feel confident that this will not be continuing now that Desiree is there and making the appropriate changes.  If you do have any issue I recommend you come to her to discuss them before posting on Yelp as I sincerely believe Desiree does care and will address each one with you and will work hard to make sure to take care of anything that needs adhering too."
4,"This is probably like your typical pho place. Standard food at standard prices! Great place to drop by if you're in the area for lunch or dinner. Extremely affordable and reasonable prices. 
Large selection of noodles, vermicelli, rice etc. We ordered a viet coffee on ice and it came in a take out cup.. which is quite small and not filled up. I usually like it when it's in the individualized drip and when it's in a glass with ice and condensed milk. 
Staff are nice. 
Pay at the front and suggest to bring cash just in case.

Overall pretty standard pho place w no bells and whistles and just some good ole pho or bun ! Cheap and affordable eats!"
4,We had takeout tonight for the first time. The Food was excellent and the portions were large. Seasoned just right and lots of meat. Will definitely be back.
4,"Good food and drinks. Good vibe. Similar to Valdez, with some new items. A bit pricier. Have not checked out escobar yet, but I heard it's more of a scene now. My only criticism is that they don't call back or have a good reservation policy. I left messages twice and they went unanswered and they were really unaccommodating with a group reservation where they were insisting on a set menu for a group of 8 on a weeknight.   Would go back."
4,I've been going here since I was a little kid. In my opinion this is the best Chinese food in Madison. Good vegetarian options. My favorite is spicy garlic eggplant. Yum!
4,"What a find in quaint Cramerton! Our server, James had an awesome personality which made for a pleasant experience, however, the food is the star of the show! The house  made pimento cheese has just the right amount of heat and the Mayworth chips are scrumptious!"
4,"First time at Julie, Excellent food, beautiful venue and attentive staff.  The shrimp and grits, and fried chicken were delicious, along with great house cocktails."
4,"We stopped by for dinner tonight. We started with the lettuce wraps, which were very tasty. Then we ordered our entrees. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (Mayworth style) and my friend ordered a grilled chicken salad. Lots of very tasty options for sandwiches and salads (customizable). The real thrill was dessert. This eatery gets its desserts from Queens City Pastry. This is a great pub, with a great beer menu, and great food. The service is friendly, the food is good, and the atmosphere is inviting. We are sure to come back. Make sure to stop by and give it a try!"
4,"Hubby and I shared a large Bobbie - it was delicous but a cold sandwich that we both expected to be warm. Anyway, it was still tastey. We went to two different locations in Vegas and both seemed to be short handed which made service a bit slow. No other complaints!"
4,"3.5 stars

Not quite up to a 4 star, but pretty close to it.  I went to the restaurant and ordered take out in person.  I ran into a bit of the language problem Holly mentioned in her review but it wasn't a big problem.  We ordered asparagus chicken and Hunan beef.  I got the beef extra spicy.  Of course, my wife's was gringa--no spice to speak of in the asparagus chicken.  She liked her meal except the asparagus was a bit woody.  My Hunan beef was excellent and it had the extra spiciness I wanted.

I can see coming back here and now that I've ordered in person, I'd call and pre-order.  It's only a mile from home so it's no big deal.  The wait in person was about 10 minutes and I got 3 stars on two Angry Birds levels."
4,"Good, fast and affordable Vietnamese joint.  Speedy service and low prices make it an excellent lunch choice.  Large menu with not only lots of pho, but good choices of vermicelli dishes (bun) and rice dishes.  Not fancy, but hits the spot.  A large pho is only six bucks."
4,"We landed on Christmas Day and knew we had to eat in the airport.  I travel a lot for work and eat in airports too often.  

We got 4 different meals.  They were all fantastic.  The chicken was moist and tasty.  The waffle was perfect.  The hot sauce and syrup went perfectly.  

The price point was good.  The service was excellent.

Other is our group that took off from terminal 4 (we took off from terminal 2), went back to Lo-Lo's on their home.

Will definitely go back again."
4,"Recommended to me by my Viet friend as her favorite place. I couldn't disagree. When you visit the place is packed with Vietnamese families so you know the food is authentic. The pho itself is flavorful and they give you generous portions with lots of veggies. Prices are cheap too.

Food: 4
Service: 4
Ambience: 2
Overall: 4 of 5 stars"
4,"This is my second favorite HK style cafe for breakfast/lunch/dinner other then New city. This place is pretty consistent and their milk tea is on point.  That's what makes or breaks a HK style cafe. If their milk tea sucks,  then I won't be coming back.  But I give this place a thumbs up for their milk tea. Nice and strong. Couple be a little bit hotter though. 

Their afternoon tea menu has gotten better. I remember  when they first opened it was a bit lacking and the choices weren't as great. I noticed they improved it... I'm willing to try more. 

Overall, opens early and closes late for snacks. Great job!!! I will be a regular here."
4,"This place has great atmosphere and excellent tapas food.  The main dishes are ok but sharing the tapas dishes is really encouraged. I had a main, the chicken with avocado rice and I was really disappointed, especially for $32. It was really salty. The tapas however were excellent as were the churos for desert. After dinner we moved upstairs to the lounge which was ok but not amazing. The staff were friendly, especially in the restaurant downstairs. The place is very busy on a Saturday night though so if you go then expect to feel a bit rushed. All in all I'd go back for the tapas!"
4,"Wait is it Miami or Toronto?  On the inside you wouldn't know where you are.

Caught Baro last week during a business trip and loved the vibe.  We ordered pretty much all the small plates and they ranged from average (pork) to good (empanadas) to awesome (most of the other things).  The crowd seemed very ""look at me"" but still liked the scene.  Will definitely go back next time I am in town - hopefully when it is nicer and the roof is open.

We checked out the second floor lounge and it was loud and full of v-neck t-shirts.  Not my scene.

Interesting place overall."
4,"I wasn't expecting much, I have to admit. But every single item we ordered was really good. Better than I expected. Our service was good - the place was busy on a Saturday night - so maybe we didn't get as much attention as we would have liked (drink refills, etc). But I have to say the food was worth it, and the 'imperial garden' ambience of classic American based Chinese food made this much more of a grand experience than the hole in the wall places I'm used to in bigger cities!"
4,"They are located before the security check point  near Gate D,  so you can enjoy a meal before  your flight with friends or family (who aren't traveling). Chicken was better than expected and the service was fast. Greens were seasoned well with a little extra spice. The waffle was just average. It wasn't soggy though, so they must have addressed previous complaints. I came through Phoenix on a Friday evening around 5pm, so my review is based around that time frame. Definitely worth a return visit."
4,I've been here a couple of dozen times. Good food and value for the money. Friendly service. I'll be coming back until a sushi or thai place opens up in area.
4,"Only reviewing for lunch.  They have a smal lunch menu 18 items and all costing $6 or $7.  I had the kung pao 3 ways and it came with your choice of fried, steamed or chow mein and egg flower soup and some fried wonton skins with 2 kinds of dipping sauces.  It's your basic Chinese -American fare.  and well cooked and not greasy. The portion was decent and was good for lunch. The dining room is nice and clean and the service is good.  Not worth making a special trip for but decent if in Summerlin and they do deliver."
4,"I hate to sit here and say a chain like this has great steaks, but wow. Texas Roadhouse has impressed me. The steaks for the price (that is cheap AND includes 2 sides) is probably worth 5 stars. I've had the filet and the filet medallions here (see a trend?) and both were great and cooked just like they said they would be. The sides are big which I appreciate. The spiced rice that comes with the filet medallions is enough to convince me to order it again. Not to mention peanuts, a bread basket, three 3 oz medallions, rice, and two sides easily makes two meals out of one $20 entree.

Where they fall short? Crushed up peanuts all over the floor. They're always super busy so it can be hard to flag down your server (not an issue the past time I was here). I didn't care for their chili and would encourage a different side. Lastly it's a popular birthday destination and the ""YEE HAWs"" make me cringe, but hey, maybe that's just because I'm no fun. 

If you're looking for a great steak and not looking to break the bank or dress up for a fancy establishment I think you'll love this place."
4,"This place is my go to place for quick breakfast before work. Everyone want something quick and cheap! This is a plus, everything you think of Hong Kong style breakfast, this is the place. They offer many combinations for different dish, toast, noodle, pho and many more! Fair price and pair with milk tea is the perfect breakfast for the morning! They offer many different variety of dishes for every meal. Excellent customer service and helpful when ordering! Love coming here for those cheap eat, which is a plus for everyone!"
4,This is a great place for good food at reasonable prices. The ambience is basic. The staff is friendly and efficient. They offer takeout too. I have eaten there many times and not been disappointed.
4,"Neat sports bar/restaurant located smack-dab in the heart of Cramerton, a quaint southern mill town.  It exudes Americana.  Think Mayberry and you get the picture (sans Andy, Barney & Aunt Bea).

I've visited twice for lunch and both times was treated warmly with friendly staff, good food all at great prices.  My advice:  pull a seat at the bar, say 'hey"" to Bree, nurse a frosty and enjoy some well-prepared grub.  Me likes it!  Nice."
4,"The Sesame Inn is great.  It is tradition, old school chinese food.  Not all the hyped up, twisted things you get at other 'Asian' places around Scottsdale.  This place is down home.  I've had many different dishes here and always been satisfied.  It will taste like Chinese food you have had before in larger cities.  Hard to find around Scottsdale area.  Staff alway courteous and service is spot on.  They remove dishes from the table immediately and will get you on your way quickly if you want to go.  I could stay longer and have some more food though!!"
4,Good food and friendly staff.Ive always enjoyed myself here.Maybe I'll go again later this week hmm.
4,"A bit of an under-rated restaurant if you ask me! I go here because this place offers cheap, filling and good dumplings around the Agincourt area :) I've tried their chicken dumplings both steamed and pan fried, and the Korean pancakes and pork pot stickers too. All of the items were a generous serving size for an affordable price. A tad bit on the oilier side for the pancakes and pork pot sticker, but still good nonetheless. Definitely recommended for folks who are looking for a budget-friendly meal!"
4,"Dumpling restaurant, presumably, specializes in dumplings.There are a number of other dishes on the menu, including a set of korean dishes for some reason.

For the dumplings, the standard serving comes with 14 steamed pork dumplings starting as low as $5.99. Compared to other dumpling places I've been to, this is the best deal I've seen so far for cooked dumplings. They also have chicken, beef, and lamb options for a dollar or two more if you can not, or do not want to, eat pork.

There are a couple fried options, which were pretty good also.
If you're looking for some fried pancakes or beef rolls, I would also put in a few orders.

Service is quite under-staffed. There's one person behind the counter and one person managing the floor. If you need something you should just go up and ask for it. If you need refills on tea, you will need to ask for refills otherwise they will just walk right by.

We ordered a few non-dumpling dishes, but didn't find them particularly interesting. I would just go with dumpling night and get 10 plates of dumplings for a party of 6. Nothing beats sharing 140 dumplings between 6 people."
4,"I've come here on many occasions. In true HK cafe style, the menu is ginormous - classic Taiwan dishes, ramen, build-your-own noodle soup and of course, the HK classics. I decided to order none of these on this occasion and order the poutine. Unexpectedly delicious! The fries are exactly what you think - huge and super crispy in true Chinese restaurant fried style. The gravy was lighter than your traditional beef gravy and a little less salty which was nice for the body. The hot gravy + hot fries meant that the cheese curds were perfectly squeaky and perfectly warm. The milk tea here is also pretty decent and really a must have. This place does get pretty busy so expect a moderate wait if you're coming on the weekend!"
4,"I can't get enough of this place. It's my go-to hot pot restaurant in the area. 

Food - plentiful, diverse and high quality selection of meat, seafood, vegetables and sauces. Must have the deep-fried bun with condensed milk. I like spicy food but I find their broth filled with Szechuan peppers numb my mouth within 5 minutes. 

Service - attentive and quick."
4,Went about a month ago. Had the prime rib.  Loved it. 7 of us went we all had a good meal.
4,"In many respects China Tango is your typical neighborhood Chinese-American restaurant:  they have take-out/dine in, and the menu is immediately recognizable with all of the staples. 

What sets this place apart from everywhere else (especially Panda Express) is the staff , the quality of the food, and the exceptional lunch menu. 

Every employee we have encountered is absolutely wonderful and takes great pride in their service, appearance, and attitude. On my last visit we were seated behind a very typical  Summerlin family with a teenage twit  who felt it was her job to make sure everything was 5 star quality (""What do you mean this chicken isn't free range? Why don't you serve Bling water?"") and never once did the waitress lose a beat or let the level of service for the rest of her full section drop. 

I'm not sure what it is- perhaps a combination of the smell and ingredients that are higher quality than most neighborhood eateries- but the food here is simply amazing. We've been in about 5 times now and every dish has been delicious and perfectly cooked. My personal favorite is the mu-shu pork and my wife is a huge fan of the volcano shrimp (I have to disagree with other comments about the soup- it's great)

So, long story short- if you live in the area definitely check this place out! I would say it's even worth the drive if you live further out."
4,"We were running late after a day of tourist things...and we wanted to eat a good steak.  We tried SEVERAL places with a ton of stars, and you know what?  They close at ten, but won't seat you at nine.  I mean, really???????   So we settled on Texas Roadhouse who informed us on the phone that they seat until the minute they lock the door at ten. 

Wow, that's great.  AND the food was great.  Wish I had been able to take all I didn't eat, as I was so hungry I way over ordered.  Steak was cooked perfectly, and you'd be amazed how many folks can't make a rare steak.  Hubby loved his meal, and we both had an appetizer.  They brought us drinks promptly and refilled our rolls...oh did I mention the rolls?  Yummmmmmmmmmy.

Go, just go, it's great service from people happy to see you show up, not grumbling because you will make them stay late at work.  And it's great food.  Win Win...."
4,"Can't speak for the food, but the drinks were refreshing, strong, and delicious :) I really enjoyed the mix of hip hop and it was a friendly crowd"
4,"I work across the street and eat here at least once a week.  The food and the prices are great, sometimes the service is a little slow but that is typically during high traffic times like lunchtime so it is understandable.  Excellent lunch specials and delivery/pickup is available to order online.  Overall a great place for a quick and delicious lunch."
4,"This place is super trendy. The restaurant is decorated to be aesthetically pleasing with lots of greenery.

The prices are steep. I think to avoid having a scare when the cheque comes around, it's well worth to pick plates to share. We weren't that hungry so we got the chips and guacamole, a pitcher of sangria (which by the way can easily be split between six people), and the empanadas. The empanadas came in a cute paper brown bag - nice touch. 

It was very hot inside, distracting us from our conversations. But, it was a good time! Definitely a place to try in the summer."
4,"Nice Place for Indian food lover and Biryani lover :).  Visited with my friends. 
We have ordered Veg , Nonveg starters and Chicken Biryani and everything was really tasty.
Well all I can say is nice to have such South Indian restaurant in Toronto :)"
4,I have been going here for years and the service is always the best and the food is consistently good.
4,"I was first introduced to this sandwich place in 2009. A friend had urged us to go here before the end of our Las Vegas trip. I ordered the SlawBeJo: roast beef, provolone cheese, russian dressing, cole slaw and mayo...Yes, you read it, cole slaw. I think its the cole slaw that made this sandwich soooo good. Their bread is fresh too. I think the key to any good sandwich is the bread. I don't care how much stuff you put into a sandwich. If the bread sucks, you can best believe that the sandwich will too!

The other sandwiches that I've tried are the Cole Turkey and their Cheesteak. The Cole Turkey is just like the SlawBeJo, but with turkey instead. The cheesteak was forgettable."
4,"We finally found a Chinese restaurant worth going to over and over.  The service is attentive, warm and friendly.   The atmosphere and decor is beautifully designed. We ordered egg foo young, pork fried rice, wonton soup and sweet and sour chicken.  The food was delivered quickly and very flavorful."
4,"Decent Northern Chinese type of food.  Dumpings, pan cakes, buns, etc.. as well as some Korean dishes. 
Cheap and good dumplings. Leeks and Porks ones are my favourite there.  The Korean pork stew dish is quite good too, although wouldn't be a dish you'd eat in front of a date as it can be kind of messy.
Another one of my favourites is the tinfoil wrapped beef with onion pancake.
The service is fairly fast and the ladies there are friendly.  With their recent renovation, it makes the place feel much cleaner than before."
4,"Half off all breakfast entrees until 10 am!! Their steak and eggs is a solid, post-night out meal. They changed their breakfast potatoes; they're now a little thicker, not so crispy, so I get the fries instead. 

Update: Children are no longer allowed at Sierra Gold because of the liquor laws."
4,"Dumpling Restaurant is a very low-key establishment in an area that is a bit out of the way for commuters (Brimley and Sheppard), but the commute is well worth the trip.  Some may call it a ""dingy hole in the wall"", but beyond the old furniture, the few utensils that haven't been scrubbed hard enough, and the somewhat questionable washroom, it houses very delectable dumplings.

We came with a party of 7 and there were no difficulties with seating us.  We ordered chicken dumplings, bok choy dumplings, minced beef dumplings, pork dumplings, braised beef pancake wraps, the onion pancake, the spicy fish, and fried noodles with beef.  Aside from Chinese fare, this restaurant also serves Korean dishes, but I do not believe these will be on par with dishes served in K-Town.  

In terms of the dumplings, all types were steamed with the exception of the fried pork dumplings.  With regard to the variety that is available, you can order dumplings with pork, beef, chicken, zucchini, bok choy, seafood, chives, egg, and lamb.  As such, a meatarian, pescatarian, and vegetarian can enjoy these little gems.  Just keep in mind that half the assortment will have pork in them, as that is the main protein in most iconic dumplings, and even the vegetable dumplings (eg. bok choy dumplings, zucchini dumplings, and chive and egg dumplings) may still use a meat-based broth. I didn't get the chance to ask what the broths were made from for the vegetable dumplings and only turned a blind eye towards them when I was previously on a vegetarian diet.  If you have a vegetarian friend, this is something to chew on.  Most of the dumplings will be steamed and the only fried dumpling option is a general pork dumpling, but I am very certain that you can ask the chef to fry most of the dumplings  For the steamed dumplings, they ooze with delicious juices (broth) that titalize the taste buds - just remember to let them cool off a bit, lest you want to treat your taste buds to a premature death.  The fried dumplings also have a good volume of broth inside, but just in smaller amounts compared to the steamed versions. The wrappers have a pleasant texture to them; they were neither too soft nor too chewy while enveloping the decently sized chunk of filling inside.  For those who are wondering, the meat is cooked through and I have never come across a batch that was under-cooked.  Funny enough, my favourite dumpling here is still the bok choy dumpling, even when compared to its meaty counterparts now that I am no longer vegetarian.  What always surprises me is that the bok choy dumpling's broth has a certain mouth-watering ""milkiness"" to it.  Price to portion-wise, you get impeccable value: 14 dumplings for $4.99-6.99 before tax and tip.  if you need a comparison, most competing dumpling restaurants charge 2-3 dollars more for the same number of dumplings or for  fewer units.

Now, aside from the dumplings, I was a little disappointed with the braised beef pancake wraps because my old university friends raved about these all the time.  However, this was 2 years ago, so maybe they intentionally thin out the cuts of beef in the wraps now.  From what I heard about them, I expected the wraps to be flavourful, but all I received was a mouthful of carbs with small bits of marinated beef.   Additionally, the onion pancake was average, though large in portion size, the fried noodles were a little too oily, and the spicy fish that we received was actually fried fish with sweet and sour sauce.  I don't particularly enjoy sweet and sour sauce, so I'm sure you can guess which dish was my least favourite.  In all fairness, I implore you to opt for the dumplings only.  They could potentially make a friend who is underwhelmed by the meal do a 180. 

As for service, this is another unfortunate quality of this precious mom and pop shop.  The servers speak a mixture of English and Chinese (mainly Mandarin), so communication will not be too difficult, especially since customers have to write down their orders themselves.  However, the servers never checked up on us throughout our 2 hour meal.  This was not unexpected though because many smaller Chinese establishments tend to leave clients to themselves until they ask for assistance.  What really hit the nail on the head, however, was when I wanted to submit the orders.  You see, it doesn't look very good when I had to wave down a second server after the first completely ignored me (after she made eye contact with me and walked past my table twice).  To add to this, my friend said the same server rolled her eyes at him when he asked her for the bill.  We are not asking for our servers to go over the top with emotional labour, but we do appreciate polite responsiveness. 

Overall, the dumplings overshadow all the negative points of this establishment, hence why I am rewarding it with 4/5 stars.  I will definitely return, but I have my fingers crossed that that particular server will not be there next time."
4,"This is one of the best places for hotpot, I've been to many of them but it's not the cheapest.

It's located beside TNT Supermarket and there are plenty of parking spots available both outdoor and underground.

This place is more of a higher end hotpot restaurant, it's very clean for a Chinese restaurant, just watching the way they clean up their tables show how much they pay attention to details in terms of keeping everything clean.

Food selection is great, everything you ever wanted for a Chinese hotpot.  The one thing this place shines compared to other hotpot places is the quality of the food.  Shrimps and squids are good quality seafood items.  They also offer premium beef at extra cost, I believe they're Kobe beefs.  I loved their selection of sauces!

I was impressed with their willingness to bring out meat, a lot of hotpot places are cheap when it comes to meat but this place was amazing, non-stop lamb and beef."
4,"It's run by Sino-Korean from China (Harbin?).  The owner speaks very fluent Mandarin and Korean.  Most of the ""Korean"" dishes have hint of Chinese to it.  The ""wonton soup"" is similar to Korean  (dduk-guk) but with the Chinese dumplings.  I liked it.  And their  (cold noodle soup) is fairly good.  Actually it's awesome.  I never had anything like it before.  It's similar to ChosunOk  but different.   Can't quite place the taste but I am addicted it now.  We usually order the fresh noodle (kinda like jjolmyun - ).  (It costs $1 more, but woth it.)  As for the dumplings, they are fairly good.   Washroom is in the basement: not recommended. :(       for the value, it's prob best bang for the buck.  Nicely served dumplings in large bamboo steam trays.  They remind me of Korean run dumpling places in Harbin or near North Korean border.  Seafood soup was ok.  Ja-jang-myun () like dish was ok, but a bit too greasy for me.  Mostly I like their vegetable dishes...  Not your usual Korean Resturant in the GTA.   If you're expecting Korean Restaurant, try others...  but if you want some interesting Sino-Korean Fusion taste, this is the ONLY place I know in Toronto."
4,"This is really solid Americanized Chinese food. I live just about a mile away, so we get take-out every now and then. I honestly believe the low reviews are because of the fairly high prices. I do wish they would lower their prices--we would get take-out more frequently if they did because their food is good. Our last take-out order, we got the moo-shu pork, shrimp with vegetables, house fried rice, and one egg roll. Our total with tax was $40 (as for the reviewer who ordered for four and their total was $110 - they must have ordered a crazy ton of food. My family doesn't eat like pigs). This fed my family of four for dinner, and I had enough leftover for my lunch the next day (a big lunch too. I was stuffed). 

Quantities are not always very big. I love moo-shu pork, but they give you very little for $10. If you eat it in the restaurant, they roll it into only two pancakes and serve it like that. If you empty those two pancakes, it amounts to very little, but it's still very tasty. I also like to take my daughter here so we can sip tea while we wait for our meal. The ambiance is lovely.

Anyhow, if you need a Chinese fix, this is a good place, but be prepared to spend more than you would at your typical cheap Chinese place. The food is good, though, the decor charming, and the service friendly."
4,"Oh wow. The best fried chicken that I have had! It is not greasy, crispy on the outside yet the meat is not dry. Seasoning is not salty. The crispy skin just melts in my mouth. This chicken is perfectly fried. As for the waffles, they are crisp yet fluffy inside.

Now I look forward to layovers at PHX. It would be much better if Lolo's is located inside secured area."
4,"Last night was my 3rd time there, and it gets better each time. The Lemon Chicken was superb, and CT has become a favorite."
4,"We only ever go for their lunch special - so that's what this review is, I haven't yet gone here for dinner.

The dishes are a little hit/miss for authenticity. The Imperial Chicken is really good (not breaded like someone else said, but it's great), the sweet and sour chicken is definitely a ""miss,"" the mu shoo pork is great, although a tad greasy, the fried spring rolls are fantastic, the egg rolls are okay. 

The service is FANTASTIC and the price is unbeatable for what you get. We never walk  away from lunch hungry. I suggest getting there a little early for lunch (they open at 11am) because it can get a little crowded.

Also, I love their spicy mustard - you have to try it!!!"
4,"A group of us went to this restaurant on the weekend to take advantage of their ""pay-once-eat-twice"" anniversary promo. We could smell the delicious food as we drove up, even though our windows were closed. Conversely, despite the mouth-watering aromas that greeted us, we didn't actually smell like cooking when we got home, so their ventilation must be really good. Our server was a really nice genuine guy. For 6 people it ended up being about $30/person (a la carte) so it was a little pricey compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to. But the decor is nice, they play all the popular Tamil music and the food was all very yummy. I would recommend this restaurant if you're jonesing for some authentic Chetinnad cuisine :)"
4,"Came here for breakfast. I often come here on the weekendbfor breakfast so coming in on a weekday was interesting. 

Firstly, I love how big it is! This helps with the ventilation. I hate smelling like teppanyaki so having this giant space really helps that smell not to be woven info every fabric I'm wearing that day. 

Second, I know that this is not exactly revolutionary but for a cha chahn tang (???) it was a step ahead. They have a little machine on each table so you can press the button to order, get a bill, cancel an order, and something else. It makes things really efficient because once you press it, it makes a little chime sound at the ""control station"" and they send someone over. If you wanted the bill and you're in a rush, this could help cut down on the time. 

Anyway. We ordered 3 breakfasts for the 2 of us. Their potatoes were absolutely fab. Yeah they're fried but they still taste naturally potato. Breakfast sausages were delicious and not drowning in oil. Yum! 

This place has my favourite preserved egg and pork congee. They only have it for breakfast time (why not all the time?!). They have a lot of toppings, the congee is thick enough so you're full, but it isn't like you're eating congealed slime. The congee has a lot of the preserved egg and pork taste but WAIT. 

What's spectacular is that the toppings actually taste like what they are supposed to be! Usually when you make congee with toppings, the congee had all the flavour but the toppings do not. BUT this place had one of the best congee ever. Everything had taste. 

Definitely recommend the congee and pan fried rice roll breakfast combo. Also the one with potatoes and breakfast sausages. They give you 3 links. 

One star taken off because service was average for cha chahn tang. Food was delicious."
4,"I like this place. Good food, great lunch specials, they have boba, nice modern atmosphere. Yeah service isn't amazing, but it doesn't bother me. I'm well travelled & used to this in Asian businesses. People complaining about the service have not experienced real Chinese customer service. This is the norm - I guess experience is all relative."
4,"Ventured here with a Groupon after seeing decent reviews on Yelp, I decided to purchase this and give it a try. It is usually a hit or miss with Indian cuisine or so I've noticed at least. 

I dined here with a friend for lunch and there was a pretty good crowd in there although the outside appearance is deceiving. We were greeted and the server was very friendly, I believe the manager or owner came by and asked us if it was our first visit here and inquired if we had any questions in regards to the menu. Very friendly!

We got the Butter Chicken and Aloo Gobi Masala as I tend to stick on the vegetarian side when I am eating Indian food. The food was very tasty and flavourful. The overall price of the meal was fairly decent for the quality of the food, this is a hidden gem for Indian food. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."
4,"Dumpling Restaurant is a fan favorite of locals. In truth neither the food or service is exceptional, but the homeliness of a family-owned small restaurant keeps us loyal folk back for more. Not to mention competitive prices! I always order the same thing: kimchi fried rice and the pork and chive dumplings. Lemme tell you why.

Pork and chive dumplings are solid. You get 14 juicy dumplings of good size. The shell is a little thick and very slightly rubbery. But you won't see me complaining, you do get 14. 14!!!!

The kimchi fried rice is good. Will not blow you away but definitely worth ordering each visit. Real kimchi flavor, shreds of meat and lettuce. Hands down the best rice option on the menu.

If you're accustomed to paying $10.00 for 6 dumplings, be at peace to skip out. But if you're trying to eat well while balling on a budget, EAT HERE."
4,"I was indecisive when studying their menus. They have so so so many choices. I am not exaggerated. Definitely true. It is a great menus which overwhelmingly cause people like me indecisive or mind changing on food orders. It makes you wanna return again for other choices.  Love this part as we customers have more options.  

My Kitchen is an authentic HK style tea and food restaurant. Afternoon menu start at 230pm, small portion for noodle in soup for hungry lady like me. I really like their red bean French toast, I can only find it from here.

Definitely a wonderful addition of HK style tea house in Markham.  I love it spacious and order buttons so you don't have to wave your hand or scream out loud. :) love their French toast thick one . They did a good job and make me return 2x at least . One star lost because from my visit history their size of any afternoon tea set soup noodle is always smaller  than other regular items and the quality of ho fun can be improved. I rather spend a regular price for a decant size of noodle.  

Try their French toast with red bean from the afternoon set menu, it is my favorite not overly sweet. Their Milk tea are okay. not better and worse. It is generally an acceptable cheap eat place and adequate service. The greeter from the bar is always so welcoming as soon as you walk in ( if the young man is working) :)"
4,"Imperial Garden is good.  It's not life-alteringly good.  You won't tell your grandchildren about it, but if you want a reasonably good Americanized Chinese sit-down meal for a reasonable price in the middle of an upscale Madison suburb, with an understanding of the limitations inherently provided by that context, you'll probably enjoy this place.  It's not the most authentic food ever, it's not the best decor you'll ever see, but it's good and it's consistent.  

The good:

1.  I love the servers here.  They're a hoot.  Everyone I've ever had.  They all take the job pretty seriously, and that's actually kind of cool.

2.  The vegetable egg rolls.  When you get a veggie egg roll at Panda Express or something, the wrapper is usually crappy, and it's tiny, and the filling is mushy and weird.  The veggie egg rolls here are amazing, and I can see a point in my life where I just crack and eat like four of them as a meal.  I'll probably have to remember to ask for extra sauce and mustard when this day eventually arrives.

3.  Most of the food.  I've been unhappy with one of the five entrees I've tried here, and I wouldn't order it again (the fragrant pork wasn't spectacular), but by and large, given the contextual specifications above, this is really good.

The bad:

1.  The menu's a little bit repetitive, and isn't as big as it seems.  A lot of protein swaps in otherwise identical dishes.

Overall, I definitely plan on going back."
4,"After driving by this restaurant many times, we decided to go in. Should have done so a long time ago. The service was friendly. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The kairali chicken was moist and juicy with just the right amount of heat. The ghee dosa was huge! We also ordered the mutton curry and shrimp biriyani. Everything was great but the price might have been a little higher than other restaurants in the area. Will definitely go back though."
4,"Dumpling Village really suffering from identity crisis!! Is it a Korean Restaurant, not really. There are mostly Northern Chinese items on the menu like dumplings. Is it a Northern Chinese restaurant, not really There are a lot of Korean dishes  in the menu like pork bone soup, cold wheat bucknoodle soup, kimchi and bean sprout as appetitizers.

The only Korean characters are the 3 on their business sign in the front..and all the rest are in Chinese and English. All the wait staffs here speak Mandarian and even most of the patrons are Chinese.

It is located in a really tiny strip mall.. with limited parkings! To tell you the truth I am in the area for over 10 years I never notice it until I read the reviews on yelp! 

We arrived around 6 pm on a Saturday. The restaurant was almost full.  The tables are not really packed together, so you still have a certain degree of privacy at least I cannot tell what the table next to me were eating.

We decided on my favourite chives and pork dumplings, kimchi fried rice and Korean cold bucknoodle soup. They are all $4.99. 

The cold noodle soup is so so good! Nice and refreshing! and the soup based is a little sour and it really stimulate your tastebuds and just make you want to eat more! (I can finish it all myself! I don't want to share! I want one all for myself next time!)

The kimchi fried rice.. hmmmmm not good! A little on the oily side. There are not much taste, not spicy enough? We could not finish it and end up have to pack it all to go...(not even sure I will eat it, but cannot just let it all go to waste)

The dumplings arrived last! But it really worth the wait! 14 big fat hot dumplings filled up the whole steamer! Yes I counted them 14 of them for $4.99. They are all freshly made, freshly steamed! The skin is nice and thin, not chewy and thick! Oh so delicious! One bite and all the soup are ozzing out! But if they are not burning hot, you can just stuff the whole thing into your mouth and let the soup and favour just explosed in your mouth. 

Just a warning. If you going out on a date, please don't come here. Even it is a good place for a cheap date, our bill was $18 for 2 and we were full! But the place can be noisy, the food too good and your date will be too busy eating and just ignore you! Or you will keep eating and eating and you freak all your friends out!

The services here is cold but efficient. We were given extra napkins without requesting... Maybe we looked really messy??

Cash only!"
4,"Been here once and will definitely return for more. Had the Kothu Roti the first time around and its my favorite Kothu Roti in all of Toronto. The quantity was great for the 9.99 price tag.

Service was good and prompt, family had the dosa, peas and puri and they loved it too though they managed to finish their food (mine I had to doggies bag as well)

Worth a visit and also a repeat trip for sure."
4,"This is my go to spot if I'm driving along the 401 and a get hit by a sudden craving for Pho.  

Usually it's coming back into town from some road trip in the west (ergo anything west of the Saugga). 

If I'm hungry and I'm thinking, I'm not going to make it back home to cook (let's be honest too lazy) I'll pull off the Keele exit and head north.

It's a solid bowl of broth, and you get all the yummy bits in their special.

Nothing pretentious or super special.. just a solid no non-sense bowl of Pho."
4,"Always impressed every time I've been to a Texas Roadhouse. It's a chain, so I've been to a few between Ohio and Pennsylvania. 

You can't go wrong with the cinnamon butter that they start you off with. It's so good, you may find yourself tempted to cover more of your dinner than just the rolls.

The steaks are always cooked just as you request. Tonight was no different. We had the filet medallions and a portobello chicken dish. Both were delicious.  

The service could have been better. It's a busy restaurant and it appeared that most of the servers appeared to be younger, so I won't fault them too much for that. 

During each visit, I've usually heard a birthday being announced. Tonight there were two. There was also a balloon artist going around to tables tonight, so it's definitely a place to bring a family or kids. 

For how inexpensive the Texas Roadhouse is compared to other restaurants that serve similar items, it's really a great place to check out."
4,"Oh how I've missed Dumpling Village since I moved away from Toronto.  Love their celery steamed dumplings, eggplant with fish flavour, and cold noodles!!  The eggplant makes me come back time and time again and the prices are great too!  The Korean pork bone soup is also superb!  A few things that bring the rating down to 4 stars: the service is terrible and the atmosphere gives the impression that things aren't so clean.  Still love this place and visit it every time I'm back!"
4,"We recently moved to town and, in spite of the fact that it's our anniversary, don't have a babysitter yet. Neither, for that matter, do we have a grill. So we wanted a kid-friendly, reasonably priced steak house and this absolutely was exactly what we were looking for. With much better cuts of steak than other comparably priced steak houses and cheap kids meals (about $4 each), we were all pretty happy. Our server Jami was attentive without being intrusive and was generally exactly what you want your server to be. My only complaint is how salty some of the food was (which wasn't really a problem for me but would be for those with hypertension problems). We will definitely be back."
4,"I ate the chive and shrimp dumplings at the ""Dumpling Restaurant"". The dumplings were very good and I will go back to try their other dishes.  The restaurant serves Korean/Chinese food and the owners are Korean Chinese.  The service was great and the restaurant was quite clean."
4,"I like this place: the servers remember my name and what I like, the prices aren't too bad, and it's open late. I've been getting salmon teriyaki lately and they remember to cook it very lightly. The risotto they have as a side is a nice touch and isn't too shabby.

Not all is perfect as they don't have much in the way of juice and randomly are closed sometimes. 

A great place to drop in late, have some good food, and chillax."
4,"Capriotti's is awesome... my favorite sub is the Cole Turkey.  It combines cole slaw and turkey with russian dressing.  Great bread.  They also are famous for their ""Bobby"" sandwich which is a sub with turkey, stuffing, cranberries, etc.  Just like a thanksgiving leftover sandwich.  They also have these great bundt cakes that are moist beyond belief!  They'll refill your soda if you ask too."
4,"There's a climactic scene in the movie Drive where the hero meets the badguy in a 'Chinese' restaurant. It's a prop for the movie to sell the idea of foreign while these two real bad American dudes hash out their differences. It's rich and exotic and mysterious and... goddamn exciting. 

IG is a Chinese American restaurant in the burbs of burbs that serves burbanites, but man it had that feeling.

The Russian friend and I went there on a Sunday night for their Peking Duck special. We got that and some appetizer platter and some wonton soup and some cocktails. None of it was particularly memorable, and in fact the Peking Duck skin was *not* crispy, but the presentation was spot on. There's been so much streamlining of Asian restaurants that nice chairs and big booths with lots of room is uncommon. And on top of it I am a sucker for ethnic restaurants that have good servers that can connect with customers. Do you know how rare that is? Take advantage and talk it out. Be polite and get good service.

I don't think Madison's foodies would give this place four stars. But I saw a bunch of other slant eyes here with me, and I imagined they were like me, wide eyed and happy to be here eating whatever this was.

I'd take my mom here."
4,"Decent menue, lots of items to choose from. Service could of then a little more upbeat. They do have awesome chicken wings though!!"
4,"Tldr: Cash only, great value, delicious dumplings, would recommend

Came here a couple times pre-renovation and post-renovation. This place offers great selection of northern Chinese dishes (with a focus on dumplings ofc), as well as some Korean fusion options. When i came here before the renovation i dreaded the sticky tables and dirty floors, but i endured it because food was worth it. I have to say, after the renovation, this place looks way cleaner and aesthetically pleasing, while maintaining the quality and consistency of their dishes. 

When i come here i usually order one type of steamed dumplings (pork and chives is my favourite), one type of fried dumplings, and one noodle item. You can't go wrong with the steamed dumplings here. The wrappers are thin, but strong enough to hold everything together when you pick them up. They put a good amount of delicious filling as well. In terms of the fried dumplings, the pork pot stickers take first place. They're beautifully pan fried, crispy on the outside, juicy and meaty on the inside. For noodles, i personally like the beef noodle soup. Nice beefy broth topped with vegetables (usually shanghai bok choy), and elastic/bouncy handmade noodles. 

The place is pretty big, so don't be afraid to bring a larger group. Service is pretty good, though i don't think they speak much English (Mainly mandarin, can understand Cantonese). Price is amazing for the amount of dumplings that you can get, and the noodle portions are good too. Cash only! Would recommend to anyone!"
4,"Really Good American Chinese, maybe the best I've had in town thus far. Exceptionally fresh and not at all greasy. We split a tofu and vegtable stir fry that was spot-on and an egg-foo young that was loaded with fresh veggies and cooked to perfection. The price, service and ambience were all good, as was the fresh food."
4,"I've been coming here for years. I either get beef, spring rolls and vermicelli or pho. The food is consistently good and the waitresses have all been nice. I highly recommend it."
4,"okay so I signed up about a year.  The previous management sucked.  I cheered the day they threw on of em out.  The new manager Dawn is superb.  They put in round the clock *FRIENDLY* security and have really made a big effort to change the place.

They also reduced the price of the rents here making it more affordable.  With an apartment in Vegas you get what you pay for.  You pay a little extra here but you get a whole lot more.  

Its worth it.  My only tip is to try to get a few friends to live with otherwise they will match you with roomates which is both exciting and chaotic.  Most of the time it works out great.  I made a great friend for life who is perhaps the most interesting person I've ever met."
4,"Good food. Nice atmosphere. We went on Valentine's day, they had a special menu. We would go again for sure to try their regular meals..."
4,"Came to Pablo for their happy hour deal, which is $5 select tacos, 5 oysters for $5, and $20 pitchers of sangria/mojitos. We got a small pitcher of sangria (about 6 glasses?). The sangria tasted literally like orange juice and wine, there were no other fruits in it. It was okay for the price I guess. 

I wish they had more items available but the interior is nice for a small group after work hangout!"
4,"Well Done Steak, Loaded Mashed Potatos, Corn and Shrimp Skewer! 
Always a pleasure to eat here! Great food, great price and atmosphere. 
However, the staff? Very immature. Their side comments that they have about their customers are very unprofessional and rude."
4,"I come here all the time. This is such a great Pho place! I could eat here all day, every day! Well...To a certain extent. But check this place out, great find for the area."
4,"Came here with my boyfriend the first night I moved to Vegas. After a 9 hour drive all I wanted was good food and a beer and that's what I got! The waitress who was one of the assistant managers was great, she was attentive and made sure we got anything we needed. The four stars is because the wrap that I ordered was a little watery and a bit too spicy for me to eat all of, but other than that the environment is great."
4,"We do Beer Thursdays after work at Sierra Gold.  Fun atmosphere, great food (hint: try the Gilroy with RED sauce...yum!)  Pretty much all the seats in the place have a good view of a nearby TV screen so you won't miss a second of the game."
4,"We are doing low-carb and the salads here are very good...  

The ahi salad is VERY good, and my husband enjoys the Cobb (no blue cheese and avocado on the side) he gets ranch, and it is quite tasty, and I get the avocado, YAY!   

Have you had Ahi down the street at Hank's in GVR?  Sadly, or wonderfully, the ahi at Sierra Gold far surpasses the ahi at Hank's....  for many $$ less, go figure!  

The beers are cold, and the service at the tables is good as well.  Not too much, not too little...  We usually see the same servers so they know us, but tonight we had a new server and she was equally as attentive, and got us our happy hour beers before the end of happy hour, so of course... we were happy!"
4,"Our group tried the Imperial Garden for dinner this week.  It's a large space with multiple rooms.  They had a lazy Susan on our table so it was easy to pass sauces and dishes to share.

Our server was friendly and prompt.  She made suggestions on our orders and explained the different sauces.  She and the rest of the wait staff were good about refilling our water and beverages and checking up on us.

I thought the grilled dumplings were excellent.  I enjoyed my lamb which was very tender and had good flavor.  I tried a couple of different shrimp dishes, one with a creamy garlicky sauce, and one with a sauce which was too sweet for my taste.  Our group also had a variety of other beef and chicken dishes.  Although not all of the flavors were to my taste, I would say this was one of the best Chinese restaurants we've been to in the area.  I thought the prices were reasonable, the portions fine, and most of the flavors and textures quite good.  The service was very good.

If I was in the area and wanted Chinese, I would definitely go back."
4,"It amazes me sometimes when I go to a steakhouse that hasn't yet mastered the art (science?) of cooking a steak. 
That NEVER happens at Texas Roadhouse. My family has a range of preference from medium rare to well done, but no matter how many of us order, our steaks all come out at the same time and cooked to our liking. We visit this location about once a month and I have honestly NEVER had to send a steak back.
Mom is picky about seasonings and asks for hers plain... a couple times they've sent hers out smothered in salt, for which she's had to send back.

Overall... this is a great place for steak. The menu offers plenty, salads are good and I enjoy the side dishes. The servers are great and provide prompt service. My family won't spend the money at a high end steakhouse downtown, but when we want steak, this is the only place to even consider."
4,"After reading all the negative reviews I was a little hesitant to try it,but have heard great things so took the plunge. Glad I did!  The chicken breast was crispy and delicious, the waffle a little soggy but I still managed to eat it!   The food wasn't ready immediately but this isn't McDonalds, and it was well worth the brief wait. Service didn't blow me away but nothing bad either. Next time I've got time to kill in the airport I'll be back!"
4,Great value for their dumplings.  Dumplings are tasty and juicy.  I also like the onion pancake beef roll.  Service is below average because no one can speak proper English  (so be prepared to point at menu items or bring a friend who speaks chinese).  Next time I'm going to try the pork bone soup.
4,Definitely a sports bar. Really fun on Sunday's! Staff has great customer service skills. Good beer selection but wish there was more since it's a public house. Food across the board is good too! Don't drink their water though. Seems to be a known issue for a long time.
4,"Dined at the outside courtyard on a warm fall evening. Folky band was a perfect accompaniment for the setting and food. Reasonable tap selection. Service was attentive but not intrusive. Kept water glasses full and answered menu questions with ease. The biscuit was large, delicate inside but crispy outside and a delightful balance of sweet and buttermilky. The field pea salad was delicious--smoky bacon dressing with lots of farmer cheese, kale, and peas. Was hearty but not heavy. Rewarded my lighter meal with buttermilk pie topped with lemon curd. Was a bit bland and crust was heavy. The curd was thin and rather limited. Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated. Some signage directing patrons where to enter and where to sit would help with multiple establishments using same space."
4,"My hubby and I came here on my birthday and we were very well accommodated that night. Fun and spacious decor, fantastic cocktails, huge portions (I meant HUGE), excellent service and the price was right. Even though I still think Valdez was better in terms of the culinary quality but to be honestly fair, Baro is pretty decent too. My hubby and I ordered the Tasting Menu and oh my lord, the portions were huge and we ended up having two large boxes of take-away at the end of night. We will probably come back to check out other floors for a different vibe and experience."
4,"JC called me about a week before I went in, and left a message stating that they were looking to buy back some of their previous inventory, and would work to get me into a new vehicle at the same monthly payment. I messaged him back that my current Mazda 3 (which I'd purchased from Cardinale Way 3 years prior) had a cracked windshield, a dent in the passenger side, and also had already passed 80k miles, so I didn't think they'd be interested in buying it back. JC still wanted me to come in, so I agreed to an appointment a few days later. JC was very courteous throughtout our appointment, and worked to get me into a newer, much more well-equipped Mazda 3 while only using my trade-in and no down payment. My finance manager Todd was also very nice, and worked to get me a great warrany at a fair price as well. JC personally delivered my new car to my place of work the next day, and also checked in on me a few days later as a courtesy. I also received a call from Todd a few days after my purchase date, stating that he'd taken it upon himself to work with my financing a bit more (even though I'd already signed all the contracts) and was able to lower my monthly payment by another $20 a month and overall cost by over $2200. 

I was very pleased to have worked with two gentlemen who came acrossed as patient, honest and went above and beyond what I expected from them from a service standpoint. And as a female purchasing a car (yes, I went alone, no man to chauffer or assist), I never felt harassed, patronized or taken advantage of. 

Thank you Cardinale Way!"
4,"Going to keep this review short and sweet.

I LOVE the bread here. I honestly don't think I have had better bread in my whole life and it is great to see that they make it in house. It was perfectly soft and sweet and still warm when it got to our table. 

The main dishes are good, but nothing to rave about. For the price I think they are well worth it.

Overall - I would definitely come back and recommend Texas Roadhouse to my friends."
4,"I found this location to be suitable and the food palatable. The lunch menu was reasonably priced, quickly prepared, and I found the value to be good. Service was ok. Restrooms were clean!"
4,"When you don't want fast food burgers or typical bar burgers, walk don't run here. Avocados won't be reported missing, a slab of Ortega Chile takes the a burger to a whole new level!  Fresh ingredients unapologetically adorn your burgers here!
While the burger patty could do with a little seasoning that alone is our only complaint. Fries are thick, but if you enjoy spicy heat you simply must order the spicy Cheetos onion rings! Waitress Lisa is welcoming and friendly!!"
4,"Drive up to Carefree for lunch, stop in at the Sesame Inn. Their original Chinese creations are tasty, reasonably priced & all served in CLEAN surroundings. I'm a BIG fan."
4,"As far as Chinese restaurants go, this one is a sure thing.  Lots of parking in a pretty quiet strip mall.  Staff is friendly and they even have some Thai options.  I have gone a few times a year for many years and the food is always enjoyable.  They are pretty conservative with their spice, even the dishes that are marked spicy are pretty tame, but the taste is still very good.  The potstickers, orange peel chicken, lemon chicken, and kung pao anything are our favorites. I always appreciate when the waitress gives suggestions about dishes or the quantity of food ordered and I find they are very honest with their suggestions-they are not just trying to get you to order more.  Moderate prices for this area. Three of us ate for $60."
4,"Love! 

I'd be happy if I could have plain dosa with the butter chicken and chilli gobi (dry) everyday. 

My go to place for Indian food was downtown's India Palace, but it's closed down and Little India has finally won that awkward side-by-side competition. Having tried food from both, i'll always love India Palace and think their food was actually better. 

Anyhow, Karaikudi has a warm atmosphere with friendly staff. I had a large dosa here for the first time and it took me by surprise- a beautifully crisp golden rolled crepe served with 3 chutneys. Dip it into the butter chicken sauce and that's where the money's at. 

We also ordered the aloo gobi, naan, raita and chilli gobi (mild) with a side of rice. If you're not too great with spice as we were, definitely ask to get the chilli gobi mild. The first time I got it, it just lit our tongues on fire - but still delicious! 

Do yourself a life favour and try the galub jamun with ice cream for dessert. If you haven't tried galub jamuna before it's a delicious donut-like fried ball in warm syrup. But then they add vanilla ice- cream and it melts into the syrup. #drool

Definitely a new Scarborough staple in my book.

P.S. They collect points!!! All I know is points or not, i'm coming back. I've already been here 3 times in 3 weeks and plan to take friends to check it out next week."
4,The cheesesteak is a tad bready and the peppers are spicy. The bbq chicken salad was good but the ranch was too mild
4,"My family loves this restaurant and the chili gobi dry alone brings us back again and again and again!  It's very spicy, with a spice that grows with each bite, and it's addictively delicious!  The butter garlic naan is the best in the city!"
4,I wanted to have peeking duck. I had heard of it for many years but have never eaten yet. I chose this Imperial Garden to try it. It required a one day notice in advance to order it. I am very satisfied with its flavor. I had the three-course version which included duck being served in three different ways. It was very tasty.The service and atmosphere was very nice. It was relaxing and enjoyable.
4,"Went with my son and his family, it was our first time there.  We found it to be a very nice place.  Food was good And service was very good too!  I will go back again for sure!"
4,"Some friends recommended this as the newest place to be, so we went at 7ish on a Friday, and oh man. That wait! Luckily we could just go to the wine bar next door, Barolo, and have a glass or two first.

The food was good! I really like the grilled oysters, liked the chicken liver pate, and quite enjoyed the cornbread.

Weirdest and most delicious thing: the Perlou. I really wasn't sure what to expect with the oysters in there, but it was a surprisingly refreshing little salty nip in with the other elements!

Overall: I would definitely go back, and I had a good time, but I don't think it's a place I would crave on the reg. I think I would try the fried chicken next time (looked awesommmeee) and potentially save some room for dessert!"
4,"Considering it was crowded was surprised to see how fast we were seated and only had to wait about 15 minutes the steak and ribs were cooked to our liking... yes I would recommend as I have had to wait a lot longer other places which cost a lot more and was not happy with any of the food we ordered. 
When i go to a restaurant I expect great service and even better food.(otherwise I will cook better at home)"
4,Came here for lunch. Cozy kind of place.  Its a nice HK cafe kind of place. Serves you tea. Free WiFi. Food is pretty good and portions are decent. Lots of room for large groups or just a couple of people. Perfect for a quick bite. Would definitely come back for food!
4,"Dining at Imperial Garden was an exciting Chinese cuisine experience. I wasn't sure what to expect upon entering, but it was definitely a grand entrance. I was delighted to be dining in a finer atmosphere than your average Chinese Buffet. Yes, the décor might be slightly outdated, but it's truly a nice, traditional ambiance. Service was good and our server was very friendly with years of knowledge on the menu and the restaurant. 

We ordered Egg Rolls and Shrimp Rangoon for appetizers. The egg rolls were fresh, full, and crunchy. I'm a picky egg roll gal and these would have been perfect if the crunchy part was a little thicker. Nevertheless, I'd give these rolls an 8/10. Our server praised the Shrimp Rangoon and it was a wonderful alternative to the standard Crab Rangoon. Dinner went just as well with Crispy Scallops and Fragrant Shrimp which came with white rice. The portion sizes for both dishes were plenty. The scallops were full of flavor with a panko-like crust and even more savory after squeezing fresh lemon. The Fragrant Shrimp was lacking the spice that was in parenthesis next to its name on the menu, but it was still a flavored packed plate with green peppers, onions, water chestnuts, mushrooms, and carrots. Overall, the food, service, and ambiance was good.

I just wish they were open for lunch hours on Saturday and Sunday."
4,"My theory with dumpling joints is that the more north of Toronto you go, the larger the portions and the cheaper the bill. Rings very true with this restaurant, tucked away in a tiny suburban plaza. The decor is the standard, if you could call it decor. But you can't go for the decor or atmosphere; it's the dumplings, of course. They're big, juicy, and I can't even finish them in one sitting. They also offer other food like noodles and so forth. The red been pancakes are also not bad."
4,Reasonably priced family style restaurant. Food is consistent whether you have HK cafe food or regular dinner with courses. The staff is friendly and food is served pretty quickly.
4,"Tonight before going to the movies, Danielle and I went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner. 
The place was packed but we were seated very quickly and enjoyed some of those fresh baked buns w/ the cinnamon butter.
Unfortunately, I'm a fat ass and the booths are really cramped and i wasn't comfortable throughout dinner. 
Danielle had the BBQ grilled chicken dinner w/ vegetables and a salad. Sadly, her vegetables were raw. She liked the rest of her meal, though. 
I had the country fried chicken dinner w/ a baked potato and corn. My dinner was great. Absolutely no complaints The food was delicious. Sadly, i wasn't very hungry at the time. But hey, now i have some leftovers for tomorrow. 
Check this place out if you're in the area. I was surprised how much I liked it."
4,"Tasty food and friendly staff. They keep the intrinsic spice level pretty low and supply chili oil on the side, so everyone can enjoy all the dishes. We had Panang Chicken, Spicy Eggplant, Walnut Chicken and enjoyed them all."
4,"Good place to have lunch, food is good and fresh however, I wouldn't go for dinner their dinner menu seems a little overpriced but, lunch price is good because they have lunch specials. Thai tea is also good. Great staff except for this one young kinda chubby Asian kid he has no personality and is a little rude. Anyway I like coming here for lunch great prices and portions."
4,"Let me start off by saying, there is a good reason why the dining room fills up.  Delicious and authentic South Indian food with attentive serving staff and a comfortable dining room.  Top marks go for each dish we ordered in our group. We all love spice and color in the way we eat and can not imagine being able to carry on a friendship with someone who does not eat like us!  Mutton...perfect.  Shrimp Biryani...perfect.  Dosa...to die for!  Joined their points program because we plan on returning often. Love this place!"
4,"I first tasted this sandwich in 2007 next to a gas station. 

The sandwiches here are to die for. The slaw be joe roasted beef with slaw, the capastrami pastrami with slaw and many other sandwiches are worth tasting here. 

I have tried Jason's Deli, Firehouse, subway and Mikes but this sandwich shop beats them all. 

The only reason these guys do not get a five is because the owners make different decisions. At one I can get a hot ham and cheese while at another one they say it's not on the menu so they say no. 

Still one of the best sandwiches around."
4,"The atmosphere at Julep is really cozy in that style I can only describe as looking like it was designed by that ""Fixer-Upper"" couple.  We went in the middle of the week and were able to be seated immediately.  Service was really smooth and all of the staff were attentive.

Their menu is small, with starters, small and large plates.  Despite the limited choices we had a hard time selecting.  The two of us shared a starter, 2 small plates and a large plate.  That was plenty and I regretted not saving any room for dessert.  The pea salad was nicely seasoned and fresh.  The tamales came with 2 and I think are best to share.  Really good but the tamale dough seamed too heavy to be able to eat a plate of on my own.  Our large plate was the perlou.  It was really smokey and flavorful, though the sausage overpowered the whitefish and oysters.  I wished there was a sauce with it.  The star for me was the ham terrine starter.  It was served with whole grain mustard, pickled green beans and toast.  Every element was great on it's own and it all worked really well together."
4,Went there for a dinner.  Very nice and clean place. Relaxing atmosphere. Very nice and polite customer service. Food was very delicious and flavourful.  Mushrooms 65 and fry fish was delicious. Shrimp Masala was amazing and so was the Mutton do Piaza. Everything had the right amount of spices and the portions were generous.  Great lassis as well. The one thing they should improve is the quality of their naan. It was little dry.
4,"Ok, I'm not from Phoenix, but I get it. It's not the same as their main location in town, the service might be subpar (which I didn't experience), and it might take a while to get my food, BUT THESE ARE SOME DAMN GOOD CHICKENS!!!!

The $19 price tag for my whole combo is a bit excessive, but considering it's at an airport, I'll take this any day over the $12 refrigerated turkey sandwich with wilty arugula at SFO.

Thank you PHX, and thank you Lo-lo's, for making my 3-hour transfer so fat and so enjoyable."
4,"I had no idea what to expect from Morals Village, but I was quite impressed with my visit here. We came tonight. It was a rainy, cold, Tuesday night at 8:30pm. We assumed we wouldn't have to wait, but when we got there, we had to wait for about 15 minutes. 

We were led to a large table where they had placed a divider so that the two of us would have some privacy. I like the divider idea. However, it does mean there's less space on the table to place raw food. When the first waiter took our order, we decided on individual pots, then proceeded in ordering our food and sauces. Just as we finished, while our first waiter was still with us, our food started arriving. That's the fastest service I've ever experienced! I was super impressed. 

The food quality is pretty good. We had the satay soup base and the pork soup base. We preferred the satay, but the pork one was impressive in its own right. It had green onions, goji berries, and other things in it. It wasn't just broth. I appreciate that the lamb, beef, and pork slices were overall less fatty than other hotpot places, in the sense that they did not have large fat layers. I would have preferred more marbling in my meat, but this was not bad at all. 

Some of their English menu items are a tad scientific sounding. I don't know if they have a more English friendly translation. Someone should look into that. Highlights from their menu include king oyster mushrooms (prince mushrooms on their menu), watercress, raw shrimp (fairly large), mussels (also fairly large) on their menu, two kinds of stuffed meatballs (as well as cheese filled beef balls we did not try), and sliced ox tongue. I appreciate that the ox tongue was sliced very thinly. It reheats and becomes tender much quicker this way. The highlight of my night was a fish ball for which I do not know the name. It looked fried and had bits of squid in it. It tasted like fish tofu, but less processed. 

Others have mentioned the ice cream at the end of the meal. It really does make a difference. While the ice cream was slightly gritty, it still went down incredibly smoothly. Great end to a good meal.

On a weekday, it was about $32/person before tip because we got the cheaper soup bases. It's not as cheap as other places, but it's definitely one of the better hot pot places I've been to. I wouldn't mind making a return trip here some time, but not today. After two all-you-can-eats today, I'm down for the count."
4,"A lot to like about this place:

The julep was tasty although I think they go a bit overboard on the crushed ice.
The food was very tasty (we had appetizers, the shrimp & grits, risotto, pot roast, and fried chicken as well as a couple of desserts).
The ambience is nice, bright, airy - very pleasant.

My main gripe is the vast difference in portion size between the entrees. The fried chicken thighs ($18) only came with 1 thigh on a small bed of collard greens - 18 bucks, c'mon! Especially when it is listed on the menu as ""fried chicken thighs,"" plural.

The pot roast and risotto were large portions and the shrimp & grits was an ok size although 3 shrimp is a bit skimpy in my opinion.

The service was pretty slow as well. The drinks took forever. We ordered them first then ordered appetizers, and didn't get the drinks until we were 1/2 done with the apps. 

A good place but they've got some things to work out before it will be great."
4,This is a good Chinese place. Will it take you to a place you've never been? No. But you will leave satisfied.
4,"Come here infrequently for years for happy hour to meet friends or watch football occasionally.  Always loved the gilroy pizza.  Not always a fan of thin crust, but good from time to time.  

Then I found out about the breakfast specials.  I wish were would get here more often, but don't go to breakfast much when not football season.  Those house-made potatoes are addictive and while not a sausage fan the breakfast burrito is a fun to change up the eggs and bacon skillet.  

Not a beer drinker and the drinks are uninspiring to me.  Never been able to find a cocktail to like here.  

Always clean.  Regular staff that are friendly to repeat customers.  We aren't that frequent, but some friends are.  They try to accommodate however they can for sports."
4,"Recently opened on the King W strip, this jumping place seems to be the new 'it' place.  4 floors of Latin American flair, it will definitely leave a good impression on you at the end of the night!

The first floor is their restaurant- highly recommend reservations if you want a meal here.  The 2nd floor is their cocktail bar/lounge area.  First come first serve and we were lucky to grab one of the last tables.  It's a bit small - long and narrow but nothing a few drinks can't cure!

The drinks here - oh my definitely try the Five Flower - are nicely cultivated with a little of something for everyone.  You won't find these cocktails anywhere else.  They also have wine, beer and tequilas/rum etc if mixed drinks aren't your thing.

The 2nd floor has a tapas style menu but since we didn't try any food here I can't comment on the quality/taste.  But I'm definitely intrigued to come back and grab a bite!

The service was friendly from the hosts on the first floor to the servers on the 2nd floor.  It was busy but everyone was friendly.  Overall a great atmosphere and a lovely way to spend the evening.  It looks unassuming from the outside but once you step inside you just get that fun vibe. 

The 3rd floor I believe is a 'secret bar' and the 4th floor is their event/party space.

Definitely will return to try out the food!"
4,"I'm quite pleased. Dumpling Restaurant has been on my bookmarked list for a number of years, and I've never gone. I'm a sucker for Korean food and a sucker for good steamed dumplings. I have no idea how they came up with a concept to serve both together, but if I can get both, I will do it. My brother wanted to go out for Asian food tonight, so we ended up coming here. At about 7-7:30pm on a weeknight, less than half the restaurant was filled up. There was also a few free spots in their very small parking lot. This works for me. So far, so good. 

Then comes the menu. It's one of those ones where you tick off what you want and then hand it back to the server. No pictures, but I'll survive. It's times like this I wish I knew how to read Chinese more so I could (hopefully) have a better idea of what some of the menu items are. It's not that the menu is particularly vague. It's just that sometimes, I'd like to know what kind of fish I'm ordering if I'm ordering spicy BBQ fish. I didn't end up getting my fish, but I probably will next time, and there will be a next time. We ordered, for the two of us, pork bone soup ($6.99), lamb skewers (8/$8.99), steamed pork and chive dumplings ($5.99), and pork and chive pot stickers (5/$4.99). 

The lamb skewers were alright. Not the best I've ever had. On the dry side, but for the price, not terrible. I'd rather pay a little more and have them juicier though. I'll pass on these next time.

The steamed pork and chive dumplings had thin wrappers (a plus in my books), and as my brother tried to take a picture of the dumpling he was holding up with his chopsticks, I just watched as juice poured out of it. Juicy dumplings. Also very reasonably priced. I can't remember whether it was 12 dumplings or 15 dumplings. Good stuff.

The pork and chive pot stickers are the long dumplings. At $4.99, they're a good snack/light meal. Also super juicy. Bottoms were nice and crispy. 

The pork bone soup, while not quite the flavor I attribute to a Korean pork bone soup, was still tasty, and would satisfy a pork bone soup craving. The bones were very tender. It's a very sad day when you struggle getting the meat off your pork bones. For you soup lovers, there really isn't much soup in this bowl. There are a few veggies and a slice of potato, but this dish is very bone heavy. My brother had two bones, and I had a bit, but the rest of the bones we took to go. They were supposed to go into our small takeout boxes, but the bones were too big for the boxes, so they had to go into a large, rectangular box. They filled up that box. I can't remember if I put four or five bones in there. A minimum of six good-sized pork bones in pork bone soup. Definitely bang for your buck.

Total damage was $30 and change AFTER tip, but before tax. We also had two boxes full of leftovers. There's lots more on the menu I wish I could have tried, but I'll need a return trip with more people to do so."
4,Get the Bobbie... every inch is like Thanksgiving again! One of the best sandwiches I've eaten ever in life. Only reason it takes a hit is because ordering over the phone is nearly impossible. I hate having to wait a while when I'm hungry already.
4,Great place to get your car repaired. They are very trustworthy and very thorough. Tj the owner is a great guy and will take the time to explain things to you. There are a few things I would caution people about but it's nothing too serious. They have longer then most wait times but once again they are very thorough and they will offer you a free ride home. They are not for early risers. Their doors open up between the hours of 0830 and 0945 and it could be later. Also when booking an appointment be advised that it will likely be a week out. Those are just somethings to know but overall it's a great place and I still encourage people to give em a go.
4,"Okay, everytime I go to a steak house, for some reason they seem to think that medium means rare. I absolutely cannot stand the sight of rare meat so when I get my steak back almost walking, I tend to get upset. But the manager here was very very nice and professional about everything. He made sure that everything was perfect when he came to our table. And then he only charged me for one meal. So I couldn't be upset with the service, but the cook needs a little refresher on how a steak is cooked correctly for the customers wants. That's all. The waitresses have such great manners and a lot of hospitality. I love that."
4,"Want something cheap?  That will fill you up while you're watching your sports game and waiting for your ticket to come in?  This is your place.  For under $10, you'll get a sandwich that will leave you with a gut busting sense of fullness, chips, and a soda.  Get the Bobbie - it's Thanksgiving between two slices of bread.  Can't beat it.  The Italian isn't bad either."
4,I ordered 10 oz ribeye combo with shrimp and a sweet potato as a side. My girlfriend ordered ny strip with loaded baked potato. Great tasting steak and cooked to perfect temp. The bread you get with meal are so addicting
4,"I've been here a few times for Trivia Night.  I recommend!  Great location in small downtown near the river.  Nice atmosphere, attentive staff.  I've tried the pretzels, chili, and a burger.  All were very good.  I need to get back and try more things on the menu!"
4,"Overall a great place to check out. Ambience is good for more intimate settings and parties as large as 6 or so people. Waitstaff is friendly and professional.

Food is pretty good too. Had the shrimp fritters, which were decent... Texture was a bit strange being bready with bits of slimy okra. Mac and cheese was amazing. I would eat it again and again. Field pea salad was very delicious as well and a very large portion size. Would definitely suffice as a meal in itself. The farro risotto was pretty okay. I might have just been really full from already eating the previous items, so wasn't so excited about this. Random sweetness of apples were interesting. 

I would come here again for sure and try their other items... and for more mac and cheese."
4,"Loved the decor! Loved the food! Service was great and attentive. I had the cuban rice and beans, the picada platter that had all things i love since i'm latin. The empanadas were to die for. Def a must."
4,"The service here is mediocre  at best. The main reason I revisited this place was because they have the best nachos I've ever tasted, hands down. The décor of this establishment is very nice and the coolest part was the TVs in the mirror in the bathroom."
4,"We are from California and everytime we stay at The Boulders (a hotel across the street) we come over for their delicious Chinese food.  The owner and her family are always happy to sit down and chit chat, and the food is consistently great.  We look forward to our next trip to The Boulders and The Sesame Inn."
4,"Finally got to try hot pot at Morals Village  ~ 
I had their original spicy soup base and it was one of the best ones I've had yet! It was very flavourful and very spicy. It complemented the lamb slices and veggies perfectly. I was also very impressed with the service; many hot pot places tend to forget a lot of items you have ordered and I would have to keep ordering to get just one order of it. This place I would only order once and it would come right away! I was very impressed. Just wished they had fried gluten, it's my favourite thing to eat at hot pot D':"
4,"Mayworth's is one of my go-to's. It's always a solid choice. There's not a huge menu, but you'll find something to please everyone from the ""chicken tender plate"" to your more adventurous foodies. It can get quite busy, and for good reason. 

The sweet potato waffle fries are AMAZING, and the regular waffle fries come with some kind of chipotle bbq ranch sauce that is good on everything. The mac and cheese is comforting, with some fun options to dress it up if you like. I've had the spinach and goat cheese sandwich made with chicken, it's a bit like a gyro sandwich, and a great lighter option. The korean bbq chicken is good too, tangy, but I usually get it without the bun because it's a bit big and unwieldy with the extra bread. The pretzels are also a really yummy appetizer, but I'd recommend a double serving of the honey mustard sauce, and skipping the queso. I've never done a salad there, but I'm looking forward to trying the wings at some point. Plenty of beer and wine options, I like to go on Mondays for half-price wine."
4,"This place is very cute. Great date spot.

Let's start from the top.

My experience starts with a quick phonecall to Julep for a reservation. A lady answered and was awfully courteous and prompt with making this happen. I usually dont comment on this part but there was just something that impressed me by her style.

We entered from the front and first went past a coffee shop and bar to finally enter the restaurant. Our first impressions were very positive. The general look and decor of the restaurant could probably be summed up as modern, classy, cozy while remaining casual. The outdoor area is very well done as well and I was particularly impressed by the fact that while part of the seating has a direct view of east washington, there was no noise to pollute restaurant atmosphere. Depending on where you are seated, the restaurant could certainly lend it self to a nice one on one feeling to set the date mood.

A cool note is that after we ordered, hot sauce condiments and salt and pepper were placed on the table. We thought this was a fun touch.

Okay now to the food. We ordered a few things including, cornbread, biscuit, mac n cheese, shrimp and grits and fried chicken. We thought overall the food was very good. The breads were rich in flavor and buttery. We liked that the biscuit came with jam in addition to butter. The mac and cheese was interesting, it had a certain depth in that you could taste each cheese per time of ingestion. There seemed to be a fair amount of mustard flavor to it, however, and it was slightly overpowering. The fried chicken was very impressive as well with a crispy skin and perfectly cooked inside. The hamhock and collard greens that the chicken was served on was on point.

A couple notes on service. Overall it was great. A nice lady who we presumed was the owner came and inquired of our satisfactiom a few times. Our waiter was overall good but seemed spread and wasnt able to provide us with great service. Something that caught me off guard was that after we said we were finished our waiter took our hot sauces and salt and pepper shakers and put them directly on other peoples tables. I am sure it is common in the restaurant bussiness to move this around but it just seemed like maybe this isnt the best thing to allow patrons to see, given it can he interpreted in different ways.

Overall, Julep is great and I will be apart of the crowd who spreads the word. Great atmosphere, food, and service."
4,"Fresh off a trip to Nashville, I was pumped to try the southern cooking promised by Julep. The menu is organized by ""snacks"", small plates and large plates. We tried 2/5 in each category.

Snacks- pimento goat cheese was good. The cheese came with mildly cheesy crackers. A knife was needed BC the crackers crumbled with a dipping attempt. A-. The cornbread was buttery, fresh and delish. A.

Small plates- Nashville salad had fried pigs ears, lettuce and hot sauce. The weakest dish of the night. D. Blue crab rice cake. Rice, crab and scallions with a briney slaw. B.

Large plates. Fried chicken with collard greens. Mediocre, C. The greens were too sweet.  The best dish of the night was the Perlou. Rice grits, whitefish, andouille sausage. I would come back for that alone. A+.

Overall a solid B with possibilities."
4,I liked this place. It's fairly new. The inside was nice - open and clean. I got the cashew chicken and it tasted like fresh ingredients. The servers were a bit disorganized looking as I observed during my meal but they were very friendly and the kitchen was pretty fast
4,"Originally we walked into Red Rock Casino tonight to eat at the Yardhouse, but it was a 45 minute to 1 hour wait and f^%k that. Actually, it was a mission trying to find a place to eat tonight that didn't have a ridiculous wait. After doing laps around the place trying to find a place with availability, we pretty much gave up and went to the food court since we just wanted to eat something by that point.

We all quickly agreed on Capriotti's and off we went! My experience here tonight was truly a ""mixed bag"".

(+) The food was really good. I mean like really, really good. I've eaten at many Cap locations and some are much better than others. This is definitely near the top of the list.
(+) Portions were surprisingly huge, which I don't quite get. It was the same price as other Cap locations that I frequent, yet our same subs here were MUCH bigger it seemed. Why is that?? lol I don't know why, but I love it! lol We actually ordered an extra sub to go after eating because we were so impressed by this!

(-) Service was painfully slow. To be fair, they were busy but everything just seemed to move at a snail's pace.
(-) Employees were very nice but seemed a bit confused. One of our subs on our initial order was just plain wrong and not even close to what was ordered, but we were so hungry we just ate it anyways. It was good, don't get me wrong, just not what was ordered.

Basically, food was a 4 and service was a 3, but we will certainly be back and we were pretty much wowed by the portion size so they get the benefit of the doubt and a 4 star rating from me.

4 stars.

Yup. I'm a fan!"
4,"Quick and simple Chinese food. Lunch combos include egg drop soup or salad, fried rice, egg roll and fried wonton for about about 10 bucks. My favorites are the Kung Pao Chicken, General Chu's Chicken, and I've heard great things about the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. Get it with brown rice to save a few calories. I stay away from oriental dishes containing beef unless I know they're using high quality steak. That goes for any restaurant. 

I believe they're family-owned and operated. The staff is always very nice and will chat with us if we have enough time. We're usually in a rush, so they expedite our lunches and we're in and out the door in less than 30 minutes. The prices may be on the high side, but you don't have many alternatives in the area aside from Pei Wei, and you'll pay the same there.

Great for take-out too!"
4,"Visited Kinkade's with a prepaid $15 oil change coupon, with the intention of checking out the shop for future business.  Have another trusted mechanic, but needed to find someone more conveniently located.  They did a great thorough job with the oil change, but more importantly, correctly diagnosed a couple of problems and presented a no-pressure estimate and priority suggestions.  I did end up bringing my vehicle back and basically got 4 jobs done for a little less than I was prepared to spend for 3.  They were quick, communicated well, and I was able to work out a schedule where I could drop the vehicle in the morning, pick it up after work to take it home, and bring it back the next day.  Was impressed with the honest pricing (I always compare new shops with my regular mechanic) and the no-pressure explanations.  Provided the repairs last (so far so good!), I thoroughly recommend TJ and the team at KinKade's.  Don't let the location scare you -- it's clean, big, and your vehicle will receive good care."
4,"Came here because Congee Queen was packed with a 25min wait.  Forget about that !!  In this day and age, there are other restaurants around that are just as good, especially if you are hungry.  This is one of them!

Sunday night around 6pm, table for 7.  Walked right in and got a table right away. I knew what i was going to order from looking at the menu last time i was here. (Soft shell crab fried rice).
MMmmmm, was not disappointed. The place was not extremely busy, but busy enough. The staff was much friendlier this time around.  Push the button, and they came right away!

Quantity of food was good!! Had to take food home.

Still hard to pick dishes, you have to come here a few times and just order your fav dishes !!

4 stars for this experience!!"
4,"Kinkade still my favorite place to take my car for an oil change. The guys are friendly and honest. If it wasn't for the Groupon deal, I probably wouldn't know about this place. They even have a Keurig coffee station while you wait, but no tv. They highly recommend you make an appointment. This place gets extremely busy. The parking lot is small. They have shuttle service if don't' want to wait."
4,"Went for lunch special  - Ordered General Tsao;s  Chicken - served with either Chow Mein or Fried/Steamed Rice for 6 Bucks.
Opted for Chow mein instead of rice.
Served w/ Soup, Fried Wontons (several side sauces plum, duck and serious mustard).
Way too much for lunch, so took half home and was great for dinner!
Tasty, Spicy, 3 kinds of peppers (chinese, serrano and jalepeno)
nice Jasmine Green tea.....
Great Value and nice atmosphere."
4,"Me and a friend stopped in for dinner on a Sunday afternoon. We had the pimento cheese dip and tortilla chips as an appetizer. The pimento cheese dip was warm and very good. It was not spicy.  For our meal we had the veggie tacos, collard greens and the sweet potato waffle fries as our side. The tacos were perfectly seasoned and nice size proportions. The sweet potato fries were crispy and cooked just right. Our serve Jeremy was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. He was able to make suggestions to help us with what to order. I would definitely recommend this place."
4,"While waiting for my movie to start, I stopped here for a bite to eat. I'm a first timer at Capriotti's and not much of a sandwich person at that.

I ordered the most familiar thing on the menu --- cheese steak sandwich, plain. It came warm, cheesy, and oh so gooey. The quality of the meat and cheese were top notch. It was probably the best cheese steak sandwich I've had; I think it is a lot better than Subway's version. 

I thought it was kind of pricey though --- $11 for a small drink and a 9"" sub. This was in a casino though, so I'm not sure how the prices compare to a standalone shop. I'm not a sandwich person, but I'll probably stop by on another occasion."
4,Had a great breakfast here before heading home.  Two people ahead of me in line but had my 'waffle breakfast sandwich' in less than 10 mins.  The waffles were thin and crispy but still soft on the inside.  Mark (the chef I believe) came out during what looked like a lull in service and asked how it was.  I didn't expect good food and friendly service at the airport.  I'll definitely be back.
4,"I would have given Pho Mi Asia a 3 star review - ie. average - but their Pho is really quite good.  The broth tastes delicious and they have a generous serving of beef.  The bowl comes out quick and piping hot.  A quality meal for its price point especially on a cold day, or if you're feeling kind of sick. $7 bucks with tax and small tip for a medium.

The grilled beef is passable although, I find that they don't cut the beef into small enough pieces.   Nothing spectacular. That's just my preference.  Again, they provide a generous serving.  $7-8 with tax.

Spring Roll - I find their roll oily but still delicious.  They provide a little vermicelli salad on the side.  $4.00 for two rolls.

Avocado Shakes - The reaction I get from most people is that avocado shakes can't be good.  Ha!  On the contrary, they are quite delicious.  They are creamy, although, they definitely put a lot of sugar into the shakes here.  $4 with tax.

I can't speak for the rest of their menu except that there's a bajillion food choices.

Why was I tempted to give it only three stars?  Well, I must say that sometimes their service can come across as rude.  They take orders quickly and food comes quick but service isn't really pleasant.  Think of that actor Ben Stein and his monotonous delivery. 

If you're big on having a smiling waitress who will gladly answer any questions you have about pho and Vietnamese, this is not your place.  If you just want a bowl of pho and you want it damn fast, this is your type of place."
4,"We had a party of 5 and had the bacon cheeseburger, Mac and cheese, shrimp tacos, fish tacos, and chicken tenders.  Everything was very good!  The tacos were delicious.  The Mac and cheese is homemade. Cute place  and reasonably priced."
4,"Coming from Chicago, most of my friends think I am a borderline scumbag going to a gambling establishment for breakfast. Thankfully, I live in Vegas now and this is quite a frequent occurrence. Sierra Gold is our go-to for breakfast and a few drinks after a long night at work.

The bartenders are great. Friendly, attentive and they make me smile in the morning before a 6:00AM flight. What makes me smile even more? Gluten Free Crispin cider ON TAP. Only $7 for a large pint to start the day? Yes please! Forget the calories, give me the cider, which, by the way, tastes amazing on tap. Let's get to the food, because other than gambling away my funds, that's what we come here to do.

Specials: 1/2 off breakfast from 6:00AM-10:00AM with players card. I would still pay full price for the breakfast though, but moving on.

Pizza: I haven't eaten the pizza, but friends and my fiance have, and it was pretty good for Vegas pizza. Yes, we are pizza snobs coming from a city that prides their pizza as the best pie in the country. Go to Gino's East and you'll understand...or Pizzeria Uno...maybe even Lou Malnati's. I digress. Get the pizza at Sierra Gold topped with meats and veggies and you'll be good to go.

Breakfast. Oh the omelets. I had to go here twice in a row one week because I found my happy omelet with bacon, guacamole and pepper jack cheese. Perfect amount of cheese, not like the Omelet House that makes my arteries scream for lean proteins. Perfect amount of guacamole and crispy, crispy bacon. I have a pet peeve about restaurant bacon. Crispy or go home. Sierra Gold did it just right.  My fiance get's the Miner's Breakfast which is sausage, peppers, breakfast potatoes, ham, onions, bacon and more, topped with delicious eggs and cheddar cheese. My fiance does not like scrambled eggs but eats these scrambled eggs in a heartbeat. The sourdough bread looks incredible. Big thick slices, toasted perfectly. You can also get wheat, rye and white. Excellent choices. One issue with the breakfast? The breakfast potatoes are nothing to write home to Mom about. They're fine, just nothing as good as the omelet. They need some seasoning, maybe the seasoning they put on their twister fries?

Go to Sierra Gold if you're in the area. Specials in the morning for breakfast, 1/2 off food and drinks at night too after 12:00AM, oh, and a happy hour in the middle of the day as well. That makes the draft domestic beer 25 ounce large glasses $2.25. Yeah. Worth it on all accounts, and hey, it is pristinely clean and TV'S IN THE MIRRORS IN THE BATHROOM. Hey, it's all about the small things my friends."
4,"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(204/365)  ""Super Sammies!""

 I've always been a fan of Capriotti's, and when Mom and Pops was in town recently, rather than take them for their usual In-N-Out fix, (In-n-Out doesn't exist in Hawaii) We decided to check out Capriottis, since they have bomb sandwiches and is another business that isn't available in Hawaii.

We ordered a small Bobbie and a small Capistrami, my two favorites. We looked around to see what Pops wanted, and knowing him, he had to have his rice fix, so he ducked out and went to nearby Panda Express. Mom was surprised to see the size of the sandwiches, so I guess it was a good thing I didn't order footlongs!

Pops had a little taste and he liked both sandwiches and Mom was enjoying it as well. They both liked the fact that there was real turkey in the Bobbie and the great taste of the Capistrami as well. Now they have another food option for their next visit besides In-N-Out or a buffet!  ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"
4,"I've been eating at Sesame Inn for more than 15 years, starting when there were down at Thunderbird and Scottsdale Rd.  I've even had the same waitress, Grace, all that time.  This is the only place I know of that makes Kung Pao Beef by deep frying the beef first.  It's unique and without peer.  Everything else is good as well, from the soups to the Mu Shu Pork to the House Special Chicken."
4,Pretty fun spot and the food was very good. Port tacos were excellent and the ceviche was also very good.   Service was friendly and great atmosphere. Overall a cool spot.
4,"Friendly staff,  great atmosphere,  onion pakoras taste like kfc chicken.  Must try the paper masala dosa at least once in your lifetime.  Biggest dosa ever.  Reasonable prices.   Overall, good experience."
4,Excellent value for the food. Unique North Korean style of food. Dumplings all made to order for dirt cheap. Great hidden gem. My go to dumping place
4,Good food and nice atmosphere. Not fast food Chinese.  Love the orange chicken and hunan beef. Been coming back for years! Good take out too! $1.00 drinks when you eat in is a plus!!
4,Very nice servers/wait staff.  Food was very good!  Spicy fried rice actually had some heat to it!  They even have REALLY good tasting fortune cookies!!
4,"We ate here on Friday of the opening weekend and it was super crowded but we got seated relatively fast for a peak hour. The server was nice and she gave us the drink and food specials. 
The food came quick and it was good. 
The place has a ton of TVs and so if you want a quiet romantic dinner this is not your place. They had the basketball tournament going and so the crowd was definitely there for the sports. 

Price was reasonable and would like to come back."
4,"Came here for a birthday celebration with my best friend. Restaurant was overall good from service to food and drink. 
Drinks - we got the Baro Sour and Man Latin. Baro sour was the clear favourite, very tasty! It's their spin on the pisco sour which is a popular Peruvian drink. The Man Latin was good but I wouldn't recommend if you don't like strong tasting drinks, it's more of a sipping kind of drink.

Food
-started with the tostada, a giant chip with guac & chicken on top ($7). Guac was smooth and the combo of chip chicken and guac was a good light started. Probably a dish you could make at home.
-next, we had the Chori Papa which definitely my kind of comfort food with a baked dish of chorizo, potato, onion and peppers. You also get 4 warm flour tortillas to make your own little wrap. 
-for our main, we got the duck chaufa, this thing is huge, could probably share with 2-3 people. This is a tasty rice dish with duck. It's for a hint of spicy for those spicy lovers. It's a nice warm filling dish on a cold day.

Had a good experience. Food is on the pricey side but definitely worth the experience."
4,Andie is the bomb! She is the best and I look for her every time!  Great food. Lisa was our server.
4,"The flavour of food that you get here is unbelievable, I have never been disappointed with any of the dishes that I have ordered!! The service however could be improved, I feel as if the staff have to be more attentive and approach customers with a friendly attitude, rather than their usual manner! The butter chicken is authentic! Make sure you try it if you ever visit this place!"
4,"As far as i know, this is really only place in Madison yiu can get Southern-inspired food. The cornbread was amazing and the fried chicken thigh large plate was very good. The cocktail list was different and everything I tried was really good"
4,"The buffet was rediculously busy in the casino, so we sought an alternative. The sandwiches were quite good, especially for the price. It's in the food court, so don't expect pleasant ambiance, bit a relaxing lunch nonetheless."
4,The hot and sour soup is really good! Great dumplings with great price!
4,"For a chain restaurant, they do a very good job. Service is great, and the food comes out to your liking. Drinks are also very good. 

Got the steak and loaded sweet potatoes; they were very good. No complaints. 

One star down for nothing exceptional -- it was good but nothing exceptional."
4,"We go here with friends who have been eating here for over 18 years.  We have probably been eating here for at least 10.  The food is good, fresh and hot.  Most of the time the service is reasonable but it all depends on how busy they may get.  There was one time that it took almost an hour and when our party of six finally got served, one of the six had to wait about another 20 minutes for their food.  Everyone else was almost done eating.  The waitress kept apologizing but I don't know what the problem was but it was apparent it was in the kitchen.  We have had take out from here also.  Be sure to call ahead.  I like spicy food so ask for extra hot sauce as most of the food can be mild.  One time our party tried desserts of mango, green tea and another flavor ice cream which was a treat."
4,"When I'm looking to fill a Chinese fast-food void, I'm not looking to see if the service is top notch; I'm looking for big value, freshness and flavor! China Tango Bistro meets all of those requirements so, ""Yay! I'm a fan.""

I would probably say they cook up the most flavorful and plump honey walnut shrimp ($12) I have had in a while. I loved how the shrimp batter is not too crazy thick and fried expertly to make it crispy for texture. The little white noodle bed it's served on also adds addictive crispy pops! So good! The best part is the portion is generous! Plus, the shrimp tasted fresh and succulent. However, it is a tad on the sweet side; you might be able to see the grains of sugar in the sauce not completely dissolved yet. If you don't like your food extra glazed and saucy, I would skip this item. Flavor rating: 5/5

The upgrade from white rice to egg fried rice is only $2.50 and I completely recommend it! It is fluffy and flavorful with lots of delicious fried egg bits mixed in. The portion, again, is huge! It's enough for me and my fiance to share and then share again the next day! Flavor rating: 4/5

The crab rangoons (cream cheese wontons) ($5) are freshly fried and filled generously with a silky cream cheese blend. I wouldn't sweat the crab since there is no crab flavor detected, but if you ever had a cream cheese wonton, these are a great version - they are super crispy and delicious. Just make sure to request some sweet and sour sauce to dip them in, if they didn't come with it. Flavor rating: 4/5

The total for us to dine here for dinner was $22! We took over half of the food home to enjoy for lunch the next day because they really give indulgent portions. And guess what, the next day it was just as tasty! I won't lie and say that their service is awesome, but I can definitely see they are trying and working on improving, so hats off to that! If you didn't know, this type of service isn't as bad as you think it is. There are far worse and it's culturally accepted (or is it...O.o).

P.S. When we dined here, we felt that they might have did an overhaul on their restaurant since the food tasted fresh and delicious, far from Panda Express quality."
4,Got the capastrami. A great mix of sweet and savory. And it was so filling!
4,Great lunch today!  I've been wanting to try this New place.  We started with pimento cheese dip and chips which was amazing...great amount of heat.  I had the California Black Bean Burger with avocado and pepper jack cheese.  Burger was great.  Our waitress did an excellent job with our large group of 6 women and 3 kids!!  This is a great addition to the community.
4,"Great little pub located in historic downtown Cramerton! Don't be fooled by the pub label however as this place serves up some wickedly good food. In particular, the Buffalo chicken tacos are fantastic. I have ordered them on both my visits along with the thinly sliced, perfectly fried sweet potato waffle fries and have been very satisfied both times.

The fish tacos also rock as do the collard greens, which may be the best this greens lover has ever had. 

The service is very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is festive and attractive with wood floors and beadboard booths. Will always eat here whenever I'm in the area. It's  almost worth the drive from Charlotte (I said almost)."
4,"Came here for afternoon tea.  Reasonably price and food selection.  Spacious inside, getting into parking lot can be a challenge because of markville mall traffic.  I would come back again."
4,"I've been here for dinner but I went for brunch for the first time today and it did not disappoint! Great southern classics that were very tasty. We had the shrimp and grits, blueberry banana muffin, and Nashville hot chicken. 

Shrimp and grits were so flavorful! Would have been nice to have a few more shrimp since their were only 3 but overall very good! 

The hot chicken was good, but not too hot! And the muffin was super moist and delicious. 

The other thing that really made this brunch was the outdoor courtyard. They have a beautiful courtyard that was perfect for this first warm weekend of the year!"
4,"Food is good. I love their hot and sour soup (they got it right most of the time). $6 lunch special which comes with a cup of soup. Their crab Rangoon is very delicious. Also try their General Tsao ToFu.

If u live around the area, ur better off trying china tango the ho go ho (they r gross)."
4,"Im rating this more on being American Chinese then true authentic Chinese. That being said it was very nice inside. Not too formal but definitely not a take-out joint.

We got a cup of the Hot and Sour soup. Which is always my favorite. To try something different we got the Seafood Hot and Sour soup also. Almost taste just like the regular Hot and Sour put of course more of a seafood flavor then pork. It only comes in a serving that serves 2-3. Which is a great value because the 3 of us easily got 2 cups each out of it.

The Fragrant Pork had chestnuts, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and carrots in a garlic tomato sauce, Said that it was spicy hot put I only got a tiny bit of kick. Put still good being sweet and garlicky. 

The Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice dish caught me by surprise in a good way. Expecting it would come with that same bland and over salty white sauce. But I couldn't stop tasting the sauce. It was like no other white sauce I have tasted before. The waitress poured the sauce for the dish right in front of you so it was ""sizzling"". The rice was on the bottom of the skillet plate so it ended up getting crunchy. Adding a great texture to the dish. The shrimp, scallops and chicken in the dish were tender. Also in it were pea pods, water chestnuts, carrots and mushrooms.

Even the fortune cookie at the end was a better grade cookie then take-out places.

Service was helpful, attentive and friendly."
4,"Really good food. Slow with service but at least they were not rude (just short staffed).

LOVED the Korean fried rice & assort. veg.
The dumplings & shrimp was good.  The shrimp was messy to eat.  They really should clean it or butterfly it if they want to serve this dish with the peel.
Also had red bean pancake & egg + chives pancake both were pretty  good. 

I would say the only thing I didn't like was the fried noodles + seafood. You can tell the noodles are fresh but the dish was under seasoned & didn't taste like anything.

I would come again to try the rest of the Korean dished."
4,"A craving for strong Vietnamese style coffee, no matter how heavily calorie induced the condensed milk is in the bottom of the cup..the nerve of even counting calories!!!
Asian specialty coffees have a place in my heart.

Oh and the PHO here, you ask? Authentic with great tasting slices of protein and the soup base is darling to taste buds and ass kicking remedy to every cold symptom imaginable. The first sip of the hot soup makes everything better again, hunger pain wise.

The place went through much needed renovations, they got rid of the awkward green walls and splashed some modern taste for a refreshing and upbeat place, great choice.

Staff seem alert enough for a quick response to hungry monsters like me, with the normal request for wooden chopsticks for moi and a fork for the baby girl. Then hot sauce galore to bang bang those sinuses away. 

My check-ins don't do justice to  the many times I've come to visit but do take my word that their special beef soup is highly recommended to anyone in need for a quick, authentic and satisfying bite."
4,Steak was great! Got the New York strip. Bread and butter was awesome. The downside is the seating. Very cramped and small tabletops are not good. Waiters were great. Very reasonable. Surely going back!
4,Located in the Red Rocks casino by the theaters. Quick service. Can use your Station points to pay. Heavy sub sandwiches. Do a yelp check in for a drink. Join their club.
4,"I am glad they got a new location in Summerlin.  Very attentive, clean and accomodating.  Best dish:  Shrimp and Green Peas.............the best!!"
4,"We go here every once and a while. Never disappointed. The service is always good. The steaks are usually cooked to the correct temperature. 

The thing that I always look forward to is the bread. Mmm. It's just so warm and tasty."
4,"Come here often with my family and we like to get Pho, Vermicelli and Broken rice. The reason we come here is it's cheap and it's pretty tasty and made very well. It's one of those places that look slightly sketchy and has little service, but the food is worth the lack of service and decor. The dishes are always made perfectly and fills you up no matter what.

It's unfortunate so many people gave low reviews for this place or maybe they were just unlucky and came at a bad time. But I've been here many times and the food is always good. You can get pho for $8 and most of the dishes are $10 or under. Prices are very good for what you get, which is something we enjoy about this place.

You can even get vietnamese drinks here or just bubble tea, and it's not that bad either. But I recommend you probably stick to the food because that's what they're really good at here!"
4,"This is a typical Hong Kong style cafe, but the price is a little too high for this type of food.  A typical lunch would be around $11 plus tax.  The decor was your typical modern design with a slightly dark grayish floor with light colour table and slightly darker chair.  The lighting is soft and not too bright.  
They have way too many items on their menu.  It took me a while to go thru all the items.  I decided to have to steam rice with shrimp wrapped in lotus leaf.  It was 15-20 minutes wait, and i waited a bit longer than all my friends at the table.  The meal offers either Chinese soup or English soup. lol!  I prefer the Chinese one since it is usually a soup lighter in a style of light consomme.  I had the typical milk tea as the after meal beverage.  The rice was really fresh and tasty.  It has the rich shrimp aroma throughout the rice and slightly floral smell from the lotus leaf.  It was definitely good.  Service was not bad since one of my friends is a regular here.  Although a little pricey for this style of food, but it was worthy."
4,"I would come here for just the sweet rolls & cinnamon butter! I love how they come right out when you're seated. 

I got the chopped steak aka the road kill. It was topped with mushrooms, onions, cheese & I got a side of brown gravy to top it off with. The meat was juicy & cooked perfectly! It went really well with the brown gravy. I normally get the chopped steak from Brown Derby Roadhouse but, this chopped steak is so much better than Brown Derby's. The chopped steak came with 2 sides so, I got the rice & sweet potato. The rice was mushy & tasted off & the sweet potato was also very mushy. I could of skipped both of the sides.

I guess if you come in from open til 6 Monday-Friday's, you can get this meal & other meals for only $8.99 which is a really nice deal."
4,Good dinner. Fresh reasonable prices standard Chinese restaurant faire.  Will come back.
4,Im visiting family and my sister wanted me to try this place. I was very pleased. We got a biscuit and it was buttery and flaky however $4 for 1 biscuit is a bit steep I think. Then I got the perlou and sister got the special of the day which was catfish fish fry. My perlou was really good. It had great flavor qnd texture of crispy rice was soo good. The fish fry was hot and crispy and pretty darn good.  The service was good and the ambiance is really nice. Will head back when Im in town.
4,"Amazing food and broth choices. 

I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday not too long ago. There were 7 of us. We had to call in for a reservation. We had to wait for our table for about 5 - 10 minutes but the hostess was very sweet and apologized for the wait. We sat down and immediately someone came over and asked if we wanted a round of ice water while looking at the menu. The menu is easy to read and follow and it was all you can eat! We were here for about 3 hours. Over all, friendly service, it is quick and easy, this location is definitely one of my favourite places to have hot pot from now on."
4,"Went outside my comfort zone and tried The Bobbie, pretty damn good. Turkey and I mean real turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce, not my usual but damn good. The small is huge, I can barely finish it. A small town s $7.49, totally reasonable considering its HUGE. Pretty impressed. Staff was great too."
4,Cool place with good food. Most of their dishes are designed as family style but can be eaten individually. We went on a Wednesday so it was pretty empty however it was still nice and lively with the music. Overall would recommend this place for the decor alone but the quality of the drinks and food are an added bonus.
4,"i do like their moo shu but it's only served with 2 pancakes.    most restaurants give 4.   their prices are a bit high.   lunch specials runs around $9.50.   other chinese restaurants are less.    their wonton soup is really good.

the sesame inn also needs to be cleaner.     there's dust all over the ceilings and hanging lights which is so bad i'm afraid it's going to fall in my food.     

they're making a lot of money -- get someone in there to clean the place."
4,"Kairakudi is a popular restaurant frequented by South Indian and Tamil clientele, but offers a range of North and South Indian dishes.    

The food and service is excellent.  Fast attentive wait staff work with quick kitchen staff to bring your meal quickly.   My only minor complaint is the sauces for the North Indian dishes are too similar (or same) such as Butter Chicken and Mutter Paneer which are almost identical flavour.

Recommended: Paper Dosa , for the ridiculous size and good Facebook photo moment!"
4,"Great quick inexpensive option while at the Red Rock Resort.
We split their smallest Philly Cheese steak and it was enough for two for sure.
Filled with finely shaved nicely flavored meat and tons of melted cheese.
We liked it alot.
check it out!"
4,"We had dinner here on Sunday night:  My husband, two sons and I.  I did some research and we came because this restaurant met our requirements: nearest to home, Dosa on the menu and they served meat.

Our menu consisted of: 
Masala Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa, Sambar (I didn't realize that the dosa came with 2 each or I wouldn't have ordered it, but it is awesome), Garden salad, Chicken Biriyani, Butter Chicken (this was just OK, a bit too mild for my taste) and Naan.

All this for $60 and we had leftovers.  I would go back for the DOSA it was really, really good.

Also, just a note, we arrived early (at 4:45 pm) so it was quite empty, but the service was spectacular!"
4,"Located inside the food court of the Red Rocks Casino.

Capriotti's is a restaurant chain.

We had the italian sausage topped with marinara, cheese, grilled sweet peppers and mushrooms. The medium size comes on a very long piece of bread and thus makes a very long sandwich. Perfect for splitting."
4,My favorite local bar. A little more upscale than you Pt's with a great atomosphere and terrific food selections 24/7
4,"The power of Yelp compels you. As Jennifer noted in her review, you might pass this obscure dumpling house every day of your life and never have noticed it. But search Yelp for dumplings in Scarborough and you'll turn up this sucker and amazingly a couple people have reviewed it.

By 7 pm Saturday this place fills up (don't let Jennifer's typical empty restaurant photo fool you) with a mix of Chinese and Koreans (based on a visual sampling of the newspapers patrons were reading). A sure sign. I was the only honkey (""ko jang eee""[1]) in the place but my lone arrival caused the staff no consternation, hand wringing, or sucking of air through the teeth. Everyone seemed to speak good English. 

The menu is in English (with typically overtly literal translations) and Chinese. Despite being Koreanized Chinese food and Sinotophied Korean food, there was no Korean on the menu. The menu offers a good range of dumplings. Interestingly prices can be very deceiving (in a good way) and the uninitiated might tend to over order as prices are incredibly low. As Jennifer notes, you get over a dozen over-stuffed dumplings for $5. 

The kimchi fried rice (kimchi bokumbap) was pretty sub par. Jennifer noted while we planned this impromptu 2 person ""Elder Statesmen of Yelp"" UYE  that Koreans do weird things to Chinese food but I'll offer Chinese do weird things, and little justice, to some basic signature Korean dishes. Avoid this one (ie the kimchi fried rice... NOT the restaurant) for sure. However, they do up the cold buckwheat noodle soup (neng myun) right. Korean Chinese or Chinese Koreans tend to hail from the North Korean border region and this soup is a signature dish from that region. Like the massive bamboo steamer of dumplings, the soup came out in a huge bowl with enough for three and also rang in at about $5.

Service was quick. Food came out with little delay. And table service seemed to avoid Korean service rules (if you want something, flag your waiter down, otherwise it's assumed everything is copacetic).

Really, if you want to fill two people quickly and cheaply, Dumpling Village is your oppa. Damage was $21 with tax and tip and food packed up to go (""kudurap da restup"" [2])

4,"Really good Chinese food! Would definitely recommend the sesame chicken and the calamari. Very delicious! Best calamari :) Great prices during lunch but gets a little pricey during dinner... Overall, great place if you're wanting Chinese food."
4,"Joint is ghetto like most Viet restaurants and that usually means authenticity. This stands true for this location. I would recommend their Pho but Vermicelli is mediocre. Dish is good but the accompanying fish sauce is lacking in flavor. Overall, not bad but could be improved. Worth a visit none the less"
4,"Good southern-style food. The portions are really too large for one meal, especially since it's located in an airport, and most people can't take leftovers home. 
I had the catfish and okra. Everything was excellent!"
4,Food is always excellent. Great service. The only thing I don't like it the wait time. It's a very popular place so expect to wait during busy times.  Definitely blows away the competition (outback and longhorn)
4,"The place was really busy and people were flocking for the food. It was very good service and probably the biggest Dosa I have ever seen. Try the indian coffee- it is an experience of its own. tastes a bit like ovaltine mixed with coffee. Very Tasty. 

The vegetable's that came with the dosa were really good. The Sambar was delicious- so was the potato and cocunut raita. 

Pepper Chicken was unique and different from the typical indian dishes. The only issue I had was the channai paratha was over priced and not worth the value. i would just get dosa or the naan's. Overall - had a great experience."
4,"I stop in here a few times of year, they are always busy, and they have been named 'Best in Madison' many years in a row.  

I don't think I have ever had a bad experience here, although my visit on April 1 was borderline. The food arrived timely, and for six different lunch menu items, I was impressed.  The ginger beef was fragrant, just enough punch, and portion size was reasonable.  

The only complaint I have was getting our beverages refilled. They have such tiny water glasses and after about the fourth trip to the table, they finally dropped off a pitcher of water.  Not until they brought the check did they offer to refill any sodas.  I thought it was tacky to ask at this point since the glasses had been empty for at least half an hour.  

Overall, prompt service (if you know me, I really hate to wait), good portion size, tasty food... I'll be back"
4,"One of those restaurants where everything I ordered was very MEMORABLE.  It's kind of a HIDDEN place in the same tiny strip mall that has had the CHEAPEST (asian) hair cuts for 15+ years if you don't care how you look.

The decor didn't have anything to it, I took a photo of one of the RARE items that make this place indicate any signs of being KOREAN resto as well but now I look at it, it looks like its written in CHINESE.

Fried Dumplings, Steam Dumplings were absolutely a pleasure to consume.  We ordered Battered Deep-Fried Egglants which were nicely crispy and seasoned but eat it quickly FRESH before it gets soggy.

My meal is not complete without a bowl of NOODLES!  Cold Korean Noodle is quite refreshing and had a Medium Boil Egg Half on top.  The photo says it all, just as good as the ones I've had near Steeles/Yonge.

This is one of the FEW places I would eat ""Water Cooked Fish"" because I'm not big on spice.  The dish actually took awhile to come, so we figured that the chef actually went out to get a fresh fish.  Nonetheless the fish was GREAT and the spices wasn't OVERWHELMING.  A non-spicy eater RECOMMENDS it!"
4,"Best chinese is Madison by far, but very expensive! You do always get great service though. Yum!"
4,"This place was great, a hidden gem! I got the mysali dosa and the idly. It was delicious I highly recommend it. The severs were prompt and all the food came out on time. I recommend this place for anyone having a dosa craving!"
4,"Came here for dinner once on a Friday night. Their food is really good if you plan on sharing, so you can order several things and try them all. We ordered the chicken liver mousse, the crab cakes, the corn bread and the grits. The chicken liver mousse was fantastic, and paired well with the pickled onions that came on the side to help cut the richness of the mousse. Could have probably came with more bread though. The crab cakes were nice and big and mainly crab. The corn bread was nice and fluffy. The grits had more of a modern twist than your traditional grits, it was not creamy or cheesy. The texture to me was more fried rice than grits. But still very good. I got a mint julep to drink, how could I order anything else? Oh wow...it was STRONG! But once I gave the ice a chance to melt and dilute the drink down, it was really good. Will definitely be back to Julep to check out the rest of the menu some time."
4,"This is one of my favorite hangouts, the wait staff ranks really high (thanks James and Rebecca)--They take their job very seriously.  The food is awesome, even though I eat mostly salads these days.  I get the grilled shrimp added to the build your own which is excellently prepared.  Great rum cocktails too with a nice local draft beer selection.  I go about once a week just to see everybody that works there, excellent armosphere!"
4,"Called the location to ask if we had to make reservations for a group of 8-10 to visit during Happy Hour and bring board games. Was told we did not need a reservation and the woman who I spoke to over the phone recommended the private lounge area so that we could close the curtain to block off the noise and crowds. I thought that was a wonderful suggestion. We confirmed the time my group would be there. This was about 3 weeks out from the date we would arrive.

When our group arrived, the host and other staff had our room ready for us, with water and cups, napkins and silverware/cutlery arranged around the seating area. The private area is nice and cozy-lots of leather oversized chairs mixed with soft ottoman/seats and regular tables in between. We arranged the furniture to accommodate our needs but were sure to return it back to how we found it when we arrived. There is a big fire place at the back of the room as well.

Our drink and food orders were taken right away, and the host was very attentive. Our food was delicious and better than average bar food. Aside from our (HALF PRICED DURING HAPPY HOUR! drinks), we ordered and shared: chicken quesadilla, nachos, fried mozzarella, BBQ Pork potato skins, and artichoke dip. 

We had the room reserved for 2 hours and were actually sad when our time was up. We could have kept playing Cards Against Humanity and talking for much longer than that. We were given our checks, and again the host had no problem with the large group of us each having a check and each having a different method of payment. 

My group and I are already planning our next game night here. Thanks for the amazing service, perfect little venue, reasonable prices, and tasty treats!"
4,"Pho mi is so far the best Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. I'm not a huge pho fan, but their pho makes me crave it sometimes! No matter what noodle soup you order, it'll be full of taste with lots of ingredients. You'll leave feeling very full and satisfied for sure. Prices are also reasonable. Restaurant isn't fancy at all and service isn't extremely friendly too, but the food is what makes me come back! 
The broth in the pho is very flavourful, but I find that the ""specialty noodles"" are the best! Recently tried the chicken curry noodles and it was so good! Doesn't taste too heavy at all!"
4,Nice decor and great service. Authentic Latin American food with a unique touch to it.
4,"I've been wanting to come here since hearing its like PT's but a little better. Went for happy hour which I'm not sure what time it started but was until 7pm. It was PACKED!! I've been to PT's on Silverado and Maryland for HH and it was never this busy! 

It kind of dark inside but had a nice ambiance. Although quite busy, there were several tables still available. There are pool tables which weren't in use either. 

First off, our waitress said we would have to buy the beer and bites members card in order to get HH prices. PT's never made us buy that, nor did my friend say she needed when going to Sierra Gold previously. Weird. Anyway, that card is $5 but you get $10 to use immediately and you build points on it for whenever you visit and eat there. What also sucks is that their HH is for drinks and thin crust pizza's ONLY. No appetizers. Bummer!

Ordered a couple drinks. I tried one of their specialty drinks call grand smash which was grand marnier, lemongrass syrup, sierra mist and mint. It was pretty delicious!  Also, got bucket of chicken wings, garlic fries and their Gilroy thin crust pizza. The gilroy was awesome!! It had white sauce, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, pepperoni, sausage and tomatoes! SOOOOO good. 

The bathrooms were very very clean! And while washing my hands, I noticed there were tv's in the mirrors!! Cool! lol. Our waitress was very friendly and when my bf asked what beers were on tap.. she pretty much went down the whole list and would have continued if my bf didn't say he got the point. HAHAHA.

Overall, its a little far for me to go to HH often.. but I will return if I'm ever near one again. Its a lot nicer than PT's that's for sure!"
4,"Brownie points for this location specifically for being open until 1:00 AM - later than all the others. This is Vegas, why does every other Capriotti's close at 8:00 or 9:00 PM? Anyways, this one is also closest to my house.

It is inside of the Red Rock Hotel so you have to walk through the casino to get to the food court but that is no big deal. I placed an online order and drove to pick it up. Everything went smooth without a hitch."
4,Hmm. Capistrami. The Bobbie. Excellent choices.
4,"Love Lo-Lo's even in the airport the service is great. Cashier is friendly and helpful. 
Always a fan and customer"
4,"Great Hk style milk tea! ""Authentic"" Hk style food! Big restaurant with lots of booth seats."
4,"What a wonderful jem of a place that seems to be tucked away in secrecy?! Delight prevailed from  the moment we walked in to when we left. Cocktails were a pleasant start and then to dinner that was served by a pleasant server, with the food being delish and hot from the kitchen. We'll be back!"
4,"This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in the Madison area.  Hands down, it's the best Chinese I've found so far.  I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were more reasonable and the dine-in environment was better.

Like I said, the food is superb.  My usual dish is Cashew Chicken.  It's hard to deviate from that when it's sooooo good.  Other dishes are excellent as well.  What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good.  The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or ""questionable"".  The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  

We don't dine in often or at all.  It's a little more formal than I prefer, and the experience can take a while.  Just not my preference.  I keep their number in my phone and call ahead for carry-out.  That's the way to go here, imho.

Their location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western 'burbs.  The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day. 

If you're looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here.  If you don't mind a more formal setting and have the time, go ahead and dine in."
4,"Had breakfast twice their the past week and the service was great , steak & eggs are very good and cooked correctly. The restrooms are clean , pool tables, and.cold beers!!"
4,"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located on McCowan Rd and Hwy 7 E in the plaza with Subway. Lots of parking spotsout front, and more spots in the back.

[SERVICE] - 5/5
Our server was very nice! She made a couple recommendations and was very personable. Severalother ladies checked on our table and made sure everything was good.

[DÉCOR] - 4/5
Booths were comfortable, and had a more modern Hong Kong Style Café vibe.

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Average-quality ingredients, but you get what you pay for.

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Lobster on Steamed Rice - $19.95: such good value for the large portion size (there wasenough food for 2 people)! The order came in a big bamboo dim sum steamer and wegot a whole steamed lobster on a bed of fried rice. The taste of fried rice became a bittoo one-dimensional after a while, so I would suggest ordering other dishes on the side.

- All-Day Special - Egg Sandwich + Butter Toast + Shredded Pork & Pickle on VermicelliSoup + Milk Tea - $6.45: so much food and so inexpensive! I think this is great for thosewho enjoy a variety of Hong Kong style breakfast foods.

[OVERALL] - 4/5
Service was great, the ladies who helped us out were so friendly. Quality of food was averagebut portions and value were fair. I would recommend this place if you crave a simple andcomforting meal."
4,"I like this place! A little more ""luxurious"" than your run-of-the-mill PT's, but not ""stuffy"". The interior is well lit for a bar - not too dark; not too bright. The service was excellent considering there were a ton of people there celebrating my friend's birthday. The drinks were accurately mixed, and the bar food is better than most. There's tons of seating. Huge downside: super smokey, but I guess I should expect it. I may also be putting it on more of a pedestal than I should since it was my first night out alone since having a baby, LOL. Either way, I'll be back on a night that I'm baby-less."
4,"Had dinner here one Sunday evening. Had the ghost pepper wings. They unfortunately were not hot, at all. I'd been hoping for them to be a little spicy but nope, not at all! 
We had the Mayworth chicken to share since we weren't that hungry. It comes with rice and was pretty good. I'm usually wary about eating chicken breast because it's usually dry but this was spiced well, moist and tender! We got a side of the house salad which was actually huge! 
They have some good looking burgers that I'd love to try so yes, I'll be back!"
4,"On a few occasions my hubby and I have ordered take-out from here and it was always good. We went to the resturant last week and it was trivia night. Place was packed and very loud but all in good fun. Service was great and food was good. Some items we have ordered over the last few months and enjoyed were.....wings (ordered hot), side salad was awesome, loaded baked potatoes were delicious, hubby loved the bacon wrapped meatloaf and waffle fries. Things we thought were meh were mac and cheese (bland) , burger was a little dry and chicken fingers also dry. Mayworth is a great neighborhood joint and we look forward to going back."
4,"A Spanish bar with great music, mediocre service and hit or miss dishes. 

I'm not even into Spanish music but their playlist was amazing! It was not even that busy on the Saturday night that we went but the service was quite slow. However, they were polite and very smiley which we always enjoy. For the food, we first ordered a platter of apps which was a HUGE disappointment... we swolled everything down thanks to our bottle of wine which kept us happy. Surprisingly enough that platter filled our bellies to the top but we kept seeing this one dish being sent out from the kitchen. It was the duck charfa, so being the curious people we are, we made the order. It came in a stone bowl and it looked amazing, it smelt amazing and it tasted like heaven!! We were extremely full but we ate us every last grain. 

Honestly, that last dish saved this place to give it a second chance. Knowing that dish was good I'm sure there are other delicious dishes on the menu as well. It really is a hit or a miss! 

Oh and there is a 2nd floor to this place which is a lounge! Awesome vibe and good music as always."
4,Hamburger sliders were solid. Bar tenders attentive. Great group of people who could sing on karaoke night.
4,"Dumplings are juicy and I enjoyed both steamed and fried dumplings. We also ordered stir-fried snow pea leaves with garlic and deep fried chicken with hot pepper flakes. Snow pea leaves were a bit overcooked, thus too stringy and fibrous. Chickens were nicely cooked. Everything is cheap here without sacrificing the quality of food. Portion sizes are generous too. The place is quite big but I have never seen it being fully packed. 

Overall, a good place to grab a quick bite."
4,"My crew and I eat lunch here all time.
The decor is a little dated, but the food and service are great. The lights hanging from the ceiling crack me up"
4,Capastrami sandwich with the cole slaw is unique and good. Definitely be going back for this one. Convenient location in the Red Rock casino.
4,"Kitchen M is directly across from Markville mall & I cannot stress enough how every employee should go and eat there for their break.

Walking in I was surprised by how little people filled the place as it was around 2PM and should've been high hour for lunch.  
My friend & I got seated right away and we shared a beef ngau hor (beef noodles) for roughly $9. It filled both of us to the point of where we both had to fight over who didn't have to eat the last portion. 

I can completely understand why diners get irritated at the service. The waitresses are all somewhat middle-aged Chinese women and they don't really care about all the ideals that society holds. They don't smile, they don't say thank you, or try to interact with you and ask about your life - they honestly just do their job efficiently; with taking your order, bringing your food, and clearing your plates.  

I'll be returning on my next 1 hour lunch break to try another one of their dishes :)"
4,"I only get take out but I've never had bad food, a wrong order or a rude person.

Love that I can make the Mongolian Beef to my spice level and the Fried Rice is great."
4,First here so I tried the burger. It was very juicy and moist. For my side items got mac and cheese. It was  very creamy but not very cheesy. They have a large selection of draft and bottle beers at the bar. Lots of TVs. Great place to come for lunch during the weekday. I have not tried them on the weekend it. My waitress was very attentive and she checked on me at least 5 times in 30 minutes. LOL
4,"Our experience first and certainly not last experience at Mayworth's was great! The decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant was dark and somewhat industrial. I loved the woodwork and the Edison bulbs in the lamps put a nice touch on things. The TVs in the restaurant were appropriately placed to give you something to look at. I loved the tall backs on the booths as it did offer privacy to your table. The booths were not padded which is fine to me as some restaurants have sunken booths that are uncomfortable. 
The bar was beautiful and rustic. Definitely a welcomed addition to Cramerton! The patio area was not offered but the option is there. I wished the area was not so fenced in.

Food was good. I had the Mayworth's chicken. The siraracha sauce gave it a nice kick but was perfectly balanced with the tzatziki sauce. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the marinade reminded me of a Greek marinade I've had before. The rice its served was a a bit much. It was literally an bowl of rice with chicken on top. I would have much rather had a smaller portion of rice and a vegetable. 

Maria our server was EXCELLENT! She was pleasant and professional. Her silent service was appreciated and her recommendations were spot on. Maria made the experience very enjoyable by serving our needs perfectly."
4,"My go to place in North York area for a bowl of hearty, delicious and cheap Vietnamese pho.  Can always expect generous portion of meat, chive and bean sprout.  The service is also fast and effcient but never friendly.  This is a good place if one's expectation is affordable Vietnamese quick bite, but definitely not a place for social gathering.  I always come here for pho tai nam and bun bo hue.  In my opinion the ultimate favour is still Pho Linh on Dufferin, but this is closer to me since I am in North York area.  Like many other Vietnamese restaurants, it offers diverse selection of Vietnamese items ranging from pho, vermicelli, appetizer, noodle and rice.  But I would not recommend rice dish although the portion is filling.  

I've never seen the owner here smile so don't expect too much on service."
4,"It appears that people either love this restaurant or not. If you are use to Americanized Chinese food, you may not like this place. You have to have an open mind and palette and be willing to try something new. The style of cooking is Thai and Asian. The dishes are named the same but not the same as we have been accustomed to. These dishes have more vegetables and especially onions. I embraced the change and the flavors. I felt that the portions were huge and am happy to have another meal or two from the excess. It's worth a try if you are an adventurist."
4,"Texas Roadhouse grills up a mean steak.  In the Parma/Brooklyn area, this is definitely the best place for steak.  

When you enter the restaurant, the kitchen is on your immediate right and they have steaks lying in plain view if you wish to select your specific cut of meat.  The steaks always look juicy, marbled, and fresh.

We usually start off with a Baby Blossom, which is your typical deep fried onion, but it has a unique seasoning, which is not awesome.

My favorite cut of meat is the 11 oz  ""Hearty Cut"" Sirloin.  It's really tender and delicious and 11 oz is about right for me.  If you want more steak, they have the 16 oz ""Cowboy Cut"".  You have your choice of sides and they include items like green beans, which have bits of bacon and a very salty, smoked flavor...not your typical green beans.  They also have mashed potatoes, which are really good.  Of course, they offer seasoned steak fries, but the seasoning is not awesome.  I'm in the game for awesomeness!

The best thing they serve is their home-made butter.  This stuff is really good!

They serve some good local beer and there is a full bar in case you need to get tanked.  Peanuts and bread are served before every meal and yes, you can throw the spent peanut shells on the floor.

I've eaten here over 10 times and I have never been disappointed.

Recommend!"
4,"One star was taken off because they did not pick up their phone.  A Wednesday night dinner for 3 did not needed to wait long, also I was just a little shocked that I had to pay extra for soup base and drinks, whereas many other places came with it for free. 

Food was good, I could not complaint about it. Decor was amazing and service was awesome! I did had a great experience at the restaurant and will most definitely come back, probably on a weekday."
4,"This is my second time back and I went with my boyfriend and my parents. We all agreed that the service was wonderful and the food was served quickly. We tried the pork bone, tomato, mushroom, and herbal soup bases. They were all quite flavorful but it does get diluted with the generic soup stock used as refill throughout your meal. They were very diligent in ensuring our soups never ran low and refilled it periodically. 

My parents were happy with the quality of the meats. They said it was above their expectations for ayce hot pot and the shrimp was very fresh! Only suggestion they had for improvement is maybe having more choices for meat and more cooked food variety. 

My boyfriend enjoyed the spring rolls in particular. He said it'd be better with more filing but he still ate like 6 lol. They only have spring rolls and deep fried bun for cooked foods and they're both great but we would like to see more options. Only complaint he had was that he wished they also had chicken. 

Personally, I have no complaints about the food and was happy that ice cream was not limited lol. Only problem we encountered was when we asked for Coke and without clarifying whether we wanted can, glass bottle, or fountain (included in the meal), we were given glass bottled Coke. Other than that, everyone was happy with their meal."
4,"Closer to 4.5 stars.

The food was very very good.  We ordered the beef meatballs, empanadas, the chorizo dish, and the duck confit with fried rice.

Every dish was distinct, flavourful, and had been carefully prepared.  Unlike a lot of ""small plate"" places, the portions here are a good size.  The duck confit was an impressive amount.  There were two of us and we were very full, at the end of the meal.

The staff were friendly and very attentive; my water glass was never half-full.  

It's also a fun, lively space.  They're doing a take-off, from Spanish ""street food"", but higher end.  

The only ""con""?  Maybe a little loud?  (Hint: I'm stretching to find a con)

For two people, with dessert and 4 drinks = $150 (before tip)."
4,I really thought it was a nice place. Great happy hour as always. The food came out great and I would def go back!
4,"I come here when I crave Chinese food and it's close to my work. Their lunch specials have huge portions, prices are $6 or $7. I haven't tried any of their non-lunch specials. It's one of the few places where you get hot and sour soup or egg flower soup when you pick it up or get it delivered so an extra star for that. Most Asian places don't include soup unless you dine in. It's a little better and cheaper than Panda Express but you get a bigger portion and soup. It's not the best nor the worst Chinese food I've had but definitely hits the spot when you want Chinese food.

I haven't dined here but the service is decent. A few times, I had to wait a few minutes when they said it would be ready in 10 minutes but not a deal breaker."
4,"Came here about a week ago for the first time for a friend's party, in fact I had never been to any Sierra Gold before...only PT's. When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised with how spacious and nice it was. Definitely was not expecting it. There was plenty of table seating and TVs located through out and not only at the bar. It was also pretty cool to see TVs in the bathroom mirrors so you can continue to catch the game and not miss any action!

For the party we had a couple areas reserved for our group and our own waitress as well. The poor waitress was trying to keep up with all our food and drink orders, but overall I think she did a pretty good job despite there being 20-30 of us and only 1 of her. For food we ordered a bunch of appetizers and set it up buffet style for our group to munch on during the party. There were boneless wings (where they apparently serve the sauce on the side?), sliders, fries, and various pizzas. I thought the food was pretty decent for bar food and being able to order them in buckets makes it pretty easy to order in large portions. 

Sierra Gold seems like a pretty chill place to grab a beer and watch sports and it was much less crowded than other sports bars I've been to around town. If only it weren't so far away I would be returning soon to catch some games!"
4,"Love this place!  Great service, good food at a decent price.  Drinks are huge."
4,"Had the turkey veggie sandwich and wifey had the veggie burger. Both were very tasty ! Need more help though. Only had two workers. Would go back,"
4,"Took my daughter and a couple of her friends to Texas Roadhouse for her 11th birthday.  We did the call ahead seating and despite being very busy, five of us were seated immediately upon walking in to the restaurant.  Our waitress arrived quickly, introduced herself, and took our drink orders.  She ended up being a great waitress the entire night.  She was cute, friendly, fast, and courteous.  Excellent!

I ordered the smothered chicken once again because that dish is just the bomb.  I love it.  My daughter and her friends all ordered a 6oz steak and they loved it.  This place has great food and great service.

Did I mentioned I had a craft Summer Shandy beer?  That was a perfect pairing with my meal.

Yum!"
4,"The girls that work are so nice! Service is always quick! 

I love me a good Bobbie and Capistrami but they are high in the calories so I went for the Chic ken Cheesesteak. Don't judge. It's a better alternative, I'm not starving myself in the name of food. LOL! Yum! I was sad and hesitant to go beyond what I love at Cap's but now I have a new favorite. Order this...do it! And do it with both hot and sweet peppers! The hot ones add just a bit of a kick!"
4,China Tango is a great location for quick orders.  I placed an order for dinner through the Eat24 iPhone App at 8:10 and at 8:31 they were at my door.  When you place the order it gives you the standard 45 minutes to one hour wait but it has always been quicker.  Free appetizer with minimum order and food prices are good.  The downside is the $2 delivery fee.
4,"A small hidden gem right at the intersection of Kennedy and Ellesmere; their serving sizes for pho or soup is a little smaller than other places I've been to. Otherwise, the service is great and their crunchy spring rolls are bomb!"
4,"Times like this I wish I were blind or poorly sighted...this place looks worse than a hole in the wall...smells ""special"" when you walk in and honestly...if city inspectors aren't retardo..this place I think would definately be closed down.  The washroom is absolutely filthy so please pee in a cup if you must go or wear depends when you come....I promise..you will thank me for this advice.  It really made me want to throw-up when I went down there and how unclean it was.  I wish there were portable showers cause I felt so dirty when I came out of there....

Anyhow...onto the review.  As I was saying...if I were blind or poorly sighted...this place would be awesome!  From price to taste to service...it was all pretty bang on.  The portions were large and the food was just delicious.  We had the pork bone soup, dumplings of course and beef  wrapped rolls.  I have to say...when we first walked in...expectations were at 0...and then BOOYA!  food was fantastic.  

Although I expected to get food poisoning or see a rat run across the floor and the building to collapse at any moment....none of these things that my wild imagination dreamt up happened.  We left very satisfied and a smile on our face.  

We will be back...but likely for takeout.  Not sure I can handle the sight of this place...maybe I'm just a snob... :(  I guess I'm more high maintenance than I'm willing to admit...."
4,I went here after a short trip to Las Vegas...the restaurant is located in the Red Rock Hotel and Casino in Summerlin. I didn't know that this was a large sandwich chain like Subway or Jersey Mike's. I ordered a foot long meatball sub and I have to admit that it was really good. The sauce was excellent and had spices that I really couldn't identify. Overall a great experience.
4,"Ok fellow yelpers....show your check in yelp free drink before you pay.

Still bitter they didn't honor the free drink because I was two seconds too late.

Order in the order line, pay in the pay line...you would think its obvious but no joke people were waiting 10 people ahead before learning they were in the wrong line.

For the actual review: The sandwiches are consistently delicious. Capistrami is my favorite. Something about the Russian slaw paired with the pastrami here is so perfect. A little bit of sweet and savory wrapped in a bun. yum.... My hubby loves the cheesesteak and claims it was the best meal in Red Rock. Sandwiches were $8-$9 so pricey for a sandwich.

Moral of the review: it's a little pricey but a worthwhile meal as long as you pay AFTER you show your yelp deal"
4,Ate here many times and we love it!  The generals chicken is exactly like PF Changs but less cost. My friend has had the orange chicken and loved it.
4,"The broth was very good. We ordered the spicy broth - one 3 spice level and the other 2. The 3 spice level was too spicy we cannot take it.  To change it, we need to pay for another broth soup. 

The food options were lots and the service was very good. 

We waited for 30 minutes before we get a seat during peak hours - around 7:30pm on a weekend. 

The only thing the price is a lot higher compare to other hot pot restaurants. 

Would definitely go back back again."
4,"I used to think about the one time I went to Valdez all the time, and when they closed down I was in a panic until I learned that Baro is the reincarnation. Finally got to try it, was not disappointed. I liked everything I had. Shrimp Ceviche, OG Duck Chaufa (which is ammmmaazinngg), my drink was great (though I can't remember the name of it) and even though I was so full and didn't want desert, I couldn't help but finish the churros suggested to us. It is on the pricey side - but I would rather spend the money here over many other restaurants in that strip. Not sure if seating for 2 has that many options (we were seated at the kitchen bar, but we didn't see any other small tables on the first floor)."
4,This place has an aggregate 3 stars only because it has so many reviews. This is definitely a 4 star place. Im 61 and I have been to China twice and I have been to Chinese restaurants in most large cities in the US. It just doesn't get much better. We don't see many Asians there because they don't exist in Madison but I can tell they are in the kitchen. This place is a total classic American Chinese restaurant. Everything is delicious and there are always leftovers. The building is beautiful. Imperial Garden deserves support.
4,"We have been looking for a place to fill the void of our favourite dumpling restaurant closing down at Midland and Finch years ago. This place fit the bill nicely! Their fried dumplings are amazing, and the steamed dumplings are good too, they just take longer to come out of the kitchen understandably. Cash only though."
4,"I called a few days prior to bringing in my car for an oil change. There clearly wasn't any need. The guy who came to the desk didn't look for any appointment book. It took 45 minutes from when he pulled my car around, 1:20 from when I got there. 

It was $25 for an oil change. I'd most likely return, just not on my lunch break."
4,"Wonderful service and ambiance! We sat outside, and it was absolutely perfect. They have heaters outside for the colder weather, which is great. The biscuits and fig jam is to die for!!! Best biscuit I've ever had. I had to get an extra to take home with me for breakfast. 

My boyfriend ordered the brisket pot roast, which had great flavor and laid in delicious mashed potatoes. The fried chicken and collard greens are good, but the breaking was a little spicy for my taste. I prefer breast/white meat over chicken thigh/dark meat for fried chicken, but it was still certainly better and more authentically Southern than anywhere else in Madison. The mint juleps are great! We will definitely be back."
4,Very good food!  Recommended by co-workers and worth the trip. The black bean burger was perfect and the mussels were delicious in the spicy tomato sauce with andouille sausage.  The music trivia was icing on the experience cake with the whole place joining in!
4,"Strolled in at a cool 11:00 pm on a Friday night. Was greeted and sent to the second floor for some cocktails by two hostesses that were very helpful. Atmosphere was very fun and groovy. Bartender named Max was awesome, as were his old fashions (8.5/10) if Max makes it (12/10). Plus he was a real snake charmer. Seating was slightly below average and by slightly I mean extremely below. Would return."
4,"The service was great, food was (omg) delicious, and their mango lassi and milk shake was amazing!

We ordered:
Cheese Masala Dosa (8/10)
Devil Chicken (7/10) I might be a bit bias about this one 
Butter Chicken (9/10)
Mutton Biriyani (9/10)
Garlic Naan and Cheese Naan (10/10)
Mango Lassi (9/10)
Mango Milkshake (10/10)

The only downside is that the prices are a bit more expensive than others.

Amazing first experience, can't wait to come back!"
4,"4.5 stars.

I bought a Groupon for this place (after checking the great reviews on Yelp) and went last night with my wife and a neighbour.  We had the following;

Aloo Gobi Masala...9.99
-Potatoes and cauliflower in Indian gravy
Mutter Paneer...10.99
-Peas and cottage cheese curry
Dal Makhni...8.99
-Home-style black lentils
Kathirikkai Kara Kulambu...8.99
-Spicy and sour eggplant curry, goes well with rice

They were all very good and had distinct flavours.  The eggplant was quite spicy (hot).  There were plenty of cheese cubes in the mutter paneer.  We also had an order of plain rice, plain naan and raita.

My mango lassi was excellent.  Very thick and mango-y, without being overly sweet. 

The only weakness occurred when we ordered Papadum as an appetizer.  There were three of us, and she brought 2 papadums.  Weird.

It is clean, has nice decor, and is worth the drive to Scarborough."
4,"5.99 Steak and Eggs.  The steak was great, three eggs, and home fries.  

Had a whole side of the restaurant to myself around midnight, Tuesday morning.  

Bartender served me, nice guy.  Watch out for smart-ass bikers though."
4,"I've been coming to this particular Sierra Gold location for about 3 years now and I've always had good experiences. The bar staff is friendly, and love to engage in sports talk with their customers. The place is an upscale version of PTs all over the valley. I particularly like the fact that they have TVs all over the place, so they can show all of the games at once. They have additional rooms that can be reserved for viewing parties, and they'll even put the sound of your game on if you're an early requestor. They run specials on the food, usually super early in the morning at 6 am. The food however, tastes a little under par; I've always really liked the variety of wings they have but most of the other menu items for some reason don't quite carry the flavor of other establishments. If I was going to primarily eat food, then I'd rather choose other establishments around town.

All in all, I like coming here because of the staff. The beer is reasonably priced, and you'll never have any trouble finding any of the games you're trying to see; especially since they have TVs imbedded in the mirrors in the bathrooms."
4,"Nice sandwich shop with a bit of an East Coast Italian feel.  Cheesesteaks, meatball sandwiches, cole slaw on sandwiches, and a seeming bent for turkey as well.  Nice veggie options as well.  Overall, not the broadest menu selection I've seen but the food is good and it's convenient if you're at the Red Rock and don't want to deal with the big lines at the buffet or Grand Cafe."
4,"I recently bought a new car here. This was the fourth new car i purchased.  It was an over all good experience. 

I am just as protective of my time as I am with my money, so buy a car is always stressful.  I hate to give up either!  I got the deal I wanted, probably not the best deal. BUT I got in and out with a new car in two and a half hours. Which definitely impressed me.  

They were fair with my trade in. 

I felt like I was more knowledgable about the car and their competition then my sales person was.  That disappoints me. Competence is important.  

I was frustrated with the finance department. Not for finance issues though.  They made a few errors in documentation and the supervisor called me (at work) to chastise me about them needing to meet their deadlines. I ended up having to come back to sign a new contract.  (This was all because of miscalculation, not my credit). I clarify, because I think financing gets a bad rap just because people have credit issues.  

In summary, I feel good about my experience and would recommend this dealership for anyone in the east valley looking at Mazdas.  
*I have not purchases a Mazda before*"
4,"Their sweet and sour pork was very succulent and tasty. Probably the most delicious sweet and sour pork I've ever tasted. Once I've tasted this dish I never bother ordering it from other places.

The dishes I've ever ordered from the restaurant always come in a large portion. Tasted pretty good too. Except for one time when I ordered stir fried vegetables with mushroom it was lacking in flavour as it was too watery, as if the sauce was watered down. But nonetheless I'd go back again to try the other dishes."
4,"I came here with a couple girl friends for dinner on a Wednesday. Great ambiance. The food was good. The Churros were to die for!!!! All in all, it was a great experience and will take more friends here for a fun night!"
4,"Overall great
They were very patient with our 14 month old!
Food good, service and interior great!"
4,"Food was great; service was ok. We had a reservation for 7 p.m. on a Saturday, but we got caught in some stupid Pan-Am games traffic and ended up getting there around 7:20. They had given away our table by then (despite us calling first) but we only had to wait another 10-15 minutes to get a new table. 

Once we sat down and ordered, our food came super fast! We got four pots of broth, two spicy and two non-spicy, to share among six of us, which I think was plenty. The best items were the meat, which seemed to be pretty good quality; the stuffed meatball (beware of the hot cheese); the shrimp wonton; the fried mantou (served hot!) with the condensed milk dipping sauce; and I liked that their taro was in small pieces and pre-fried so it wouldn't take too long to cook. While our first batch came quickly, the other stuff we ordered came more piecemeal or required us to remind the waiter a second time. 

Things I wish they had: a sauce bar, like many places in Taiwan (though I did pretty well ordering the garlic sauce, sha-cha and chopped chives and mixing it all up); clams in the seafood options; Chinese cabbage (gao-li cai) and baby corn in the veggies; but overall I think they provided a pretty good list for an AYCE. 

The free ice cream at the end is also a nice touch. 

Though they have a two-hour limit, it wasn't enforced when we were there, probably because there wasn't a line when we were eating."
4,Beautiful ethnic decor and good food. Their egg pepper dry fry as an appetizer is zingy & delicious. Their dosas are very good with ample amount of spicy potato filling. Their veg-biryani was excellent. The staff is very friendly and dining here is a pleasant experience.
4,"I was kind of skeptical at first due to the rating on yelp but decided to try anyways.  I was quite surprised,  the food quality was pretty fresh,  service was not bad,  however some of the servers don't understand English that well but we were able to get a hold off a couple that did understand, and they are very kind and provided great service to us. 

One item I don't usually see at hotpot is the cheese beef ball,  it tastes as good as it sounds,  definitely get an order if you go, you won't regret it.  Asides from that,  everything is your standard hotpot items from your typical all you can eat hotpot.   Everyone gets their own pot,  and there are no free standard soup bases,  so expect to spend about $37 after tax and tip without drinks."
4,This has to be one of the best chain restaurants around. The service is always fast and friendly and the food never dissapoints. The bone in ribeye is amazing.
4,"The restaurant serves Korean/Chinese food .
They are dumpling are very big and cheap( $4.99 for 14 pieces)!This is my favorite dumpling place to eat dumpling.
the pork bone soup is very good and big.
The cold noodle soup is so so good! because i'm not really like cold noodle.
the staffs are very nice
so it's very good and cheap place to eat ."
4,"This place was recommended by one of the guys at our retreat, so we decided to try it.
The food menu here is extensive and moderately priced ($10-$20) 
This Chinese restaurant attempts to cover several other cuisines like Thai food.
I ordered the Spicy Basil Tofu which was perfectly done. Not too spicy, but very flavorful and savory.
Ambiance is very Asian with lots of oriental lanterns. Lots of reds and the space is great for large groups. It  was probably one of the best sit-down Chinese restaurants I have been to."
4,"I was in town visiting family and someone suggested IG. When I drove up to it, it brought back yummy memories. It's been years since I ate there. I am glad we went there for dinner. We ate governors chicken, governors beef, sweet and sour chicken, peppered beef and beef chow fun. Everyone ate their plates! Service was slow that night but the food made up for it!"
4,"This restaurant is a hidden gem located slightly east of Midland Ave. and can easily be driven by if you aren't paying attention!  The tip off is that there is a 2-4-1 Pizza on the corner for you to turn in.

I love this place and cannot think of a better value for one of my favourite things to eat in the whole world.  Everytime, we have relatives coming up from the states, they always want to come here (and my stomach is more than willing to oblige!) 
 
The restaurant offers a mix of Chinese and Korean food.  

Now this place is called Dumpling Village for a reason.  We always enjoy getting the assorted as it has a mix of different types of meat and vegetable dumplings.  The longer pan fried dumplings (comes in 5) and the smaller dumplings of 15 are also nice and doughy and made fresh to order.  

The meat rolled in an onion pancake is excellent as it is always very very tender with a light sauce.  I love the fact that they will always try to cut it into the appropriate number of pieces so that everyone at the table gets one.  

The Korean Pork Bone soup is an excellent choice for the colder weather.  I have to admit that we don't order the Korean food as much since I am too busy stuffing my face with dumplings.  

For those a little more adventurous, the egg white dessert filled with red bean with a light coating of sugar.  Careful, this is really HOT when it is served so wait a bit before biting into this.  

Here are some tips that I have learned in the many many times that I have eaten here.  

This place does take reservations so don't hesitate to call.  This is especially advisable if you have a large party since they don't really have that many tables that can seat 8 or more.  

The waitresses are generally always the same 3 people.  When it is busy you will have to flag them down to get your teapot refilled or to even get your complimentary kimchee and bean dish.  Don't be afraid to stick-your-hand-up-in-the-air like grade school to get their attention.  

They will leave on vacation and the WHOLE restaurant is shut down. Nothing is more disappointing than being ready to eat and finding out that they won't be back for another month.  This past year, they were gone for all of February and have been known to take the odd week as well.  All the more reason to call than risk disappointment!"
4,"Located inside the Red Rock Casino by the movie theater. Good place for a quick meal. Good sub for your money. If you check in you get a free large drink and they do free refills for it. It is not like a typical sub place, the sizes for sandwiches go from 9"" , 12"", to 20"". My boyfriend and I got the meatball and cheese steak subs. Good quality, not horrible, not amazing, but good.They are definitely better than subways though. Definitely will go there again if we're in the area."
4,"Since this is my first review, on Yelp,  let me recommend a Pho place in my neck of the wood.  If you want the best Vietnamese food in the GTA, you must head to North York.  This is where most of the Vietnamese live.   Although recently, they move north of HWY 7 to Vaughan, most of the best diner still can be found in North York.  

Pho Mi Asia is the place to go for the best Bún bò Hu and Banh Xeo.
The broth for the Bún bò Hu is thick and tasty and they give you a large portion of fresh veggie.  The Banh Xeo is hugggge and crispy with slice of pork skin and pork fat.

By the way, their Pho is good too.

The only down side to this place is that their Cha Gio, Vietnamese Spring Roll, is good but not the best.  For the best Cha Gio, go to Pho Mi 99 on Jane and Finch. 

So...why not 5-stars..becuase I've eaten at better Vietnamese restaurants  in LA, but this is number one on my list, in TO."
4,"Ate here for the first time today. All I gotta say is they are way better than subway sandwich!!

They have 3 sizes of sandwich bread, the largest being 20 inch.. Right next to movie theater. Chicken sandwich real good. I did not give them the five star because they only have one kind of bread which is white bread.  Tell them BigDaddy sent u..!!"
4,"Absolutely in love with Capriotti's. Although, the prices can be a bit pricey, but most of the time it's definitely worth it.

The Bobby is absolutely amazing if you love having turkey sandwiches. Turkey, gravy, & stuffing in a delicious roll [it comes with cranberry sauce, but I'm not a big fan of any cranberry sauce on my turkey]. But while the Bobby is amazing, their Cheese steak is by far my favorite. You definitely have to get both sweet and hot peppers to make it extra delicious.

The one thing I dislike about this specific location is that they only offer two sizes, while most other Capriottis offers three different sizes. The Red Rock location, for some reason, does not offer large sandwiches. 

Other than that, go and enjoy. Eat a sandwich while gambling, or even sneak it into the movie theater to enjoy during your current movie choice."
4,"I can't stop thinking about the delicious food I had for dinner last night, which prompted me to write my first yelp review.  Although it is a small restaurant by Yorkdale, I could tell I was in for a treat as this place was already packed with a line up of people at the front entrance, which is usually a good sign. 

We were seated pretty quickly at the end of a long table with other customers, who were friendly enough to tell us which number they ordered as it was the noodle dish with the shrimp cracker and seafood soup, ""My Tho"", I think it is called? Compared to other ones I have had in the past, the shrimp cracker was bigger and you have the option of ordering the soup with the noodle or on the side. The noodles were flavoured with a soy and hoisin sauce with BBQ pork in it, and the seafood soup was perfect for the cold weather outside with pieces of squid, shrimp, and fish balls floating around sprinkled with generous helping of chopped green onion.   

Also ordered the ""Cha Gio"" spring rolls that seemed to have more taro in it, which I thought were tasty but I've been told that there are better ones elsewhere.  And of course, I also usually have the jack fruit milkshake along with my meal, which came in a plastic cup that seemed more suitable if I was ordering take out...but maybe I'm just being picky about my dine in experience.  Anyways, I can't wait to go back to try their Pho and Banh Xeo!"
4,"A wonderful and extremely reasonably priced restaurant --you really get above and beyond what you pay for here.

Recommendations: All sorts of dumplings of course, including:

- pork & sour cabbage dumplings are excellent 
- likewise are pork & mushroom dumplings 
- spicy lamb dumplings are my absolute favorite

They also have a variety of cold noodles, crispy shrimp, crispy eggplant, all of which are worth ordering!"
4,"Hidden Chinese Gem. ""Dumpling Restaurant,"" You would think the marketing tactic and point of differentiation is more evident. Googling dumpling restaurant, you can probably come up with countless searches well before this, simply because the name is jaw-dropping and outstandingly unique. That said, you'd be surprised at how tasty the food is, contrary to what it's boring signage would suggest. 

Service is not ideal, decor isn't exactly luxurious and up-scale, I'm really selling this aren't I? But the food and the price point? My goodness it's so worth the unequivocal stark contrast in service, decor, and signage. 

The steamed dumplings contents within are flavorful but not overpowering, the skin is just the right thickness, and coming out of the stove at the right time, it makes any living being salivate. My parents would always pre-order 200 frozen ones to go because that`s how good they are. The fried meats are tangy, crispy, yet filled with tender meats within. Sided with a cold dish that is refreshing, this meal is a big win for quantity at a very descent price.

Close your eyes if you`re someone that enjoys lounging in up-scale ambiance, but this place is a must try if you`re in the area. Worst case is you don`t like it, but it definitely doesn't make a dent in your wallet. So why not give a safe bet a chance?"
4,"Dropped off early at the airport. What to do? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? Lo-Lo's or Matt's? I'm a big fan of both restaurants, but have tried neither airport location as of yet. Sometimes proximity to an escalator is all it takes to sway me. Lo-Lo's it is!

I was a bit concerned by previous reviews. Harsh! My reaction to this spot? It's not S. Phoenix. It's not Scottsdale. It's Sky Harbor Airport. If you reduce your expectations accordingly, it's not bad. The staff was very friendly. The Lil Jay, eggs and waffle for six bucks, is not a bad deal for an airport. The cheesy scrambled eggs were great. The waffle suffered from being crammed into a styrofoam container, but was recognizable as Lo-Lo's. 

I'm curious to see how they handle the chicken here, so I'll back. Next morning airport visit? Have to check out Matt's.

It's difficult to recreate a local restaurant experience in an airport, especially one as unique as the S. Phoenix Lo-Lo's. Abbreviated menu. Portable delivery. No individualized seating area. Lo-Lo's is still working on it, but they're headed the right direction and I suspect they will eventually get it right."
4,Ordered pork dumplings and fried noodles with beef on a Saturday night. Wait was about 15 minutes. Both menu items were good!
4,"Where there with friends and we shared a number of the dishes on the menu.

We started out with the terrine, the cornbread and the pimento cheese. Terrine was distinctly smocked and served with a sweet, grainy mustard, salty, pickled green beans and toasted bread. Very good. The cornbread was amazing. Not sure what they did to it, but it was sweet, crispy, chewy, moist and perfectly caramelized on the outside. Basically it hit every note: highly recommended! Pimento cheese was a bit meh. Nothing special.

Then we had the fried chicken, the pot roast and the perlou. All was good, but the chicken was the star! It was so good we ordered a second round. And not only was the chicken good, but the collards it came with were amazing too: tender and sweet, with some smokiness from the ham. Perlou was spicy and crunchy, but really you could not tell there was fish in there. Good in a drunk food kind of way. Pot roast was very tender and well flavored.

We rounded off the meal with the sweet potato pie. Not too sweet, rich, creamy and with a perfectly crunchy crust. Better than expected.

For drinks I had a julep. Strong, but I enjoyed it.

Now let's get to service. Way too fast! The waitress was always trying to took away our dishes before we were done. We commented on that several times and made a joke of trying to shield our food. We were not very successful. Now I appreciate prompt service as much as the next person, but there is a point at which prompt becomes rushed and you start feeling like they are trying to turn tables as quickly as possible and get us out of their way. That is exactly how we felt. As a comeback we stayed and chatted as long as possible!"
4,"Great place to come if you want a nice, cheap meal! The only reason I took one star off is because the quality of the food varies depending on how busy the place is.
On a quiet weekday afternoon, the pot stickers I ordered were hot and perfectly crispy at the bottom. On a busy weekend, the bottoms were pretty sad and soggy. However, despite these criticisms the potstickers are my favourite and are super juicy! Be careful of hot juices spilling out your first bite.
Everything I've had here has been tasty, and everything is so inexpensive (an odd thing is that one time I ordered a bibimbap and they placed the veggies at the bottom of the stone pot and it ended up burning, I'm not sure if this was just a one time mistake, or if they just don't know how to make bibimbap in a hot stone bowl).
The interior is not the nicest, and the service is not spectacular but that's to be expected from a typical Chinese restaurant. No complaints here!
Will definitely be coming back."
4,"Came here on a Monday night at 8pm and it was PACKED! Had to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table for two. The atmosphere is very busy, and very clean. It is definitely on the higher end of hot-pot restaurants (which is definitely reflected in the price). The total cost of our dinner for two was just under $70.. which included the price for two small soup bases (pork bone and satay). The waitress recommended getting two small pots instead of a large split pot because you have to pay an extra $3-4 for a split pot.

I liked the satay soup base a lot more than the pork bone one, would definitely get that one again! The meat quality is good, and the service is quick. Our waitress was really friendly. I did not see the appeal in the fried buns with condensed milk that everyone else does... the buns were kind of cold and hard.. maybe they were old since it was around 9pm when we got them. 

Although it is a little pricey, I don't mind spending a little more once in a while for good hot pot."
4,"This is a very good Chinese restaurant, we have gone there for years. I am shocked by the bad reviews and would suggest you ignore them, this is good Chinese food!"
4,"I came here last night with 4 friends and had a decent experience.  
We ordered 2 large pots, which gave us the option to 4 soup base.  We had the satay soup base in both pots, along with this mushroom flavour and corn flavour. (I forgot the exact name) The soup bases were all unique, but the satay is my favourite.  

In terms of the food, they have a very wide selection, including seafood.  But for the price you pay, you shouldn't be expecting any less. The service here is also worth mentioning.  Our waiter was very courteous and friendly, checking up on us often.  All the food came quickly, so we always had food on the table!  

Overall, Morals is an excellent hot pot place with great service.  Although it is a little pricier compared to most, you pay for the quality and well decorated atmosphere."
4,"Went here with 3 friends on a Sunday. We got there around 12pm - I would say this was just before the rush. Very nice looking environment.

Lots of different options on the menu. I got the 10-year special soup base, really flavorful and spicy. I'm not a huge fan of the individual personal pots because hot pot is always a big group activity kind of thing for me. All the meats were really fresh. Menu pretty much has everything you ever need for hot pot. Service was a little slow, but nothing crazy. I would definitely come back."
4,"I needed to buy a hard drive at Staples* so I stopped here for a late lunch/snack.  The table next to me ordered a butter chicken and biryani. I went with a Masala Cheese Dosa for $13.99. At that (high) price, I could have had a meat or seafood dish but I really wanted a dosa. In fact, I decided recently that I should learn to make dosas at home so that we could all enjoy them without spending $100.

My dosa arrived promptly - even before my neighbours' order. At first sight, I started to feel happy. Then, I smelled it. Very happy now. First taste of the crispy dosa and curried potato filling. In Nirvana! Learning to make my own dosa? Fuhgeddaboudit!

I overheard my neighbours asking the waiter about my order. I told them what it was and mentioned that it was delicious. The man exclaimed, ""I know! I had it last time I was here but couldn't remember the name so I couldn't order it!""  He, he. Felt a little sorry for him but just a little.

* Btw, the Staples store is many kilometres away. I just needed an excuse to get my dosa fix."
4,"Authentic good quality food in an old style Chinese restaurant setting.  Very satisfied overall with my first visit.  Second visit included my six year old which was not so good, they don't even have crayons for a child."
4,Quick and fast viet restaurants with good dried noodles and pho. Pretty cheap and you get what you would expect from these type of quick Vietnamese establishments. Don't expect the service to be amazing.
4,"This is a good, cheap steak. For about $11, you can get an 8 oz sirloin with two sides. There is an 8 oz sirloin and BBQ chicken breast combo for around $14 which is also very good. I always opt for the salad and baked potato. My friend had the pulled pork platter for $8 today and enjoyed it. They are not fancy steaks, but I don't really care for super fancy steaks. If I am in the mood for some high protein meals that won't really send me in the poorhouse, I will come here. I still may prefer Outback, but the service has always been friendly and usually by cute girls that I creep out with my creepy friends."
4,"After craving for some South India food and being disappointed by many restaurants I came upon this place.

During the first visit I had the Veg. thali and Mr. H had the Uttappam. We also tried the Mutton Sukka and they were all delicious. The Mutton Sukka actually would make me come back... again and again.

During the second visit Mr. H and I both tried their biriyani's (Chicken and Mutton) and Oh My God! It was the best thing ever! The rice was so soft and moist, the mutton would melt in your mouth and the spicy flavour was just right. 

Once again however, my food was better than Mr. H's, he did like his Chicken Biriyani a lot but the Mutton was awesome. Their service is pretty good and fast.

Next time I try the fish biriyani. :)"
4,"This restaurant is brand new, and we waited a couple weeks to try it. Downtown Cramerton is extremely quaint, and we already have a favorite restaurant there (South Fork Deli). This is a wonderful addition to the downtown area! Very different type of food from South Fork, but also delicious!

The restaurant itself is on the dark side with lots of wood and not much lighting, but it's not unwelcoming by any means. We sat in a booth and it felt fairly private. There are big screen TV's to watch the games, but they aren't overpowering if you just want to sit and dine. (We went around 6 pm, so I'm not sure how this changes as it gets later).

Food wise, it was good. We would order some things again, and probably not order others - but everything was fresh, homemade, and unique! The menu is not huge but allows for a lot of customization.

Appetizer: We got the chips and queso. The chips were good. The queso was on-point with taste, and was definitely homemade and not from a can! But, the consistency was off. It was heavy and not as ""runny"" as I would have liked... more like a guacamole consistency. We would probably not order it again.

Drinks: We split two mojitos - black raspberry and regular. Again, we would probably not order them but more because of personal taste. They were VERY sweet, but the flavor was good. They used fresh mint leaves which was a huge plus! Just too sweet for us - but not a bad reflection on the bartender by any means.

Dinner: My husband just got a house salad and it was great! Lots more toppings than a standard house salad. I got the southwest chicken salad and it had corn, black beans, chicken tenders, spring mix, pico de gallo, and a BBQ ranch. The greens were fresh, the chicken tenders were impeccable, and the corn was clearly freshly grilled and cut right off the cob! DELICIOUS! The BBQ ranch sauce was delicious, although it got a little too spicy for me toward the end. However, the taste was on point - unique, delicious, and definitely something I would order again.

Something else great about this restaurant was the service! They were busy, but all workers were helping one another. Multiple servers brought our meals, cleaned up dishes, etc. The manager/owner (not sure) stopped by every table to thank us for visiting and ask how our meals were. Our server was quick with refills, the check, etc, but we never felt rushed. I hope that the enthusiasm with service continues as the restaurant loses the ""newness."" It's nice to see a group of employees working together and keeping a restaurant moving!

Overall, the restaurant was slightly pricey, but quality was second to none. Even the food that we didn't love, was still made well and with fresh ingredients. We look forward to trying something new on the menu next time we come."
4,"This was our second visit. One thing we found out is that they serve lunch until 4, so that might be a good way to try it out without spending a lot of $."
4,"I dined here with a couple of my friends. I was super excited to have some southern food as I have not been impressed with any other place in town.  For a drink, I ordered the Bourbon Sweet Tea. I thought it lacked flavor, would not order that again. For my main dish, I got the shrimp and grits. It was VERY good. The grits were cooked perfectly. The other two I was dining with ordered something different so we could try all the dishes. One ordered the Fried Chicken and Greens, and the other ordered the Perlou. The Fried Chicken and Greens were good. I enjoyed the greens. The bite of fried chicken I had was a little too breaded for my liking.  The Perlou was very tasty - would not recommend if you don't like spicy as it does have a kick.  We ordered corn bread for an appetizer, and it was VERY good.  Overall it was a pleasant dining experience. I felt that there prices were a little high."
4,"All you can eat hot pot! What more can you say. Certainly seems like Hot pot is the new trend in Toronto nowadays. Morals location wise is the somewhat new T&T/Condo plaza in Markham. Parking I have to say is quite horrendous. They do have underground parking which you can usually find a spot but it is still a bit of a walk to the restaurant. I went on a late week day night so there was not a wait to get a table. The service is somewhat attentive, english/chinese speakers beware. Service is mainly in Mandarin or the traditional ordering language of finger menu pointing. A few orders were missed which was expected and not that big of an issue. They do have quite a few different type of soup bases that are not seen in other Hot Pot places which is nice but then they do charge a premium for them. I tried the tomato one which is nice and sweet but then again when its hot pot all that matters is if its spicy or not. Probably will just stick to regular type soup next time. The food seemed fresh and the service was quick to add water and take away empty plates. They have all the usual types of meats/balls/veggies but not much seafood at all unless getting charged extra which is a shame. Most of the other places will include some basic seafood items. The only complain I would have is that their dessert/ice cream is quite disappointing. You can only get ONE ice cream person and thats it. I do not understand that for an all you can eat place. That aside, if you are ok with all the extra charges for premium items Morels is pretty good. A little higher scale type of hot pot."
4,"Pad Thai noodles, fried wontons and mayonnaise shrimp were excellent!  Fried rice, so-so.  Service was good."
4,Food is good but the place isn't cozy. Been coming here for a quick meals. Try their special pho. Prices are cheap considering the servings.
4,"Long overdue review on this place. Went to try this place out over the Christmas holidays since I heard pretty good things about this place. 

Went in at 6 o'clock which I thought was pretty early and already it was packed. Assuming it was during holidays so figured it's busier than normal. The decor is very modern and bright compared to alot of other hot pot places. 

There's plentiful of choice and selection off the menu and their drinks are pretty neat as well, quite different from other traditional pot pot places where you can only choose from pop, or pear drink. 

Got a split of two soup bases, one tomato vegetable soup and one spicy. We tried out just mild for the spicy soup and good thing only 2 peppers because it was really spicy! AHHH! Cant imagine if I had gotten 3 peppers.... 

Lots of meat choices,veggies and seafood as well. Service was pretty quick and attentative in responding to our requests in getting more food and clearing the table of finished bowls and plates. 

This place is a bit more pricey than other hot pot's but definitely I feel you get a bit more from this place and the quality of the items on their menu is better than most. Good place to try out."
4,"I had to meet someone for lunch in west Toronto near 401, and had no idea where to go. A Chowhound friend suggested Pho Mi Asia. (She has since been banned from Chow for an unbelievably stupid reason!) 
 
It turned out to be a great place to go to. We arrived just after the lunch hour crowd, but it was still fairly busy and the kitchen and waitresses kept everything moving smoothly. We had three orders of medium pho (huge!) and one order of squid in black bean sauce.
The food arrived very quickly, all at once, and was perfectly cooked and spiced. The pho broth was excellent, and I guess they are getting a reputation for genuine pork broth. At least, that was my take on it, but I'm no expert on Viet food, yet!

Service was generally excellent, mostly by young students (I think) with fairly good English.

I would go back to this place any time I'm in the area, or maybe check out the Mississauga location."
4,"This themed resturant serves mainly steak but does really well with other species too.
I ordered a medium rare 12oz Ribeye last time I was there. The server asked me to check doneness before leaving and will replace your steak if it's not done right (the table next to mine had that problem). The side steamed vegetables were cooked just so it's still crunchy and fresh. The side green bean was a little disappointing because it was too salty. 
But with a name like Texas Roadhouse, most would think that their best dishes are of the cow persuasion. However, I beg to differ. They have the most delightful (barring Chik-fi-let) chicken fingers, named Chicken Critters, I've had anywhere. It's fried with a delicious batter and served with your dipping sauce of choice. Their default dipping sauce is honey mustard but you should order it with breakfast gravy (white) for a true Southern (Southwest) taste.
There weren't too much peanut shells on the floor as the other TR I've been to in the South but I tell you what, the food tastes the same. So if you're lookin' for a grand ole time eatin' and listenin' to country music. Give this joint a try."
4,"This place actually took me by surprise. Their drinks are a little over priced, but whatever. Their pho was actually not bad. We were just looking for something close by to Yorkdale. It was only about 5 minutes away in the ghetto area of North York it seems. LOL! If we're ever in the area again I'd definitely go back!"
4,"Baro, nice cozy spot, with a young, latin vibe. Great service and fun music. Enjoyed the mixed platter of ceviche and some st simon oysters.  Although I was clearly the oldest person there, I felt very at home. I recommend if you are in the neighbourhood. :)"
4,Yum. Check out back of menu soups. Very good!
4,"A decent place for a chettinadu cuisine. Nothing is bad at this place, ambiance, menu & service. I like their devil chicken."
4,"The dishes showed that everything was cooked after we ordered them...everything was very hot and delicious so the short 10-minute wait was well worth it. The pork potstickers had a very crispy, golden brown side. The pork filling was not excessively fatty and there was a lot of it! It was flavourful even without the ginger, although i did add my favourite vinegar just for my liking. We also ordered the steamed pork and bok choy dumplings. I rarely eat it but I might start ordering more of it. The wrapping was chewy and the perfect thickness. I think the filling was similar to that of the potstickers. Lastly, we had the red cooked beef noodle soup. It is one of my favourite dishes to order anywhere that has it! The flavour is very unlike the Taiwanese style, and tastes more Chinese. I still thought it was yummy though. It had chewy, thick noodles (that we suspect was homemade), large non-fatty chunks of meat, and a few bok choy. 

Oh, I ordered the pork bone soup before, and it was not my favourite. It tasted nothing like the Korean ones I usually have, which was kind of expected. It had a lot of meat and potatoes, but the flavour was again, more Chinese.

The most important thing is that this restaurant is very affordable! All the dishes are large in portion and a few dollars less compared to in other restaurants. The ambience is very simple, but the tables are spaced out, quiet and it became cleaner over the years. My family loves coming back for lunch or an afternoon break during the weekend."
4,"Capriotti's is my favorite sub place to go in Vegas. Even though most people like the ""bobbie"" my favorite is the turkey. I get it with mayo or oil depending on my mood with cheese tomato and lettuce. I also have to get pickles and their peppers. Their peppers are amazing and spicy. My mouth is watering thinking about their pepper mix. It definitely makes the sandwich. If you're looking for a meal on the go I reccommend these subs."
4,"First time in.  Visiting friends from the area. Nice atmosphere, warm and inviting. The food was good, nice portions.  I am saying a 4 star rating because they need to work on the service. Not terrible but there is room for improvement. It maybe a new business and they maybe working the bugs out.  Everything else was wonderful!"
4,"From what my beau says, this is East Coast style Chinese. So I said""ok..I kind of like it.""
We order from this place at least once a month and we always get the Hong Kong style noodles. Because it's so good. We rotate with the beef and broccoli and the walnut shrimp is always savory. The prices are a bit higher, but they seriously cook to order. Delivery time is usually 20-30 minutes. And I live 2 blocks from this place. 
FYI, stay away from the boba. It is watered down and the boba is either too hard/soft."
4,"Pretty good.
Made a reservation a day in advance since I was bringing a group of 8. 
Service was alright, the server took our orders fairly fast and the soup and food arrived fairly fast.
Drinks are pricey. The good soup bases are sort of pricey."
4,"I think good Chinese food is hard to find, and this is the best in Madison. If there is a better place, I would like to know. I just had the Governor's Chicken. I asked for all white meat and got it. The chicken fried rice was good too.

There was a lot of food in the dinner portions, so it made for great leftovers the next day. I did carryout, and it was ready when promised.

Mark me as a satisfied customer."
4,"Pretty decent but so spacious!  Very good for kids and you can order dim sum! They're open!!

Free wifi and awesome :)"
4,"3 stars for the food...pretty standard HK cafe fare.  Extra star because I value good service, and, for an Asian place, they definitely went above and beyond to merit that.  Plus, I have yet to come across a place that serves tofu fa as dessert...so that was a pleasant surprise!

Ordered some standard stuff: a pork chop rice and some beef spaghetti dish.  Nothing special re the pork chop rice.  Same goes for the spaghetti.  Only thing is, either the wait staff or the kitchen messed up the meat on the spaghetti (i.e. they put fish instead of beef), and we sent it back.  They were SO GOOD about fixing the dish to the correct order.

The HK milk tea and lemon tea that we ordered were ok.  We'll come back again and try other dishes!"
4,"I came here on a Saturday for lunch with my bf and his dad since we were in the area. I was craving banh xeo, the Viet crepe, and lucky for me they had it. My bf ordered the bun bo hue and his dad ordered pho. 

The banh xeo here is pretty authentic, it came with lots of greens on the side including even some herbs that I didn't recognize but that my bf and his dad recognized (they are Viet). The crepe itself was nice and crispy, at least the top half. Unfortunately, a lot of the oil from the pan made its way to the plate so the bottom half of the crepe got kind of soggy.  It was filled with lots of the requisite bean sprouts and pork, but they were pretty light on the shrimp: one, possibly two pieces of shrimp. 

My bf downed the bun bo hue and said it was probably the best one he's had in Toronto. It came with square chunks of blood (blood jello?) which doesn't always come with it at other restos. His dad gave his approval for his bowl of pho, which means it must've been pretty darn good because he's picky when it comes to pleasing him with food."
4,One of the best steak places in the western suburbs!  You can watch the chefs grill your steaks as you wait.  A great place for families.  We usually make reservations.  Food I'd delicious!  Especially their bread and honey butter.  Great customer service!
4,"NOT BAD FOR EATING AT THE AIRPORT

Chicken: flavorful and crispy if you're lucky. Some of the thighs weren't as crispy which sucked. 

Waffles: average tasted like Roscoes. Only negative was it was soft because it came in a to go box the steam ruined the exterior. 

Gravy: they have two types. The white gravy with sausage was delicious! The LoLo gravy has onions which we passed on. 

Mac and cheese: pretty good. It's the dry thick version which is my fav. 

Corn bread: very dense and semi-moist. Only the center was soft. The exterior was pretty hard and dry. 

I think had we gone to the real LoLo's we would've had better prepared food. But I still gave it a 4 star for it being pretty tasty at the airport."
4,"The best meal I had after four days at Red Rock. Had the Bobby with sliced turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. Fantastic and huge. The meat was flavorful and the stuffing moist and salty, the way I like it. Huge sandwich on a good roll and a great value."
4,"We love this place for fantastic breakfasts!  Bacon, eggs and potatoes are cooked to perfection!  If you can get there between 6 and 10 am, the breakfasts are half price.  This is one of the few places where you can get a generous deal for under 15.00 for two people.  The breakfast choices are all delicious.  We've also been there for lunch. Truly, their burgers are the best in town."
4,"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is legitimately not a bad pick if you ever find yourself stuck in PHX on a layover for whatever reason.

Among the top chicken and waffle joints in the United States, Lo-Lo's is often mentioned among them, and for good reason. This is actually the recommended place of Charles Barkley, and he definitely knows his food, for better or worse. Normally, you wouldn't expect the same level of quality in its airport counterpart. I wouldn't know, since I haven't actually been to the actual place.

However, I can attest that the airport location satisfies the craving just as well. I decided to go with the Puffs Chicken Tender Basket, since I prefer my chicken boneless, and I wasn't let down. I got a few big pieces of chicken, probably one more than they were actually supposed to give me and a tasty waffle. Provided were syrup, butter, and BBQ sauce, all you really need to enjoy a good chicken and waffles dish. I found it very filling for a generous price of $11.95, which I find very good by airport standards.

One thing I'll note is that the sides are really pricey, and as much as I'd like some greens, I'm not paying over $5 for a side of greens. That's one big downer. Nonetheless, the entrees get the job done at just about the right price.

Another thing is that this location is before security, which is unfortunate, so I had to leave the security area to grab my chicken and waffles, but with a few hours to kill, it was well worth it, besides the slow security process back in.

TIP: Definitely get the waffles. I would recommend that with any chicken dish, whether you prefer bone or boneless."
4,"Very inexpensive and the food is good.   Home made noddles are outstanding, you can definitely taste the difference.    $35 for 5 dishes and you will get two meals out of it."
4,"always good to come back.
i visit this restaurant for over 15 years,  if you look for ""straight forward"" Chinese food - this is a very good place.
Try their soup as well as fried calamari - you will thanks me later"
4,"What a great spot for hot pot! I came here with 5 other people on a Tuesday afternoon. I originally made reservations for 1PM, however my friends and I got there early and they were totally fine with accommodating us at an earlier time. 

They selection they have to offer is pretty great. You have a variety of different soup bases, veggies, meats and toppings to choose from. My favorites are the square tofu, chaozhou stuffed fishballs + meatballs and enokitake (these suck up the flavor of the soup really nicely!) Their soft-serve green tea ice cream was also pretty bomb!

Service was great and the restaurant is very clean. I would definitely come back here again!"
4,"This is a good spot to spend a morning watching football. First of all, it is not overcrowded like it is at Buffalo Wild Wings on a Sunday morning. My friends and I arrived at 9:30 am Sunday expecting to fight for a television.  Since we had specific needs- the Cowboys game on 1 television, and the Eagles game on the other, we were unsure if it was going to be possible. 

We set up in a booth that was surrounded by 4 televisions. As soon as the server came over to greet us, I immediately asked if she could accommodate our viewing needs.  Done! In five minutes, we had our games on, and our food ordered.

If you are a proud member of their BEER & BITES club (free to sign up), food is half off before 10:00 am. As a result, I was able to get my Sunday started with a pretty decent breakfast. Scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast for $3.99- YAY!  Oh, and their pizzas are half-off during happy hour- if you are into paper thin crust pizza. I tried the pizza, and thought it was just OK. However, if you drink enough beer- I am sure you will enjoy it.

The atmosphere was laid back, with a private room to watch football if you want to reserve it. They have a few pool tables and a Golden Tee arcade game if you are not into watching football. 

The service was good initially, but tapered off once we ordered our food. It was almost like it was unheard of to order lunch after eating breakfast 3 hours earlier. Prices are good, food is edible, and the vibe is comfortable.

 We will be back-too bad the EAGLES are horrible this year!"
4,Fast and clean service. They didn't have a whole menu and portions were small. The food was thoroughly cooked and very juicy legs. It's a very small review since it's an airport Lolos compared to other ones.
4,"First impression was confusing with the number of menus we have to read before ordering. Once we passed the first hurdle, everything we ordered was tasty. The staff are all very friendly, they gave you decent food for relatively good price. All our meals came with soup and a small dessert. We have gone back to Kitchen M 3 times for quick meals and all have been good. Our favorite is the chicken steak with spaghetti with garlic sauce."
4,The food and service was great for the money. Downfall my husband was sitting off the side of a vent and had dust and debris all over his shirt. The bathrooms had a sewage odor.
4,"Nice decor, place is huge so lots of seating.
Most rice come with soup and drink combo."
4,"Definitely have to thank the Yelp community for looking out on this one... was looking for restaurants reviewed in my ""hood"" so to speak and found this little gem... 

My fiancee ordered the Chicken Pho (medium) which was easily enough for two people and it was very delicious. We've went to Vietnam for 2 weeks a few years ago and she mentioned it was better than Vietnam. Since she is Asia I will take her word for it. 

As for me I had the fried shrimp and vegetables in black bean sauce and I would rate it a 4 out of 5 as they vegetables and shrimp were very fresh. 

Seating is a bit tight which doesn't bother me, but seemed to bother the people beside us (we overheard them). Overall I would highly recommend this place for a visit."
4,"Sister company of Ming Kei in Scarborough. Same chef. I think it's pretty decent and maybe better than Phoenix. Kept most of the design from previous Japanese restaurant. Clean, good service, good price, good portions. I got the soft she'll crab fried rice ($12.95) and I thought they would give me tiny pieces of soft shell crab and have to dig for them but there were actually many pieces ans big too. Overall I give this place a good thumbs up. 

Dine in guests also get free Chinese news paper (either Ming Pao or Sing Tao), that's a dollar savings on its own!! 

They have specials for everything, and dim sum too. But during hi-tea hours (around 3:15pm) it'll be the busiest so be ready to wait a while."
4,Great service and delicious food! We didn't have a wait and everyone smiled during our entire service. I will most definitely frequent this location more!
4,"I don't mean this to be necessarily negative, but Texas Roadhouse isn't so much a restaurant as it is a human foie gras farm.

My best friend and I love coming here on Friday nights, despite the crazy long wait time and crowds. The anticipation, hunger and stress of waiting only adds to the relief and elation when we are finally taken to one of the comfy 2-person booths and commence stuffing our faces with the first of a million dinner rolls with cinnamon butter. 

Fried Pickles? Awesome.

Loaded Mashed Potatoes? OMG.

Getting Loaded Mashed Potatoes AND a Baked Sweet Potato with cinnamon butter and brown sugar as your two sides, AFTER stuffing yourself with a million rolls and cinnamon butter? Priceless.

I am always surprised when the bill comes, because it's always way less than I think it's going to be. 

But then again, by the time I waddle my Texas-sized, stuffed self to my car afterwards, I have to say ""Never Again!"", but... by the following week, I get the visions of sugar rolls dancing in my head and then we find ourselves back in line...

Other than the dirty, peanutty floors, stressed out staff, earbud-bursting country music, waiting in line in a cramped, claustrophobic hallway to nowhere and terrible margaritas, this place is awesome!

P.S. - Please don't come here on your birthday. It stresses everyone else out when the entire restaurant staff is doing their song and clappy dance ON TOP OF the terrible PA music."
4,"This was my first experience with the chain. The portions are humongous, and they have the best yeast rolls I've ever had! I got two baskets of yeast rolls, and I almost didn't have enough room for the rest. Every time I come here, I bring almost half of the steak home for lunch the next day. The steaks are huge, but dry and overcooked sometimes.

The service is all right, and the atmosphere is fitting."
4,Delicious sandwich shop with good original sandwiches. The Bobbi is always good and the russian sauce is perfect pairing for the cheesesteak.
4,Service and food is way better than Phoenix. Food is delicious! Their food is between Congee Queen and Phoenix. The bbq duck is the best! Bonus- free wifi!!
4,"I went there with a colleague today who recommended this place.  He said he goes there four times a week.

I have one word:

E.X.C.E.P.T.I.O.N.A.L.

My ""other"" (former) pho place has deteriorated, service-wise and food-wise and I have a new go-to place now.

Good size portions.  Had the vermicelli with the grilled chicken - mmmmmmmm.  Vegetables were clean, dressing was perfect and the noodles well separated, i.e. did not arrive in a clump.

Exceptional.  Very good.  Will DEF be back."
4,"12inches of Bobbie goodness! The sandwich cost $8.65. This place is a bit more expensive than other Capriotti's because of the location inside of the Red Rock Hotel.  

The Bobby is Thanksgiving on a hoagie! Roast turkey, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. My go to sandwich. 

Naps are optional but encouraged."
4,We ordered their Masala Dosa and butter chicken. Masala dosa was really delicious. Butter chicken was as usual a bit sweet for our taste but I guess some people prefer it like that. Over all the food was good. Our favourite was hands down the Masala dosa.
4,"so the gf and i were here and i tottaly liked the decore becaouse it was diferent, it didnt have all the chinese cluster of stuff all over the walls and the traditional dragon and buddha with for sale sighn on a sticky note, but was stll chinese in a way, love the bamboo on the ceiling..but let me tell you what if you like soup they have the best ox tail soup i have ever tried in my life, it almost cleared my cold and gave me enough energy to want to play basket ball i told my gf.. and i dont even play basket ball lol..soooo goood..and she had the kun-pao chiken, too spicy for mee but i had a lil..sevice was exelent..def be back ..."
4,"Went here yesterday for apps and drinks, as such was only on the second floor.  Apps were good not great, I really liked the sloppy joses, the salsa was interesting as well with a hint of cumin in it.  Great music but a little loud for so early in the night.  Very difficult to get a drink at the bar but once we secured a comfy sofa the vibe was great.  Smallish beer list, very good cocktails!
Decor and ambience in an old Colombian style, very well done, I would definitely return."
4,"Chinese food on a table cloth? It's not quite a unicorn, but it's pretty rare. Imperial Garden has a litany of awards from Madison Magazine and I'm certainly not going to disagree with the well earned accolade. The Governor's chicken, moo sho pork (and pancakes) and mixed fried rice are the MVPs. Hand's down. And they have a pretty nice bar with a decent repertoire.

The crowd skews a little older and more gentile, but it shouldn't matter because you'll likely be more focused on trying to cram as much delicious food onto your chopsticks as you can. That's what a gentleman would do."
4,"Good place to eat , nothing special like how everyone says it so good or the best steak house ever. Never had a problem here so I'll be coming back ! One thing I don't like about this place is , that we can't get seated unless everyone in the group shows up."
4,"Review on TangoChina, Summerlin

This small, charming, new Chinese Café/Restaurant is located in a shopping plaza in Summerlin. It has a neat and inviting decor. It has a good selection of Lunch Specials of typical Chinese cuisines; complete with soup, chips, and a side of rice or fried Chowmein, for $6 or $7 each, thus, of excellent value.

The waitresses are very friendly and quite accommodating.
- The Szechuan Spicy Chicken I ordered had excellent aroma, texture and presentation, but surprisingly, it was unsually ""too SWEET"" at every bite! I asked kindly and half-jokingly my friendly server if the chef had used sugar instead of salt by any chance. She was helpful and accommodating, and actually went to talk to the chef about it, who said it was no mistake, but was totally WILLING to re-make the dish with less sugar! Well, to me, that is a mark of good business practice, I was impressed.
- Yes, I have had Szechuan style spicy dishes in restaurants in SZECHUAN, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and in a few Chinatowns in the States, but no, I have never tasted a Szechuan dish with such sweetness before. Well, at least the chef at ChinaTango was willing to remake the dish! The helpful waitress offered her good advice that the next time I order, make sure to ask the chef to go easy with the sugar! Good advice, I'll definitely go back and give it another try.

- Based on the happy faces of other customers, the cuisines must be pretty good in general. I'll definitely go back there and try other items in the menu.

By the way, another plus for this Chinese Café: - It has a very CLEAN bathroom, complete with paper towels.

4,"great food but a bit dirty if you ask me.  i have been here many times and on my first time i was here i found something disgusting on the floor which i cannot say here.  i have not seen the same thing again since that day and i have been back here many times.  the service is okay.  the food is piping hot.  you get a mix of korean and chinese food here.  the menu is not very helpful, no pictures.  they use english but it's not very helpful in describing the item.  everything is good.  even the appetizers.  

this place may be a bit hard to find since it's set inside a smallish plaza off the main road."
4,"Shrimp and grits - pretty good, although the fact that we only got three shrimp was disappointing.  The shrimp had really good flavor though. 

Perlou - also pretty good. Smoked whitefish is always good. Unfortunately the oysters tasted too much like algae for my taste.

Black eyed pea salad - the highlight of the meal. A unique and intriguing potpourri of flavors. Very tasty. 

Apple cobbler - very good. The lemon and apple work well together. The maple cream doesn't really improve the experience though. 

Chocolate cake - a bit disappointing. Cake was not ""chocolatey"" enough. Mint ice cream on top was pretty good."
4,Delicious & very filling sandwiches. The small was hardly small.... The Bobbie fulfilled a Thanksgiving craving of mine. Will definitely be back!
4,"I've been to Capriotti's twice and both times Ive had a tasty sandwich.  They have a nice selection of cold and warm sandwiches plus some signature items.  The key to any good sandwich however is the bread and lets just say Capriotti's is no Subway....and that's a good thing.   You have a choice of small or large but to be honest I thought the small was pretty darn big, so if you order a large it better be for 2 people or because you just helped a friend move into his third floor apartment without an elevator.  

The first time I went in there, I grabbed a Capicola sandwich which is always one of my favorite.  They were generous with the meat and the veggies that accompanie it were fresh.   The second time decided to throw caution into the wind and I got one of their signature sandwiches, The Capistrammi.  Talk about a heart attack in wrapping!  Thats not to say it wasn't good, because it was delicious but considering it was stacked with warm, buttery pastrami, coleslaw, mayo and russian dressing, you better not be on Cholesterol meds when you try it!  Next time I go there I want to try their other famous signature sandwich, the Bobby.  It looks like a  full thanksgiving meal in sandwich form.  I should start clearing room in my stomach now and I'll probably be ready for it sometime early next month!

Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing outrageous.  You're getting  a higher quality sandwich than at a lot of other joints, so its totally reasonable.  This particular location is at the Red Rock Casino but it still has the same full menu as you would find at any of their other locations.  

Great spot to grab a bite before the movies right next door...unless its a movie you really want to see because you might lapse into a food coma!"
4,"We live about 5 miles away and whenever I get the cravings for Ma Po Tofu, that's where we go. Their fried rice is very flavorful and satisfying all on its own (the entree, not part of lunch menu). I think their special dishes like cucumber soup, Ma Po Tofu are what sets them apart from other places. I've had their lunch specials and sure, I wasn't impressed and I would give them less stars had they been the only thing I've tried. Please give their cucumber soup a try! When a friend ordered it for us it sounded a bit unusual but shrimp was so succulent and tender plus the soup offered delicious mixture of sour and savory taste that will have you craving for it. So there you have it... My 3 favorite items! I will be back to try the mayo shrimp next time!"
4,"Appreciate the smiles when you walk in. Place looks clean. Ordered Singapore noodles. It was really tasty. This dish calls for ALOT of onions. I've had this dish at other restaurants but they put too much onions and their not really cooked all the way. At China Tango Bistro, the onions are nice and sautéed. And they used purple onions (a nicer taste).My lunch was really good. Definitely will go back."
4,I have been coming here since the 80s and never miss a chance to eat here every time I'm in Madison. I love the food here and my family does as well. My favorites are the pan fried dumpling appetizer and for entrees the Governor's shrimp is the best. My sis always orders the Fragrant beef and loves it. Sometimes service is a little slow but only because the place is always full. The won ton soup and vegetable fried rice are very good as well. I wish I knew of a Chinese restaurant as beautiful and clean as this in the Boca Raton area! Can't seam to find anything to compare!
4,"This was my first time at this location. I had reservations for 8 and had to wait about 5-10 minutes after my reservation to be seated but that was fine. The service was decent, we had people check in with us to make sure we were okay. All food requests came rather quickly but they did forget about our spring rolls and ice cream so we had to follow up which is expected at a ayce restaurant. Why they lost points was that I didnt like that I had to ask my server for fried buns, spring rolls and sauce.. the other location ive been to downtown had a self serve station. They also werent able to split the bill but we figured it out amongst ourselves. Overall I love this hotpot concept and its selection!"
4,"This place is great, if you want a chill, but lit night on King West. After securing the password from a friend, we went to Escobar, their ""secret"" bar upstairs.Their menu was rather small, but it was done well and they had some classic dishes on there. Realistically though no one is really coming upstairs for the food, instead it's a place to dance to some good music (mostly hiphop) and have some good cocktails. I will say, that this faux exclusiveness is a little much because no one even asked us for the password when we got in. Additionally, they have a ""VIP"" area which you can't get into unless you know someone, but this area is literally the same thing as the other side. Give it a rest guys."
4,"if you are here for the buffet, it is only on the weekday mornings  except for Tuesday. 

Food is awesome. If you appreciate south indian food then this is a place that you must try. Generally speaking, this particular line of cuisine is famous for using indian spices with a special focus on herb based ingredients. 

The servers were fast and courteous. You'll probably have a nice experience here. 

I took out one star from the review, because of their timing does not agree with me as I preferred weekend and evening eating out."
4,"Came here for dumplings a recommendation from a friend. Besides Chinese they serve Korean as well. 

Ordered pork with chive dumplings, veggie dumplings and lamb skewers. To finish off I had the caramelized sweet potato. Once you place them into water they harden and caramelize. Not a lot of place serve this dessert so I had to get it. 

The dumplings are quite good and the lamb skewers were okay. Love the caramelized sweet potato."
4,Great food but need to work on customer service. It is on the pricier side but its always fresh and excellent quality so I'm not complaining. We would come more and bring more people if they were halal. Make it halal please!
4,"Wow I'm surprised I hadn't yet reviewed this place. I decided to go here Valentines day with my better half and boy what a treat it was again. We ordered some appetizers, I had the Chicken Egg Roll and we shared an order of the Grilled Pot Stickers. Both were great ways to start off our meals. 

Fast forward to entree time and she had the Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice, which was pure fantastic and a huge quantity. I ordered the Cashew Chicken, it was the best CC I had ever had. 

The service here has always been great, we've always been able to make reservations and they were always prompt about seating us when we didn't make one. The bar makes pretty good drinks although they are a bit generous with their Vodka. As long as I live in Middleton I will continue dining here as it's always a stellar experience."
4,Driving by and came across this Bistro.  Clean interior and very friendly staff.  Kung Pao Chicken and Shenzen Chicken were very good.
4,"Best value for money on dumplings in the city. Many different style dumplings, great prices, and incredible value.

The ambiance? Let's just say you won't be paying a premium for that. You're coming to this unpretentious joint to eat dumplings, and maybe have the kimchi pork bone soup. If you're game for that, you will be hard-pressed to find a better spot."
4,"Baro is sleek, chic, fun, and delicious all at the same time! We came here after careful consideration and recommendation from locals, after all we were only going to be in town for a day on a business trip.

The place is huge with two full floors (that I know of) both with bars and tables. The upstairs layout with couches is more suited for lounging, drinking, and snacking, whereas the bottom floor has bigger tables for a proper sit down dinner. They play great, catchy Latin music here.

For food, we ordered a large array of dishes:
CGS ($15, house made chips, guac, salsa): I absolutely love house made chips, it's crispier and fresher. The guac and salsa tasted house made as well.
Empanadas ($7, beef, potato, peas): tasty, but not a big fan of empanadas
Chicken wings ($15, w/ guava bbq sauce): the wings are so juicy, fresh, and the sauce is delicious!
Flight ($32, mixed ceviche): seafood was fresh and I love ceviche
Chori papa ($16, chorizo, peppers, goat cheese, tortillas): 
Duck chaufa ($35, basically a bibimbap): Weird this dish is called ""chaufa"" and not bibimbap because it's almost exactly what it is. It was very tasty, not heavy with a hint of sweetness.
Whole fried fish ($42, branzino, rice, avocado): the fish was excellent, fried perfectly and not overcooked, while remaining tasty.

Everything here was enjoyable from the food to service to the upbeat and chic atmosphere. The only caveat is all menu items are grossly overpriced ($15 for chips and dip, $15 for a few wings, $35 for fried rice, etc)."
4,"We visited last night with family and were so pleased!  Great pub, cute area with a great neighborhood vibe.  

Service was amazing, we were well taken care of.  I had a small issue with temperature on my pasta dish, and the waitress took it back immediately and I found out she comped my meal.  Who does that?

The food was great, too.  Our table shared a pimento cheese dip that was so creamy and tart we had to order another.  Chicken tenders were crisp and delicious.  The waffle fries were crispy.  The shrimp tacos lacked a little something, it needed crema or something as they were dry.  

We ordered 3 desserts to share with the table, and though I'm not sure they are made in house (they looked so perfect) they were each very delicious and well made.  Chocolate cake was rich and moist, the Tuxedo cake was a favorite with the chocolate cake base and the creamy cheesecake middle but my favorite was the spiced carrot cake.  

All in all, a really great place to eat that I'll gladly return to for a casual dinner."
4,"Have come here a lot over the years, very friendly staff, great service and constantly good food at reasonable prices. Thai spicy curry chicken is my favorite as are the egg rolls and soups. They do a nice Lobster sauce here also."
4,"Love the food here but the service is lacking a little. The food either takes forever to come or it never comes at all. I would also like to mention that the bill does add up, soup bases are separately charged for, pot size is also separate. If you're down to splurge a little I recommend ordering the wagyu beef! Don't forget to try their deep fried buns too, one of my must haves every time I go."
4,"I've eaten here a total of 3 times over the past year.

Twice for the weekday buffet.  Once for a weekend dinner.

Weekday Buffet ($10.99) - this is pretty decent value.  Highlights are the butter chicken, chickpea dish, paratha, plain dosa roll, chicken briyani rice, vegetable briyani rice.  There is also a selection of soups, yogurt type dishes, small dessert table, fruit.  

Everything at the buffet is labelled, so you know what you're eating.

The best part about ethnic buffets is that you can try small tastes of everything you would not normally order.

When I came here for dinner, it was just ok, the prices worked out to be ~$20+ per person, so its not the greatest value.  The dishes are on the small side.  

Service for the buffet lunch was not great.  Our table had stacks of plates on the table and they rarely cleared them.  So it got a bit annoying since the table was getting a bit cluttered."
4,"This is the only good Chinese food in the area, solid service and a good atmosphere. This family owned business has been in business for years. We sit at the tiny bar area all the time for their fresh rolls and Thai dishes. Always good, great place. Must try."
4,"Went to Baro for the first time on a date, and although the date didn't go so well, this place is my new favourite bar. 

Their cocktails are delicious, pretty, and boozy. The second floor is loungey, cozy, and usually lively. I went on a Friday night and it got crowded - people were standing around everywhere chatting with one another, but Saturdays seem more tamed. The couches are first come first serve but can reserve if you really need. 

Apparently there's an upstairs which is a big loft-like space for events and dancing? 

I haven't had a proper meal here yet either than some chips and dip, which were pretty good for such a simple order.

Looking forward to checking out their half priced wine Wednesdays! .... But will probably keep getting their old fashioneds!"
4,Good food but great music and atmosphere! I've been to the upstairs bar many time but somehow never got a chance to check out the actual restaurant. I set my expectations pretty low because it's a bar but they surprised me with the quality of food. The service was a little slow so I had to take away a start but otherwise it's  a nice spot. Prices are average for the area
4,Very Delicious & plates are very hefty. Sweet tea needs alittle sweeter. Kevin the employee was very helpful and friendlyw
4,"Went here for my buddy's fantasy football draft.  We were allowed to use the private back room which was pretty nice although a bit disorganized.  It was cool though that we were allowed to rearrange furniture and tables to how we wanted it though.  I ordered the Kendrick sandwich and a hefeweizen both of which were surprisingly good.  The sandwich sounded good on the menu and delivered once eaten.  I was annoyed that it was $17 though and $9 for a large beer.  The food is good but definitely not worth that much.  There are cheaper options but for the most part the whole menu seemed to be a bit on the pricier side.  We had one waitress for 12 of us which made things a little slow and unorganized but everything worked out.

I've been here multiple times before but just to drink and hang out and I've got to say that this was probably my favorite time.  Can't say if it was the private room or the items that I ordered, I suppose I see this as more of a restaurant than more of a bar to just sit at and drink."
4,"The restaurants at the Red Rocks food court offer vegetarian options, but Capriotti's is the only place that offers four mock meats (turkey, steak, salami and burger). I did a doubletake at the menu on the wall, because although they had a vegetarian section, I thought it was a mistake. Looking closely I saw the ""Vegetarian Meats are 100% Meatless."" Bingo!!

I initially ordered the Cheese Steak (which I was really looking forward to) - but was told that it was still frozen and not ready (I got there at 11am). So I opted for the Turkey sandwich. Mmmmmm! The mock turkey portions were generous on a sub roll, with lettuce, tomato, lettuce and italian seasonings. It reminded me of the days of growing up in New Jersey and eating hoagies from Wawa. I would give them five stars if they had vegan mayonnaise (like the excellent Wildwood Garlic Aioli).

I hope I get a chance to try their vegetarian cheese steak (btw, if you're ever in San Francisco, check out Jay's Cheesesteaks for their seitan offerings)."
4,"The only reason it gets 4 stars is because can't  rate in half. The waitress we had was rude and abrupt. It took a while for the waitress to even come for our drink order. We finally got to order. We got our salads, then suddenly the food was at the table didn't have time to rest a minute between salad and main course. I ordered chili as well and that never came til I asked about the chili. The food was very enjoyable. I really liked the chili, it's different in a way, its got a nice suddle bite at the end. I got chicken and ribs. The wife got her prime rib, which was cooked perfectly. Overall it was a good experience though, despite the waitress. Love the decor, there is a huge mureal of a native American in the one dinning area that caught my eye, it's very intriguing."
4,"There's a reason this place has been around so long. They have lots of offbeat options like mayonnaise shrimp, cucumber soup and a couple of interesting and legitimately spicy curries. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the hot and sour soup; good flavor, but way too viscous for me.
The House Rice Noodles are a must!"
4,"Just recently moved in a few months ago and haven't had any complaints, its conveniently located to EVERYTHING you need (shopping centers, unlv, strip, etc). The staff has been very helpful in making this move as easy as possible and they're always very friendly. The building i'm in is pretty quiet for the most part which makes studying easy and they also have a computer and printer which is super helpful when it comes to my school work. Overall dont judge the apartments by the yelp reviews you read! This is a good place to live"
4,"Got together with my university boys for our regular catch up dinner and decided to go with the recently opened Baro located in the heart of the entertainment district on King West in Toronto. For months I had been watching it been built slowly but surely and was super excited to suggest it to the group when considering dinner options!

Baro brings the best of the former King W restaurant, Valdez (and it's speakeasy hip hop cocktail bar Escobar), and gives it mutant super powers spread over 3 floors a dining floor, a raw bar and the loft which, as I understand, is what Escobar was and you need a password in order to access the space.

The decor is really nice, it feels almost like it's part rainforest, part ancient ruin part sophisticated night spot. And to add to the AHEM aesthetic of the venue, it would appear that Baro has poached every attractive server, bartender and chef from the rest of the city. This human aesthetic is only exceeded by how attractive the crowd is here. I felt like a wallflower in my fancy jeans, blazer and Chelsea boots. TL:DR - this place is all kinds of sexy...

... then there was the food. This place follows the Toronto Tapas trend that forces me to evolve past my Joey Tribiani mantra of NOT sharing food. Toronto is all about shareable plates, and Baro is no different. Here is a recap of what we (5 guys) ordered and split evenly between us.

PLATICOS

CGS $15
chips + guacamole + salsa
- The chips were fresh made and had varied flavours all of which delicious. The guacamole and fresh salsa were also excellent. That said I don't think this dish is worth $15 for what you get. If this was a complimentary starter for when you sit down I think that would add some value but I highly doubt the food cost on this is even $3 so the markup is a little crazy.

EMPANADAS $7
corn meal + beef + potato + peas + aji 3pcs
- 3 bite-sized empanadas per order served on a paper bag. I thought these were delicious and the presentation was cute and fun. The Emps might look super teeny tiny BUT they are packed to the brim with filling. Definitely a great buy and delicious. We had 2 orders for the table, I could have easily eaten 2 orders on my own.

CHORI PAPA $15
chorizo + potato + peppers + chipotle golf + goat cheese + 4 tortillas
- This was the table favourite. A glorious pile of ingredients served in a skillet with steamed tortillas. Sort of like a do-it-yourself soft taco appetiser. The flavours were incredible again and te meat was seasoned very well. I would definitely highly recommend this dish.

CEVICHE

TIRADITO $19
albacore tuna + passion fruit & lulo + squash + chile + cilantro + sesame seeds
- this original tuna ceviche was easily one of my favourite ceviches I've ever had for two reasons. First, there wasn't an over-abundance of citrus. I've found many times a lot of restaurants go a little crazy with the lemon and lime and the end result is you miss the taste of the fish, Baro uses citrus as it should be, enough to make and flavour the dish, without overpowering it. Second, the fish was served in almost sushi style sliced rather than chopped chunks in a bowl. 

MAINS
ARROZ CON POLLO $30
breast and pamplona + avocado rice + spinach + saffron jus + patacone
- Saffron rice was tender, moist and full of vibrant flavours and the chicken matched the rice on all three categories. The chicken breast ws massive, definitely too much for one or event two people to handily eat on their own. 

ROPA NUEVA $32
braised beef + yuca gratin + rapini + garlic + chile + oregano
- this was fall off the bone fork tender, the meat was soft and deeply seasoned in a beautiful sauce. The yuca cratin was similar to mashed potatoes

PERTH PORK $27
loin + grains & legumes spicy rocoto pepper + celery root puree + apple salsa + mustard jus
- This dish reminded me of the pork you would find inside a Cubano sandwich infused with the flavours of a pork chop which was brought about but the apple salsa. The pork was super tender, very good. I didn't get very much of this dish so I'd like to return and try it again.

Split 5/6 ways the meal overall was very reasonable at about $60-75 a person after tax and tip. I didn't drink any alcohol but the cocktails my friends ordered looked incredibly well made with a high degree of skill and precision put into making them.

I'd like to return and try a few more things, including some drinks before awarding the next star. Definitely an excellent spot for groups, date nights (and fellas, this is impressive to bring a first date - just keep your eyes on your date).

Eatcrest Out!"
4,"I currently live in Atlanta and I'm moving to Las Vegas to attend UNLV in January, I called to get information on the pricing and application process, I was helped by a woman named Tatiana, she was so pleasant, she was able to answer all of my questions and concerns, she made me feel really comfortable and excited about this move and transition. I'm truly looking forward to moving into Rebel Place and experincing college life with roomate living off campus 
Thank you to the Rebel Place staff Tatiana for all your help!!!!"
4,"Finally a chinese restaurant in Madison that doesn't make me mad!  My VP at work is a big fan and we go here often for work lunches.  They always seat us quickly and are attentive.  

Last time I was there I ordered the Governor's Beef (Spicy Hot), it came with an egg roll and soup.  The soup was nice and the egg was fresh and contained chicken instead of pork. Which is awesome because I don't eat pork!  I also really like their chicken lettuce wraps and sauteed bok choy and broccolini.  

But to be honest, I always find myself wondering if part of my love for this place, is pure nostalgia.  It looks and feels like the formal chinese eateries of my childhood in St. Louis much more than the little shops tend to see around Madison.  Likewise, where a lot of the takeout places in town cater to college kids and seem to serve sauced chicken nuggets, the food here always seems fresh."
4,"I love this place! Food comes in very large portions with very affordable pricing. Their dumplings are handmade, and there is a large variety of them. I don't know the exact number, but there should be around 15 dumplings per order. Other dishes they have are equally as good, and despite not being an authentic Korean place, their Korean dishes are tasty too. 

The service is not the best, but that may be in part that the waitresses have very limited English skills. Either way, while the service is not outstanding, the servers do their jobs effectively.

Be warned that this place is closed on Tuesdays!"
4,"Been here twice now, both times for drinks and never disappointed. 

The cocktail menu is robust, as is the wine list... but they're also great at the classics which is typically where I end up going after trying to be experimental for a drink or two. So yes- they make a great G&T.

Vibes are chic and cool with dim lights, music, and industrial decor. 

There are multiple floors for different music and vibes which is love, you can kinda choose your own adventure. Seems like they offer bottle service so if you're looking to get lit with a big crew or just grab a date night drink Baro works for you!"
4,"Great value and decent number of options for their lunch buffet. There are curries, chutneys, rice dishes, and breads for dipping. They even have a dessert section for their lunch buffet. I also appreciate how quickly the replenish their dishes, so you never have to wait long to try something. 

Warning: their dishes are spicy and if you can't handle spice, their dishes will set fire to your digestive system. 

I have been told that the dishes are quite traditional. However, it was odd seeing Szechuan chicken, but it tasted more Indian than Chinese to me. 

If you're coming for lunch on a weekday you can probably get away with not making a reservation. 

My one complaint is the inefficiency of their payment system. They don't split bills, and requested that we pay in cash if we wanted to pay separately."
4,Also their chicken fried rice is massive and delicious. Add a fried egg! Also #528 on the menu is a favourite with my friends. Called the Epic meal now
4,"This place is becoming my go to spot for hot pot - been back twice this month. Being the hotpot addict I am, I'd say quality of the food here is above average and the place rarely runs out of items listed on the menu even if you are there late (unlike other popular hotpot places ie Kim Tao, Celebrity etc.). The differentiator for this place is got to be the service! Though the hostess is hanging by a thread for below average, our server (Bill) definitely makes up for it. Will be back again."
4,"I'll admit, I really do avoid looking through the kitchen area - or go to the washrooms. The place does have a bit of a weird musky dirty smell. But hey; street food is good and never clean.

Food wise - best pho ever! I mean i've had pho at a loot of restaurants in NorthYork and nothing beats this place. The broth has good flavour, the meat portions are generous and tender. 

I tend to stick to Pho and not venture much but my coworkers thoroughly enjoy the Bun selection too."
4,"First time eating at Dumpling Restaurant (very original name). Went in with high expectations and left satisfied.

We ordered the assorted dim sum, deep fried dumplings, Korean fried rice and pan fried onion cake.  Spent $25 for two and had enough leftovers for two.

Food: tastier than I expected. Full of flavours, a bit on the oily side but that's expected. The dumplings were great. Definitely coming back for more. one complaint is that the dumplings were a bit 'doughy' for my liking.

The restaurant could definitely stand for a makeover ... If you're looking for a homely atmosphere you won't find it here! Not a first date spot for sure. If you're at the point in the relationship where anything goes then it won't be a problem;) Wasn't the most pleasant service ... Instead the woman wordlessly pointed in the general direction where we could choose a seat then silently handed us the order sheet and then crept up a few minutes later and took it back. 

Try it out!"
4,"On the outside the little plaza looks pretty crummy and small but don't let the looks throw you off. When you get inside it is quite spacious and I was really surprised how many customers they had. After looking over the menu I can see why this place is so popular. The prices are rock bottom, dirt cheap, super bargain. Cash only though.  I ordered a pork bone soup $5.99 and a beef pancake wrapped in foil $4.99.

The pork bone soup was super overflowing with huge chucks of fall off the bone meat. Soup was scolding hot and not overly salty. The beef pancake was filled with shredded beef and there were some chucks of fat which I was not a huge fan of. Overall the food was very good and portions super huge.

The place was clean and service was fast. Parking can be a problem since the lot is so small but there are plenty of neighbouring lots where you can park and just walk over.  And don't be intimidated just because its a Chinese run place. The menu has English on it as well and you just check off what you want to eat. That simple."
4,"Just had to get something not too filling. Two breasts, bottle water and Gatorade, $17. Chicken was crisp and moist. Hit the spot for both of us."
4,Good chetinad food. And spicy enough even for my palette. Ambience was also good. Overall a good experience and will visit again.
4,"Great spot! Went for dinner and got in without reservations. The ceviches are to die for, especially their Nikkei.  The cocktails are good too. I also had the Duck Chaufa which I enjoyed"
4,"1 star = Terrible. Multiple things went wrong. Never going back.
2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful.
3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back.
4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here.
5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.

Solid 4 star for me. The service is excellent. The servers are super nice. The decor is simple and elegant. And the food is really good.

We started with lettuce wraps, crab rangoon, and egg drop soup. The lettuce wraps were delicious and we loved that the chicken stuff had pine nuts in it :) The crab rangoon seemed freshly made and were yummy. The egg drop soup was just ok. All three dishes we had were excellent: Mongolian Beef, String Beans, and I had the crab and egg white fried rice which was fabulous: there was tons of flavorful crab meat in it. Yum!

It was a big pricey -- we paid $75 with tip, no alcoholic drinks. But it was worth it."
4,"Baro opened only 2-3 weeks ago and is the newly reopened and slightly more east (but still on King West) version of Valdez. My group agreed it was a ""soft"" 4 out of 5. Things were generally good and I thouht it was an improvement from Valdez.  The best part of the meal was the duck confit rice (delicious!), branzino was tasty but we recommend to debone it yourself because the server didnt debone the best. The mussels were unfortunatwly undercooked. We ordered the hamachi ceviche which was good. Tamales were a bit bready but cocktails were good. Service was very attentive. Overall a fun place for a group meal but a hit of miss depending on what you order."
4,"Overall:  Authentic fiery south indian food, great value

Room: Like a modern a/c restaurant in India, with dark wood furniture, and a regular rotation of current and classic Tamil hits on the stereo

Service: Friendly, nice, people, but a star lost for occasional forgetfulness 

Menu: I've only gone at lunch for the buffet, and it's a solid selection, and focuses on food from the Chettinad region in Tamil Nadu, which is known for its specific spiciness.  

Presentation: Buffet, not much to say, dosa made on request, south indian coffee delivered traditionally, held in steel cup placed upside down in a steel saucer

Taste:  Delivers on south indian vegetarian goodness.  

Healthiness:  Good, but not great, quite a bit of oil 

Value: Excellent, what you'd expect for Scarborough dining"
4,"Big dishes and good price.

I ordered the steak + pork chops + chicken on a hot sizzling plate.  It is also coming with soup + bread + spaghetti + coffee/tea for $16.95.  Really a big size and more than enough for a single person.  The quality is an average, but in terms of size and price, and it is a good deal."
4,"Wanting a change from my usual Grand Cafe dinner this trip, and simply too tired from hours of video poker to drive out to any of the Italian restaurants I bookmarked, I opted for a quick casual dinner at this Capriotti's, a food court place I've eaten at now and then during my many trips to Vegas.I ordered a medium Cheese Steak($10.49) sub,hero, hoagie, whatever. I chose onions and sweet peppers as toppings.The counter dude asked me to repeat my order immediately after I ordered it. He looked a little too young for short term memory issues but who am I to speculate about the nature of his affliction. It was enough that he got me my huge 12 incher promptly......boy that does not sound right.....look at the picture instead.

The sandwich was delicious, hot and consumed quickly, though a little cheap on the cheese or wiz. I liked it anyway.It was filling and a great value.

t saddens me that there are no Capriotti's in Downstate New York. Is anybody out there listening?"
4,"From reading the previous reviews, it is evident that the new management has really turned this place around. I toured with Courtnee, she was super friendly and funny. It was a nice looking place with some great activities included on the premises  First up, gated parking, that is awesome. You get things like the pool, computer room, study room, computers, recreational room, even tanning! The rooms have bedrooms that were pretty far apart from each other and private bathrooms, which is a plus. The rooms and common areas come furnished which is helpful. You also get cable and internet! over all the staff was friendly and the rooms looked great for someone going to UNLV! I am looking forward to when I Attend UNLV and I get to move in!"
4,"Some consistently good Pho, I frequent this place whenever I need to go to Yorkdale or in the area. I always getting the Pho rare beef and brisket which comes with plentiful meat and noodle, you can also definitely tell they've stewed the soup base at least for a night or so. Spring rolls are pretty sizeble as well. I've been told the seafood or more traditional Vietnamese dishes are really good too. 

Its right beside the beer store as well if you're making a beer run. 

Prices are typical of most Pho places."
4,"This little cluster of restaurants is definitely welcome on the once desolate-after-6pm stretch of E Washington. The décor is clean and appealing and they nailed the outdoor patio (see you next year!).

Southern cuisine is something that has been woefully represented in Madison, so it's nice to see Julep get in the scene. I'm happy with the size of the menu - very manageable and organized well. We started with the grilled oysters, brought to the table on a smoldering pile of wood chips. Good flavor; I'd just suggest a bit more smokiness.

The mains exceeded expectations - if you knocked me out, blindfolded me and told me we were eating in South Carolina, I'd believe you. The Shrimp & Grits was a medium-sized portion with three large shrimp and a tasty gravy. The Perlou stole the show with the tasty crisped rice (think: sothern bibimbap) with undertones of a nice smoky whitefish flavor. You're probably wondering about the Juleps - they are solid, just a lot of crushed ice."
4,"2/1/2013: Sesame Inn still getting an A Grade from Maricopa County Environmental Services. :-)

My family has spent thousands of dollars here since 1999.  Mostly because the staff will always do special orders with an ""oh, sure!"" sort of joy.  And it's the only decent Chinese in the Desert Foothills (Shanghai Club in Anthem ain't bad).

There are two Chinese menu items I sort of use as a test:  Spicy Eggplant and Hot & Sour Soup.  Either are often quite obviously *wrong* in other restaurants but not here.

Spicy Eggplant is EXACTLY how one would hope and dream this dish should be -- the eggplant is creamy / cooked to perfection and the yummy sauce displays green onion and garlic equally to the palate.  And it's always served really good and hot.

Hot & Sour Soup also has a number of distinguishable flavors floating around in it.  (As opposed to the too-thick salty goop many places pass off as Hot & Sour.)  The sour (vinegar) is always perfect.  I always order it without pork but no one else at the table seems to care because the deliciousness is nevertheless quite potent!  Oh, and this soup is chock full of all kinds of exotic vegetables.

This place is a bit pricey but there is a certain pride of workmanship going on here."
4,"I don't know why lots of reviews indicate that the service is bad here, but actually I received pretty service every time I came here :0(because I can speak Cantonese?) food here is okay, but it is a good place to eat cuz i can have many choices here!"
4,"My second visit to this restaurant in the last week. This is the only dumpling restaurant I've seen that sell chinese dumplings with Korean food.

I have an assortment of Dumplings from pork, minced beef, mushroom, bok choy, vegetables, chicken, lamb. Apart from the pork, I've tried most of them. They are juicy and amazing. 

Their stir fried noodles was kinda bit oily. Also tried their lamb skewers on the second visit. It was a bit fatty but probably not the best but can't beat $8.99 for 8 skewers. 

They have other things I'll like to try, but I think they are the best for the dumplings. Will definitely come back again."
4,"I order my food To-Go online and it was ready for pick up right on time! 

I'm becoming a huge fan of Texas Roadhouse. Where else can you order a grilled Salmon for either $11 ( 5oz) or $14 8oz) w/ 2 sides?! The salmon at this location was cooked to perfection! Very moist and seasoned very well. There are many side choices available on the menu. I ordered mashed potatoes with brown gravy and vegetables. Both were pretty great choices. The vegetables however were a little bit on the hard side, nonetheless still a great choice for a side."
4,I always over order here cuz theres so much option and the foods amazing! Try the dumplings it takes awhiel cuz its hand made. The beef rolls are good too. Bean curd in sesame chili oil yumm
4,"Torontonians need to yelp more! This is my favorite dumpling place to eat whenever I come back to Toronto.  Their chive and shrimp ones and tomato (trust me) steamed dumplings are divine, full of soup and entirely handmade.  Their korean dishes are great too.  I love the cucumber and peanut buttery paste glass noodles and their spicy beet, carrot, cucumber, and mushroom mixed veggie cold dish.  English does not do a good job of describing asian food, which is a HUGE shame because this place is AH-mazing."
4,"Ive been coming here off and on for a few years and havent had a bad experience yet.  Great place for football, ice cold mug beer, and their steak and eggs special is great!"
4,"One of my favourite place to grab Indian food. I fell in love with this place years ago because their butter chicken is incredibly buttery and their lamb briyani is delicious but what I do not like is their prices. I find them a lot more expensive than other places (~$13.99 for a small bowl of butter chicken). Their naan bread gets pretty pricey as well (an additional $0.50 for butter naan). 

Although the people who work there are nice, I find them usually short staffed even during busy hours. They have a loyalty program to collect point using your phone number which then can be redeemable for credit at the restaurant which is nice."
4,"Rebel Place is actually a good value for the price. It is super close to the strip (within walking distance). It is also very close to UNLV and the restaurants around it. Its mostly college kids, but there are a few working professionals. I like it. The hot tub is really fun and its a social center. The gym is not all that but its ok. They need a better leg press machine.                

                  They just added a study center that is really modern and hi-tech with a bunch of new computers. The office staff is really cool. I have no real complaints. Lots of security walking around at night. They are pretty friendly. I always feel safe here. One annoying thing is that they add a $10 charge a month for insurance protection. I dont remember asking for that . All in all Rebel is the best overall value for the price. You can find nicer places for the same price but they will not be this close to the strip and UNLV."
4,A good solid 4 stars.  Hubby and I just moved to the area  a few days ago.  So Our first time here and very impressed.  We hit Brunch hours so $3 Bloody Mary's. Very good. Then my husband and I split out plates because everything looked good.  So we split the pimiento cheese burger and buffalo chicken tacos.  The tacos were really great and the pimiento cheese burger was equally great.  The pimiento cheese was pretty much best I ever had. And geeeez can't say enough about our server Jason so very helpful went over the menu with us explained everything.  Very friendly.  We will be back I'm sure many times.
4,"I've already been to Morals Village a number of times but never wrote a review until now. Everytime I have come here, the food and service has been consistent. 

The restaurant is fairly busy especially later on in the evenings. We came in the early evening on a weekday this time knowing that. We were seated immediately as there was still plenty of empty seating. I ordered the split soup base (french corn and sweet tomato). Both had a nice flavour to them without being either too mild or too strong. The servers were attentive and placed our ordered almost immediately whenever we wanted to add more food. The food came very quickly, was fresh, and were nice portions. The server refilled our soup with more broth whenever it was about half empty. 

I would highly recommend this AYCE hotpot as it scores high on service and food quality which is normally hard to find."
4,"This is my go-to dumpling restaurant. Of all the other dumpling locations that I've tried, I don't think I've found a place that trumps this place. 

I love that the dumplings are homemade and super fresh to order. Also, the size of the dumpling is slightly on the larger size in comparison to other dumpling places that I've been to. In addition, one order of dumpling is 14 pieces, whereas other places usually serve 12 pieces. As well, I like that the dumpling skin is not too thick and is a great balance to the filling.

The pork bone soup was just alright, the soup could have been more flavourful but the meat was tender and juicy so no complains on that front. This dish also comes with rice but we were pretty full from all that dumpling so we just packed the rice to-go--I guess I'll be having fried rice tomorrow. 

Despite how busy this restaurant was during a lunch rush, the server was attentive and able to get me refills for my tea. 

Overall, the meal was relatively cheap for some pretty awesome dumpling. Would I return? MOST DEFINITELY!!"
4,"This is my second time here, the 1st being a few years ago, and I don't know why it took me so long to return because the food was ssooo good.  By a recommendation from someone else's review I read on here, I got the mutton biyaani which was amazing. I also got the chetinnad chicken, which I didn't love because there were only 3 pieces in it and 2 of the bigger pieces we mostly none, not worth the $12! Got a popular mutton dish, but don't remember the name, it was the 1st one on the mutton list. Also got garlic butter naan which was so buttery and delicious. I'm stuffed!

The service was also quickly and friendly.  Was in and out within an hour on a Sunday evening.

Looking forward to my next visit!"
4,"Been here a couple of times now but only during lunch hour - and the place has been pretty dead every time.  That's a sign usually, but I can only imagine that there aren't more people because its smack in the middle of the day.  Maybe I'll venture here for dinner some night soon, if I can tear myself away from Hot Rods down the street.

I can't really complain about my visits, as the food has always been good and the servers are friendly.  The menu is very extensive, so take a minute to read it through.  I recommend the chicken parmesan sandwich or the chicken salad sandwich - both of which are very good.  The sliders aren't bad either and the chicken rice soup they offer is tasty.

I like the fact the place centers around the bar and has plenty of TVs to watch while you eat.  Makes getting away from the office for lunch that much more appealing.

But don't show up here with $10 and expect to eat though...my last lunch of soup, sandwich and soda was $20 with tip.  UGH."
4,"Some of the best dumplings I've ever had; hand made and delicious. The rest of their dishes are well priced, well made, but the dumplings here are the stars. One of the servers is terrible, another is great. Overall I'm quite a fan of this place and go here almost once a week."
4,"4 stars

Your typical quick fix for fast chinese diner/cafe style foods.  We had the sweet and sour pork, mushroom beef slices, BBQ pork vermicelli soup,  fried pork chop, and veggie dish.  The food was good.  All around decent flavor and the soup noodle broth was delish!

The free starter soup is super yummy (was told no MSG) and free dessert in the end was a nice touch.  The soya bean dessert was no good, but the mango pudding was good.

The servers were really friendly.  Child-friendly atmosphere."
4,"Authentic South Indian Food.

This place had a great atmosphere, it is clean, tidy and organized.

They bring you water, leave you a pitcher of water on the table and the menu is simple and straight forward, lots of vegetarian options and many vegan options on the menu.

While we were here we had Idli's and Channa Batura, they were both amazing and I would highly recommend that you try both if you have never had south Indian food before. It will be an adventure for you, you won't know what to expect and you will not be disappointed.

Food was flavourful and service was great, I would go here again."
4,"Great interior with high ceilings and modern decor. Unique dining experience where you cook your own thinly sliced meat, seafood, and vegetables in an individual hot pot.  There are many choices of broth to cook in. I made the mistake of ordering spicy.  It was full of chilies, Sichuan pepper, and oil.  Better to get a bland broth and order sauces on the side.  All you can eat.  It is very good if you are gluten intolerant.  All the broths are gluten free (no soy sauce) and most of the other items are just raw."
4,"This place is down the street from me and I decided that I wanted Chinese Food, so I placed my order online and went and picked it up.  This is my second time here and I like the food and the service."
4,"Very good authentic Chinese food! Beautiful restaurant decor. Feels like you're in China! Hefty portions. Very good grilled dumplings, shrimp lo mein, ginger soy sauce, and rice. Friendly staff. The only drawback is that the meals are a tad pricey. But considering the portions, they aren't bad! Overall, a great restaurant!"
4,"WHAT TO TRY?

Known for their Latin dishes, if it's your first time and have an appetite, try their Latino Party Set dinner. It comes with four courses. First it's the chips, guac and salsa - guac is made in house and can be right in front of you if you sit by the right corner of the bar!! The chips are not just the regular tortilla chips but also taro, banana, purple yam, yaca root - very fresh and crispy. 

Then you have Nikkei which is a ceviche with hamachi and ponzu sauce. A bit on the sour side with the overpowering lime juice but it's quite a refreshing appetizer. 

Then comes a pan of various sorts of Latino food including empanadas, chicken wings (absolutely loved the smoked guava BBQ sauce!! The chicken wings were crisp and flavorful on the outside and juicy in the inside! And arepitas which is a white corn meal that's fried with honey butter and queso d'hoja 

The chaufa is a fusion of Asian and Latin cuisine with rice in the hot stone pot served with duck confit and edamame and egg. I personally loved this dish not only for its flavours that remind me of my Asian cuisine but it's cleverness in combining these two cuisines together. Very tasty!

Lastly, was the ginger and chile popsicle that's water based, but still got a taste of some fruit notes like mango and apricot even though this popsicle might not have those ingredients!

Last tips: the latino party set dinner is cheaper on Sundays! If you want to save some money, ($55 pp vs $45 pp) go on Sunday! If you can choose to sit by the bar, you can see the business of the chefs in the kitchen and can find out more about the dishes having that 1:1 experience with the chefs. Usually Kevin, the head chef is in so you can get a full story about how each dish is made! The staff were all friendly! If you decide to do a-la-carte, I suggest not to skip out on the chips and guacamole appetizer, the chicken wings and the chaufa rice dish! All were really good so hard to choose, I know."
4,What a great local place. Wings with a side great choice and top notch service too!
4,"Food and service was good. The only thing is they could have advised the size of the paper masala dosa, yes it says extra large but for a first timer, It was shockingly large more than 3 feet long and about 6 inches in diameter. I thought they serve me a barrel of a canon by mistake. It could not fit on the single table. I don't know how to start..Lol..busy restaurant. Lots of parking. Very and courteous staff. Fast service."
4,"Clean, simple, no nonsense, no upselling. Owner & crew have the honesty you look for in an auto repair shop. Kinkade's was recommended to me by many friends ad now I know why. TJ runs a great place. They're certainly not perfect. And when they're not they admit it and pay for the fixes out of their own pocket. That's a rarity. I'll definitely return for future routine maintenance & repair work."
4,Matt in sales was great. Bought my Mazda 3 from him about a year ago and by far the best interaction I've ever had with a car salesman. Definitely would recommend people buy from him. Matt alone is 5 stars but the reason I didn't give the business a 5 star overall is because the service department has not lived up to the bar Matt set. Nothing bad so far with the service department but not 5 star worthy.
4,"You should know I reserve 5-star ratings for truly exceptional, exquisite experiences. 4-stars means I'm a fan and will return often enough to become a regular.

I've been here three times now and have enjoyed each visit. The service is good, the food is good, the atmosphere is good, and I really like sitting out in the back open area.

Try the Sloppy Joseph fries appetizer. You won't be disappointed. The bacon wrapped meatloaf is good. I've never seen anyone get anything they weren't happy with.

I've been there with a group of about 6 people and another group of about 14 people. All had a great time.

I would recommend Mayworth Public House to anyone."
4,"I've been going to this place for about 6 years now ... 
I only get pho , the shrimp rolls both with no meat and durian shake it's the best !! 
Can't say the same about the ladies that work there they look soo miserable and bothered all the time . The place isn't very clean as well .. Now I just order to go"
4,Love my Mazda so Much! I Have been a mazda owner for half my life and can't seem to give them up! Thank you David Starlin with helping me get my latest 2018 CX5!! YOU ARE AWESOME. Not in love with the financing personnel but nothing but positives on Dave and all the Mazda vehicles at CardinaleWay.
4,"Authentic Vietnamese food. The pho, vermicelli, rice and sour fish soup combo is great here. Service can be a dud sometimes but it's a minor setback when it comes with good and cheap food. 

Be careful of double charges. A friend ordered a drink and when he never got it he reminded them and they tried to charge him twice."
4,Fantastic dumplings.   Lots of food for the price.   We'll definitely be back!
4,I'm not a huge Fan of Pho but this place has great Pad Tai!
4,"I don't expect good service from most Chinese establishments but the staff are fast, friendly and wonderful here! Wide variety of options on the menu."
4,"Just happened upon this place, as we were walking our dog across the Isthmus. Lucky for us, there's a nicely-designed outdoor courtyard at Julep (shared with a wine bar and coffee shop) -- and they allow well-behaved pugs there. While it was a warmish evening, the restaurant also provided outdoor propane heaters when the temperature dipped. The wait staff were all extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu.

Which brings me to the food: It's well presented and super tasty. Since moving to Madison from New York City, I've been impressed by so many restaurants here. And Julep is now in the top--tier pantheon! Great (and yet inventive) Southern fare. Definitely try their Sno-cone-like mint julep... gorgeous presentation and (like all the food we tried) ultra-delicious."
4,"Great location in Summerlin in the Albertson shopping center. Prompt seating, service and food. So prompt that I felt rushed that's why I rated 4/5. Food was great. Very fresh! Venue was clean. They did lack on condiments though. Great lunch specials at $6-$7 for soup, rice and entry. Free fried noodles and sweet and sour dip upon seating. Free fortune cookie. I would definitely return."
4,"This is a very convenient place to live for students! When I was in college and didn't have a car, the shuttle to campus and close proximity to UNLV (along with being on a main bus line) made it much easier to commute between school, home, and my internship. The staff is very friendly and welcoming when ever you come in, whether you have a maintenance request or simply want to tan in the FREE tanning facilities! Sandy and Mandy are standouts when it comes to friendly staff. They are always there to help anyone who comes in and needs assistance with something and I feel so much more at ease when I walk in see one of their smiling faces! I recommend this for any students who are on a budget and looking to live close to school!"
4,"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Arrived around 7:30 which was great because after 8pm it filled up quickly and there was a wait Ronnie seated. The decor is nice but tables were too close together. We ordered the following:

paper masala dosa- it was HUGE! It was nice and crispy and delicious... chutneys were just ok

Egg biriyani- rice was light fluffy overall was tasty

Fish fry- only got a fillet was expecting more, taste was great but was pretty spicy!

Uttapam- not bad not great

Vadai- hot and crispy outside with a soft inside!

Overall was a great first experience!"
4,"My friend and I came here several times on weekends. We loved the ambience of the bar and Samy, one of the servers, was very sweet and kind. Also cute lol. I would come back to see him again! 
But I only can give 4stars because of the overpriced drinks!"
4,"I like Rebel Place.

I don't know how it compares to other apartments in Las Vegas, but compared to where I lived before moving to LV it's really affordable.

It's furnished, which is AWESOME

I like all the people that work in the front office, they are super nice :-)

I've been pleasantly surprised with how quiet it is at night.  I haven't seen any fights or public drug use or anything of that nature, which is pretty impressive considering it's mostly college students.

I'm very happy with it."
4,"I never had a chance to go to their old location and I'm glad I waited for this one. It's beautiful. Love the architecture and colours.

Went here for the brunch experience and to be honest, it wasn't bad. There were dishes I wish I had tried but I can only try one thing at a time. So yes, I'd definitely visit again.

Customer service here was a stand out from the beginning. Friendly, informative and people generally seem to enjoy themselves, always a good sign.

Food here has a South American influence as you peruse the menu. There are a lot of things I wanted to try Coffee. I ordered their GRINGO breakfast: bacon, spiced home fries, eggs, roasted tomato and toast.

It was delicious. 

Coffee was spot on so was their churros!

Very curious to try their dinner menu."
4,"I really enjoy this place. The food is pretty good and really nice location right across from Goat Island Park. It's perfect for lunch and then taking the kids to park after. 

The last time I was here I had the cobb salad and it was enormous! For a salad it was incredibly satisfying. My wife had the Korean BBQ chicken sandwich. I only had a taste of it but it was pretty great.

Only minor complaint was that the last time we were there our server forgot about us towards the end of our meal. We waited patiently for the check probably 10 minutes after we asked for to go boxes and ended up having to flag down someone else to get things wrapped up. It happens, not the end of the world and most of the time things go fine.

I'd recommend this place, definitely worth checking out."
4,"What is up with the low reviews?  The breading was crispy but light not hard, the collards amazing, the butter was salted and delicious and syrup so thick it left trails like glue.  The chicken was super juicy and well seasoned, so that my son hated to put hot sauce on it because he couldn't taste the seasoning on the chicken.  I have only had chicken and waffles in 3 states and it is still top notch in my book.  I guess the lower ratings could be because the waffles weren't all that crispy."
4,"This Chinese style Restaurant has a very good selection of entrees.    The menu is varied and tasty.   Highly recommend the Hong Kong Noodle , Lemon Chicken, Wor Won Ton Soup, Cashew chicken which is my favorites.    Our family loves the Boba drinks however their are times when they don't completely cook the boba correctly and it ends up being very hard.  The biggest plus is the fact that the lunch specials and the sodas are less expensive when you order online and they deliver it.   There is a $2 delivery charge but there is a quite a difference in price per entree.   Delivery is limited area around the restaurant.."
4,"After reading some previous reviews I came to this place skeptically after being in my Yelp bookmark list for an extended amount of time.

Were the reviews to be true?


DECOR :

You can't help but notice when coming in that this place is the ultimate diner experience at least in terms of decor. Huge comfortable ""banquets"" to sit at that scream the 50ies or 60ies to you. Huge jukebox in the middle of the restaurant. Music from another time compliments the joyful atmosphere. The decor is simply fantastic! It's an experience in itself. I can't help but marvel at accomplishing such an atmosphere and appreciate it.


FOOD :

I ordered the Dean Cheese Burger with a side of onion rings and special garlic mayo. This joint allows you to custom your burger by choosing the type of meat you want and the type of bun you want as well. So I went with the a Pumpernickel bun,  traditional fresh ground beef and Monterrey Jack cheese. I also ordered a root beer float.  If I was going to stack the calories... I might as well do it the right way, right?

And I sure did!

The root beer was ridiculous. It was bigger than my head! What a generous amount! And mightily delicious as well! I recommend trying it! Wow!

The Dean Cheese burger was good but nothing that stands close to burgers you'd find at Five Guys or La Belle et la Boeuf. The onion rings and side garlic mayo however were palatable. I was full but I couldn't help myself and needed to finish it all. What an experience!

My friend ordered the same burger and decided to go with the fries. He felt the same way about the burger and loved the fries. At least those I stole from his plate. :)

He also ordered a May West milkshake and it was delicious! I had some... since the waitress not only gave him his milkshake but the EXCESS of the milkshake (basically 1.5 milkshakes!)

Incredible!


SERVICE :

The service was solid. We got prompt service when seated and got taken care of during our visit. The was the perfect amount of attention. Kudos on this.


PRICE :

I found the price tag to be expensive with most burgers being on average about 15$. For this price, you'd expect excellence but perhaps it was the Dean Cheese burger but I didn't feel I got my value. Most shakes/floats are very reasonably priced and the extras are just about right. So this is where they lose the 5 star rating.


BOTTOM LINE :

I give this place a solid 4 stars. Even perhaps a 5 stars if my burger didn't impress me. Perhaps on future visits (and there be more!) I will correct this score to a proper 5 stars.

I'm happy I tried this place, despite the yelp critics. It pleases me to prove them wrong. People are far too willing to 5 star or 1 star their experiences."
4,"When in town, and being shown around by a (nearly) life-long resident of the Slopes, the Pretzel Shop is part of the tour. Wow. Was I impressed with the variety and price! Holy cow, everything was tasty (we tried a few varieties because, why not?) and I'm so glad we had someone show us this place. I doubt I would have found it on my own. 

Pro-tip: Bring cash."
4,"This coffee shop has great coffee, but more importantly, if you want a coffee shop with some buzz but not quite the noise level of Sip, Cartel, or other highly frequented coffee shops in the area, this is the place for you!"
4,"This is a great place to go with family and friends. Very friendly staff and has a lively atmosphere. Has the feel of an old nostalgic type diner. If you're coming here, you'd best forget about any diet you might be on. The food here will give any nutritionist a heart attack :) But that's what makes it so great. From burgers to fries to good old mac and cheese, they've got everything to crush any cravings you might have. Indulge yourself in their milkshakes or floats. Don't hold back. Regret and guilt is best saved for any other night of the week. But while you are there, just enjoy yourself."
4,"My hubby really wanted to try the waffles so one blustery and gray Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to go and try. I have wanted to try WI for a while now and just didn't get there so now that they are so close, makes it very easy. I checked the no wait app and there was no wait. Onward we went. There was a line but there was a huge party waiting to be seated. It took a few minutes but it was not bad and once we got to the host stand we were immediately seated. I have to say, unfortunately our waitress was not good. She walked back and fourth a few times before bringing our coffee. Making excuses. Then she brought the wrong meal for my husband blaming the kitchen. Never asked my hubby if he needed a water refill. Then she brought the check and did not even ask if dessert was in our future. Thankfully the food was great (the only reason this gets a 4and not a 5, our waitress). The waffles light and fluffy and the toppings we got were wow, just wow! And there are so many choices. I chose the chicken and waffles. I didn't even need syrup on it. The waffle with its pecans, light and fluffy. The fried chicken tenders on top were sweet, tender, and a little crispy. The hubby chose the sausage gravy and waffles, double portion which didn't look like a double but who are we. But the sausage gravy was seasoned wonderfully with nice big  chunks of sausage. Overall, the food is delicious. Our waitress was not good. But I would and we will certainly go back."
4,Nice bbq place that we need in this area.  Enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  Everything is ala carte but the portions are good.  Much enjoyed the brisket and pulled pork
4,"Time to add on more accolades to the Pretzel Shop. Their pretzels are wonderful. For one of the cheapest, tasty lunches around, pick up a pretzel sandwich then head over to a park bench on a nice day and chow down. 

A few caveats though - 
1) They tend to run out. They will reserve pretzels for you if you call in advance, though.
2) They close way too early. They should be open till at least 7pm - preferably midnight. I can't imagine the post-bar business they could do on Carson St. As it is, you'd better not get a pretzel craving after 3pm or you'll be out of luck.
3) They don't sell chips. If you're the type of person who thinks that sandwiches and chips are made for each other, take the time to stock up on chips elsewhere. As others have said, they have lots of other baked goods including rice krispie treats and seasonal cookies. Personally, I recommend a side of pretzels."
4,Love this store but didn't really find anything I really wanted to plunk down a huge chunk of change on... Sales staff were much more pleasant to talk to than the assholes at Neiman Marcus.
4,"So glad I decided to try this hidden gem! There is live music and a fun environment. Meat is smoked right outside.

We shared the brisket with fries and the ribs with vegetables. The ribs were phenomenal and fall-off-the-bone tender. The brisket was good but nothing special. Vegetables were also good but not amazing. The fries were so amazing. They were hot and crunchy and we would have ordered more if we weren't so full from everything else! 

I'll definitely be back to enjoy the good food and good vibes. Free parking on site."
4,"I thought it was just another burger place but it was pretty good, I'd go again, fun feeling atmosphere and waiting staff. Just remember, it's a burger.... And the Poutine burger is awesome"
4,"I have been here a total of two times and found my experiences to be quite pleasant. The food is great and I do enjoy the set up. The prices are also pretty inexpensive and you get a lot of food for what you pay for. My only reason for giving this place four stars is that the first time I went the staff seemed to not care about their job, maybe it was because Friday nights are busy. They barely said anything as I placed my order and went back to my seat. The second time was a great experience though. I will be visiting again!"
4,"What a welcome addition to Wexford! Literally located in the plaza in front of North Allegheny High School and open at 8am for Breakfast/Brunch. When we searched for Brunch places to take our visiting out of town daughter last night & discovered this now existed, all 3 of us said, 'Done!' We've been to the Southside location before & this one pretty much replicated the great food in a slightly larger space with a bit more elbow room, so it's a win. 

My husband and daughter both got The Chunky Monkey Waffles with bananas, peanut butter and chocolate. There were loads of happy sounds from both of them across the table. I ordered The Souther' Waffles with chorizo, jalapeños, cheddar cheese, salsa and cilantro. Absolutely delicious with a nice kick of heat. My husband finished my last waffle section on my plate & also raved. Adding their Bourbon Maple Syrup to both our dishes was fabulous. 

Portions are large and quite filling and there's always a special waffle each month that your server will describe. Our service was great, coffee cups were always filled with piping hot coffee and we'll definitely be back!"
4,"Service was good and the ""duck"" noodles I  soup was pretty good...definitely come back to try their buffet sushi menu"
4,"Omg yes! It was amazing. Love this place! Will be back again and again. Everything tastes great. I got the blueberry BBQ chicken thing with squash salad. And the cheese was amazing on the cheese and pepper grilled cheese. Very good vegan place! Plus the atmosphere is nice too

Edit: only problem is they never seem to be open... went back many times and they are always closed...."
4,Love Wheelfish but think adding guacamole and homemade Blue cheese(actually all dressings) would be great!!
4,"We love wheelfish! It reminds me a lot of a place you'd find in town, not the burbs! The menu is small and focuses on BBQ-style foods like chicken, brisket and pulled pork. They also have sides like sweet potato fries, Mac n cheese, Cole slaw, and corn bread. I've had the pulled pork, fries and Mac and cheese and they were all really good. My only complaint is that it can be a little pricey and the portions, particularly the side dishes, are super tiny. The mac n cheese is $5 and you barely get a full cup-size portion. The specialty mixed drinks are also up there at $9."
4,"My wife wanted to visit this restaurant because it came in fourth on People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA's) list of the ""Top 10 vegan sushi restaurants in North America"" (http://www.yorkregion.com/community-story/2511035-vegan-eatery-in-markham-gets-thumbs-up-from-peta/).

Neither of us are vegetarian, but we quite enjoyed the food and were impressed at the lengths to which the restaurant went to mimic the flavour, appearance and texture of meat. To me, ""vegetarian"" usually means something that's entirely vegetable based or something with chucks of tofu in it. Occasionally you'll get something like a veggie burger that tries to mimic its meat-based cousins, but it was a bit of a surprise to see this approach being taken across an entire menu!

We had the ""vegetarian duck"" and the ""vegetarian beef."" The ""duck"" actually tasted quite a bit like the real thing! It also really looks like cooked duck. It's a bit surreal, but overall a solid dish. The ""beef"" didn't taste like anything that once had hooves, but the curry sauce they used was delicious and more than made up for this.

For an appetizer we had the won ton with peanut sauce. Again, the sauce was what really made this a winner. I would highly recommend this dish.

It was quiet on a weeknight, and the service was excellent. Unsurprisingly, the restaurant is unlicensed."
4,Brought a friend from out of town here to get pretzels. Where else are you going to get a good pretzel in the burg.
4,Always looking for a good Mexican place as it is my favorite thing to eat! Decided to give this place a try and I'm glad I did! We got seated right away on a Saturday night! Most of the burritos come with nacho cheese on them but I asked to get quest instead since I like it more. It was not a problem! Our waitress was very nice and attentive and food was delicious! Great and similar to any other Mexican restaurant! Only thing I wasn't fond of was my margarita. I usually like the frozen lime ones that most have but this was made in a blender and one of those ice at top liquid at bottom type of frozen margarita. Would get it on ice next time to solve this problem because other than that it was fantastic! Also has a large parking lot in the back so no worries about finding a spot!
4,My eggs Benedict was cold. Manager came by and replaced my meal and did not charge me. Second time around was great!
4,"I come here for one thing...


The grilled chicken chimichangas with the red sauce on the side so i can use it for dipping.  I cannot tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic. Do i love the price for all of this...I guess.  Its not a stellar deal or anything but its like a once a month or every other month thing for me.  I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand.  
Believe me Chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure.

Horchata is okay. Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion, I love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet.  One guy that works here knows my friend who is hooked to this place and got me started so when we walk through he already knows.  The girl who cannot do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story."
4,"The pretzel shop is a place anyone can love! If you're from out of town, the pretzel shop is definitely a place you want to consider stopping at. The people that own the shop/work at the counter aren't the friendliest but the pretzels are worth it and prices are cheap!"
4,"The only thing I hate about this store is the staircase. It's beautiful and all, but it's a major pain after a night out in heels.

Nonetheless, very helpful and friendly associates here. I love how spacious the setup is compared to the SF location, and not as crowded. There are seats here and there for your tired girl friends and husbands while you're shopping. 

Sometimes they have items that are not available in other stores. I remember coming here to purchase a baby blue colored Phillip Lim Pashli that I haven't seen at other stores. 

They have entrances from the end of the Venetian/Palazzo hallway and from the second floor of the Grand Canal Shops. Purses, cosmetics, jewelry on first floor.  Women's on second floor. Men's on third floor. If you hated the staircase too, maybe try coming in from the Grand Canal Shops entrance, it'll lead you right into the shoes section."
4,First time visit. Very cool atmosphere and vibe. Nice tables and awesome bar area as well. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Tried the brisket which was very tasty and with their different sauces you get to add on your own you will definitely find one you will enjoy.the salmon was very good sized portion and tasted perfectly smoked. Tried the fries which were very good and the mac and cheese which was even better. The slaw was different with candied pecans on top wihich was really tasty. Great local draft list and lots of bottles to choose from. I would recommend 100%
4,"This restaurant replaced Loco Lime....but dont go in expecting to compare the two because they are not nearly the same.  Not that one is better or one is worse.  

Went on a Monday night....very few diners present.

The decor has changed some.  Its casual and comfortable....but the lighting is a bit bright.  Tolerable, but bright.

They serve 2 types of salsa with their chips.  I liked the spicy one best.  It was quite tasty.  The chips weren't bad....but they weren't hot and fresh like at some other places.

My friend had the Nachos.  They looked pretty good and he had no trouble polishing off his plate.

I had the Shrimp Diabla.  It was Shrimp, Onions and mushrooms (which i added) in a spicy red sauce.  I couldnt believe how many shrimp they have me in this dish.  For $11....they had to lose $.   Either that or ive been getting ripped off at every other restaurant i eat shrimp at.  Anyway, it was loaded with shrimp.  The res saice was really really spicy....but not over done.  I really enjoyed my dish.  

Be very clear when you decide to do separate checks.  Otherwise, they will split the bill down the middle and run your card.  When we tried to have them correct it, it was explained to us that it would take a few days for the bank to adjust it on our accounts.

My friend got pissed over this, so i doubt we will be back...due to that fact only.

I liked the food....i would dine there again.

Not quite sure why other Yelpers have been giving it such bad press."
4,"What can I say except I have soft spot for Chick-fil-A.   Perhaps it's their world-famous chicken sandwich. Or perhaps their hatred of the sacred cow.  Either way I like it.   I prefer the plain old number one sandwich combination, hold the pickle.   Also, their milkshakes are rather tasty.  However, their waffle fries could use some improvement, . as could their approach for filling up soda behind the counter. Other than that, I'm sorry Yelp, I'm giving a fast food restaurant four stars."
4,"Vegan yummy heaven, great place to take kids for a treat and not feel guilty. Very happy to support!"
4,"Yes, I'm reviewing @ChickfilA, but with good reason.

Marissa worked the counter today, and epitomized service with a smile!

She delivered our food to the table, and even asked if we needed refills on our drinks.

She was one of the friendliest people I've ever encountered at a fast food restaurant, and should be praised by her employer.

The food is pretty good, and I would probably go to Chik fil-A before KFC.

But I just want to rave about the service."
4,"Fast food can be delicious, at least at Chik-Fil-A!

I met some moms here for a little play date and lunch, I hate McD's and this is another option - a better, cleaner, more nutritious and delicious option.

UPS:
My daughter hates nuggets, any nuggets, anywhere.  She LOVED these nuggets and the fruit cup, she finished it all!  

The play area is smaller but it's nicer and cleaner and has less kids running around (at least on this afternoon).

They have delicious and fresh salad options which also come with their scrumptious chicken (you can get grilled too).  Love the dressings!

Friendly and helpful staff.

DOWNS:
A little pricey for those fresh salad options (almost $8)

Sucky kids toys (comic book?)"
4,"Solid Chik-Fil-A. I came here for lunch and ordered a Chik-Fil-A sandwich with medium fries and a drink. The staff was incredibly friendly and brought me my food when it was ready. The food was great! Just like every Chik-Fil-A I've been too. The chicken was nice and crispy. The fries were great with polynesian sauce and what can i say I'm a fan of the place, so it was very enjoyable. As I was only on vacation, but come down here eery year for Spring Training I will definitely drop by again in the future when I am back in the area."
4,"Not bad for a vegetarian restaurant. The food is fresh, creative, and inspiring. It's not easy to replicate sushi or duck/pork using soy, but they pull it off in a fresh and tasty way."
4,"Barney's is totally a great place to shop if you have extra money to spend. Barney's carries a variety of clothing, brands ranging from levi's&kid robot to YSL&Christian Louboutin. It's a shoppers paradise.  Located at the Palazzo on the Las Vegas strip it truly is a great place to stop by and check out. Also if you plan on shopping here, they also have they're own valet so you don't have to walk far. Look for Emmanuel he'll take good care of your car for you while you shop.  Overall a great place to shop while visiting Las Vegas."
4,"Vegas is the heaven for exquisite shopaholics like myself. There are more high-end shops within a short 3 mile LV STRIP radius than anywhere else in the country. But if you are like me who always look to stand out from the crowd and deeply care about the quality of the cloth one wear, and most importantly you would like to have many trendy brands to pick from at once, just go shop at BARNEY'S. I do all the time.

My only complain is that the Vegas's BARNEY'S is not quite as large as the ones in LA, SF and NYC.  Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars ........."
4,Really good food! Fast and friendly service. Menu was pretty big with lots of options. Chips and salsa were good and I had a chimichanga which was excellent! Plaza Midwood is a favorite area for us and this is on our top 5 list.
4,"I would typically give a place like this 3 stars, but it's surprisingly difficult to find 'standard' mexican restaurants this close to uptown.

Also, does anyone else think this is just Loco Lime with a name change?  They even have the toy vending machines...."
4,"Typically I wait to try a few things in the menu before I review a restaurant. This is just for the readers looking for something on Saturday or Sunday. That something, is the menudo. It's perfect. Buy it."
4,"I do like their food. I like how the kid meals come with something educational instead of some piece of plastic junk. The only thing I would say is for the price, I think their portions could be a little bigger. I am always wanting just a couple more waffle fries."
4,"Definitely a unique location. If you are feeling adventurous, then you may want to try a pretzel sandwich. The first time I ordered a pretzel sandwich I was completely surprised by the sight. I thought I was going to have an ordinary sandwich with some sort of golden crusted bread; I was very wrong. The bread portion of the sandwich was a pretzel cut in half. The key to a good experience is figuring out how to hold the sandwich so that the contents do not fall out."
4,"I know, 4 Stars. Listen, not 5 Stars since I must venture over to the Strip.  On the flip
Side, it beats the mass shopping mall nearby.
Ways stocked with particular designers' trendy pieces.  The best and latest and greatest in perfumes, colognes, makeup and skincare lines. 
Essentially, Barneys has and will always stock the current 'it' designers.
It's not overly packed with people and/or merchandise which is a plus for myself.  Always clean, immaculate and merchandised laid out perfectly.  Creating an enhanced and flowing through the store experience. Yes, experience- brought to you by the exceptional Barney's staff."
4,"Love the lavender toddy!
Also really good chai here....
Love the vegan options here....
Love the vibe here!

Ordered the squawker Texas ranger sandwich (vegan buffalo chicken sandwich with arugala on top of a rustic crunchy bread ) with a side of sweet potatoes and black bean salad....all delicious!!!

Service was a tad slow but the gave us $1.00 off cards for our next visit.....


Will definitely be back...."
4,"Another great experience at WI. I love the fact you can check in with the No Wait app, limits the amount of time you have to wait for a table. Tried 2 new waffles, the December monthly special Fig waffle and the Country Benedict. Loved them both. Just an fyi the military discount here is 10% every day and 40% when in uniform!"
4,"What a hidden gem in the north hills, literally! It sits right behind Adrian's Pizza off of Thompson Run Road. This is exactly what this area needed since there are a ton of chain restaurants and I am not a big fan of chains. I grew up in a small town that was filled with mom and pop restaurants and I always loved these types of places. I stumbled upon Wheelfish on Facebook one night and was so eager to try it! I have been looking for a good bbq spot and this place is it. 

If you are looking for a place to grab drinks they have a pretty big bar area or if you are looking to grab drinks to go you can build your own six pack. 
The menu is simple and I honestly didn't mind it being that way. I ordered pulled pork ($5)(quarter pound) and a side of mac and cheese ($5). The menu is a la carte so you are going to pay for your sides if you want them. The mac and cheese was homemade and topped with bread crumbs. Very creamy! The pulled pork was also very tasty and just enough for me. It also comes in a half pound if you are really hungry. My mom ordered a half rack of ribs ($13) with a side of curly fries. I did try her ribs and fries and I LOVED them both. The ribs were a dry rub, but they do have 3 different bbq sauces to add to your meal if you wish to make things more saucy. The curly fries came out with a special homemade sauce on the side and I wish I knew what was in this sauce because I put it on everything it was so good! 

I really loved everything about this place the rustic decor, the simple menu, and great food. Everyone, go try Wheelfish you will not be disappointed! Finally, a relaxing place I can go to that's so close to home!"
4,"ATMOSPHERE: Visually, it's a very nice restaurant. It's title is perfect for the vibe that they're trying to give off, the classic ""vintage"" look. And of course, they have a giant Jukebox right in the middle of the restaurant from which you can choose a variety of songs.

FOOD: It's your classic American food. Greasy, big portions and comforting but not the best quality. They give you a lot of fries but they aren't the best. I wasn't able to finish mine. The burgers are pretty good though, just be prepared to bring your appetite as it can get heavy!

PRICE: Quite honestly, the food is overpriced. Everything is extra now, even your choice of sides which is pretty disappointing seeing how the burgers are pretty expensive. I would only come here on rare occasions.

SERVICE: The staff is friendly and efficient."
4,"Not AYCE resto but quite impressed with the food! I'm not a vegan myself but decided to give it a go since my friend couldn't eat meat on Good Friday. Heck, the ""salmon"" and ""chicken"" tasted like the real thing! Scary! I would be returning and dine here on a regular basis. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed :)"
4,"For street tacos, these were pretty good. My husband liked the carne asada. I took part of the cashiers suggestion and had a carnitas taco, plus a chicken (my choice). I should've listened to her fully. The carnitas was off the hook! Chicken was fine. Just...fine. Only real downfall was the iced tea was old, which tastes nasty. The cashier gladly gave me a Bottle of water instead."
4,"I was here for the opening of the store. I did that overnight thing where I hung out in the parking lot and got 52 free cards for meals. That was mang years ago.
Since then, I've gone back many times. The food has been consistent and the service has always been great. When I worked nearby, I would come here for many busy lunches, and they always kept everything moving very quickly."
4,"I had driven by this place for a long time due only to it's choice of name and location - I thought ""Mucho Taco in a strip mall, how good could that really be?"" A friend of mine recommended, so I suggested to my Pops and we checked it out on a weekend menudo outing. I was very pleasantly surprised.

That was some time ago - it is now our normal Mexican food choice. We have not gotten too adventurous (as have some other reviewers) but I can attest to the deliciousness of the menudo (red), carnitas, carne asada, caldo de res and caldo de pollo. The churro's are always fresh and piping hot! I love the Limonada too.

As others have mentioned - great staff - you will likely see the owner  working here. They are always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere - it's a real small place with no frills."
4,"Jukebox's theme is the old 70's 80's style. They have a really beautiful location and it's usually busy for supper & lunch time. Although their food is a little expensive. They serve quality ground beef for their patties, you can even see the process through a window in the back which I find is cool. However, their most iconic food is the milkshake. They are delicious and are pretty big. Recommend trying this restaurant. Specially if you enjoy American food!"
4,"Great food, nice service, simple menu.  My only complaint was that the side order of eggs was small, but everything else was big.   Definitely making this a common stop for breakfast."
4,"Delicious at an amazing price! Whenever my family and I are around the area we stop in to get their pretzels. The original are my grandpa's favorite, and I love the cinnamon bites. Everything comes in a brown paper bag which adds to the charm of the place. This little shop is a staple of the 'Burgh."
4,Very nice place... Good Vibe... Lovely atmosphere... Decoration and setup is simply beautiful. The service was great... We had fun. Very family friendly and kids friendly. The food is not the best in town but value for money is excellent.
4,"I'm pretty positive that  La Unica has new owners over the past few months. I originally passed over this place a few months back due to the negative yelp reviews. After having a friend mention it, I gave it a try. I mean it's Mexican right by my house with outdoor seating. It doesn't get much better than that. 
This place is your standard Mexican it's no Pacos or Cantina, but it's good! If you're looking for a quick and affordable meal give this place a try. Starting out, the salsa is fresh and they give you mild and spicy- can't complain with that. The queso is simple, but does the trick. I've had the tacos- Al pastor, and a few others, always really fresh. More like street tacos. Last week, I split the 'No name' meal and it was enough food for both of us. 
The wait staff is speedy and friendly and I've always been able to get a table outside. I'm glad I gave this place a try. Simple Mexican- I'm a fan. I just hope the word doesn't spread too much about this place, but they deserve more business, so I'll do my Yelp duty and give them a deserved review."
4,Again - this joint is great-  I love the Cheddar and jalapeno - for only 1 dollar it is as cheap as eats get.  You can get a full lunch for $3.25-  Like the fresh pretzel with parm as well as the plain-  not a fan of the cookie and other baked good but other seem to buy them.
4,"Jukebox is a safe bet when you're in the west island and in the mood for good comfort food.
Service is prompt, portions are generous and prices are totally reasonable.
They make one of the best veggie burgers in town - IMO."
4,"Who knew Vegetarian sushi could be this surprisingly good!  Came here on a Saturday with JC because she was still on her vegetarian diet and it was surprisingly good!

We ordered the Agedashi Tofu, Sushi Combo A and a Green Dragon Roll to share.

The Tofu was the first dish that came and it tasted so good, tofu fried to perfection with a cucumber in the middle and topped off with a sauce that was very delicious (I wish I knew exactly what it was but it looks like soya sauce?)! 

Sushi Combo A was the next dish that came, it was a little smaller than expected but sharing with two people is still a good portion.  Out of all the items in the combo A, I was super impressed with the imitate salmon sashimii! How can someone make fake salmon so real where it tasted like salmon too!!

Green Dragon Roll was the last dish that came and it was delicious as well! The imitate crab tasted great and the avocado was very fresh.

I am really interested to know how they make such great imitate Japanese sushi and sashimi!  If you got friends that are vegetarian, I recommend this place!"
4,"I have only had the pretzel stick, but it was really great! Reminded me of the Philly pretzels of my youth. Pretzel was dense and chewy and they have little packets of brown mustard. Fabulous. 

The pretzel ""sandwiches"" they offer look pretty atrocious, but maybe I'm just a pretzel purist."
4,"Went at the busy hour of lunch, they were on their game in and out of the drive thru in less than 10min. Love the chicken wrap with spicy sauce and love the waffle fries."
4,"I'd give it 3 stars compared to 3 Amgio's and sabor, but I'll be nice here.  4-5 star tacos, great salsa, and reasonable prices on everything else.  Not too much to hate on.

If in this area, I won't go here on a normal basis, as I do like the other places I mentioned above.  But the southside and northside La Unica's are my favorites in those areas.  All the locations have the same salsa and tacos, and that's really all I go for.  Its cheap, its easy, and its good.  What else do you need.  I certainly don't need some weird shrimp dish or something with a super rich cream sauce.

Service is friendly, food is good enough, you just won't find me at this location very often.  I hope you guys are happy with that 4th star, I thought twice."
4,"This was our first time to Wheelfish. We had previously been there when it was Frank N Steins and could see all the work they did outside & inside to renovate the property. It has a cool rustic feel. There is a bar area, separate restaurant area & little stage for live music. They are only open over the weekend.

Everything is a la carte. My husband and I shared the chicken (moist & delicious with the skin), smoked beef brisket (delicious, brought to you dry & they have multiple sauces they bring to you that you can put on - I didn't care for the sauces, but my husband did like the Cowboy), delicious sweet potato fries & the corn muffin (my husband loved it. I thought it had a weird taste). It was definitely enough food for both of us. You don't get a lot of brisket (small portion), but do get a lot of chicken (small portion). 

When the chicken first came it was not cooked enough. My husband sent it back & they were very nice about it. The owner brought it out, apologized & gave it to us for free because she wanted us to have a good first experience. The waitress was also very nice. They know good customer service & could teach a few local restaurants a thing or two.

They have a cooler that you could get mix & match 6 packs to go. They have a great craft beer selection & good imports. The only bad thing was they thought Blue Moon was domestic. 

Great place! You definitely need to check it out. We'll be back & are happy to have a great local place."
4,"Went here yesterday afternoon.

Wow- what great burgers! and huge portions!

Service was not the best that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars- but the food was really good.

I had the hot rod and the wife had the gleason which she could not finish- I was happy to help! 

The burgers are probably twice the size of Five Guys ones. Don't get the gleason unless you are pretty hungry!

For the people who think it is overpriced/expensive- get real- this is a restaurant, not McDonalds. Just for fun I checked Jack Astors... they have burgers at $14 and shakes at $5. Uhh... that's the same price.

The only slight complaint I would have was the service was ok but not great- they had baby chairs but did not offer it even though I was holding a baby, so I went and got it myself, and  they could not substitute our kids ice cream for a small milkshake because they only have one size... so we got the shake anyhow... and boy am I glad we did... delicious! 

Definitely will be going back!"
4,"I had no idea a Waffles INCaffeinated was coming to the Wexford area. I've never been to one before but I have heard of it. I was on the NoWait app the other day going somewhere else for breakfast and Waffles INC popped up (Yes, they are on NoWait!). I didn't go that day but told myself to try it soon. 

I tried it today and I was pleasantly surprised. It's located in the plaza right in front of North Allegheny Senior High School. If you drive too fast, you might miss it. The sign outside is a little small. The environment itself is pretty small too but quaint enough to be a nice-sized diner. It wasn't too busy so we sat down right away. 

They have  a large menu filled with unique breakfast items like chicken and waffles, Eggs Benedict called ""Benny"" with a waffle substituted for the english muffin and topped with crab, and the ""Breakfast Magic,"" which is what I got. It's a waffle with bacon, cheddar cheese, and green onions cooked into the waffle topped with more bacon and cheese as well as a sunny-side-up egg. You can even create your own waffles, omelettes, and crepes with a large array of fillings and toppings. Also, the portion sizes are pretty large. 

I'm a big coffee person so great coffee is key. They have their own brew and I approve of it. You can even pay fifty cents extra to include a shot of flavoring such as gingerbread. You are given a small cup full of the syrup so you can accordingly add it to your coffee. The coffee cups are a little small for my preference but the coffee itself is great. 

If you're looking to try something different for brunch other than your typical eggs and bacon, try this place!"
4,"I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife.  We ended up headed to Wheelfish because one of my bowling teammates told me that it was good.  Whenever we arrived to the restaurant at right around 7 PM both the bar and the restaurant were jam packed.  Thankfully there ended up being a single two top available which we were seated at.  The unfortunate part about that was that it was near the door and so it was cold every time someone came in or out which happened frequently.  The inside of wheelfish is composed of two levels with the top level consisting of the bar sitting a couple of feet above the dining room.  The walls are decorated with what looked like reclaimed wood and the night that we were there a live band was playing.

For our entrees on this evening my wife and I decided to split a ton of different meats as we often do at BBQ restaurants.  So my wife went with the smoked eggplant with a side of sweet potato fries while I went with the brisket with a side of Mac and cheese.  Then we also also ordered 1/4 pounds of chicken and pulled pork.  It all looked pretty good whenever it was delivered to the table with my only concern being the fact that the chicken was still on the bone which I don't like.  Ironically the chicken ended up being my favorite thing due to the spice rub on the outside and the fact that it was cooked nicely.  The pulled pork was flavorful and juicy and while I enjoyed the brisket it was weird for me to see a 1/2 pound of it cut into only 3 strips.  My least favorite main dish of the night ended up being the smoked eggplant which while good and certainly the most innovative wasn't completely my cup of tea.  Out of the sides I liked the sweet potato fries better and thought that the Mac and cheese was adequate although nothing to rave about.  After we had finished our meals my wife asked to see the dessert menu which consisted entirely of Leona ice cream sandwiches.  It's good to see one local business supporting another!

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Hopefully next time we get a seat a little further away from othe door but I thought that the food was good and enjoyed the live music."
4,"Food is authentic and very good, service is fast, most waitresses need a new personality. They are all angry at the world."
4,"What's not to love about Chik-fil-A? Their food is good and the preparation is consistent. This location in particular always has very friendly staff. Remember that they are closed on Sundays. I've caught myself pulling in there a couple times only to realize that I'm there on a day that they are closed. I appreciate that they are closed on Sundays and holidays so their staff can spend time with their families, however, so I don't mind one bit."
4,"Looking for an American Tradition burger joint ?!
 
Come on down to Jukebox! lol (not paid for saying that).

I actually love that location in the West Island. They have that modernized Jukebox where you can choose you songs and will be played once it's your turn (playlist).

Staff are amazing, quick and fun to talk with. Variety of choices for entrés, main dishes and dessert. I've tried their burgers and it's fulfilling. Love it . I also tried the Cherry Coke and I can spend the whole night drinking that lol.

Each time I end up to Jukebox, I always tell myself I will get a milkshake... due to the size of the food and how delicious they are ... I never got the chance to try. So if anyone have tried it, please let me know (I love vanilla)...lol!"
4,"Finally went to this restaurant after months of having it bookmarked on Yelp. They have an all vegetarian Japanese menu! We ordered the tom yum veggie seafood soup and sushi combo F (comes with 5 sashimi, 5 sushi, and 6 california rolls). The sashimi was so good, the highlight was definitely the mock salmon, which tasted exactly like real salmon. If we just got the combo, I would've given this place 5 stars, but the tom yum soup is where the restaurant fell short for me. The soup was incredibly sour, so we told our waitress. When she came back with the soup, it was pretty evident that all she did was add some hot water to it.

Service itself was kind of lacking for me, as well. The server was curt when we were asking questions about the menu. Additionally, she forgot to bring the miso soup to us; we had to explicitly ask! Overall though, food came out quick and efficiently.

Verdict: Would love to come back to try other menu items, and will definitely be getting the salmon again!"
4,"I've been to a few Barneys stores, and this Las Vegas location is the best.  One salesperson in particular was really helpful, polite and enjoyable to talk with since he was a former Chicagoan: German (pronounced Herman).  He didn't work in the Men's department, but he helped me make a clothing decision and seemed so personable without being pushy.  The store design and layout are typical Barneys: eclectic and sophisticated without overwhelming the clothes and goods."
4,"I ate here with my wife for Sunday brunch. We ended up going to north park in the morning and watched the wait time decrease on the yelp app from 45 minutes down to 0. That is a VERY useful feature!!! We were seated quickly and the inside is a little small and fairly packed in with tables. 

I'm not a huge sweet person for breakfast, but I do love chocolate chips in my pancakes and the funky monkey waffle sounded amazing! I ended up going with the chicken and waffles instead since this isn't too popular a dish in the Pittsburgh area. My wife and I shared a side of home fries as well. The waffle was huge and tasty; a great combination of sweet and savory together.  There were 4 large chicken strips on the waffle as well as scallions. I liked the vanilla syrup better than the maple and the home fries were good as well. My wife had half the berry waffle which looked great for a sweet tooth like hers. 

I liked my experience here. Prices are a little higher than what I typically would like to spend but the food quality is definitely there with some unique dishes. The unique part makes this a worthwhile stop if you are a fan of waffles!"
4,"I LOVE this place. It's fun and friendly and the food is really good. Juicy, flavourful burgers that come with many different toppings. Great fries ( I prefer the Waffle fries which unfortunately are an extra 2$). The menu is extensive and I've yet to tray anything but the burgers 'cuz they just call to me  but that have mac and cheese choices as well as other diner faves.
The place does get a little loud but thats ok, it's a gathering place after all. 
I can't wait to come back!"
4,"Like many others, I visited Jukebox Burgers after seeing them on the Food Network. I thought what a fun looking diner, can't believe it's not in the USA! It lived up to expectations. I felt transported to a different time and location upon entering the restaurant. I love the old timey classic decor, music, dairy bar and comfort food. 

Don't be scared by the long lines, it gets packed on weekends but we didn't have to wait more than ten minutes and we were a group of 5. Service is pretty fast. 

I've been twice in two weeks with a group of people and we all enjoyed our meals. For starters, the wings are jumbo sized with a tangy homemade sauce that truly tastes homemade. The chili nachos were the cheesiest and meatiest I've ever had - plus they serve guacamole at no extra charge.
 Burgers are a towering, super sized deluxe creation, and my favorite- the mac and cheese is creamy and filling. I've tried the philly steak mac and cheese as well as the Mexican style which has lots of ground beef, beans and a hearty sauce on top of your classic cheesy goodness. You just can't go wrong. There are so many options and ways to customize, build your own burger and choose from a variety of sides. 
Pair that with a custom milkshake or a cherry cola float served in a giant 1liter glass, it's a meal to remember. 

I went all out, and was so full I couldn't find room for dessert but if you're going as a group and want ice cream they offer this mega platter served in a sink (yes!) Or opt for their Joe Louis ice cream sandwiches with fudge on the side to dip in. 

I'll be back, I need to try more. I'm hungry as I type. 

Bonus- free WiFi. Lots of comfy booths and coat hangers. 
Minus- it's pricey. 75$ for two people on both occasions I went. And very loud. It's kid friendly so expect a few cries/ screams."
4,Great tacos and burritos. It looks dead and small but the food is awesome!! I'm here visiting and loved this little hole in the wall.
4,"If you're looking for a mean burger, an elevated mac n cheese or just a classic milkshake, this is the place for you. The food is excellent. The decor is really cute with obvious 50s diner influences. One down side is that it's quite loud. However, thats never turned off from enjoying my time there."
4,One of my go to places to take anyone when they say their craving something different. Jukebox has a greasy vibe friendly staff and amazing food ! Anytime I've eaten here weather in a large group or on a date staff was friendly and always had great recommendations. There are so many different sides that you can choose from to go along with your massive burger that I'd be surprised if you can finish your whole plate. I tend to stick to the curly fries when I eat here but the onion rings or Mac and cheese are also great sides. Whatever burger you get is sure to leave you full but if somehow you still have room left try a delicious milkshake or my favourite the white chocolate  macadamian nut cookie for dessert. You definitely gotta taste this place !
4,"It was a very nice cafe with some interesting vegetarian options. I'm an omnivore and liked the soyrizo breakfast bagel and coffee. They did have dairy for the coffee upon request.

If you have to have meat you may want to eat elsewhere."
4,If you are going to eat fast food this is a much tastier option than some other chains out there. An added bonus is that their lemonade is delicious! The restaurant is usually clean and the service is quick and friendly. I like their original chicken sandwich and the fact that their fries aren't overloaded with salt. The chicken is well seasoned and juicy and the pickles add a little zing. They are always happy to offer up sauces with your order in case you want to jazz up your sandwich or fries.
4,"More of a 3.5. I've tried both a la carte and ayce sushi. I would say a la carte is the better deal. Alternatively if you like the variety in ayce, it may be more economical to get a few bento box orders so you can get tempura and a variety of rolls and/or ""sashimi"". The price of the ayce is comparable to sushi places with real meat/fish, and I feel kind of ripped off paying that same price for fake meat/fish which cost less.

 Speaking of sashimi I was quite impressed by how close to the real thing this place got. The texture is like a firm jelly and they lay the sashimi on top of seaweed so some of the fishy taste latches on to the ""sashimi"". Their specialty rolls are also very good. In particular I recommend the super yam roll and the one with mango. Each roll is very sizable and are loaded with ingredients. 

They also offer some chinese/thai dishes. I recommend anything that is fried and slathered with their sweet and sour. This ranges from fake chicken to bean curd slithers and all are delicious. Batter is super crispy and sweet and sour sauce reaches the perfect balance between the two tastes.

Overall great place to go with a vegetarian friend who's tired of the typical vegetarian fare!"
4,"This place is pretty good! Very cute location. Perfect for visiting all the local shops nearby. Food and coffee was delicious. We had a grilled (Diaya) cheese and Philly. I loved the atmosphere - it was similar to Cornish Pasty. 

Service was fine. Not very impressive."
4,"The burritos are delicious because of the homemade goodness inside of them, however, they're significantly smaller and more expensive than other Mexican joints. The Red chili is amazing and always fresh. Service is top-notch, and the store is always clean."
4,"Food was amazing, but the ticket time was terrible. We order and 20 minutes later the waitress came to apologize and said ""our ticket times are slow today"" it took 50 minutes from the time we ordered until served. The waitress was great, food was amazing, but kitchen was terrible in speed."
4,"We like bringing our kids to chick fil a because of the nice family atmosphere. We unknowingly came here on a fundraiser night. Even though it was very busy, the tables were cleared fast and the bathrooms were clean. 
I didn't give 5 stars because we were slightly disappoint in the under cooked fries and chicken nuggets. We still are everything up but I prefer when the fries and chicken are crisper."
4,"What a unique place for breakfast!!! While just slightly over priced, the menu gives you a wide variety of meals to choose from!!  I had the chicken and waffles which was fabulous and the vanilla bean syrup they offer is spot on!  While the waitress worked as fast as she could - I do feel that a busy breakfast hour should have more than 2 waitresses working!  The place lacked in decor that was welcoming and would tie in the unique food with the over all experience of the place! This location is located in a small strip mall area in Wexford where the parking lot could stand to be slightly larger.  Most concerning would be the entrance and exit to the parking lot - if you're making a left hand turn from the parking lot you may be waiting for awhile on a busy highway at a busy travel hour.  I rated a 4 because my boyfriend and I enjoyed the food so much!"
4,"We had some great vegetarian food here - couldn't believe how good the Spicy 'Salmon' Sushi was...incredible flavours...

Portion sizes are small and the menu is expensive so will probably come for the odd sushi fix but will not be a regular"
4,"Solid barbecue spot with a rustic atmosphere, great service, strong drinks, and artisanal ice cream sandwiches for dessert. 

The half portion of ribs had a great,slightly sweet bark, and lots of meat underneath that was fall-off-the-bone tender. Others in my party had the smoked-then-fried chicken, which was juicy with a crispy skin, with a pleasingly subtle smoky flavor. 

We had the smoked peach and Manhattan, Pennsylvania drinks, and they were right good thanks to top-shelf liquor and butters as a base. 

Would love to come back when they have live music.  Super chill and intimate venue for that."
4,"La Unica is a great Taco Tuesday spot. The service is fast and friendly, especially Ron. The tacos auténticos have a large variety to choose from, plus they're only a dollar and delicious! If the house margarita doesn't do it for you, I highly recommend the jalapeño margarita if you can handle the spice. While the mild and spicy salsas are great, queso is a must."
4,"Great place for the family to enjoy some comfort food. My burger (Humphrey) was pretty good. The wife had the Philly steak sub that she truly enjoyed. Smoked meat poutine was awesome! My son enjoyed his curly fries. Service was very attentive, very friendly. We shall be back!"
4,BBQ in Pittsburgh? Hmmm...it honestly wasn't what I was expected and that's a good thing. Meat was tender and smoky...I wish it could have come with the bark because that's my favorite part of eating BBQ. The sides were filling and tasty. There was plenty of parking but this establishment is kind of hidden so keep your eyes peeled!
4,"Awesome mom and pop shop. Recommend to me by my very favorite hotel concierge Angelica. 
Wonderful food. Not just because of the large portions but because the food is spectacular. I had the verde pork with the homemade tortillas beans and rice. Enough for two meals by the way. 
Great place for lunch or dinner if you are a true Foodie !!!"
4,"On a Saturday night, the place was packed but they managed to squeeze us into a side table with a great view of the stage.  We had to flag down the manager to ask if we had a server because other tables around us were all being served and we were thirsty.  Evidently, the hostesses need to inform the wait staff who has which table and she forgot to assign someone to us.  Both the manager and the hostess were supremely apologetic.  Perfect response in such a situation. Now, the service is chaotic, grant you, and a little slow but this mom and pop BBQ joint gets the job done.

We ordered the smoked eggplant, the grilled veggies side, and a few beers to start.  The grilled veggies were al dente and perfectly cooked.  The eggplant came with a tomato ragout over it.  Eggplant being the super porous veggie that it is, absorbed all of the smoke in the smoking process so it sort of overpowered you with smoky flavor.  Some might like it that smoky but I would maybe recommend a shorter smoke time for that so it has a hint of smokiness instead of a sock in the mouth of smokiness. Otherwise, as did the grilled veggies, they need to find their salt and pepper shakers because nothing was seasoned.  

For entrees, we both got the salmon.  I ordered the quarter and my partner, the half pound portion (see pics of side by side sizing so you have an idea of the portions).  The salmon was very good other than needing some seasoning and the mac and cheese was superbly creamy and delicious.  The pork and beans were a little on the runny side and tasted really good.

The live music started at 8PM and added a nice background and they adjusted the volume to ensure people weren't being blasted out but could hear her.  Mary Lou Scherder did a nice set of 1970's and 1980's era hits and some country songs. Looks like she plays once a month.

We will try it again because everyone, patrons and staff, were super nice.  Think we'll try the brisket or ribs next time and maybe order up some bourbon to go with it."
4,"""sandwhiches"" were quite good. I enjoyed the pretzels, but nothing really blew my mind. Had the gyro, club, and chesseburger"
4,"What to do on Super Bowl Sunday when the Steelers aren't in it? Head to Waffles INCaffeinated for brunch. 

This location is in a small strip mall - that it is literally in front of North Allegheny High School. There's a small parking lot, but we able to grab a spot.  

We checked the No Wait to see if there was a wait - but there wasn't so we were able to get seated right away. We arrived around 1:45pm and they are open until 3pm - so it wasn't too busy and nice and quiet. 

I ordered the Mega Berry waffle, my mom ordered the Breakfast Magic, my Dad order a custom waffle with apples and pecans, and we split an order of the home fries. My mom and I split our waffles down the middle. However, I enjoyed my Mega Berry waffle more. They also forget to add the whipped cream, but our waitress brought us a side of it. 

They have a loyalty program - so with our visits we were able to get a waffle free or $8.00 taken off the bill. Definitely a great loyalty program. 

I'll be back again soon."
4,"Came here on Taco Tuesday. Def one of her best taco Tuesday's. Their tacos are only $1 with a small up charge for sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes. The  barbacoa taco and the chorizo taco are a must have. The margaritas where huge and at a good price. Service could of been a little bit better. 


We were told to order the green sauce when they give u chips and salsa. It's great and only for spicy lovers like me!"
4,"Four STARS- I agree with previous reviews. It's Mexican food and it's clean & good. Nothing really to brag about - but even better - Nothing to complain about. 

It was good. The price was good. The service was good.  It's across the street from my friends office so we went there for lunch.  
It was good. 
So yes I feel confident you could enjoy a Mexican meal here.  

I've had better food at other places but for a meal on the cheap on Central Avenue... this is definitely an available option."
4,"Si vous êtes du genre péquiste facilement offensé par un mot d'anglais, je vous conseiller de prendre une grande respiration avant d'entrer chez Jukebox parce que le ""bonjour hi"" de l'hôtesse pourrait vous choquer profondément. Pour ma part, le mot ""hi"" m'agace parce qu'il y a plusieurs autres façons de saluer dans la langue de Byron : hello, good afternoon, good evening, etc. 

Maintenant, parlons Jukebox. Le menu est très varié. Bien que leur spécialité soit les burgers, les fans de Mac 'n' cheese, de salades et de wraps seront aussi comblés ! Vous êtes vergé ? Vous pouvez remplacer la galette de viande par une galette végétarienne. À ce sujet, je vous conseille le Burger Béliveau avec galette végé. 

Pour le reste, allons-y rapidement : personnel courtois, endroit très propre, mais musique peut-être un peu trop forte."
4,I am addicted to the grilled chicken and fruit salad. It is low cal if you use the low cal dressing and very filling. The staff will go out of their way to get things right- and make your experience a positive one.  I buy the nugget trays too when I am having guests and it is always the first thing to be finished.
4,"Fantastic value for quick and tasty treats for lunch! Stopped by here on a busy Saturday afternoon and was impressed with the range of sandwich offerings and variations of pretzels. For a mere 6$ my family of three ordered a gyro pretzel and 2 pizza pretzels which were all really tasty and filling. Although we were eating a light lunch in between other stops, the pretzels were satisfying. The line was full of regulars and it's clear from the efficient and friendly service that The Pretzel Shop has a great business model. I totally understand why this is a popular establishment and am hoping to return. Also, for those traveling with little ones, this place is toddler-approved!"
4,I really enjoyed the vibes and the food was amazing ! I live so close and kind of mad at myself for not stopping by sooner !  I had the avocado toast and Mystery burrito ! They were both delectable and affordable !!
4,"If you are looking for some good BBQ, give Wheelfish a try.  Good BBQ in a reclaimed wood environment.  Really friendly and good service.  Was told they do have live Blues music some nights. Will have to stop by and have some Q, Blues & Bourbon.  
Decided to try the ribs and Mac & Cheese.  The ribs were well cooked and tender with nice flavors.  It did come with a little side (a couple of bits) of picked onions, a couple of pickled green beans and some lettuce.  The Mac & Cheese was creaming and both were piping hot.  The have three sauces you can use - The Cowboy is the spicy, a Traditional and a sweet."
4,"Excellent tacos. Had the shrimp and pastor. Both were delicious and fresh. Reasonably priced with free chips and salsa which were also very good. The homemade hot sauces and lime were a nice accompaniment.

My fellow diner was disappointed by the smaller size of the tacos, but I thought they were just fine for the price. Only wish I could have had a margarita with my meal. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chandler."
4,"The sushi chef who works there, is extremely generous and friendly. 

My boyfriend and I were seated at the bar area, on a Saturday night, because all of the tables were taken. The sushi chef was polite, he asked us about our day, and made the occasional small talk, when we made eye contact. We order from the AYCE menu, however, the chef hooked us up with fancy sushi that were on the regular menu.

On a side note, I was recommended to this restaurant, for them having the best vegan sushi in Toronto. When I was there, I've noticed that the restaurant had the word ""vegan"", plastered on placemats, posters... Etc. (Which I thought was quite deceiving, because this isn't a vegan restaurant). They use actual dairy dressings, for their salads, the wontons there contain eggs, and the spicy mayo topping (for sushi) isn't vegan as well. The ice creams are regular dairy ice creams.

Vegans need to notify the server before ordering."
4,"It's so nice to see a vegan place in downtown Mesa, but they need to be consistent with their schedule. I stopped by yesterday afternoon, and the store was not open. The Yelp app showed that they were open till 8 pm, but they weren't, so I ended up going to Worth Take Out instead. It was too bad because they have good food here. I've had the Boy Blue Vegan Fried Chicken at Volstead with blueberry BBQ sauce, cole slaw, and cheese in a potato bun, and was looking forward to trying the other items. The menu seems to change also, so be sure to check out their online menu to see what they are serving that day. 

Closest Light Rail Stop: Country Club & Main Street"
4,"Great selection of pretzels. So many different kinds to choose from. The pretzels are a little harder on the outside compared to Annie Anne's but they're still really good, and offered at really good prices. The cookies are good too! They also offer a selection of pretzel sandwiches and pepperoni rolls that aren't too bad either. If you're looking for something quick, this is a great place to stop in."
4,"This is my first time here.

It's small, but the use of the space is well thought out.  The staff hustles and quickly preps the tables.

The menu is made up of waffles, omelets and eggs. They like to put green onions on EVERYTHING, so be forewarned. 

I will come back, try something different and review again. But I will be back."
4,"I went to La Unica last night for the first time. I thought the food was pretty good.  As someone else mentioned they serve 2 types of salsa with chips, after chatting with the bartender a little, he brought us two additional salsa's to try, both had more way more spice than the first ones. The chips were hot and fresh and all 4 salsa's were very tasty. 

The steak fajitas were very good, meat was tender and well seasoned, the vegetables were very fresh.  My boyfriend had a sampler of the tacos and all were really good. 

Margaritas were awesome! Not too sweet - i hate that! Staff was incredibly friendly and fun.  

Dinner bill was under $40... overall its a pretty decent local mexican restaurant in Charlotte!"
4,"Since my last review, visited several more times. The food is still delicious (as usual) and I must say the service has improved significantly! I've had the pleasure of both dining in and ordering togo and I really don't have any complaints. Good job La Unica, I'm impressed!"
4,Nice and friendly staff. Great place for some good tacos.
4,The waffles are yummy and the service is good. Not very crowded during the week. Try the mega berry waffle!
4,"Great concept, good coffee and always attentive, friendly service. Interesting selection of menu choices with sweet and savory selections. I would like it a lot more with healthy meat options and meat sides."
4,"Simply fabulous.  

I made several visits during my stay:
V1: Bought myself a plush leather handbag.  A+++ service.
V2: Picked up my handbag.  Checked out the shades, A++ service.
V3: Tooled around with the bf, service was lazy, b/c it was closing time.
V4: Shopping bag's life's span was waning, so I went in and asked for another.  What I got?  Attitude.  The SA remembered me, was less than friendly, told me that they cannot give out bags w/o a purchase, WTF!??!  I just made a HUGE purchase.  I should have given her some lip and returned the bag, but I just sucked it up and took the extra shopping bag she grudgingly handed over.  

GEEZ.  Totally ruined my almost perfectly wonderful shopping experience."
4,"So glad to see this type of place on main in downtown Mesa! Food was great (we had non vegan options). Staff is super friendly. Also had a cocktail, which was delicious, but pricey for its size (super tiny with a lot of ice) and the plastic cup in which it came. Would definitely come back, but not for the cocktails."
4,Reasonable pricing and great  selection and variety of Mexican food. They can add a salsa bar and give it an extra incentive to return.
4,"This place is delicious! I love that they have a gluten free waffle, because gluten free breakfast is hard to find at restaurants. The only disappointing thing is how expensive it is. Every topping and side costs extra. The staff is extremely friendly and there is never a wait! Recommended!"
4,"Waffles Incaffinated sounded like a great place to stop in for brunch. Located in a small strip mall with a small parking lot we were thrilled to find out there was no wait for a table for two. I tried the coffee, but had to change it for a water. I personally didn't like it, too strong for me. I am very picky when it comes to coffee. We went with a Breakfast Magic and a Funky Monkey waffle. We were both really happy with them. Terrific waffles topped with pretty much any and everything under the sun. Crisp edges and tender insides that are excellent vehicles for top notch additions. The Fubky Monkey had a large dollop of house made peanut butter, bananas, chocolate syrup and a sprinkling of icing sugar. The Breakfast Magic waffle had crispy bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, green onions and 2 medium fried eggs on top. Should have drizzled some maple syrup on top but didn't think of it until it was too late. We thought the idea of a waffle place was great and we will definitely be back. 10% military discount. We were also given a pinch card for future visits."
4,"Lots of vegetarian and vegan options! There is no meat served here, and only a few fish options, so my vegan girlfriend was very happy with the selection. As a meat lover, the menu was a bit challenging but this was expected.

We got the edamame, vegetable tempura, spicy salmon roll and gold roll. The edamame and vegetable tempura were pretty standard. Both were good.

The spicy salmon roll was not made with the small chunks of salmon and mixed with spicy mayo as other places. The roll contained a full thick strip of salmon, tempura bits, and then a small dollop of chili sauce on each piece. It was my favorite item, but also the only non vegan item.

The gold roll is filled with a fake crabmeat and topped with mango and sweet mango sauce. I won't comment on the filling of the roll as I strongly prefer really seafood. My girlfriend found the mango topping just right for the roll."
4,"I had a good experience here. I made an appointment online so I didn't have to wait when I got there. The manager helped me and he was very friendly. My tires were a bit old, so I purchased the middle of the line ones.  I thought it was good customer service. 
I recommend making an appointment online because then you don't have to wait so long once you get there."
4,"Waffles INCaffeinated is a delightful little spot perfect for a late breakfast on a Saturday. I don't understand for the life of me why people would be willing to wait over 30 minutes for a waffle...that's why I waited a few months after opening before I decided to give this place a try. 

My wife and I arrived around 9:30am and didn't have much of a wait, although it seemed to fill up quick after we got there. The ambiance is simple. Nothing really makes it stand out...just seems to feel like your everyday breakfast spot...not super inviting. The menu is a bit intimidating with all of the options. I decided to go with the Waffle of the month. It was a mocha waffle with white chocolate chips, strawberries and espresso infused whipped cream. I also had a side of their home fries. What I loved about this waffle was the flavor...it's all about the flavors working together people! I never get too enthused with places like this because the breakfasts seem so decadent and I'm afraid the meal will be a ""punch-you-in-the-mouth"" sweetness that will inevitably be cavity inducing. However, I was so impressed with the flavors in my meal rather than the sweetness. I really enjoyed it. The potatoes were nice too. 

Coffee was good - check
service was good - check
food was good - check

All in all, this place is a winner. The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little loud and my jacket smelled greasy for a couple days after my visit."
4,"On my day off from work I figured I would treat myself to some waffles for breakfast! I have been wanting try waffles incaffeinated for a while now and when I found out they were putting one in Wexford I was so excited to try it out. 

For starters it's located in the plaza next to North Allegheny High School and the sign is a bit hard to see from the road, but it's there I promise. I was seated right away and my waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. I ordered the mega berry waffle that comes with whipped cream (I told them to hold the whipped cream), powdered sugar, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and raspberry syrup. The waffle itself is infused with more berries! I also added the vanilla bean drizzle which added some additional sweetness. Their menu has some other options for those that might not be feeling waffles (omelette, French toast and crepes). Pricing is pretty fair for the size and amount of food you get! 

Cons: One thing that I can't say I'm a fan of is leaving and smelling like grease. Yuck! Also, the center of the waffle was a bit doughy, but I guess that's expected when you add a lot of fruity toppings. 

Other than that I would give this place another go!"
4,"The salesman here helped me find my first pair of raw denim jeans. He was very helpful. A few weeks later, the salesman emailed me to ask me if I liked the jeans and if there was anything he could do for me. This place is expensive, but they treat you like a king."
4,"Was told about this burger place by my mom who had attended with my sister. Gave it a try last night. I gotta say after hearing what my mom and sister said I was expecting a lot. 
Could have been better but my burger was still very good and I really enjoyed the fries. I will certainly attend this place again and try a different burger."
4,"Very good burgers (big sizes not McDonald crap)
Very satisfying"
4,"Wow. This place was fantastic! I was quite impressed that this place pulled off vegetarian versions of all the favourites you'd find in a regular sushi restaurant. 

Fishless sashimi?? Looked just like the real deal and tasted like the real deal too. I wasn't sure how on earth it was going to be, but I was quite impressed with the results.

Started with a vegetable gyoza which was absolutely perfectly prepared. The sushi party platter came with a great variety of sashimi and sushi and was very tasty. There were a couple of items that I wasn't able to identify but didn't really care because it was delicious. 

So this is where they lost a star. Tempura. I didn't care for the batter they used. It was a little doughy and wasn't nearly crispy enough. I was a tad disappointed and really..it's all about the batter for me. 

The service was fast and friendly and I'm so happy to have found this place. It was worth the hour drive from where I live and I will be back."
4,"I've only eaten one thing from The Pretzel Shop, so my review should be taken with that in mind.

I had the cinnamon sugar pretzel bites. They were the best pretzel-related anything I've ever eaten. Sweet but not too sweet with hint of salt. And bite sized! I tried it with the icing dip, but that made it a bit too sweet for my personal tastes (but it was still good). 

My only reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is really arbitrary (and I wish I could give half stars because it's really not worth a full star point deduction). They only take cash. I never carry cash and generally hate having it. But, they have an ATM in the store. This ATM only allows a minimum withdrawal of $20, though. And I paid a little under $3 for my food. Come with cash."
4,"To start off, I am not a vegetarian, we came here for friend's birthday who is. The restaurant was quiet on a Friday night.

They offer all-you-can-eat vegetarian sushi, which has an impressive amount of options that you would see at a reuglar all-you-can-eat..they have vegetarian general taro chicken, salmon, rolls, sushi, etc! 

It was definitely an experience, some of the fish looked quite convincing, but I am not sure I liked the imitation fish, as it could be described as a moist sponge with a fishy taste...I did very much enjoy the rolls with bean curd on top though.

The service was great as the staff was friendly, we were able to bring in our own cake."
4,"I didn't know they charged extra for lemonades, which was a down side.  But other than that, all food are still great, service still excellent.  Great jobs everyone!"
4,"Great little coffee house a real coffee house. Fresh brewed coffee in a cup and saucer if staying. Nothing like coffee in a big cup with saucer on the bottom, but that's just my opinion.  Visited Volstead when I first arrived in 
Arizona.  They have some new additions like waffle sandwiches which looked delicious. Someone ordered a buffalo chicken waffle sandwich and it was brought out, but no one claimed it. I told the server she could leave it on our table so that it wouldn't go to waste. Urrrrr she wasn't having it, oh well I tried. Scone was had by a friend and enjoyed.  My coffee was great, it was a good second visit."
4,"You honestly would never know this sushi is vegetarian.  Everything was a delight to the palette.  I think the fish is soy, but the flavors are all still the same and the texture hasn't changed at all.

Portion sizes are what you would expect, except for the seaweed salad, which was huge.  The portion size was about four times what you would find at any other restaurant.

Beyond the sushi I also had the dumpling soup.  If you like warm wet dumplings then this soup is for you!  I liked it because it eliminated the amount of time I would have otherwise been dipping dumplings into a sauce or broth.  

Fun fact, this restaurant is recognized by PETA.  So if you're into ethically treating animals and you're a person give this place a shot."
4,"I dropped in last night craving tacos. I ordered half of the taco menu times 2, cabeza, tripas, El pastor and carne asada. I was very impressed. the place was clean the customers there were laughing and talking and the young lady at the cash register answered my question with confidence. I will be returning tonight to order the other half of the taco menu."
4,"This place is so freaking cute it blows my mind. I wish there were more locations available. This place is extremely lively on Sunday when I went. It was a full house and the wait line can get pretty long, so i opt to sit at the bar. I believe they have a good selection of everything you'd expect from an old-school diner.

I am obsessed with the decor and atmosphere of this place. Their portions are pretty big, and I feel worth the price if you're considering the entire experience. They have so many beautiful burgers, shakes and desserts that I know I'll need to come back and try them! 

I think this is also a great family place, and a very cute date spot!"
4,"We came here one Saturday morning. I decided that I wanted a ""specialty"" pretzel but I immediately regretted not getting an original. 

I've been here many times before but just realized I never created a review (silly me). I love their pretzels, while they don't compare to Philadelphia pretzels, they're pretty damn good. So cheap, so authentic, so Pittsburgh."
4,"Started coming here recently and really enjoy it. Very cool atmosphere inside especially when there is live music (which seems to be pretty much all the time). The whiskey selection is the best you're going to find outside of the city. The BBQ can be hit or miss sometimes, but is always passable. The mac and cheese is fantastic."
4,"Beautiful gem of a shop. Enjoyed leisurely browsing here on a Thursday evening - staff was gracious, helpful without being smothering. Found a clever black DVF dress, fantastic find. Will definitely return on future trips."
4,"Cheesy looking place... 50's decor but it works for me! I was there for their lunch special. 2 burgers, 2 fries and all the soda you can drink for under 30$. Great deal. And now for the main event, the BURGER! Big and sloppy, juice oozing down the side of my hands. Yum Yum! The taste of the beef really comes through as great quality. I had the Elvis which has caramelized onions, mushrooms and Swiss cheese. They really won me over. In my never ending quest to find the best burger in Montreal, this one took me to the West Island and didn't disappoint. Give it a try."
4,"I don't recalled other ALL U CAN EAT Japanese restaurants has VEGAN only, but TENON. 
Space is small, but tiny and clear (includ. their bathrooms).
Very nice service once I got inside the restaurant. And nice service we got from the server.
Quite lots of choice from menu.
We ordered BENTO boxes and all food don't seem VEG., seems really like raw fish (me and friend of mine wondered how they can made it !?) Price is average.
Tempura not too oily at all. Ice cream is complimentary.
They also automatically 10% from the bill (even though I ready 10% coupon from one of Chinese free magazines)
Surely will go back again. Next time might try ALL U CAN EAT (even though choices not much from that specific menu).
They only accept CASH & VISA.
Strongly recommend to all Vegetarian to try !!!"
4,"Love the food here, it's so fresh and made to order.  They don't leave any food on the hot plate or under the lights.  Love the waffle fries and their milkshakes.  All the employees that works there are very polite.  Just love it."
4,"I found this a very good place to have a burger with friends. 

The food tastes very good, based on what I ate and the looks and comments my friends had. Service excellent, though the staff was so busy you almost needed a lasso in order to get their attention. 

The ambiance is fun, and loud. Not excessive loudness, but not quiet. Not a place for a quiet meal. Anyone heading to a diner called ""Jukebox  Burger"" expecting quiet needs a reality adjustment. 

The prices seem reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. And with wireless payment machines they bring to the table, paying is easy and comfortable. 

All in all, I recommend it. ."
4,Glad to see downtown revitalized! This place is great inside & has good coffee. A nice place to relax & I hope it stays around.
4,I enjoyed this place. Their mocha is on point. The decor is amazing and the barista was really helpful.
4,"Coffee is good, the baristas are nice, and the space is beautiful! I just wish they would turn their music down--it was glaringly (I mean super duper) loud at 7:30am, and that is hard to handle when I have an aching hangover!"
4,"Ok, yes I am writing a review for a fast food restaurant. I realize that seems a bit strange and quite possibly extremely unnecessary. I mean, fast food is fast food right? Everyone knows what their getting into and what kind of food to expect, right? While this is true I felt it was worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing Chick-Fil-A.

It's nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken. The nuggets are yummy, flavorful but not overbreaded. My parents enjoyed their chicken sandwiches and agreed that the food is fresh tasting and not too heavy. We also enjoyed the sweet tea which is a classic Chick-fil-A staple.

One important thing to note was that this location was super busy when we walked in right at noon but soon after we ordered our food was ready in a flash. And for those of you who have never been to CFA before? The icing on the cake is the wonderful assortment of dipping sauces to suit whatever flavor mood you are in at the moment. Or you can do what I do and open one of each and dip to your hearts desire. Who doesn't love variety?!"
4,"I'm not sure why this place has bad reviews. My husband and I thought it was good for Mexican food. I had Steak and chicken fajitas and he had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce.  Steak was good and not chewy/fatty (typical for most places like this). Chicken was cooked perfectly and the tortillas were really good too. Enchiladas were great, simple red sauce with cheese and not greasy. We both had Jalapeño Margaritas, which were a complete win. Overall, we liked it for a night where cooking was not an option."
4,Great place to watch the game and eat an amazing burger! Perfect for outing with kids.
4,"Came here for the vegetarian salmon-like nigiri. The salmon sushi is pretty cool however the rest of the food was ok. I ordered the box special with a variety of sushi and rolls for two people. It wasn't too filling in my opinion but some items are definitely worth checking out since I don't know any vegetarian sushi places that have imitated raw fish. 

Four stars for the unique factor."
4,Good food. Prices a little high for small plate. But the brisket is amazing and the salted Health Ice Cream Sandwich was to die for.
4,"Calm,  relaxing vibe.  Picture brick wall with hard wood floors-music playing in the background. I got a Chai tea latte with soy milk (they also have almond milk),  the hubby got an iced coffee and wilber( everything bagel with ham/cheese(vegan cheese available)!  Everything was tasty!  Staff was helpful and very nice.  We will be back! I noticed they sell canned beer as well."
4,We chose Wheelfish to celebrate a birthday since seeing the segment on our local TV station. The service was very good! I had the salmon & Napa slaw which was smoked & excellent. My husband had the brisket which disappointingly was fatty though his Mac & cheese side was yummy. Our guests ordered the chicken & pulled pork with sweet potato fries & they loved it! Great selection of brews as well. Be aware that the place tends to get loud & we were there when the live entertainment was not playing. All & all I'd go back & give it another go!
4,"Since first opening, Wheelfish has improved its menu. It now offers meals that include sides instead of serving everything a la carte. I really like this update to the menu! They also have expanded their menu to include more offerings and I can't wait to work my way through them!"
4,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while as I love breakfast food! This is a smaller restaurant and we went on a weekday, so it was not very crowded. The waitress was friendly. I ordered the make your own waffle with mix-ins of pecans and raspberries, with toppings of cheesecake cream and raspberry sauce. I also ordered a side of home fries. The waffle was crisp and light, and with the compliment of toppings and mix-ins, was not overly sweet. They have a trio of syrups to choose from... maple, bourbon and vanilla bean. The vanilla bean and maple were tasty; but my husband and I found the bourbon to taste almost medicinal. The home fries were the star of the meal; a variety of potatoes with peppers and onion, perfectly crisp without being oily. They also were very well seasoned... any more and they would have been too salty."
4,"Everything we had was very tasty. Went for the ayce to be able to try different dishes. A bit pricey, but the food is very interesting and I didn't miss the meat. I would go back for the experience if I was in the area or out with vegetarian / vegan friends."
4,"First time eating vegetarian sushi and boy, was it a nice surprise! I ordered the sashimi platter, agedashi tofu, and mixed kebabs. Between myself and another person, we figured that we could fill up on a la carte rather than AYCE - either way, our bill will come up to be the same. We sat in one of the private rooms which was pretty cool but it was a bit of a struggle to get the attention of the waitress whenever we wanted something. I wish they had a call button like Korean restaurants tend to have. 

The tofu dish came first and was okay - I didn't enjoy it too much because it had the ginger flavor, but the teriyaki sauce was a great compliment. The kebabs is surely a must-try. I was so surprised to taste the ""meat"" and have all that awesome flavor! Warning though, the imitation meat contains a lot of oil which may cause upset stomachs to some (like myself). Everything that came in the platter tasted awesome - lots of variety of imitation seafoods/meats. The only thing I didn't like was the salmon - the texture was very jelly-like and tasted mild; nothing like salmon really.

The prices are not exactly cheap but if you want to try super tasty vegetarian food, this would be a good place to try for the first time!"
4,Great bbq sauces. Reminded me of Texas. Fries were good. Napa slaw seemed a bit underseasoned. Had the smoked salmon sandwich. It came alive with the spicy BBQ sauce.  The brisket was nice and smoky too. Portions are not humongous but still very filling.
4,"As usual, gorgeous store located inside the Venetian. Their window display work so well for me that it lured me into coming in.

Fell in love with a bloody shoes but unfortunately, they run out of my size. End up getting them in another mall down the strip.

Great service from the employee who tried to find me my shoe size tho."
4,My husband had their regular toddy and I had the lavender toddy both were delicious. The breakfast sandwich was good. I was surprised by the vegan options and wished there had been some more real meat options on the menu.
4,"Going here started off partially because of a lack of options/need of variation but also to see if the other reviews were accurate. So far I have visited on a Second Friday (Mesa's monthly art walk), while attending Mesa Maker's Fest, Volstead's karaoke night, and as recently as this past Friday for their ""St. Patty's Day Feast"". As previously stated part of my motivation for going so many times was to see consistency of service.

During my times visiting there was hardly any wait (less than five minutes! seriously!) for my orders or any of the other guests (despite how busy they were!). Cleanliness has been perfect every single time. Everything from the in-house baked goods to the sandwiches (and the crazy awesome St. Pattys Feast!!!!) blew me away. 

They have had creative sandwiches and side pairings as well as sweet & savory options for scones, muffins, or bagels. On top of all this the prices are great and the service is even better. A must visit especially if you understand the importance of supporting local businesses and are looking to break away from the monotony of the places you usually eat at."
4,"Amazing sushi- the food and the art!
It will leave you stunned! The way imitation fish and meat have been rolled into sushi. 
The service is great. The portions are pretty decent, a huge variety of food and everything is excellent."
4,"Im no vegetarian and no vegan but my buddy is so i go here to eat with him, and this place doesnt disappoint! The place is small and its sometimes busy mostly not, but the food is good no complains for service its ur typical asian joint"
4,"Jukebox is a great restaurant, recently I went with two of my friends for a birthday, and they were quick and the food was great."
4,Huge huge burger with to die for milkshake. The jukebox inside is fun too. Great experience overall and will go back
4,"Excellent, attentive, quick service and TONS of menu choices!

Everything was delicious and hot right out of the kitchen!  Definitely going back to try other goodies"
4,"This is a bit like Johnny Rockets ( with 50's diner decor), but that's where the comparison ends. Jukebox let's you can make your own burgers. Choose your patty, choose your bun and then the toppings. It all goes towards a great result. Don't forget to match your meal  with a root beer float or a chocolate fudge milkshake for the full experience. They also have sweet  potato fries as an alternative from the regular fries or Suzie Q's. As for service, it  was great. One criticism is that the music was a tad loud--make sure you like classic rock and roll. In the end, it's a nice treat for some nostalgia and  very family friendly. It is not the place for a ""quiet""  romantic dinner unless you wish to seduce with a delicious burger."
4,"Came in about 1:30 PM. Place was pretty busy considering!
We needed a tire repaired that had a screw in it. No Appointment. It ended up being about 1 1/2 hour wait to get to our vehicle, but the process was fairly quick to repair (the back left tire) after that. A little over 2 hours from start to finish. 
Next time, I think it best to book an appointment ahead of time. Staff was friendly and efficient.
Our service was covered under warranty NO CHARGE; so I guess it was worth that wait! LOL"
4,"This Resto has a very cool 50s theme which is fun....They make the best Resto Mac n Cheese ever...The friends I were with ordered the Burger and Fries....out of the world.....
Cold beer and great table service....My only draw back is the little kids are allowed to run around like a McDonalds Play Zone, which makes adult time a bit noisy.
Other than that, I've been 4-5 times and will continue to return...."
4,"I finally got to try this place recently. The food was delicious! And the ambience of the place was really cool. Unfortunately, we won't be coming back here. The man at the counter told us there are no high chairs, which makes it close to impossible for us to enjoy a meal with our small children. Definitely had to knock off a star for that. I'm surprised such a casual restaurant wouldn't be accommodating to families."
4,"2hours!? We thought this place was just an attraction because of the 50s styled diner theme but you know what? ... It was all that and more! The music playing on the jukebox/photo-booth was just loud enough for us to hear each other chew cos' she's a loud chewer. Tons of variety on the menu from make-your-own burger to poutines to milkshakes to etc. It was delish! Definitely coming back just for the ambiance and the food. 

The service? It's okay. Food came pretty fast despite what others say. 

Next time you're there, look for the greaser in a leather jacket sippin on a cherry soda pop. That's me, cos' The Cobras we'll be headin' back! ;)"
4,It's very nice and clean. Mad house during lunch time so plan ahead. The frozen lemonade it delicious
4,"I was excited ever since I moved to Vegas in 2006 to hear a Barney's Opening!!! It's finally here! The store is amazing! I went to help my client/friend power shop for a bag and the sales lady was slow, but nice. She was about to sell us the display model until we asked her to check. We checked out the the Mens Floor and were greeted and 1 gentlemen was helping me find a pair of jeans but no luck but great service!"
4,"Have you been to Mexico and had tacos from the street carts? Hot and yummy it hits the spot after a night of drinking. You can get the same kinds of tacos and more here. They have five or six kinds to choose from and all of them are pretty good. They also have a wide range of other mexican foods to choose from. I should know, when I go there I often order four or five items. A couple of tips about this joint are: 1) if you dine in you get free chips and salsa. 2) if you like tamales order the red. it has beef in it. the green only has chiles and cheese. Overall the place is a good value and I have not been disappointed yet."
4,"I was very lucky today as I walked in their lunch special was ""MOLE"" oh my!  I love this stuff.. it was $5.99 w/ the delicious side of beans and rice, perfect serving size w/ a warm toritlla... I loved it - I've been in and out of this place for the last 6 years... pretty descent... they are def more traditional than americanized..."
4,"I am happy to have found this place. It seems there are very few Mexican restaurants close to Uptown that aren't like gourmet taco shops or upscale Mexican food or something else different. Sometimes you just need the classic unlimited chips and salsa place. Speaking of which, they bring you out hot and mild salsa with your chips.

They have a nice covered patio area in the back. Thats where I always sit. Our server most recently was great! She was really on top of things.

They have great lunch specials and if you want one of the lunch specials on a weekend it is only $1extra. Lunch fajitas for the win. My only complaint is that the guacamole is almost flavorless, had to add my own salt and lime."
4,"I met a friend at Waffles INCaffeinated for a mid-morning breakfast on a Monday. It is located in a small strip in Wexford and is deceivingly larger inside compared to how it looks from the exterior. When I arrived, there was plenty of parking and the dining area was not very full. My friend and I were promptly seated and offered beverages. Our waitress was friendly and was patient with us as we took our time deciding on what to order. The menu is composed of a variety of unique waffle combinations (DUH), omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, crepes, french toast, and a small selection of side dishes. After a long debate, I settled on the Funky Monkey, waffles topped with bananas, chocolate chips, powdered sugar, and a mini Hershey bar. It was like dessert for breakfast with a banana thrown in the mix! My friend ordered the Breakfast Magic which was an egg breakfast on top of a waffle! How creative!  The waffles were huge and thank goodness we had a lot to catch up on or they would have required us to stay longer than we anticipated just to finish our meals. 

Though the food was good and the portions fairly large, the prices were slightly high. I ordered a cup of tea and that alone was $2. When returning, I will probably stick with ordering waffles since that is what they are in business for and I can get the other menu items somewhere else for a better price. Overall, this was a nice place with a unique twist on breakfast waffles that is worth a try!"
4,"This place is so cool, you walk inside and feel cozy. They have an amazing selection of drinks and vegan food! The only con I would have to include would probably be the time it takes for you to actually get what you order. I've been going there for often for a while now and whenever I order even just a drink it takes no shorter than like 8 minutes. So definitely not a Starbucks lol. This place is cool if you need a quiet place to do work and have a drink and a bagel."
4,"Ordered a chipotle turkey pretzel sandwich. Cash only. $4 with tax. They'll ask if you'll want it warmed up or cold, get it warmed up with all the fixings. A bit messy and they did not include a napkin in the to-go bag so make sure you grab one. Other than that the pretzel was everything I imagined it to be - salty and soft which went well the turkey, tomatoes, lettuce and chipotle sauce."
4,"Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion. 

I have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole ""kids eat free"" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy)."
4,"Let me say I can sometimes find myself being guilty of judging a book by its cover. In the case of Mucho Taco I quickly overlooked it due to location, location, location. Good thing my little girl is as adamant as I am when it comes to satisfying whats on the taste buds. I did a quick Yelp review look up and was pleasantly surprised by the overall reviews for this joint. Well, I'm not afraid of broadening my horizons. This place has a quaint old town Mexico feel to it. They even have Telemundo on the tele. What really caught my attention is the fact that this place was clean, not a dirty table in the joint. That can really set the mood and so far I'm smiling. 

Walked up and the girl working the counter was all smiles and quite frankly had the best attitude/customer service I've seen in a long time. You've got to take a moment to recognize and appreciate such things when you see it.

Lucky for me today's especial was a 2 taco plate with rice & beans. Just what my daughter loves. I gave her my American child's request for this and that added and removed and she accommodated with no fuss. Then it was time for the General to make an off the menu request. I wanted a chimichanga but I was feeling chorizo so how about combining the 2. No problemo here! The girl picked up the menu and explained with a picture how they make their chimmi's enchilada style and asked if that would be ok. Absolutely! Paid, the girl and found me a nice place to rest my dogs. A couple seconds after getting situated the young lady brought out chips and salsa. Now being a connoisseur of all things food I was up for the salsa challenge. Gotta say- this salsa is good! Thick, not runny & it had a pleasant little kick to it. Too bad food was ready so quickly because I wanted to beat down another helping. Taco's looked delicious and their was plenty of rice & beans, my little girl's order was perfect. Im regretting not posting a pic of my chimmi masterpiece. Presentation was wonderful! A good sized chimmi laid smothered in cheese and surrounded in red sauce. Could have used a little more sour cream & guac but I know this stuff is so rare around AZ that restaurants share it sparingly. now I'm being sarcastic! But all in all the flavor was delish! 

I'm so glad I have a Mexican restaurant to add to my list of happiness. This place will be getting a return visit from me and anyone else I can con into the ghetto. lol Keep an eye out amigo's because after a couple more visits to ensure I wasn't dreaming, I'll be moving my rating up a notch. This place is great!"
4,"Great spot to pick up a pretzel for a quick, budget-friendly snack. If you're expecting a fresh, high-quality pretzel, you will be disappointed. For $0.60 a piece per plain pretzel, you get what you pay for. They also have a variety of specialty pretzels (a little more expensive but still within $1-2) like jalapeño and ham & cheese; however, they look like they've been sitting out for a while and unappealing, in my opinion. I tried the plain and pizza pretzels which were decent. They do reheat them in a microwave before serving, but it leaves them a bit chewy."
4,"Overall, great service and good food. If you have a hankering for some BBQ, this is probably the best spot in the Pittsburgh area.

Being from Texas, I have a high standard of barbecue. Over all wheelfish has good barbecue for being so far north. We got the brisket and the ribs. The ribs were great! The brisket was a little fatty and not as tender and juicy. They had a small smoker out front so they probably have to cook the meat at a high pressure and shorter amount of time, which keeps the fat from breaking down. The ribs however were very good and I'd recommend that. There are other options like chicken and salmon, along with a bunch of sides like mac-n-cheese, fries, veggies, etc.

They have a ton of beer options. I got a root beer float- it was great! They have 3 sauce options- traditional, sweet and hot; all were good. The waitress was friendly and attentive."
4,Been here several times and the food has improved. I had some very tasty enchiladas and some great nachos. Definitely better than Filibertos.
4,"Over the years, I have taken a strong liking to Chick-fil-a.  The chicken is tasty and is not processed like the other fast food restaurants.  The waffle fries are delicious.

The staff is extremely friendly and at times will come to the table and offer free soda refills.

Each Wednesday they have a Kids Night from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.  Last week there was a balloon artist.  It is a fun time had by"
4,"This is my favourite place for vegan sushi   I heard super great things about it and it only exceeded my high expectations ! The Bento Box was super yummy and my boyfriend ordered the sushi platter which we also loved ! 
Portions were very good and the workers there were very helpful and accommodating. 
Definitely coming back !"
4,Pricey of course but an excellent sale dept.   Racks upon racks.  Worth a look!
4,"First time coming here and it was a pleasant little joint. They had both a la carte and AYCE vegetarian sushi. We ordered a few amount of dishes, since not our whole party wanted AYCE. We tried the Orange Chicken, Sushi & Sashimi Platter, Deep Fried Scallops, Bean Curd Dish, Spider Maki Rolls, & Seaweed Salad. Overall the food was good. I especially like the chicken, the sauce they used went well with the dish."
4,Great staff. Very friendly and attentive. Tables that turn quick get cleaned just as quick. Nice! Their new salads are fresh and crisp.
4,"This is one of the few fashion establishments that I like to poke around in but never really buy, along with Burberry.  They don't really deserve four stars because it is so unbelievably pricey and they refuse to cater in any way to anyone that might be suffering in a down economy.

Regardless, I like to look at the cosmetics and leather goods, and I recently came here to decide if I wanted to spend a ton on a new wallet for my husband - a Berluti Scritto wallet that I've never seen sold anywhere but Barney's.  It is beautiful, handcrafted, and something that he deserves to carry around but would kill me for getting for him.

I'll have to come back when things might actually be on sale.  Maybe the wallets will be cheaper then.  :("
4,"located in the palazzo...everytime i've been to this barneys location, i've always had good service.  last time, i came in looking for a pair of long black boots...i found a beautiful pair by roberto del carlo...but it wasn't my size...the sales person immediately checked their back stock and even tried to locate it from a different barney's...no luck, but i did walk out with the same boot in a chocolate brown...and even got 50% off...that's a $300 discount!!  what a deal...

did have to throw out the box though...it wouldn't fit into my suitcase...i hate that ...luckily it came with a dust bag =)"
4,"So I decided to check this place out for Taco Tuesday and so glad I did. We went at about 6p and got seated right away but by the time we were leaving it did seem to be a little wait. Upon sitting you get your usually chips and salsa but they give you both a mild & a hot salsa. They have about 8 different $1 authentic tacos that come with cilantro & onions but you can add cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream for .30 cent more which is still good. I got the barbacoa, chorizo, and asada they were all really good but the barbacoa was hands down my favorite so I ordered two more. I will definitely be coming back."
4,"I've been to this place 4 times. The food is good, massive menu. Most items are vegan friendly. The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 star review is that the service is just ok."
4,"Stopped by for lunch today,  very fast responsive service and the food was hot and fresh.  Couldn't have asked for better.  Good job guys."
4,They changed their name to La Authentica so just be aware. The service was really good and the food was also very yummy and reasonably priced.
4,"Stopped in the new Wexford location on a Saturday morning around 9:30am.  It wasn't packed yet, but by 10:00 there was a line out the door.  The food was absolutely delicious, but lukewarm.  The coffee mugs are definitely too small (hello, there's a coffee mug in your logo!) and the waitress was too busy to stop for refills.  We sat with empty cups for about 20 minutes, finally stopping her as she raced by and asked for the refill.  A simple carafe on the table would solve this problem. In the end, we only had two small cups of coffee. Our food sat under the warmer for at least 10 minutes. I watched them plate it and then watched it sit there. Finally my husband got up and approached the window, asking if we have to take our own food.  It would behoove the owner to hire some kids from the high school to have them bus, pour coffee, and deliver food.  Clearly the waitresses are too busy to be on top of these kinds of things during peek times. We waited awhile for our check to be delivered, too. The waitresses all seemed to be very friendly, but they were overwhelmed. Our visit took 90 minutes, which is a long time to spend at breakfast. Hiring some teenagers who can hustle could potentially cut a table's occupancy time in half."
4,"A step above your typical breakfast place. Friendly staff, quick and attentive service, despite being continuously busy. So many choices on the menu, it's hard to decide. But when at a place with Waffles in the title, of course that's where I've got to go. I had the Funky Monkey - a chocolate, banana and peanut butter explosion. Pretty good, although waffle could have been a little crisper on the outside for my liking. Add a side of scrambled eggs (for protein, of course!) cooked perfectly, and a coffee cup our waitress never let get more than half empty. I'll be back for sure, next time to build my own omelette."
4,"What a great breakfast spot!  First time in and they easily accommodated a party of 9.  EVERYONE was happy with the meals...even the picky kids.  Meals were fast...ingredients were fresh.  Everything was delicious and everyone cleaned their plates!!

I had the breakfast - 3 eggs, toast, bacon, fruit, and mushrooms.  Love that their sides are different and loaded with fresh veggies.  Bacon was divine.  Thick and perfectly cooked.  Bread was thick and tasty.  

I was lucky enough to try my nieces waffle with some bourbon maple syrup.  Whoa!  I could do shots of that and need to go back to get waffles just to eat/drink copious amounts of that!"
4,"Hidden off McKnight Road, we hadn't heard of Wheelfish until recently, despite searching for great BBQ in Pittsburgh. We split the quesadilla and nachos for appetizers. Both good, but I'd rather save room for the main event. We tried the brisket and ribs. Ribs are St Louis style. We prefer baby backs but still enjoyed the flavor of the ribs. Brisket was great. I agree with other reviews that the brisket is dry, but it's flavorful. Add some of the spicy BBQ sauce and it's delicious. Definitely go for the 1/2 pound portion. Leftovers heated up well in the oven the next day. Mac and cheese for me is very hit or miss, but I was very happy with the mac and cheese at Wheelfish. Reasonably priced drinks, as well."
4,"Tuesdays- can't go wrong. $1 authentic (onion + cilantro) tacos, plus free chips and salsa! There are about 8 different tacos to pick from, but I always go for the chicken and veggie tacos - they never disappoint. 

However, this place is hit or miss on Tuesday- you either get seated right away or will have to wait 15/20 minutes. Service too, but I've had more better experiences with service than worse.

PRO TIP- Ask for the green salsa with your chips. It's free, but you must ask. It's a mix of guac, lime and jalapeño. Great on it's own, or on your tacos. YUMMY!"
4,My favorite place so far for a breakfast burrito. Tasty and not greasy at all. Looking forward to trying other menu items.
4,Can't believe their salmon are vegan! It's one of those places that would surprise you. Definitely recommended for those who are looking for vegan sushi. I also appreciate its dining environment. Quite and clean.
4,"Such an unusual find in the North Hills but great barbecue! I love the option to select a local craft beer from the cooler. The barbecue is the real deal...the smoker outside of the restaurant tells you you're in for a treat. My husband and I love this spot for a weeknight date. Have to give it 4 of 5 stars because I really want to love their appetizers but they all feel a bit ""forced"". As though they're looking to put barbecue on things like nachos etc and those dishes don't really jump out as being spectacular, but the barbecue itself is. Still a go-to. We love it!"
4,"La Unica fits the bill for fast, easy and delicious mexican food.  There's nothing fancy about this place - just consistently good food and service.  

When the weather is nice, I like to sit on the patio and enjoy a few drinks, chips and fajitas."
4,"Vegan grilled cheese sandwiches? Sure, I'll try anything! I've actually been trying to cut down on my meat intake anyways and decided to try Volstead out. The name is interesting, it brings to mind similar sounding names with ""Vol"" in the title. If I am in a silly mood perhaps I will eat at Volstead while listening to Volbeat after test driving a Volkswagon one of these days!

I tried out the Copper State sandwich and a regular size iced latte with coconut milk. The sandwich comes with a side- I went with the kale and cranberry salad. The sandwich was excellent. The bread was lightly toasted and provided a lovely textural crunch with the soft gooey cheese and diced green chiles. The flavors were a perfect complement to each other. The salad was fresh, but underdressed and thus a bit bland to me. 

The latte was smooth and rich, with a chocolaty undertone. 

Service was swift and friendly.

If I'm in the mood for sandwiches and coffee in downtown Mesa, this is the place to be!"
4,"Came here on a Friday night for food and music and the place was great. My husband and I ordered the brisket, quarter chicken, mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. Our friends got the ribs and salmon sammy. Everything was delicious! The mac and cheese ranks up to one of the best we have had in Pittsburgh! The brisket is not shredded but sliced and the chicken is smoked and then deep fried and it is moist and juicy. Drinks are also as equally delicious. I ordered the Paloma Fresca and it was light and refreshing. This place is a great add to the north hills. It's great to finally have a delicious BBQ joint near by that also has leonas"
4,"I was thoroughly impressed with this location. By far it is the best! It has the typical Mexican restaurant decor and ambience. The guacamole and two different salsas were great in addition to the tortilla chips. The lunch menu was very cheap and I would suggest going for lunch for a great deal and the portions were not smaller they were quite large! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service is not as friendly as the Indian trail location. If you are in the area, I would highly recommended this restaurant!"
4,"Used the no wait app, which cut back on us standing around outside since the waiting area is VERY tiny. Small place, many different selections of waffles. I chose the French toast, and it was very good. Everyone in our party enjoyed the food. Good service, we would come back again."
4,"Love the fun 50s ambiance. The burgers and fries are great and I'm able to get a burger served in a lettuce leaf if I don't feel like a bun. If can get messy, but it's a delicious mess."
4,"I was caught by surprise,  it was very good!  I 've always been a meat or seafood person, I thought it be just no taste etc. to my surprise it was very tasty and not taste greasy at all.   What really impress me was the crispy duck dish, portion was quite big and nice presentation, shared  among 5 of us.  It  taste like meat !  Crispy and tasty.  It was dried tufo dehydrated tufo! 

Presentation of food and the atmosphere is very nice and very clean . Would recommend to try it out ! U be surprise , shrimp taste but it's not shrimp ,  then  the Fish  taste like fish but it's not.  Have to try it out !!"
4,"Nice atmosphere and great selection for vegetarians, but I was a bit disappointed by the sandwich I ordered.  Salad was great though!"
4,"This place has a classic American diner feel to it, the staff works hard at making your visit really enjoyable. They have tons of classic burgers and also specialty items, like the ""hulk"" burger, a cheeseburger between 2 grill cheese sandwiches!

There milkshakes are outstanding from cookie dough to espresso Bailey, incredible. They have a variety of sides from chilli fries to curly fries to Mac and cheese!

Check this place out."
4,"This Sushi restaurant features 100% Vegetarian fare. 

What's interesting is they have vegetarian sashimi, so you can order hand rolls etc that have ""salmon"" or ""tuna"" and it actually looks like salmon or tuna.  Taste is quite good.  The owner told me that this is all brought in from Japan.   There's a very full menu, bento boxes, noodles, maki, hand rolls, etc.  

Decor is quite nice and there are several small rooms off to the side with one or two tables in them.  

Green tea is free. 

It's really nice as a vegetarian to walk in and be able to order anything on the menu at a sushi place!"
4,"The service honestly wasn't very friendly the day I went, but it wasn't horrible either. I got the buffalo chicken salad, and it was just ok. Could have benefited from some more veggies, or something to make it a little more filling. Overall it isn't a place I would drive out of my way to come to again."
4,"I would give it 3.5 stars. 

They have a lunch all you can eat optin for $13. The bento boxes are like $10-11 so add a few more dollars and you can all you can eat. Although it is veggetarian food so its a lot of carbs but they don't downgrade the quality if you do the all you can eat vs a la carte.

pssst, They also have black seseme ice cream, only if you ask :)

Usually pretty quiet and they have little rooms so good or groups."
4,"My husband and I chose to have lunch at Wheelfish after craving something new and browsing yelp reviews. We went on a Thursday at noon and there was only one other person. 

They have one of those Touch Tune digital jukeboxes and it just so happened to play a perfect mix of classic rock that day. It looks like there is a small stage, so I assume they have live music some nights too. This place has this rustic, cozy cabin vibe to it. Before you even walk inside, you can smell the meat smokin'! 

I ordered the Dark and Stormy drink (kraken and ginger beer) and I am already wanting to remake it at home! My husband got a highball. Both our drinks were well made and tasty. We got an order of the deep fried deviled eggs. They did not disappoint! For our main meal, I got the smoked salmon sandwich and he got the brisket. When our waitress brought our food, she also brought a handy carrier with napkins and an array of sauces. She proceeded to tell us about each sauce and even shared her favorite (the Gold, which I also thought was superb!). Overall, a great place to grab a bite for lunch. We will be back!"
4,"The baked goods from Lo-Fi were better and I miss having the guitar to play while I waited for my drinks and food. I definitely miss them now that Volstead is in it's place. That said, Volstead has some amazing grilled cheese sandwiches and creative drinks. It's now a great place to go for lunch instead of just morning coffee."
4,"The nachos! I dream about their nachos. I can't put into words why I like them. I suggest trying them for yourself. 

We love this hidden gem. They smoke their own BBQ and make delicious side dishes. Their menu isn't extensive but what they offer is excellent. My husband's favorite option is the salmon sandwich (I know weird when I just said this was BBQ joint). 

The drinks are a pricey but they have a nice beer selection and they make a great jalapeño Moscow mule."
4,"Came here for some vegetarian food one evening to give this place a try since someone I know is in love with Tenon.
The thought of vegan sushi just made me think....how? lol.
Located in the busy Peach Tree plaza just south of Hwy 7 and Kennedy Rd this is a busy plaza and parking can be a nuisance during weekends.   
Upon entering, the interior is clean and cozy with ample seating arrangements.  In terms of service, it was superb since we came on a quiet Tuesday evening. 
Their menu features a lot of options, especially for vegans which is a plus.
For food we ordered their Combo A: 8 sashimi pieces, 6 sushi rolls, 8 California, 8 rainbow roll.
In addition to our house SAKE! we also tried their A-13 Cashew nut chicken which was vegan as we requested.

An overall great experience; service, food, ambiance and selections!"
4,"I love Chick-fil-A, especially their fries. But one thing I don't understand is why they don't post their closing hours anywhere.  I literally searched it doesn't sites and none of them had a time for that location."
4,"I went dinner with my family.  The food are great, tasty and enjoyed most of the dishes we ordered.  
We ordered the sushi combo.  Green dragon rolls. Spices salmon roll, Jing mushrooms avocado rolls.  One of the highlights of the dinner was when we tasted the spices salmon roll, we all thought it was real fish.. even my husband cannot taste the difference. 
My husband wasn't a big fan of vegetarians dishes, but he said he want to come back again."
4,"Had the iced chai and an americano with white chocolate. They had multiple choices for alternative milk...I had the chai with almond milk. The chai was perfectly sweetened...not too sweet thankfully. The only thing it could've been stronger in was the chai. It was more creamy and milky than anything. The americano was good. They offer quite a few things on their breakfasts and lunch menu. I also noticed their pastries, all of which were labeled vegan. They also offer day old pastries for $1. I didn't get a chance to try the food, but would love to come back one day for it!"
4,The eggs Benedict was good. A little expensive. $14 for that and coffee is a little overpriced. The place needs better ventilation. I came out of there smelling like I've been in a grease pit!
4,"Barneys at the Palazzo. Oh how I love you so. Conveniently near the Venetian and Bellagio where I frequently stay, this place is deadly. Open till 12am, right on the strip, this place begs me to spend my casino winnings there. 

Barneys here is a smaller location, with one floor dedicated to mens, and the rest for womens. Very helpful staff, but their selection is a bit limited. You won't find everything you'd see at a flagship store, but hey, you're in Vegas, and you really want, there's a boutique shop for every brand possible on the strip.

Last time I was there, I came right in the middle of a huge sale, so everything was on sale. You'll find brands like Rag & Bone, Philip Lim, The Row, etc. If you like buying clothing, then Barneys on your hit list."
4,"I was in the area the other day and remembered I always wanted to try this place as it offered vegetarian and vegan sushi besides the basic rolls offered at most places.  

I ordered their ""fish"" and sushi combo.  The fish was ""meh"" and wasn't spicy, but more sweet than anything else.  I wasn't a fan of it.  

In terms of the vegan sushi, OMG, it was delicious.  Almost everything tasted like real fish. I really enjoyed the mock salmom sashimi.  It had a very similar texture and an even better taste than real fish, but less slimy.  It was amazing.  

The mock shrimp was pretty good too.

Verdict: I'll be back for more soon.

Only con: I thought service was a bit lacking as I had to ask for my miso soup and the server seemed unhappy that I was asking. Maybe it's because I was by myself in gym clothes, but still, I ordered almost $30 worth of food.   Maybe I'll dress better next time????"
4,"My very first ever Barneys experience was here in Las Vegas. I didn't really know what to expect since I had only shopped online up until this point and didn't get a chance to go to the one in New York on Fifth while I was there so I walked in ... and was dazzled!

Everything was so well laid out, warm, inviting, gorgeous, and luxurious. Yes it made me feel like I probably shouldn't touch anything, move anything or even breath too much in there, but it was still gorgeous.

I heard the store has great sales, unfortunately was not there during sale season, but they did have an amazing selection of classic Louboutins, dare I say that even rival the Louboutin boutiques in Vegas! 

You have to stop by, if only to appreciate the store and be dazzled by the displays!"
4,"My 'Taco Tuesday' hidden gem is not so hidden anymore. They still will bust their rears to get you in and seated, it just might take a bit getting through the 12 people in front of your first.

Full disclosure: I've only been here for Taco Tuesdays ($1). Parking here can be tricky -- several time's I've had to wait for cars to leave. Be patient, it's worth the wait. 

Tacos: Al pastor is probably my favorite, followed by the barbacoa & the regular pollo. Chorizo is also decent, but not as good as the others. Serving size is pretty solid -- you'll get a heaping pile of meat, cilantro & onion severed on two corn tortillas. Queso is as to be expected, and the chips & salsas are pretty top notch.

Pro Tip: ask for the green salsa. it's like a cilantro-y avocado blend, maybe? Spicy & delicious."
4,Was a pretty good vegetarian take on meat inspired foods.  A lot of the menu (other than sushi) is deep fried.
4,"Looking for a different breakfast option? This place is for you! Being only the 4th review, I will give you the rundahn! 
Pros: food is excellent! The breakfast magic that I had was savory and fresh! My wife had the blueberry waffle and it was delicious. Waitress Nikkie was friendly and informative. This confirms the first three reviews on friendly service!!

Now the cons (sorry, there are a couple .. keeps it from a 5star affair) As the 1st review stated, the coffee mugs are too small. We asked our server a lot for ""more coffee"".
A suggestion would be to either get larger mugs OR get coffee carafes and leave them on the table (a la Perkins)
Second comment (which was also stated by another reviewer) was the smell when walking in. My guess is a little more exhaust ventilation. 

Final Answer: great place to go!!!"
4,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a decent restaurant close to home and decided to try Wheelfish out. It is a cute western themed neighborhood bar. The menu is very small and simple. I had the ribs. They were good, but lacked moisture. They were only dry rubbed and smoked, I wish they would have basted them with sauce while they were cooking along with the rub."
4,"The best breakfast we have had in years! I had the Benny Waffle. Delicious egg Benedict with fresh crab. Greatest home fries ever! Made with multi colored mini potatoes and sweet potatoes. Coffee was good. My wife had the Funky Monkey and couldn't stop raving about it. Daughter had what was the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted. May get that myself on a return visit. My 6 year old son thoroughly enjoy his waffles with chocolate sauce. Environment, and atmosphere was thoroughly enjoyable. Great place, great food, we'll be back.

Only downside, like some of the other reviews state, the smells of the kitchen tend to attach themselves to your clothes."
4,This is probably the BEST place to get brunch. The customer service is very friendly. The atmosphere is awesome. Very nice place to go on a date or just hang out with friend and family. Highly recommend the eggs Benedict.
4,Nice stuff.  Expensive Stuff.  Fun to stop while in Vegas.
4,Al I can say about this place is: gorgeous! I was able to get a kid sized portion and customize my waffle to my liking!
4,"Good food, creative entrees and will alter the orders to fit your tastes, decent service, a little pricey."
4,"This is exactly what we excepted. The food was good, salsa and chips arent the best but I have had worse. I went in with the mind set of my previous Loco Lime experience and it was very similar. I was very please with the staff, they were  awesome with our kids! It is a casual Mexican restaurant with decent food at reasonable prices. 

Food is good, staff was great and the overall experience met our average expectation. It's not fine dining but somewhere between taco bell and Azteca."
4,This is a great restaurant in the north hills. It looks like a barn in a neighborhood. The pulled pork nachos were my favorite thing we ordered. Also had the brisket and ribs. The ribs were also really great with a dry rub. The one thing I would change about this place is the price of the cocktails. They are $9-11 and are about the size of a shot.
4,"My burrito was cooked fresh and tasted delicious. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito with rice. Green sauce on the side. Carne Asada was not too spicy, a bit dry, but service was prompt, friendly and the place was clean. Not sure if the sauce is homemade or not but it is certainly delicious. It did smell a bit like cigarettes and the smell wasn't coming from outside. I was the only one there."
4,One word YUMMY.  loved the rice and beans tasted home made.  Great service.  They even have diet coke.  CarnAsada tacos very good.  nice and fresh. The salsa and chips comes if you order dinner.  Really good slightly salty but it is mexican food.  They brought out green and red hot sauce for the tacos.  Which excited me but neither of them had anything amazing.  But I like spicy and it was mild.  Not saying bad just that I expected them to knock my shoes off because everything else about this place did. I have a feeling there are a few other menu items to try that would make me want to give them 5 stars.
4,"I may be a hypocrite slightly.  I talk about how much I hate sandwiches.  But I think the epidemic in boring sandwiches turned me off.  I've been meeting more and more unboring sammies lately, which has made me actually start to crave them!

I had wanted to stop into The Pretzel Shop for a while and had heard they also serve sandwich and not just pretzels.  They actually have a whole case full of sandwiches and sides.  I opted for the turkey sandwich with horsey dressing on a pretzel bun (dah!).  

That pretzel bun... AMAZING!  It was so moist and doughy, and not too salty (which I hate about regular ones).  I also loved the tangy dressing.  It honestly made me want to come back and buy up the whole store of pretzels, that bun was so good!  You could probably buy the whole store for $20 everything is so cheap, cheap, cheap!

I'll be back now for my new pretzel sandwich habit, and probably a developing pretzel habit.  All thanks to The Pretzel Shop!"
4,"Sometimes circumstances take you out to neighbourhoods that you don't usually visit.  One Friday night I found myself in the West Island to meet some friends who live in the area for dinner.  It was the perfect opportunity to try a restaurant that had long been in my bookmarks: Jukebox Burger.

The restaurant is modeled after a 1950s diner and does indeed contain an actual jukebox.  I have a soft spot for these kinds of places so I really liked the ambiance.  If you come here you come for the burgers and they do a good job of catering to different dietary restrictions.  They offer vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

The way it works is that you choose one of the burgers from the menu and then you customize it by choosing the type of bun, side and patty.  I went for a Rocket burger which was basically just a bacon cheese burger.  The plate was humongous and I was certainly full by the time I was done.   The burger was pretty good but the beef could have been juicier.  The fries that accompanied it were also a little disappointing.  They were a tad overcooked.  

They have a really good milkshake selection here and since it had been so long since I had one I went for a Baileys milkshake.  It went down very smoothly and definitely satisfied my craving for one.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's strawberry milkshake which was quite tasty.

During prime dining hours you can expect a bit of a wait for a table but they do a good job of handling the crowds.  Once seated everything comes pretty quickly.  The prices are also fairly reasonable.  Burgers run anywhere from $15 - $20 and you do get a lot of food for that price.

A meal at Jukebox Burger is definitely a fun experience.  If you are looking for a 50s diner experience than look no further than this restaurant.  If you're in the area then it is worth visiting."
4,"Pros: $1 tacos on Tuesday, free chips and salsa, the tacos come out fast and are always filling 

Cons: they take a long time to give you the check, wanted my change (so I can tip properly and never got it)

Other than that I love the place, I frequent when I can, mainly Tuesday's lol but I'd recommend this place to anyone, only took a star off for the cons. A lot of construction workers eat here but that's not a an issue honestly."
4,Very good breakfasts. The waffles are defiantly good. Was kind of annoyed when I went that they were out of 2 beverages I asked for - and one was decaf coffee
4,"Well, this was our first foray into the veg sushi world and we weren't disappointed. Veg shrimp, veg chicken, veg beef, and - get this - veg oyster! I had no idea some of these things existed. 

Dynamite roll (veg shimp) and the combo of 3 veg rolls came out very fast and tasted pretty good.  The bill was very moderate. 

Leaving here happy as a veg clam."
4,"This is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL store.  The shoe section is to die for. See Adam for your personal shopping needs.

Although I can't afford to shop here, I am sure those who can will appreciate the perfect service and attention to detail.

Store is located at Palazzo and offers complimentary valet parking."
4,Taco Tuesday is the day to go!!! Dollar tacos plus a margarita tower resulted in a $20 tab which is something I can sleep comfortably about. Authentic food and drinks but service can be slow.
4,"I've really scored lately with some places I've tried for the first time.  I had some great takeout over the weekend from Mucho Taco.  I ordered a carnitas taco, the Chimi de Asada, and a churro.  

I was a little nervous as I walked in because I've heard this place is pretty authentic and the only Spanish I know is from watching Sesame Street.  But the young woman working at the front counter smiled and greeted me right away, which put me completely at ease.  

After I placed my order I had time to look around and this is really a cute place.  Very clean, and I like the décor on the walls and the painted tiles.  It's small, but really has a nice atmosphere.

My food was ready in about 10 minutes and as I drove home the first thing I noticed was how good it smelled.  Oh my...the whole car smelled like carne asada and rich, seasoned enchilada sauce.  (They serve their chimis enchilada-style).  

While I was unpacking it, one nice little touch I noticed was that someone stuck a tortilla chip between the guac and the sour cream just to keep them apart for transport.  It may end up a rich gooey mess on my plate, but it's not going to start out that way.  That made the presentation very nice when I opened the container.

The carnitas taco was small, street taco style and had a very good flavor, but the meat was slightly dry.  I added a few chopped tomatoes and a little guac and it was perfect.  I would definitely get that again.  

The chimi was full of delicious carne asada.  They really know their stuff here.  The meat was good quality and so tender it melted in my mouth.  I had half for dinner and then the other half the next morning with an egg on top.  DEE-licious!  

And the churro was a nice sweet way to end the meal.  My total before tip was $10.42.  I was very impressed with the attention to detail and the flavors.  The enchilada sauce had a great blend of seasonings that was way better than any I've had before.   I look forward to trying more items on their menu.  Gracias, Mucho Taco."
4,We've stopped in a couple times. Ridiculous portions with great flavor and good coffee. The country benedict waffle is top notch. Good coffee as well. Highly recommended for a big breakfast in the North.
4,"Wheelfish? What a weird name. Aside from that, it's a great little place. It's my understanding that this place's previous incarnation was a longstanding and well-known local bar. When we first walked in, some of the old regulars must have been there, because they looked us up and down! Not in a bad way though. We had great service, sampled many beers and drinks. I got a drink called Heart of Darkness which, despite its name, was a lovely drink. Being a party of four, we sampled most of the meats to mixed reviews. The chicken and ribs were excellent, the pulled pork average, and the brisket was awful. It was dry and gristly, and the sauces served with our meal could not save it. The sides we ordered were very good. The mac and cheese lived up to its reputation, and the grilled veggies were nice and chunky. The fries were good. The service was excellent, and the band playing was an acoustic duo that appeared to be a house band. They were excellent and not too loud, so we could enjoy our conversation all night. We will be back!"
4,We love Mucho taco!! The owner is great and always makes sure to take care of us when we stop in. The mole chicken special is our favorite! This place is a small authentic restaurant but delivers a huge explosion of mexican flavor!!
4,"Love the sushi and vegetable tempura. I got a mango roll and it was amazing, the amount of mango in it was perfect. Vegetable tempura is cooked to perfection, crispy batter. Definitely going back to get more."
4,"This retro diner decked out 50s style
Is expensive as hell but oh so worthwhile! 

The quality and portion justify the price
With so many options that are sure to entice

We were lucky to not have to wait in line 
And we had a cozy booth for our party to dine

Tasso and the Jukebox team were simply impeccable 
How they handled that blackout was nothing short of respectable

Dylan Stanley, a busboy, remember that name 
This kid and his voice are destined for fame! 

He sang Hallelujah in true a cappella 
His voice gave me shivers, such an amazing fella

The burgers were creative and incredibly huge
On my list of ""Best Burgers"" they're now number two! 

The beef tasted fresh and cooked to perfection 
Custom buns, patties and sides to your own confection 

The french fries were crispy and packed to the brim 
Too sweet for my liking, next time ill try the poutine 

To top it all off I ordered a rootbeer float
That came in a mug that was as big as a boat! 

The actual jukebox was a very nice touch 
But the kids in the joint played more modern stuff 

A diner with prices like this usually takes me aback 
But they do everything so well I hafta cut them some slack

Such an amazing experience to share with friends 
I'm definitely coming back here and do recommend!! 

------------ Installment 28 poetry reviews

Freaking love this place! Do expect to pay about 30$ per person to eat here, maybe more if you're an ""eyes bigger than your stomach"" kinda person. I don't think diner food ever needs to be this expensive...but i get it, so i will be back, but I hafta dock a star. 

These burgers just landed themselves in spot #2 on my Best Burgers list, 2nd only to Woodlands, imho. 

Wish that the jukebox didn't have the option to play modern songs because it was awesome listening to the good ol oldies that did play while we were there. There's lotsa teens that hang out here and kinda monopoloze the jukebox but still an awesome vibe. 

A huge thank you to Tasso our awesome waiter who just totally made the night perfect. 5 stars to him!"
4,"The food was okay, the milkshake was too sweet for my liking. Price wise, its a little pricey. But the aura of the place is really great."
4,"The food is absolutely amazing here and I would boldly state that although this is the only vegetarian Japanese restaurant that I've been to but it's the best one.  

A few points on how I feel their service can definitely be improved on:

-1 or 2 staff on a prime Saturday with over 40 patrons.
-service can be very slow and takes awhile to get somebody's attention.
-been here on 3 separate occasions where they forgot to bring the bowl of rice that comes with the combo.
-would be helpful for them to announce what the dishes when they bring it to you instead of just leaving it on the table.

Now for the POSITIVES:

-the food is absolutely amazing.
-must try: Tenon sushi roll, king mushroom roll, smoked duck with spinach, green curry."
4,"The Las Vegas Barneys is cute.  It's small but has a lot going for it.  The sales reps are helpful (unlike the NYC reps).  The selection for men is limited but it carries the essentials.  Overall, one of the best places to shop for men in Vegas."
4,"This place makes some good chewy pretzels and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  I liked the pretzels so much that I ate 5 of the 6 I bought within an hour...I was trying to save them for later, but things like this happen when food is addictive and good."
4,"J""avais vu un reportage de ce restaurant a l 'émission you got to eat here. Hier etant dans le coun nous avons décidé d' y aller pour le souper. L'endroit est populaire il va sans dire mais l attente n est pas très longue.  Le décor rappel celui des diners des années 1950 et 1960 parcontre on se sent assez pressé de commander. Comme nous en etions a notre première visite nous n etions pas familier avec le menu mais la serveuse malgré lui avoir demandé qq minutes pour décider se faisait insistante pour que nous passions notre commande le plus rapidement possible. 

J ai donc commandé le cowboy ma conjointe le heat et mon garcon le taco.  Les portions sont généreuses mais le goût n'a rien d exceptionel et je ne ferais pad un detour exceptionnel pour manger un de leur hamburger. Il y a des options qui a orix sensiblement égale offre une aventure degustative plus wow. 

En général pour le décor la nostalgie et possiblement l ambiance ca vaut la peine de l essayer au moins une fois"
4,"One of the Best Mexican restaurants in charlotte. Spinach dip you can never go wrong if they have it, sometimes sold out. Great lunch specials defiantly a bang for your buck! My main dish is the el Mexicano chicken burrito a must try!"
4,"The only resto that sells vegan . Also had the ""chicken"" teriyaki. Pretty good, I'd definitely come back. You can also purchase frozen vegan items."
4,"I live nearby, and I hadn't been to Mucho Taco until a friend recommended it. It's great!
I ordered three tacos: carnitas, carne asada, and pescado with a side of rice and beans. They bring fresh salsa and chips to your table while you wait for your food. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but the staff was kind and the food came out fast. I would have liked lime wedges served with my tacos, but the tortillas were outstanding and the food was tasty and prepared well. 
I will definitely eat here again."
4,"The food is good, price is right and the service is great. They are always very pleasant and friendly people. I took a friend here for his first torta and the guy at the counter was willing to answer any questions he had and even recommended a torta with half pastor and half carne asada so he could try both. Plus I like the fact that it's fast casual food but you still get chips and salsa. At Elmer's up the street it's more expensive and you don't get chips. Mucho taco is muy sabroso."
4,"We started out intending to go to the local IHOP but they had a line out the door. We came across Iowa Cafe right across the street and decided to give it a try. It was a good choice. We walked in and it was packed. We were seated within a couple minutes. All of us ordered an omelette. It came with potatoes and choice of bread. 

I chose an English muffin. They advertise ""fluffy"" omelette's. It was delicious and filling. Didn't finish everything because I didn't want to be stuffed. The staff is friendly. Service was good. I even enjoyed watching the football game that was on the huge tv right in front of us. I would recommend for breakfast. We all enjoyed our food."
4,Fried pork tenderloin sandwich!!! If your from the Midwest you know what I'm talking about. That is the only thing I've had here and it's the best I have found in the PHX area after looking for 5 years.
4,"Tucked away behind a bridge in an awkward business plaza or something sits this cute little cafe. Came in on a Sunday where they apparently have a limited menu and a $12 brunch buffet. 
We decided to go with the buffet and walked away feeling money well spent. The food quality in this clean establishment was above part and we'll prepared. Standing behind the active station was a friendly older gentleman preparing your perfectly put together omelet. Tip the man please because he deserves it and seems like he couldn't be happier to put together your omelet. 
For the waffles they offer homemade peach and blackberry compote to dress over your waffle. Can't speak for the peach, but the blackberry was delicious. Tasted fresh and not too sweet. 
Happy we found this place, and hope you will too."
4,Great breakfast place. Open early with a friendly staff and regulars
4,"I've been here twice now for brunch. Each time I'm a bit amazed at how good the food really is for a small town place tucked in near the train tracks.

I went a la carte on my last visit and ordered a pancake, sausage patties, hash browns, and a side of fruit. I figured they would all be super small side portions, but boy was I wrong. They were very generous with the plating and I couldn't finish all of my food. 

The pancake was delicious and looked so tempting that my friend had to sneak a taste too and agreed. It was a fluffy disc the size of a large plate with a dollop of whipped butter on the top. It's probably a dish you can recall from memory of a past experience, but this pancake still exceeded my expectations. The maple syrup mixed in with the melted butter to create a wonderful balance of decadent sweetness.

If you're looking to order a dish straight off the menu, I would recommend the Spanish Omelette. Cheesy eggs and meat together with a little bit of spice. What's not to love? A note to spice wimps that the dish is not too hot on the scale. 

Let there be a warning that service is fairly slow here. If you're someone that often needs a refill of coffee or water, this probably isn't the place for you. 

Most servers are friendly at least, but one of the women that runs food orders is not only not helpful, but is rude and dismissive. I tried to politely ask about the side of fruit that I ordered and was missing from the table, and she rudely said the other woman would bring it and walked away. My server then came out, but there was still no side of fruit. I had to kindly ask again for my order. My server quickly fixed this issue, but the other woman had the first opportunity to correct the order and dismissed me. 

All in all, I deducted a star for service, but it's a place I'd go to again if I was in the area. At least I know that I'll get a pretty good meal if nothing else."
4,"Yummy pizza!  Great staff, very friendly service! Loved the pizza! I like that the crust is a little crispy and doesn't get soggy like Rosati's. Antipasto salad was fresh and  delicious, plenty of cheese and olives,. Regular size was a good portion...enough to feed at least 4 people.  If you are ordering pizza, I recommend ordering at least an hour ahead to avoid waiting. I heard wait time is less for pastas. Even though this is technically a pick up and delivery location, there is some nice seating outside. Can't wait to try more of their menu!"
4,"Just went by here with my husband on our way home. We were expecting a coffee shop, but it feels more like a diner. The food that we've had so far is great! (Eggs benedict and the caprice flat bread) The iced vanilla latte is also pretty good. 

It definitely does not have the atmosphere of a cafe, but this is likely because it is so large! Might need to come back when it is a little busier to see how it is then."
4,"I tried this place out because of the wonderful reviews. I am so glad I did because I am now a fan. I made an appointment through Yelp, which took less than 2 hours for them to respond. I absolutely love the atmosphere. I hate stepping into the nail salon and everyone is staring at you because they are screaming at you, ""What do you want today."" That was not the case. When you walk in, you walk into their lobby and then they walk you back to the salon. My nail tech ""S"" was amazing. She was sweet and did a great job. I am very particular about how people paint dark or red colors because if you do not paint it on correctly, it is very noticeable. Everything was very clean and neat, which I love. 

The only thing that I was not a fan of was their parking. It is very hard to find parking because they are on a street that allows parking on both sides of the narrow street, which can be a tight squeeze. So go a little early if you decide to go during a busy time."
4,"Great location to get froyo in north glendale, and they have a 10% discount for midwestern students too. The flavors and toppings are consistently good - only problem is they're not rotated very frequently. Otherwise, it's very clean inside, the employees are friendly, and you can sample before committing to any particular flavors for your cup. There is also a rewards program, from which you can get a couple of $ off after a few visits"
4,Good tasting frozen yogurt. They don't let you get your own samples. C'mon...I'm an adult! : )
4,The icecream here is good but not as good as some other places in the city. Definitely check it out if you're in the area but it's not really worth a special trip.
4,Food is really good. I've had the deep dish pizza and meat tortellini with tomato cream sauce. I gave one less star because the last two times they wouldn't deliver (once they said they were short staffed and once they had a big catering order and fell behind). Also they close soooo early for a pizza place. If they stayed open later and hired another delivery person I'd give five stars.
4,"My bf is officially yogurt crazy; occasionally, it reaches a post-dinner frenzy and fro-yo MUST be had, and fast.  

Last night, no exception to this trend.  So after a tasty first-time visit to Pei Wei in the plaza kitty-corner to Yogurtology, we were off and running for a tasty treat.  

The staff here is very friendly, always wear gloves when offering samples, and invariably have a no-sugar added yogurt offering.  

I do like the option of the ""bottoming"" bits, but figure this sort of counters the concept of a lighter, yogurt treat.  There are plenty of fresh fruit options in their bar and the graham cracker topping is not ""weapons grade"" (aka so finely ground that you choke the minute you try to eat it as you subconsciously inhale it directly to the back of your throat! argh!)

All in all: pleasant, clean and tasty.  Undoubtedly, we will be back..."
4,"Great service and decent frozen yogurt too.

Staff are helpful, toppings are vast and plentiful - love the Boba!

Love having this all the time."
4,The Rival pale ale was good. The service was excellent. The strip steak was decent had good flavor the mashed potatoes were awesome. I would come back. Next time here on business I will try again. Go Cubs
4,"Burnt marshmallow : excellent.
Great service. Perfect for dessert after having lunch next door.
Likely the best location of the three stores."
4,"Food was excellent and very well priced. I got two big pancakes, sausage patties, and eggs for about $6. It was a lot of food and it was excellent.  It tasted great and I'm excited to come back and try one of their specialty dishes. They definitely nailed the basics."
4,"I have been going to Baiz for a while now. My mother introduced me to the store. I usually get like 15 bags of the freshly baked pita bread. And I always hit up the Backlawa counter. I have tried everything back there. They have the best Backlawa I have had in PHX period. I then go to the cooler and get 2-3 different flavors of Aziza soda. Baiz is the only middle eastern store/rest I have been to in AZ to carry authentic middle eastern sodas. These sodas go so well with the food and are absolutely gourmet. As I do my shopping I am usually waiting on my food from the rest. I usually get the shish kabob plate. Today they accidentally gave me lamb kabob. It was very good. However I prefer the shish kabob. The food at al-Hana rest is absolutely delicious. I mean authentic to the core. I am pushed to say the  Middle East may have (some of) the best tasting food. And Baiz does it better than right. Middle eastern food is good anyway. However, Baiz gives you excellence. 
I will say one thing though..
I have had many experiences unfortunately of bad customer service. Mainly from the Mexicans working in the rest, and even some of the middle eastern girls. I have made several complaints. Some of The staff have been very rude. I've even resorted to wearing a hijab once to fit in. Middle eastern girl at counter Still rude. However the owner is truly a nice man. Your experience there does depend on who is working for the day."
4,"A fellow yelper told me about this place, and I finally made it there a week or so ago. Since then, I can't seem to stay away- Sunday's venture was the third time in two weeks. What can I say? I like it. 

It's cheap, it's tasty, and it's fresh. No, you won't find the best middle eastern food in the world at Al-Hana, but you can't go wrong with a $3.99 chicken shwarma sandwich. 

The baba ghanoush is perfectly smoky, the hummus is ok. The chicken shwarma sandwich was really good, the falafel- not so much. 

Try the spinach pies. Maybe spinach isn't the first ingredient you'd like to find in a pie, but these will change your mind. 

Don't bother coming here if you're looking for a fancy sit down meal. It's completely no-frills, but completely tasty. 

One great thing to know about this place: They open at 9 am every day. Taboulleh for breakfast? Sure, why not?"
4,"Comfort food lives here! The Breaded Pork Tenderloin & Eggs ""Special"" that we tried today was wonderful - I really liked their fried potato slices too. The decor here is a tribute to Iowa. Amy being from Iowa, we thought it was kind of cute. If I owned the place - I'd invest heavily in landscaping to make it look like Iowa on the outside too.

FYI - They always have a Breaded Pork Tenderloin sandwich on the menu. Next time!"
4,"Came with my hubby and a friend, we ordered two entrees and hummus to share.  Chicken Kofta sandwich (aka pita wrap)  was awesome.  It's rare to find ground meat - even chicken - that doesn't taste like it's bathed in oil and fat.  This had great spiced flavor and tasted fresh and light.  Not crazy about the garlic sauce (it's clumpy and a little bland...tastes almost like regular butter to me), so I just dipped mine strait into the hummus instead. Yum!!

Prices were reasonable. 5 dollar wrap, and 4 for a ""small"" side of hummus that's more than enough to share.  Will definitely be coming back to try the falafel and take a look around the market.  (We took a peek at the deli while waiting for our food, and the fresh lamb looked outstanding!)

And IMO the surrounding neighborhood doesn't seem that sketchy to me.  Across the street from a park and some apartments that look pretty well-kept and clean.  I'm rolling my eyes big-time at some of the previous reviewers, here..."
4,"Kitchy, cozy, down-home feeling place.  Pretty much what you'd expect from a breakfast/lunch hole in the wall but cleaner!

The food was pretty good (standard breakfast and lunch/sandwich offerings) and the coffee was really good.  The server was very attentive and friendly.

We enjoyed our lunch here on a friend's recommendation and would be happy to pass the recommendation forward."
4,"I've visited this salon a few times since moving to the area. I've had manicure and pedicures done here.

The staff is incredibly accommodating and very sweet. The last time I was there I was the last customer to leave, at no point did my nail technician make me feel rushed or not as important. 

I was really impressed with how kind they were despite the appointment running over. 

They had a very sterile and clean salon. Like many of the salons in the area they offer beverages (alcoholic and non) and snacks. 

I like the way they match up their gels and regular colors so that they are easy to find especially if you are like me and like to get regular polish on the toes and gel on the finger nails -- just makes it easier. 

Looking forward to an appointment soon!"
4,"The steak was great, but the California wrap was a little on the dry side. Overall the fries were good the vegetables were fresh. Can't complain too much"
4,"I visited Al-Hana for the first time today for an Unofficial Yelp Event with Rand H., Robyn N., Mike C., Jackie C. and the other Jon H. I enjoyed some great Hummus and Pita Bread plus my main course of Lamb Kafta for $8.99 and a can of soda for $.099; this meal set me back $10.75 today.

Prior to arriving, I perused some reviews and the menu. Pro Tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned. I did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant. There was decent parking at about 11:10 when I got there. 

As I'm writing this review 4 hours later, I can tell you that I'm still stuffed. I really enjoyed my food along with conversations with my awesome lunch companions. Thanks to Rand for ""inviting"" me. I probably would have not tried this place otherwise."
4,Really good food but kind of slow getting food during lunch. I had the large pork cutlet sandwich or should I say huge!!!!
4,"Stopped in for breakfast with my husband on a Saturday morning. The place was moderately busy. We were seated and our drink orders were taken. Afyer reviewing rhe menu, I decided on the two egg breakfast. This comes with two eggs, cooked any style, homefries, and toast. I chose my eggs yo be cooked over hard, and whole wheat toast with no butter, and Orange Juice.
While waiting for our food to arrive, we admired the Midwestern theamed decor, and being Midwesterners ourselves, we related to most of it. 
When our waitress brought our plates of breakfast yumminess, we got to work eating.
My eggs were cooked perfectly, the homefries were crispy and tasty, and my unbuttered toast was toasted to the perfect toastiness!
While eating my husband noticed they offer a variety of pies. When our waitress btought by our check, we asked if they had Michigan four-berry pie(being a midwestern cafe, I thought maybe...) she said they did not...we talked for a bit about the amazingness that is a four bery pie, paud our bill and left.
Overall this was a good experience, and we will be back to try other options on their menu."
4,"""Well, my wife's from Iowa so that pretty much makes me from Iowa too.""

This place is a diamond in the rough.  A needle in a haystack. A king among men.  Well, you get the idea.  It's located between 'Bum F*** Egypt', and 'Where the hell am I', but it is worth the drive!

We usually run down there for breakfast because they have the BEST whole wheat pancakes this side of Iowa city! The rest of the food there is pretty much what you would expect from a midwestern greasy spoon, but the pies... oh the pies...

The only downside to writing a review about their pies, is that the english language doesn't have words to describe how utterly amazing they are. Exquisite? Nay.  Delectable? Closer, but not close enough.  I will simply say that if you venture to the realm of this genius facility, pie it up."
4,"Not a big fan of the Yogurtology flavors, but they have quality ingredients, friendly employees, fresh fruits, and lots of sweets to add on. Also, have high chairs."
4,Pork tenderloin is the best around! They also have a loose meat sandwich that is fantastic.
4,"I've come into the store a couple times before with my wife.  I came this time with intention of trying the Maple Bacon Crunch which I read about on The Grid, but it appears that they were out of it so I had to settle with the Crème brûlée.  Although the ice cream itself was great--very rich and creamy, I have had better Crème brûlée ice cream before, oddly enough it was at McDonalds!  I felt the Crème brûlée should have had some crispy caramel pieces on it, not just vanilla and caramel flavoring.  Crème brûlée means burnt cream, so having those little pieces would make it more authentic in my opinion.  
The store layout could be much better.  It's a small store and gets crowded really fast during the spring/summer months, it doesn't make sense to have tables and chairs inside the store during that season.  It's definitely not because it's cooler inside, fact is it's actually hotter because the main door is hanging open due to the customers waiting out the door.  
I'll be back here again, next time I hope to try the gelato."
4,"Rather than continuing to repeat what is said in the other reviews, if you like Middle Eastern food, you'll love Al-Hana.
It is fresh - made on the spot with Halal meats and fresh produce, the breads, wraps and pies all made from scratch and cooked there.
It is inexpensive - the little pies start at 69 cents and most of the sandwiches are under $5. You can easily feed two for about $10.
And it is good - all the fresh, homemade ingredients really come through in the flavors and textures, tasty meat, warm bread, crisp, fresh produce.
I am definitely going to make eating at Al-Hana a habit. It sure beats the alternative of corporate chain restaurants, processed ingredients and assembly line packaged food."
4,"It's inside Baiz market. I got the lamb kabob plate it's only  $8.99. It comes with great hummus,onion, pickle, tomatoes, and a amazing yellow Jasmine rice. Two pitas come as a side. You can bring your own bottle of water or buy one here. 
If you like to travel take a look around the market and it will make you feel like you are in a distant land. I love the candies and butcher shop area."
4,"A solid contender for best ice cream in Toronto. I had the pumpkin flavor - it was the highlight of my recent trip to the Jazz festival on Queen E. That's how good it is. There's limited seating inside but once you have your order in hand, you will be transported beyond mere walls. Get some!"
4,"I hesitate to even say anything good about this place because it was really good, and now everyone will go here...but I just can't keep it all to myself.  Tiptoe Nail is pretty darn good.  I strolled in there on a Saturday afternoon.  No appointment, but in desperate need of a gel mani and a regular pedi.  They took me right back.

You walk into the main room and it's shocking how large the space is.  You can tell, this place cranks out Mani/Pedis like no other, yet, I absolutely was not rushed at any point during my visit.  The girl who did my pedi was great.  My feet were in desperate need of repair and she fixed me right up.  Nice job on the polish and clean-up.  Love the foot/leg massage.

Next I went and did a gel mani.  The same girl did all the clean-up on my hands, another on the polish and another for the hand massage.  Polish looked good and hasn't chipped after two days!  I do wish they had cleaned up my cuticles a bit more, but I'll put that one on me for not paying attention and watching the Food Network on TV instead of looking at my hands.

Overall, great place.  It seemed like quite a few people came with a friend, so that might be fun for me to do the next time I go.  Parking was a bit of a pain, but the mani/pedi was worth it.  Positives were the great staff, nice job on the nails, clean/cute facility and the extensive collection of nail colors and matching gel colors.  There's no other way to say it except that I'll be back."
4,"Ordered some tabouli and hummus, both delicious. Comes with pita bread which was a nice surprise. I was able to order, get in line and pay for my groceries, and waited a few minutes before my food was ready. It spilled a bit in the bag, but that may be from the drive home. It was busy too, which is good to see. That means people enjoy the food."
4,Really nice out of the way place with a great breakfast menu with fresh ingredients and a coffee bar.  You might think it is coffee only but good food as well.
4,"This is PRECISELY the OPPOSITE of Pizza Hut/Dominos/Papa Johns: real quality. 

Not inexpensive, coupons online.  Try it."
4,"I ordered the Gyro for lunch.  It comes with fries but I decided to up charge for the onion rings. I am unable to give a five star rating for this lunch.  The atmosphere was awesome.  I did enjoy eating here today.  But while the Gyro tasted great.  As I got to the end there was just too much grease from the meat.  
Also the upcharge of $.99 for the onion rings was a great price.  Except one problem.  I got FOUR onion rings.  That was disappointing.  They were small onion rings at that. 
Oh well.  
Overall the food and experience was good. And that deserved the four stars.  Enjoy your next meal there.  I did."
4,"Just moved to Plaza Midwood, and I'm trying to establish a new nail salon. This is a great little place and super chill. Everyone was awesome. I will be returning!"
4,"I love Ed's. Not only does the ice cream have its own unique texture, but the staff is fun. There is the guy who wears Darth Vader shirts, another server with an Irish accent, and well...everyone there is really helpful and cares about good service. It's one of those places where you can have a little chat when it isn't busy.  I also really appreciate that they make both regular and gelato ice cream. That's commitment.  A fine establishment."
4,"I recently relocated from the Bay Area. I had been at my regular shop for over 20 years. Finding a new spot left me apprehensive. I am not disappointed with this place. Always clean, friendly  service & above average pedicure. They have every color you can think of & provide beverages if needed. Final note, they are always playing great music. I want to dance sometimes!"
4,Traveling with the family and stopped for dinner and to watch USA defeat japan for the Women's World Cup. Great neighborhood bar. Good service and great food.
4,"Good beer selection, both draft and bottle. Food was good. Patio is probably one of the best in the area."
4,"-Self-serve frozen yogurt place with various toppings bar.

-.42 cents per ounce (watch those heavy toppings!)

-Grab a one-size cup and add your flavors and toppings...or place large cookie or brownie on the bottom.

-Tastes pretty good, like soft-serve ice cream, available in different flavors.

-Try the oatmeal cookie flavor, then add raisins, chocolate chips, and other cookie related toppings...it's like a creamy cookie in a cup!

-Super clean place, very simple, & nice decor....relaxing.

-Very friendly & helpful service.

-Clean restroom.

-Convenient parking (right near Jenny Craig...ha ha!)"
4,"My go to bar. I have been coming here before it was close to home. They have daily menus, drink specials, etc. The staff has changed some, but the new servers have improved alot!"
4,"People greet you right away as you walk in. They're all very accommodating. I am able to immediately test some juices and sit in a comfortable chair.  Their juices are pretty good, I like crystal, pink star and Baja blast so far.  The flavors with coconut are pretty nice too.  This is definitely my go to spot to get juice. Remember to always bring your vape so they can check it out if there's any problems."
4,"I just had a company lunch from your restaurant . The food was very good. I would recommend you to family amd freinds.
Thank you for the lunch."
4,Excellent ice cream and flavours...  Burnt marshmellow was excellent.  And so was the chocolate....  Just right amount of chocalatiness...
4,This is my first time here. The place looks new and clean. The staff were courteous and friendly. My omelette was delicious. The only downside is the wait time for the table and food.
4,"Great place. I love going to restaurants inside of markets...is it just me or is the food almost always better? The only downside is I always spend more than I anticipated because I start browsing the store while I wait for my food. The meat section is not for the faint of heart. There are whole lamb heads!

The babaganoush is so good! It has great flavor and texture...little mushy bits of eggplant come up every so often. I also love the chicken shwarma with garlic sauce and pickles. The meat, cheese, and spinach pies are a great little appetizer. To be honest, it's hard to go wrong here--I have yet to order something I didn't thoroughly enjoy!"
4,"Went here after a run in the park. Great breakfast and great services.
I was also impressed by the proportions for the price.
Will be back for the baked breakfast bowls!!!"
4,"We were visiting the area and decided to try a local restaurant. We went on a Sunday around noon and stumbled upon their Sunday brunch buffet. The omelet station is well stocked with a good variety of meats and vegetables. The gentleman cooking them is very personable. The Belgian waffles came with a choice of blueberry or apple cinnamon toppings, and both were delicious. They also offered various breakfast meats and sides as well. 
The coffee bar portion of the establishment made a great addition to the meal. The only negative in any way comes from the service. While very friendly, it was an extremely relaxed atmosphere of ""We'll get to you when we want."" 
In spite of the service issue, my wife and I will definitely be back whenever we are in town."
4,"Iowa Cafe is one of those places I always saw and wished to stop but never did. Someone from our church had told us that it had reopened under new management and in a different location. Then, we heard other friends talk about it and said that it was good with a down-home feeling. Well, one Sunday after church my whole family decided to go there for lunch. We all liked it!!

My husband ordered the meat loaf and he said that it remainded him of back home (Ohio) so I guess that's good. The food option in the kids menu is good and super affordable. I ordered a small traditional breakfast with bacon and country potatoes that was good but also ordered  a cinnamon roll to share with everybody that it was amazing!! Just make sure you ask for it to nice and warm. 

Overall, our first experience there has been nice. Service is great and super friendly!! We're definitely going back!!"
4,"Looking for an affordable breakfast in Berea that doesn't disappoint on taste? This is your place. We go here often with my dad and step mom and they love it too. Not only is the food a hit, but the service is good too. I I love you how they feature area artists' work on their walls, too. I would have given five stars, but I'm not a huge fan of how the dining area is situated. It's a little crammed in my opinion."
4,"I ate at the location in Mesa today and it was amazing, so I wanted to make sure to share the love on both Yelps (there isn't an Al Hana page for Mesa).

The beef shawarma was great! It came with hummus, basmati rice, tomatoes, pickles, onions and a giant piece of bread. Fat and friendly and super clean. My Iraqi friend gave it an 8/10 for authenticity."
4,"Have been back a few times since my last review and have to say things are on the upswing with their food and service. We've been really happy with our burgers, salads, wings and fish and chips to name a few items.....and fries. All have been great. The service has improved 100%. Actually really refreshing!  The owners are obviously putting everything into making this a success. New bar being built outside too. We actually sat outside for dinner the other night and the patio was full of other patrons enjoying a burger and cold one on one of our first warm evenings!  

I like you, Rivals. My partner and I will be back soon.....say next Monday!"
4,"We ordered pasta dishes and they were very good. The staff was very friendly. We will be back to try their pizza too. 
This is a small place with four tables for eating in. More of a take-out type of place."
4,"Still thinking about those St. Louis style ribs. Everybody seems to do baby back and/or smoked. Don't get me wrong, love me some smoked or baby back rib. These ribs blew me away! They were cooked very well. Tender with crispy sections on the exterior. They are my favorite non-smoked rib. 

Fire place was cozy on cold February Cleveland day.The menu is huge which usually is a bad sign for me, no complaints on my plate. Extensive beer selection however is always welcome. Friendly staff, great place."
4,Great hummus and good tasting pita and lamb! A great culture experience all inside a busy little market
4,Reminded me of home. Good food. Service was a little slow but in the Midwest people don't rush so gave you even more that Midwest experience.
4,"Visited here a few weeks ago with good intentions of trying their own beer but Fat Heads was doing a promotion here for their beer, so that didn't happen. I did sample the food and thought it was typical pub fare. Tasty and reasonably priced. The beer menu was extensive with a wide variety of in-house beers. I will update his review after a return visit when I can sample the Rivals beer options."
4,This is a great spot for meetings especially if you need to meet somewhere near the airport. I love the entire beverage menu worth chai tea lattes being my personal favorite. I also really like he biscuits and gravy!
4,"In terms of food, I would really only give this place a 3 star rating because I didn't find it to be particularly wonderful.  However, I loved the setup of the menu that let you order as little or as much as you like without having to break the bank by ordering everything a la carte.  The place is fairly small and tucked away in a place you might miss if you were driving by, but they have a pretty big sign out front.  It was a seat yourself kind of deal and the server came by pretty quickly to take our drink order. 

While waiting for drinks I was able to observe the eclectic and not entirely cohesive crap all over the walls and on the shelves.  I didn't quite understand why some stuff was on the walls, but to each his own.  The restaurant seemed a wee bit dirty but it didnt really bother me one bit.  For breakfast I ordered 2 buckwheat pancakes, an egg, and some bacon.  The egg was cooked just the way I like it, with the edges of the white nice and crispy.  The bacon was fine, but nothing special.  The pancakes were enormous and entirely too much food for me.  They were pretty tasty, but a little on the dry side for my taste.

The East Valley is lucky to have such a nice alternative to the usual suspects for breakfast."
4,"I give it 4 *Stars* which is pretty generous in my world and there was a single MEMORABLE reason for it. I walked in smelling the most pleasant smell and it wasn't Ice Cream. I haven't developed that Ice Cream smelling skill yet! The whole place smelled like Waffles and that was because they were making fresh batch of Waffle Cones at the Waffle Machines on display at the window near you. 

Good amount of seating and even bar seating facing the window where you can TEASE kids walking by while their mom drag them along. The decor is of Dessert/Ice Cream Parlour mooding with Cow flying over the Moon(Clock) which isn't functional. 

Ed's has Gelato and Ice Cream where I got the Large Ice Cream Cup($5.13) that gets you up to 3 Flavours where I got Cinnamon(YUM), Burnt Marshmallow(A-OK), and Macaroon(A-OK). The Macaroon had Chocolate chunks inside as well as Dried Coconut bits. Burnt Marshmallow was almost like Caramel Sauce Vanilla Ice Cream to me. It's Cinnamon I like that had that subtle flavour. 

Along the side is a display of various merchandise as well as a FRIDGE with pre-packaged Ice Cream desserts for take home."
4,"There are two locations on Queen Street. I visited here after walking on the bench in one summer afternoon. The surround area is quiet and peaceful and I enjoyed its delicious ice-cream seating on the street side. I ordered pistachio and green tea in plain cone. Both are green!! Haha~ Really good taste. Not too sweet and full of flavour. The ice-cream is in natural color. No artificial colour or flavour!! Compared to other place's ice-cream which looks bright-coloured and very beautiful, I think Ed's scoop is real food and much better! 
When I riding back to downtown along the queen st., I found the another location was more popular. But I recommend this location because staff were all very nice and provides a more comfortable not crowded eating environment."
4,"Tasty ice cream. Great place to go if you like watching people lick things. One topping is free, so get a tasty topping on the tasty ice cream while you watch people lick things. They have a bunch of tasty types of cones, so choose carefully. Tip: You're probably going to get ice cream on your hand, but before you lick it off your hand, think of the last thing you touched. Chances are it was something dirty like a streetcar pole or a door knob, or the rump of an aged homeless man. Enjoy!"
4,She's hidden away but worth the find. Pricey if you don't have insurance.
4,"Delicious as always! Great selection of ice cream flavours. I can't comment on the gelato. I only gave them 4 stars though as service was a bit chaotic and the set up of the shop is terrible. If there's a line up, it's extremely difficult to get out of the store because orders are placed all the way at the back. There really should be two doors so people can get in and out easily."
4,"It's inside Baiz market. I got the lamb kabob plate it's only  $8.99. It comes with great hummus, onion, pickle, tomatoes, and a amazing yellow Jasmine rice. Two pitas come as a side. You can bring your own bottle of water or buy one here. Chicken has been dry a few times so I only order it in a sand which which has a sauce on it. 
If you like to travel take a look around the market and it will make you feel like you are in a distant land. I love the candies and butcher shop area. It's another world!"
4,"Had a craving for ice cream and found this place through a Yelp search, it was worth the 20 minute drive. I tried their waffle cone with two scoops, Beech Fudge Brownie and Maple Bacon Crunch... such a treat to combine ice cream and bacon in one snack! Also sampled the PB&J flavour, which was nice, but I was happy with my choice."
4,"YUM - they have some good ice cream. I had Bordeaux cherry chocolate in a sugar cone. They were making waffle cones right by the entrance which I found to be neat. My ice cream was good and had huge chunks of cherries in it. The ice cream itself had a very light flavour that was satisfying on a hot day. 

The lineup was insane and eventually went down the street. My boyfriend had gelato and it was way too cold to get the proper appreciation for creaminess. Overall I enjoyed my visit minus these two things. I think they need a bigger shop."
4,"Whenever I dragged my friend to go on a eating spree with me, she always complains no matter where I feed her... sushi (hmm), cakes (nahhh), burger (oh not again!) foie gras (oh...not one of the Hoofs) 

Ed's Real Scoop is the only place that when I asked her if she want some ice cream.. she would have said YAY!! I want it!! So that alone worth 4 stars!! 

I have been to the Leslieville location which I l enjoyed better because of the extra seating and more spacious set up. The Beach location is a little more run down.. but aside from that, it does have a more nostalgic charm. 

No patrons but us when we dropped by on this chilly Sunday afternoon... it was so windy.. and cold... I think most people were drinking hot chocolate instead of eating chocolate ice cream. 

Burnt Marshmallow and Tahitian Chocolate both taste smooth, rich and divine... 

I knew my friend really enjoyed her ice cream because she was licking her spoon non stop... as she would not let any goodness to be wasted! No judgement here, as I like to lick my plates clean too! :)"
4,I have been there for breakfast many times. Busy place. The service and the food has always been good.   It is a must place to go. I bring or meet friends and family. Parking is never ending.
4,"This cafe is very spacious, with a nice cozy fire place and great decor.  Everything I have tried there has been delicious.  I strongly recommend the Three Cheese Panini, and the Spicy Potato Soup (which I wish they would have regularly on the menu!).  You can't beat the prices, and I love that you can order breakfast all day every day."
4,Love love love this place! Santa fe spring rolls are the bomb.com  and I really enjoy that they give you the option of taking any of the sandwiches and making it a wrap.  Food is fresh and service was superb.  We'll definitely be back
4,"Ed's Real Scoop is so delicious and satisfying. 

We arrived to the smell of home made waffle cones (drool, drool) and a storefront full of overly warm patrons trying to select their flavours. I was very impressed with the selection - gelatos, sorbets, and ice cream.

Pints cost $7.50 and scoops around $3-$5 depending on your cone and size. We chose the maple bacon crunch and the cookies n' cream. Both were creamy and smooth....

We'll be returning to try the gelato!"
4,"I like this place. It has a nice atmosphere, good coffee and great breakfast I haven't been in for lunch yet, but plan on it soon. 

I have had breakfast there 3 time so far each time it was really good! Food was always hot and had good flavor. The only bad thing I could say is that the service was a bite on the slow side, but they busy each time I was in there. 

It is nice to see a locally owned small business doing things the right way."
4,"The Pizza is excellent!  My cousin and I (both originally from Chicago) really enjoyed their pizza!  Thin crust is our go to and the crust was perfect!  Sauce and sausage wonderful too!
Stay tuned for their expansion 1st quarter of 2016!  We'll definitely be back!"
4,Nice place that has definitley improved over the years.French toast with bourbon peaches is SO good. They now serve dinner.
4,"Another sports bar checked in to by your friendly local soccer team, the snail cats!

This is the third place we've been after a game for food and it is by far the best! This place is massive. I didn't get to see the patio but I did catch a glimpse of some pictures. Definitely somewhere I could see us hanging out in the summer.

It was pretty late so I was only in the mood for some light bites. Of course, this means wings!! I was pleasantly surprised with all the sauce choices and...wait for it....they have general tso's sauce...for their wings! I know, right? My eyes became blurry and  immediately honed in on the magnificent words I was reading. I practically yelled my order at the waiter so he didn't misunderstand...I clearly needed wings with that sauce on them. Yes, yes they were as delicious as I imagined. Against my better judgement, I also ordered the ""unrivaled heat"" wings. The spiciness was good but the flavor was off. Not a fan.

Over all I enjoyed Rivals. I will be back!"
4,"Great middle eastern store! Halal choices. And delicious food ant great prices. Best grocery in Phoenix, great selection of fresh veggies & fruit, stuff you wouldn't find elsewhere (sweet red pepper, saturn peaches), amazing cardamon coffee, best feta cheese, etc. Wonderful middle east market."
4,"I tend to forget about Middle Eastern food when I'm considering my dining options, but I have to thank Jason W - who invited me to try this little lunch spot in the Baiz Market - for reminding me of how satisfying and delicious (and in this case, affordable!) it can be. 

I met him and some other Yelpers to sample some of Al-Hana's wares and while there were a few strike-outs (specifically, the hummus, which didn't have enough garlic or lemon, and the tabloulleh, which had way too much parsley), the falafel sandwich, shwarma beef and chicken sandwiches (both with garlic sauce), and cheese pies were all so flavorful! And at $2.99 and $3.99 for the sandwiches and $.50 - $3.99 for the other sides, the lunch was also incredibly affordable. 

If you are ever in the area or work or live nearby, you should definitely check Al-Hana out. Given how affordable it is, you can have a savory and enjoyable lunch that really fills you up. If you have time after you finish eating, definitely take a few minutes to walk around the market - there are some real deals on Mediterranean staples, like 2-lb bags of dates for $3.99! 

One final note - there is a $10 minimum for debit/credit card usage, so bring cash."
4,"A small restaurant located inside the Baiz Grocery story. The food is not that bad, although I have not tasted enough of the dishes...The meat pies and chicken shawarma were the big deals for me and I really like them."
4,"So excited Sanfratello's is here. Recently moving to Arizona from Chicagoland, we were really missing this pizza. It was just as great as back home, crispy crust and oozing sauce. Hope they decide to open a dine-in restaurant soon."
4,Great ice cream . Usually super busy. A couple of tables inside and a bar counter at the window - two benches outside.
4,"On Sunday afternoon, we decided to venture to the beaches and we came across this lovely Ice cream shop that had a very long line. Many times I have passed this place but it was closed. So luckily we had time to kill and we waited for around 20 minutes. 

The servers were quick and asked what we wanted. I told her, waffle cone burnt marshmallow and coffee almond fudge swirl. Honestly, it was my first time and I didn't even know we could get a topping for the ice cream. There were many choices like walnuts, kit Kat or jelly beans. For every cone, it comes with 2 flavours from gelatos, yogurts or ice cream. Both flavours we picked was  an ice cream. The kiddie size was quick big and since it was a hot day, we managed to finish most of it before it started dripping.

I would recommend getting the waffle cone since it is made in store and they put a marshmallow at the end of the ice cream cone. I think the kiddie size would be the best for cones to avoid any dripping. 

I am planning to go back to try the other exotic flavours like dark chocolate chili or ed's birthday cake."
4,"If there was a 4.5, they'd win it...simple cafe inside Baiz Marketplace. I ordered entirely too much food to-go and was not disappointed by the price or taste!! Large hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli (entire package of house-made pita included) + falafel wrap and shawarma wrap = about $30 and is enough food to eat as leftovers for days. 

Best of the best was the baba ghanoush. You can really taste the roasted/charred quality of the eggplant and it is balanced perfectly with the tahini. I love the slight chunkiness of the puree that really highlights and respects the ingredients. (Grade: A+++)

The falafel sandwich/wrap was also AMAZING! Great balance of pickles, tomatoes, tahini, etc. Cheaper than the other wraps (though all are super cheap given the quality ingredients, this is about $4) and the staff favorite. (Grade: A)

I asked the gal taking my order what her next fav wrap is and followed her suggestion of the chicken shawarma. This was certainly good, but I'll definitely stick with the falafel. (Grade: B) 

Tabouli was also spectacular! I would have preferred a bit more lemon, but was pleasantly surprised that they didn't overload it with bulgar (huge pet peeve of mine). (Grade: A) 

Lastly, the hummus is flavored more strongly with tahini than other hummus I've tried from M.E. restaurants, but texture is fantastic and I'm a fan! I'd say it's a standard hummus that won't blow your socks off, but is still certainly delicious. If you are new to hummus, this is the perfect intro. (Grade: A-) 

All and all, everything was well worth the trip, money and calories. The large sides fill up an entire full-size to-go box.  I will be back for sure!!"
4,"The food is good.  Gotta love their sandwiches.  I enjoy the lamb kabab sandwich.  My wife likes the shish tawook.  We specifically travel from Mesa AZ to this particular Middle Eastern cafe....particular when my wife wants her ""fix"".  

I would like to know if they do the following:

Since I work nearby @ 34th Street & Washington in Phoenix, is it possible to call an order ahead and pickup say 45-60 minutes later?  I do not see any kind of takeout menu.  I know they do carryout, but I am just wondering."
4,"I like to be able to have a nail boutique I'm familiar with in different areas of the city, just in case I want to randomly pamper myself. Recently I was in such a mood and decided to try Tiptoe while in Plaza Midwood. 

What I liked is that I could walk right up to it, it's located sort of in the middle of everything in Plaza, very close to Central Avenue. The shop itself is is designed with modern decor. There is a comfortable waiting area, with beverages, a tv, magazines, and a sofa. The board at the front near the register lists their wide-range of services for adults, parties, and children. 

This visit I had my eyebrows waxed and received a basic manicure.  This was a Sunday after Charlotte had some inclement weather, so it was super busy in there, and I also got behind a bridal party, so my wait was rather long, but I don't feel this would be typical. I was please with the ultimate shape of my brows. I expressed my preference for a thicker brow and that request was honored.  I was also pleased with the wide range of colors and the neatness of the shop and nail bar. During my manicure, I received a complimentary glass of red wine and enjoyed watching HGTV, while my tech worked on my nails. 

My tech was very kind and courteous , asked my preferences before she got started and did a good job on my cuticles . This is very important to me, I've had my cuticles cut too deeply before , so I'm always a little leery of trying a new nail tech. At the end, even though I wasn't getting gel, the tech used the UV light to help dry my nails faster. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience, and will definitely visit again when I'm in the Plaza Midwood area."
4,"A bit of a ""hidden gem"" in a nondescript strip mall in Berea, just on the other side of the viaduct.  This place has a nice assortment of both breakfast and lunch dishes...I have had both and can attest to the quality and freshness of the food served.

My favorite menu item there is there club sandwich with fresh turkey, bacon and all the fixings.  Also, don't forget to try their ""loaded"" potato salad...a unique take on a traditional side dish.

Have also been there late-night for coffee and dessert.  They have a nice double-sided fireplace with comfy lounge chairs to hang out, etc.

Will definitely return once I move my office back to Olmsted Falls."
4,"Huge drink list.  We had a light dinner made of apps.  Fried mushrooms were ""A-"", large and yummy in beer batter.  Teriyaki chicken sliders were an A+, very delicious and very real chicken breast, and they were large for sliders.  Finally, steamed potstickers were a mixed bag.  The shrimp ones didn't have much shrimp flavor, or much flavor period.  The edamame ones had a great flavor to them.  Would probably order again but ask if I could make the whole order of 6 edamame potstickers and no shrimp (and this is coming from a seafood and meat lover).  Server was fast and friendly, though a tad crass in her language, in the same way that many PG-13 movies awkwardly insert certain words to come across as ""hip"" or ""adult"".  Yes I know it's a ""sports bar"" but the workers shouldn't assume you want to join them in a round of cussing.  GREAT patio!  Will be back."
4,"I truly enjoyed this place. Super clean, friendly staff, large (ok, ginormous) selection of toppings and, get this, bottomings. 

I tried the oatmeal cookie, cake batter, red velvet, and peanut butter flavors. 

Have I ever mentioned I'm a sucker for peanut butter? : )

The only flavor I didn't care for was the red velvet. I'm the first to admit chocolate is never top on my list, but this seemed way too fake. Eh.

I did, however, truly enjoy the oatmeal cookie. They have this one in the bag. 

Perhaps my next spin through will involve some of the fruit flavors. Who knows? I can be a bit capricious."
4,"The staff here is very friendly and helpful offering us samples of any flavors we wanted to try and I really appreciated that! My mother cannot have gluten so usually frozen yogurt places are A-OK for her but unfortunately some flavors here have some wheat in them, just an fyi to anyone also wondering. (The good thing is they do CLEARLY mark which ones have wheat!)  I personally love this place because of the toppings! (I'm not gluten sensitive.) They have lots of things you wouldn't normally find (hostess cupcakes, or lookalikes!). If you're all about the toppings then I highly recommend this place! 

The location is also very nice and chill. It can get a little bit busier on weekend nights as alot of families like to go out for a treat. There's plenty of parking as it's nestled in a strip mall so you don't have to worry about that. A few seats outside and a curb if the seats are taken! I will probably be back to try more toppings!"
4,"After falling for the Fro-Yo trend, which I swore not to, I decided to check out all of the frozen yogurt places out in the Arrowhead area.  There has to be at least ten of these shops to open up in the vicinity in the last few years.  As with any business, some will make it and many will fail.  In search of the place that had the best quality, atmoshphere, and service, I could not argue with Yogurtology being the best place to enjoy a nice frozen delight.

I've been here many times since its opening and noticed that the service has been consistently great with every visit.  No lazy kids working here.  The place is always clean, bright with white colors on the walls, and soothing music while you enjoy some Fro-Yo.  All of what I said is great, but the real reason to come here is because they serve some great varieties of frozen yogurt.  Two must have flavors are the golden cupcake batter and oatmeal cookie.  You can't go wrong with either of these.

I will be back many times eventhough it gets crowded with all those teenie boppers."
4,"This will be quick. I saw the dough they use for the pizza, it's not preformed or frozen. The food is good, best enjoyed as soon as you get it. As I understand they are increasing the seating area. It's a higher quality pizzas place, and the owner gives back to the community and to his customers. Thank you sir. And for the record I like the piece in the middle with no crust."
4,"Awesome market for everything middle eastern (spices and cuts of lamb and such) and an awesome lunch counter for pita sandwiches and various middle eastern plates of food.

Cheese pies and kafta plates are my go-to but it's all good, and cheap!"
4,"We are visiting from Chicago and the kids wanted some frozen yogurt. Although I respect that they will not allow us to get our own samples, I didn't feel the employee was friendly enough to make my kids comfortable to ask. They typically try 3-4 before filling their bowl and only had one.
Our favorite flavor was banana, but I also really liked the blackberry.
The atmosphere was not as fun as the places back home. The kids didn't want to stay and eat.
Overall I would recommend this place and thought the yogurt was very good."
4,Food is amazing and very fresh.  I have never had better baba ganouj in my life and the garlic sauce is better than sex!  Hummus with combo shawarma is delish.  My only knock is that there isn't enough parsley in your falafel.
4,"There isn't really another bar like this in the area. I live in Lakewood (land of 1000 bars) and will DRIVE to go to rivals. Great beer selection, good bar food and a lot of TVs. 

Rivals is actually 3 bars, there is a large bar, a smaller bar and a dining area. All three areas have TVs and the dining area has a fireplace which is pretty cool. 

This is a true sports bar. Great for college games and on Sundays during football season you get your typical browns fans but also fans wearing Viking, Titans and Chargers jerseys. There are also a large contingent of Steelers fans that frequent this bar on Sundays. 

There is more than enough space, beer and TVs for all and everyone gets along really well. 

Without a doubt one of my favorite bars and definitely worth a trip."
4,"I would like to thank all of our customers that came in today,  Feb. 24th, for all of their patients and understanding. I know it is the cafe's  responsibility to be fully staffed but today it was an unfortunate event. 
I appreciate everyone's understanding and all of your encouragement and praise for the server. 
Thanks again and hope to see you all again soon."
4,"This place is  tucked in the corner inside the Baiz market. It has amazing sandwiches. I love the lamb kebob sandwich, can't wait to try some of the other ones like the shwarma and kefta. The pies like interesting and worth a try when I'm not rushing to get back to work. The market also has a wide variety of fresh breads and desserts to compliment any meal."
4,"Ok I wasn't going to leave a review but this is the cherry on top... for a sports bar it's awesome - they have a ton of TVS, food was great, service awesome, $5 bud light pitcher great deal. THEN... just as my phone is about to die, they have outlets under the bar!!! ON the CUSTOMER SIDE!!! So great!"
4,"It has been many years since we had a Sanfratello's pizza. Living in Las Vegas we make sure we visit Sanfratello's when going back home to Chicago/NW Indiana. So we were excited when planning our trip down to Scottsdale to learn that Sanfratello's has a Gilbert ,AZ location.
We actually though this was a full restaurant but when driving up we realized that they do more carry out. After driving for over 4 hours we were glad they had tables out side so we ordered our pizza and grabbed out drinks and waited for a bite of heaven. Loved the Pomegranate water they had on tap.
They guys working were great and bought our pizza and plates to us outside and checked back to see if we needed anything.
It was a Friday night and they did not seem that busy which really surprised us because the pizza was great.
We really wanted to bring back some pizza but had no way to keep it cold.
I wish you would open up a franchise in Las Vegas."
4,"I love this restaurant. 
I'm a breakfast person and I find that they have a good breakfast menu and many coffee and tea choices. 
It is a lot like Fresh Start it that it is Very clean, and spacious, and the food is better than 90% of restaurants.
You also can't beat the cozy fireplace, free WiFi and friendly staff.
The sisters are wonderful and the staff is very kind and accomodating.
As a new business they have the started out well. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Meals are good, affordable and portions are more than adequate. I rate it an A."
4,"I went to this Gem of a Sports Bar last night.  The waitress, Lisa, was extremely helpful with the menu and cocktails.  I had the Steak House Salad with Vidalia Onion Dressing.  The steak was perfect and the dressing was really good without an extreme onion taste.  The lighting in the bar area was a little bright, but not overpowering.  Lots of TV's for sports.  This is defiantly on my ""return"" list for Sports Bars."
4,"The City of Angles, Los Angles, has to be one of my favorite foodie destinations. Pretty much every food trend over the past 5 years or so has its epicenter in LA. From Korean style frozen yogurt to cupcakes and now food trucks, the people of LA know a good thing when they taste it. While all of these trends have some how made their way to the Valley of the Sun, there's one thing that I've never been able to find here, garlic sauce like the one that's served at the LA institution Zankou Chicken.  

If you've heard of Zankou and its amazing Lebanese chicken and tangy fluffy garlic sauce you know exactly what I mean when I say it's ethereal. For those who've never tried it either pack an overnight bag and head to LA or drive down to 20th Street and Van Buren to Al-Hana inside of Baiz market, its the closest thing to Zankou Chicken in Phoenix and its close location makes it even better.

The area located around Baiz Market might seem a little rough around the edges but the market itself is clean, well lit and packed with all sorts of interesting Middle Eastern grocery items from dairy and fresh produce to meat and hookah paraphernalia. Tucked in the corner of the market is Al-Hana, a postage stamp sized restaurant specializing in, you guessed it Middle Eastern cooking. 

While the offerings might seem typical the flavors are bold and shouldn't be missed. The creamy roasted eggplant dip Babaghannuj ($4.49) had a smokiness usually not found in many other places. Al-Hana leaves their version thick and chunky with just the right amount of olive oil drizzled over the top. 

Ordering the Falafel Plate ($5.99) will get you 6 deep fried cumin scented pucks of ground chickpeas and fava beans. Pile a couple of these onto a freshly baked pita, slather with tahini and enjoy the crunch. Id also highly recommend the Labneh Pie ($2.99) which is filled with labneh, a Lebanese cream cheese, onions and tomatoes all baked in a light tender crust. 

The main dish for me was of course the Whole Roasted Chicken ($9.99). It comes with pita, pickles and garlic sauce. The chicken itself is so well seasoned and juicy it would seem like a crime to adorn it with anything until you get some garlic sauce on it. The texture is light and fluffy, almost like a garlicky mayonnaise. After one taste you might ask them for another container, seriously delicious. 

After a wonderful meal you'd think there wouldn't be enough room left for desert, but my rule is there's always room. With that I sauntered to the back of Baiz Market where their in store bakery is located, most of the case filled delights are around $2 each including a flaky syrup soaked baklava. 

While I love LA, knowing that I don't have to drive 300 miles to get my garlic sauce fix makes the drive across town all the tastier. 

Al-Hana inside Baiz Market
Open Daily"
4,"Had a good time at Rivals. Our server, Steven was amazing, very nice, laid back guy!!
Fried pickles, fried mozzarella and loaded fries were delisch. 
We'll be back for more patio shenanigans!"
4,"Pork tenderloin sandwiches to Iowa is like lobster is to Maine.  It is the state food.  But it is hard to find good tenderloin sandwiches in far away places like Arizona.  Fortunately, The Iowa Cafe supplies the tenderloin sandwiches that Iowa retirees in Arizona crave.  We were not disappointed.  Good stuff.  (The pies, on the other hand, were not particularly good, so stick with the tenderloin sandwiches.)"
4,Ingredients were very true to the Chicago style pizza. Deep Dish pan was very yummy! However only complaint is that they could have cooked it a little longer. However I like my pizza a little well done. I would definitely go back there and plan on it! Best of luck to this new business!
4,"Stopped in for a quick soy latte and a caramel brownie w graham cracker crust. Place was packed (Saturday around 11:20am). 
Soy latte was solid and the brownie was delicious (which it shoulda been for $6)
Will be back when we visit again"
4,"I really love this place overall, with just a couple of areas for improvement.  I got a basic pedicure and a powder dip with acrylic tips.

PROS:

Cool, industrial vibe fitting for the area (Plaza Midwood/Elizabeth).

Nice separate sitting area (looked like a nice doctor's office), not the row of chairs against the window that most places have.

Massage chair and regular chairs were comfortable and stylish.

They offer wine and drinks.

Pedicure by Mary was really one of the best I've had given her attention to detail.  You could tell she really cared and didn't rush through it.  But if you are on a time crunch I guess this could be a negative, since it took a little over an hour.

This was the first time I have had a powder dip.  Normally I just polish my natural nails, or if I do want fake nails I get plain acrylics.  But I told the owner (nice guy, but can't remember his name) I didn't want any drilling and very natural looking thin nails, so he suggested this technique.  He did a fabulous job very quickly.  Seriously one of the most natural looking fake nails I have ever seen.

Quality products.  All OPI.  Honestly!  Not the generic stuff in an unidentified bottle.

Everyone speaks English very fluently and chats with you (if you want).

CONS:

Not an abundance of parking spaces available.

Color selection of normal polish and powder dips wasn't the best I have seen.  I can't speak for gels since I didn't get this.  I like lighter natural colors and had a hard time finding much beyond the standard ""bubble bath"".

The color arrangement was among the worst I have ever seen.  No similar colors grouped together.  There was no organization at all and a lot of bottles were even 2 rows deep.  It made it very difficult to find a color (so maybe they have more colors than I previously described, but I just couldn't find them! ha).  All the bottles did have numbers put on them though, so maybe there was a sample wheel somewhere that referenced the numbers?  I don't know, that would have been nice, but when the receptionist told me to pick a color, she directed me to the wall and not anything else, so I'm not sure...

With the powder dip, my nails were dipped into the same jar the color came in.  If you don't know what this is, I am probably confusing you right now.  But basically a solution is painted on your nails, and then your nails are dipped into a jar of colored powder.  I am not sure how sanitary it is to have everyone that gets this technique done to continue to dip their nails into the same jar.  It seems to me it would be better to pour a little bit of the powder into a separate bowl and disregard the unused portion, so as not to cross contaminate.  I know this would waste some product, but seems more sanitary.  But again, I have never had this done before, and am not exactly up-to-date on my study of how hand germs spread, so take it for what its worth.

SO, OVERALL - I will be going back, and that says something since I have about 10 nail salons closer to me in the Myers Park neighborhood, and have to drive about 10 minutes to get here!"
4,"I was already headed to Baiz Market to go to Al Hana for lunch, was craving a shawarma sandwich.  Wanted something out side of the normal lunch foods other coworkers were coming in with.  Since I still have some time before I could clock off for lunch I looked up Al Hana on Yelp and boy was I happy I did! I already knew that Al Hana is just a corner in the Baiz Market and that the sitting area was small but great food comes out of that little corner! Yes the menu is on the wall and kinda lacking in details, but the cashier behind the counter is very helpful in explaining what the items are.
I normally get the falafel sandwich, but I had read many reviews who all stated that the cheese pie was worth a try and once I saw it was only $1.99 I thought why not! 
I had talked my coworker into giving it a try, so I had placed our order, 2 chicken shawarmas, priced at $3.99 a piece and 2 of the cheese pies, 2 meals under 15 bucks!   
While waiting for the food to be ready, I walked to the back of the market and got a tray of deserts to share with the office.  Man I cannot get enough of them little treats! The phyllo dough, crushed nuts and honey!! Oh that is heaven! 
Picked up my order and headed back to work.   The chicken shawarma was very delish! Chicken, tomatoes, onions, Arabic pickles and creamy garlic sauce wrapped in a fresh pita! Let me tell you I can eat pitas with just the garlic sauce, it is soo good!
The cheese pies, which is more like a pita with cheese was fabulous! It's just bread, but that doesn't quite describe it correctly, with cheese melted on top, so simple but yet so dang good!  My coworker even was happy with his lunch and it was his 1st time, he dug the garlic sauce too!  One day I will try the other items they offer. Look forward to going back."
4,"Two coworkers and I met for brunch here as a last minute decision. One of the girls (who was coming with her baby) literally lived right around the corner and our plan was to head to Great Northern after so we decided to check this place out and boy were we glad we did! 

Doesn't look like much on the outside, but he place is adorable. It has a bunch of tables with waiter service and then has some couches with a double fireplace where you can catch up with friends and just have coffee if you're not looking for anything sit-down. The decor is super cute, too. Very coffee-shop-esque. 

For being a Wednesday morning, there were definitely a lot of tables full of people. We started off with some coffee, which was good. The breakfast menu is pretty big!! It was so hard to decide what to get, but I settled on a breakfast bake that had artichokes, tomatoes, spinach, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and cheese. It was delicious! It was baked in a ramekin so it stayed steaming hot during my entire meal which was nice. I got a biscuit instead of the toast. The biscuit was ok, a bit dry and could have used some more salt. My friends enjoyed their meals, as well.

The waitress was super friendly and came by often to refill coffee or make sure we didn't need anything else. Another employee (manager?) kept coming by as well, which was nice in the beginning but began to get pretty annoying. She kept interrupting conversation to talk to us about the baby or her childbirth experience.... we do NOT want to hear that during our meal. And like I said, while it was fine the first few times, the number of times she came over was just a bit much.

Overall, the food was great, the prices were very reasonable (9 dollars for my meal? I can def do that... she didn't charge us for any of our coffee which was nice), and the service was good. I will def come back here. 

PS for those who live nearby, they have a drive thru if you prefer to grab your coffee and go!"
4,Love this place. Close to home and I get what I want and how much. Way too many choices of yogurt and toppings. I am just a simple guy and get vanilla every time. ;)
4,"Great menu and service. Food is good and not just your typical bar food. Love, love, love the patio!"
4,"A really nice breakfast place that's out of the way. It's perfect for a breakfast date with your significant other. The service was fast. Definitely get there by 9am on Sunday, because it gets pretty busy. I definitely recommend going there whether it's for brunch with your girlfriends, your family or with your significant other."
4,"I've been to Al Hana many times now but never checked in before today (glad I remembered this time!). Al Hana is part of Baiz market, a supermarket catered for the Middle Eastern community mostly. I ordered their chicken shawarma today. Since I got there at 2:30pm starving with still, no breakfast I decided to order 2 sandwiches. Umm that was a little too much! Their sandwich is quite big and filling. To me, the sandwich was very good, not excellent though coz it lacked more seasoning. I have a good reason to say that. I've not only tried many chicken shawarmas in Dubai and Lebanon before but because I also tried their chicken shawarma before and for some reason it tasted better. Overall it felt kinda bland and a little on the oily side. This said however, I would still order it again next time, maybe asking for extra garlic paste and a little more salt on my sandwich! And definitely ordering just one!
Al Hana besides serving shawarma, have many more Middle Eastern dishes on their menu, some of which I tried before such as the grilled chicken with rice and their hummus, their spinach pies too. From everything I've tasted so far, I think their grilled chicken dish would be my number one. Well seasoned and a huge portion for the price, it makes you feel gooooood!
They also have manakish, fresh bread, knefe and so much more. Be sure to try some of their dishes, I'm sure at least one would make you come back for more!"
4,"Order: Banana Chocolate Ice-cream
Size: Regular
Verdict: It was good. The texture was smoothe and creamy. The portion was huge. I had it in a sugar cone and I swear to god, the scoop was deceivingly big and it seemed to fill the whole cone with ice cream, which was impressive. ($4.10)"
4,"After posting a couple of poor reviews, my emails were finally ""dug out of the spam folder"" and this issue was addressed promptly and professionally.  Aside from the lack of response in those few weeks, it couldn't have been handled better."
4,"Great place to watch a game, multiple rooms, good staff.  They put a lot of money into the outdoor patio and added a parking lot. Nice to see owners who aren't cutting corners. Have only had one meal there but it was tasty."
4,"Now I know why, no matter what day of the week it is, there is a good crowd of people at/in this place. While it's one of our neighborhood joints, it took our good friends who live miles away raving about it for us to try it. I'm a gelato fan, and hubby likes good quality ice cream - but Yogurtology did not disappoint! The place is well lit, and spotless, which says a great deal when you are talking a self-serve frozen yogurt shop with several flavors of frozen yogurt, a bottom station where there are various choices to put in before the yogurt, and then a HUGE variety of toppings. You can imagine how messy all of that could get, but not here. Staff was cheery and friendly and not all stained up with the product (like other popular places that serve ice cream). There were 4 of us, and we all sampled a few different flavors each. My choice was the cupcake batter - YUM. Not too sweet and a great base for my topping choices of strawberries, bobas (little gelatin-like balls of flavor), raspberry sauce and Oreo cookie crumbles. The only thing I was disappointed with was the foundation oatmeal creme filled cookie, which was so hard it nearly broke my spoon. I thought it got hard from the frozen yogurt, so waited a few minutes to try it, but it was still really hard, so I tossed it. Hubby had salted caramel, cupcake batter, and red velvet cake, no toppings. Very good combo, salted caramel was a little too sweet for me. My girlfriend had pomegranate, which was very good and reminded me of an Italian ice. It was very refreshing. 

I'm sure we will be back! With or without our friends.    

Watch those toppings, as they definitely add weight, and you are paying per oz."
4,Great flavors and they are open on Sunday despite what it says. I love the tart flavors and they had three. I love the cookie on the bottom concept. Even though I didn't indulge...it looked yum. I will definitely go back.
4,Good food and inexpensive.  The market is worth walking through while you wait.
4,No complaints whatsoever for my first visit here. I wear acrylic nails and am extremely particular about the shape and like them to look natural. The technicians were extremely friendly and listened when I suggested a change instead of getting angry/irritated. The owner is very personable and assured me that my preference was their priority. I imagine that it can't be perfect every time but it was pretty close. The only negative is the parking...very questionable if its during a busy time.
4,"Went to rivals with the wife for lunch today. Cool little place. Plenty of TVs inside and plenty, PLENTY of beer both on tap and in cans/bottles. A pretty good selective menu as well. My wife loves wings, so anywhere we go she will judge a place by their wings and how they're prepared. Myself? I'm judging you by your burgers and man the rival burger was pretty good. Half pound burger with coleslaw (which I usually hate) 2 ale battered onion rings with a fried egg. Man it was amazing. I've tried my best to keep away burgers with eggs on them but man, the flavor of an egg on top is actually amazing. My only gripe with the burger is that the onion rings retained too much of the oil they were fried in. Yes, yes it's greasy bar food but man the onion rings, although very tasty, were a little too greasy. As far as their selection of beers (which seems almost endless, with a few Brews made in-house) I ordered  wild Ohio's tea beer which I freaking Loved. Man, I'll definitely be going back"
4,In town for work and the hotel brought me here. Had the fried perch and it was good. The handcut fries and hushpuppies were even better. You can tell they care about the food they put out. Nice atmosphere also
4,"Tried this place out on a Sunday for their brunch.  I loved the variety of food offered, and the quality exceeded my expectations.  The staff was very accommodating (I had a baby in tow), offering to carry my diaper bag to table and holding the doors for me as I left.  The only thing keeping this from a 5, is the wait was longer than I would tolerate which is a result from a high demand for tables that they just don't have.  Hopefully, this is just a growing pain. Nonetheless, I will be back and recommend this to anyone entertaining the idea of trying out."
4,"very delicious home made ice cream.  i regret grtting a kiddie cone.  deep down inside i wsnted two scoops hahaha...the remorse.  so i asled the gentleman, whats the best selling flavour? and of coarse its the one i was going to choose anyway.  burnt marshmellow yes...please.  i gave it a 4/5 only because ive been to many ice cream places in my time and when it comes to environment decor taste location etc overall its not the best in the city but i would most definately come around time and time again becsuse it was great."
4,"4 solid stars for great selection and delicious taste. 

I stopped by Ed's this afternoon for a delicious frozen treat. Ed's offers plenty of options in the fruit and nut category in ice cream and gelato, though not my first choice. I usually prefer the creams and chocolate variety, much to the displeasure of my physique. I did notice some decent options like sweet cream, dark chocolate and a hybrid of espresso, and I selected cinnamon with hot fudge. 

Though the cinnamon itself was amazing, the hot fudge instead of melting into my ice cream, solidified upon my scoop into globs of crunchy fudge. I do not enjoy. 

Having said that I would definitely return for a scoop, or 2 (hot fudge non grata)."
4,"I have heard that Ed's Real Scoop is THE place to go and in the summer the lineups for frozen treats can go around the block. Good for me that I went on a grey week day in spring. No lineup at all! When I saw that green pistachio I just had to have it. I had no idea at the time it was gelato, I just knew that it was the super rare flavour of my childhood and I wanted it.In a waffle cone of course!

Damn! This cost me around $6 and I attacked it all the way down to a park bench near the water.My only disappointment is, and I know this is going to sound ridiculous, this is more fancy-pants pistachio gelato than I wanted. They probably made their own authentic pistachio milk to create the real deal base but I wanted that fake flavour of my childhood. Food has gotten so artisanal!

This was good but it was so subtle. I like big and bold flavours and this really tasted mostly like vanilla ice cream with loads of pistachios in it. Poor choice on my part. There were many other flavours I could have chosen from that would have been great. Sadly I think the pistachio ice cream of my childhood is just no more.

Because the flavour was so subtle this was really like eating butter, so rich, especially for gelato! Super high quality ingredients, good customer service... I am sure my next scoop is going to be even better. ~ Suzie the Foodie

4,"Yum! Finally after having enjoyed the Biaz Market for several select items I stopped in the other day just to try the food at Al-Hana.

I ordered 2 fried kibbeh (deep fried football shaped Bulgar wheat crust stuffed with seasoned lamb/beef) and the chicken schwarma. I have to say that this is some of the best kibbeh I have had and the schwarma was quite tasty as well. 

I really need to go back soon to try other items they had. Plus I can not be without the Namoura or Zoolbia Bamieh they have in their bakery for long."
4,"We came across this place on yelp on a search for Mediterranean dinner. We ordered the chicken shawarma plate, Iraqi kabab, and grape leaves. Very flavorful and a lot of food! Each meal came with a side of rice and 2 breads, shawarma with a garlic sauce and pickles, tomatoes and lettuce and the Iraqi plate had hummus and onions, tomatoes and pickles. The employees were very polite and helpful with questions. There is a $10 minimum for card which the employee forgot to add the naan bread to our order so thankfully I had cash. Overall, we'd be back."
4,Just stumbled upon this place by chance. Wow! What a gem. very nice feel to the place. Very open and clean. Good quality food. I had a piece of home made pecan pie and it was excellent along with good coffee. Menu looked really good but didn't stay to eat more.
4,Love this place. Very nice staff. Lots of icecream selection - my favourite are matcha and lime coconut icecream! The lineup is worth it!!!
4,"This was my first visit to this establishment, and I was very impressed to say the least. They just opened their new bar/patio addition and it is really one of the nicest in the area, The bar is not on amain road, so the environment is really relaxing. They have yet to get their audio and video systems installed, but they were not missed on this beautiful Mother's day. We had a few appetizers and the avocado dip was fantastic. Great Martini bar as well as great selection of microbrews. I will be back to try one of their burgers, that were getting served to many of the customers around me. The bartender and servers seemed to approach their work with enjoyment."
4,"Al Hana has been given a bum rap because it is in what reportedly is a ""bad neighborhood"" There are no people wandering the streets. For all the times there, I've never seen a police car. The neighborhood is austere. It isn't ""bad"". If you park in their lot you will be isolated from the environs. 
They have some of the best cooked to your order Middle Eastern Food. On this visit I had a Chicken Shawarma Sandwich, which was very flavorful in and of itself, but it was enlivened with pickles
The market surrounding the restaurant also sells breads including Injera. If you walk around you will see that you can buy Teff, and meat, all the way in the back of the store. The prices are good, and you can get cuts you can't find anywhere else. Try it."
4,"My neighbor at the senior mobile home park has been telling me how good the Iowa Cafe is. I figure she should know since she's from Iowa. I'm from the Midwest with lots of Indiana roots so I grew up eating pork tenderloin and always eat a lot of it when I go back to the Midwest for visits so I had looked forward to coming to the Iowa Cafe for the same kind of food. 

My daughter and I tried to come here one night a couple weeks earlier after my grandson's Awards ceremony nearby. Yelp had them listed as being open until 7 p.m. but when we got there we saw signs on the door announcing their hours were now only until 1 p.m. (I notified Yelp and they have since corrected the hours). When Mother's Day rolled around and we wanted to have an early lunch together I suggested the Iowa Cafe again because it was near the church she attends. We were both very happy with our meal. She got an omelet breakfast and I got the pork tenderloin plate. Unfortunately we were both having tummy problems that morning, apparently unrelated from activities and foods the day before, so we were happy to find basic unspicy food available. 

The Pork Tenderloin was tender and they gave me a good portion for the price. The pork gravy was especially good. The mashed potatoes tasted homemade. I was very happy with the green beans which were prepared like an old fashioned green bean casserole using mushroom soup. I'm not sure I've ever been in a restaurant that serves them like this even though it's one of the easiest recipes you could make. The whole meal was down home and excellent. I was too full for dessert but couldn't resist the temptation of pecan pie on the menu so I ordered a piece to take home. It wasn't as good as my mother's. Few pies in restaurants and bakeries are. But I still enjoyed it. I wish they didn't close so early since I'm not a morning person but I do want to come back here someday when the opportunity presents itself. I saw other things on the menu I'm sure I would enjoy. 

The only thing that was lacking was the service which was surprisingly unenergetic considering it was Mother's Day. A surprising amount of time went by between when we were seated and when someone finally came by to take our order and it took quite a while for the food to come out also. Our waitress was cheerful at the end and finally wished us a happy Mother's Day which we heard waitresses wishing other people the whole time we were there. I had to share my water with my daughter when they didn't come back to refill hers. I just figured a down-home cafe would have friendlier more attentive service to lure people back. You would have thought they would have been crazy busy mid day on Mother's Day but the place was only half-full which made the lackluster service more surprising since they weren't overloaded with customers, at least not when we were there.

After writing this I started reading other reviews and see that service has been a problem for other customers also."
4,"Nice lunch spot, clean and spacious, and I always like a place with a cozy fireplace.  Had a decent but not huge selection on their lunch menu, including sandwiches, wraps, salads, as well as the daily lunch specials, which included a soup of the day, quesadilla of the day, and two quiches.  Also a number of specialty coffees.  You place your order at the counter, and the meal is brought out to your table.
Overall, a very satisfactory place for a workday lunch.  I wasn't there for breakfast, but the breakfast menu looked good, with choices listed including waffles, omelets, hot oatmeal, and eggs Benedict."
4,"Holy toppings! This place has it going on! This is the first fro-yo place I've been to that has ""bottoms"" which are different toppings that actually go in your cup before you dispense fro-yo.  I went with a simple brownie, salted caramel fro-yo & nutella topping, then on the other side of my cup (yes, I divide my cup in half) oatmeal cookie fro yo & peanut butter sauce. SO good! Those toppings really can hike up the price here since they can be so heavy, they had varieties I've never seen in other shops. Very cool place. Also, the oatmeal cookie fro-yo was probably one of the best flavors I've had!"
4,"Great food and usually great service. But Friday nights during winter visitor season they are understaffed. The ladies do as well as can be expected, but I've never seen owners or management here when things are hopping and they need help. We've been here for breakfast and it's busy then, too...people are going to start leaving if they have to wait too long."
4,"Lebanese food is one of my favorite cuisines.  Having heard about this combined market/restaurant, and seen it on Howard Seftel's list of top Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, I decided to check this place out.  I couldn't decide whether it sounded more like a Haji Baba or Cafe Istanbul type place.

Upon entering the facility, it became clear that this place is much more market than the aforementioned establishments.  It's basically a grocery store, with a little corner cordoned off for the restaurant.  There is no table service; you order at the counter.  The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pies (I may have to venture into this territory; it's something Cafe Istanbul and Haji Baba don't have), plates, and sandwiches.

I was disappointed to find that they don't have lamb tongue, and that they were out of soujouk and ma'anek.  I went with the lamb sandwich, which didn't have the lamb in kabab form like you would expect, but rather as a ground-up kafta type of consistency.

The sandwiches weren't huge, but I will say, that lamb was nicely flavored.  And my dining companion mentioned that the beef shawarma was pretty tasty as well.  The food really is pretty good.

Cafe Istanbul still has this place beat.  This is true when it comes to food, but even more so when it comes to ambiance.  But it's nice that there is a respectable place to get Middle Eastern food in downtown Phoenix."
4,"If it weren't for our uncle (from Iowa) wanting to try this place, we would likely never have come here.  The place has different Iowa college banners lining the entire inside which pleased our uncle.  He was nostalgic of the famous Iowa breaded pork tenderloin which happens to be their specialty along with their pies and cinnamon rolls.  Not a place to go if you are looking for healthy breakfast.  I was laughed at with ""it's Iowa food. You're not gonna find healthy haha.""  We ordered a cinnamon roll to share and it was very fresh and soft but the icing was too sweet.  Still haven't found one better than a Cinnabon.  The giant breaded pork tenderloin lived up to its reputation and more.  It was like a chicken fried steak but 10x better because it tasted like real meat.  You can taste the juicy pork under the ultra crispy breading.  The monstrosity was not complete without bacon gravy, home fries, toast, and eggs.  Some would call this a ""diabetes platter.""  We also ordered the corned beef hash which was equally gigantic with all the works.  It specified homemade corned beef and had a good flavor.  Really wish the beef was much bigger pieces. It was very grounded and not quite satisfying.  The blueberry pie was also good but not sure about the ""award-winning"" label.  Overall, this was a nice find with no wait on a weekend.  Good place to go once in a while if you feel like indulging and ignoring calories.  Also, service was quite slow."
4,"This review had an opportunity to not be very good, however in life things go wrong....it's what you do to correct a problem that tells me the most. 

We had friends/family in from out of town we had been running around all day and we're looking forward to a relaxing evening at home with our guests. We ordered a couple of pizzas and were told delivery would take about 40 minutes...an hour later no pizza. I called only to find that the pizzas had been sitting in the hot box for some time and they were experiencing some staffing issues. I spoke with Michelle, new manager, she made new pizzas and had them prioritized for delivery. I was a little short with her on the phone, let's face it there are less expensive pizza options....just not as authentic and tasty.  

The freshly made pizza arrived 35 minutes later, hot and delicious. The driver told me the charges to my card had been voided. While this could have been a bad experience, Michelle did the right thing. Btw, the pizza was amazing."
4,One of the best ice cream places in the city! I know that in the fall the have pumpkin ice cream which I'm looking forward to. I had coconut and sweetcream and I didn't want it to end!
4,"Pizza is very doughy and lots of sauce. My kids and I liked it, but my wife didn't much care for it, so we probably won't go as a family very often. Nice environment and great service!"
4,Great place and the patio they added is amazing for the space. The Neptune (fried fish) was very good.  Salad was fresh and service is always attentive.  Recommend the place.
4,"This restaurant is inside the Baiz Market!  So, don't waste your time trying to GPS it- just GPS Baiz market!

Secondly, ambiance or quick service are probably not the reasons you'd come to eat inside an outdated restaurant on styrofoam plates.

The food, however, is pretty tasty.  They have a wide variety of items typical to Middle Eastern cuisine: shawarmas, falafel, kebabs, pies, and more.  They heat items up in an open oven and the food comes out very fresh and hot!

I tried the cheese pie and shawarma.  Both items were very good.  I still got onions when I asked for them to be excluded.  I suggest skipping their small beverage options in the adjacent cooler and going to the selection on the south side of the store for a better deal and variety.

All in all, it is definitely worth trying out, especially if you are going to Baiz Market anyway!"
4,"Still haven't eaten the food here but I wanted to give their mocha another try since I didn't want Starbucks or Dunkin.

I got a iced caffe mocha & it was really good this time! It was also even cheaper than the last time. I guess the prices depends on who's doing the coffee. 

This place has been redeemed, totally coming back here again to get my coffee fix."
4,"As a newcomer to Charlotte, this was my first try at a nail salon.  Tiptoe Nail is modern and clean. Courteous staff.  Opted for Tiptoe pedicure which was relaxing and reasonably priced."
4,"This is my go to yogurt place. There are tons of yogurt shops nearby, but they do not compare to yogurtology.

Why do I like it? First, they have the boon highchairs which I have at home. I can just roll my baby down the line and fill up my cup with yogurt treats. It saves me from having to carry her, plus they are great high chairs. 

I also love how they have bottoms. What is a bottom? This goes before the yogurt. It creates the foundation for your yogurt experience.

The flavors are great and unique. I can't decide which one I like best. If you are stuck, ask the yogurt girls for a sample. It will point you in the right direction.

Finally the toppings are some of the best. They have so many unique ones. I love the pink boba- they just explode. Its great. 

Also I forgot to mention they have cones. My dad is old school and hates any place with out a cone, so he is happy going here."
4,"Have been going here for years, both the old location and now the new. The new is much more open and airy. Sometimes busy, but food is consistent and always good. Love their fried potatoes and omelettes."
4,"What a scrumptious place to come enjoy a cool treat from the heat! There is a variety of candies, cookies and fruits to choose from. The oatmeal cookie and the sour apple were particularly yummy. I definitely will be returning!"
4,Definitely one of my favorite yogurt stops. I love how the flavors are constantly changing! The stations are very clean and the staff is always helpful.
4,"I was looking for a licensed massage therapist in my area. I'm an active senior involved in cycling, pickleball, and kayaking. I like to have regular massages to relieve some aches and pains from my activities when they crop up.  A friend recommended Auden Leyva LMT at the AZ Spine Disc and Sport. It was very easy to get an appointment with him. Auden is a very pleasant and professional therapist. He pays attention to my concerns and has very good techniques. His suggestions have been helpful as well. I would highly recommend him. Even though the front line staff is often very busy with calls, scheduling and patients arriving, everyone is pleasant and waiting times are very minimal. I always look forward to my next massage. Prices are very reasonable and worth it!"
4,"Froyo makes me happy. I haven't been to many places, so I can't really compare Yogurtology to the other local spots. As most reviewers have said, this place is clean. They are always out with the mini vacuum sucking up the spilled toppings. We've been here a few times. Both when the place was empty and when crowded. But it seems to move quickly and there's never a long wait. I usually choose the sweet yogurts because the selections sound so good, but every time I realize that I do like the tart flavors better. There is always a No Sugar Added selection, which is a plus. The raspberry is awesome! The toppings bar has a great selection. I even witnessed another customer ask for something that was not out, and the employee went into the back room and brought out a cup of the topping for her. I especially like the MAYO!  The staff has always been friendly, greeting guests as they walk in and offering samples if desired. It can be a little pricey, compared to other shops I've seen, but for the convenience, quality, and once-in-a-while treat, it's well worth it."
4,"Im originally from Chicago area (W suburbs). Ordered the thin crust last night. Have to admit it did remind me of home cooked Chicago Pizza. Very good pizza. Great flavor good ingredients and not skimpy on toppings... I have to try the deep dish pizza now..

Congrats on your Openning. Great Pizza..

Pricey but worth the price. $$$"
4,"This place was really nice surprise. The menu looks good -- the apps we had were tasty -- and the brew list is quite long. As a fan of nerdy electronic trivia, I wish this place was a lot closer to me."
4,"If it's warm in The Beaches you'll find locals queuing up at Ed's Real Scoop. The ice cream's made in house and you can taste the dedication in every bite!

Take scoops of wildly delicious flavors like chocolate banana and French mint out to a seat on the bench in front of the shop to enjoy. But make sure to get there before closing time. I personally watched more than a few folks turned away because they'd shown up too late."
4,Friendly staff. Pizza was delicious! It smelled and tastes great! The crust's edge was crispy while the rest of the thin crust pizza was positively soft. Food was fresh. The Pizza Fritz was also fresh and tasted great with and without the chocolate sauce.
4,"Stopped in on a Monday morning w my parents. The place is nice inside, pretty typical for a modern coffee shop - comfy seats made for chillin, local art on the walls, double fireplace. Good for the college kids. 
We had breakfast, starting with a ghiradelli hot chocolate w whipped cream and I asked for mint. It came out fairly quickly, wasn't too hot, ready to drink right away, and was okay - coulda been richer. 
My parents got the French toast w bourbon peaches and I got the sweet and savory w chocolate chip pancakes. The food took a pretty long time to make considering it was empty and breakfast food, but it was solid. Nothing special, but well made. Prices were pretty low, so I'm going for a 4, though it's more of a 3.5"
4,I love the variety and large sweets they provide ... Just took fro yo to the next level... Check! They add a few extras to the normal frozen yogurt routine which always gets people's attention!
4,"Solid coffee shop.  Reasonable prices.  Friendly staff.  Daily specials.  Plenty of seating and free wi-fi.  I actually think this place would be more popular if it were smaller (it sounds strange to say that), because it feels a little bit too open to me.  Kind of a mix between a Panera and a Starbucks.  Absolutely worth a visit.  

When I was there, they brought around samples of some delicious gluten-free cookies.  What a bonus!"
4,"This place is so cute! My friend and I went there for brunch. We got the breakfast bakers, which were pretty good. I also got a caramel frappe, which I loved (although, it took a while to make). It took quite some time to get seated because the hostess skipped over our name, but she apologized profusely. Our server, Elissa, was spectacular, but it took a long time to get refills on water. That was my only complaint."
4,"Tried this tonight and just about everything was excellent.  SO many toppings (even half candy bars), great flavor selection, and amazing Tart flavor (always my favorite).  The only things I count off for is that they're quite a bit more expensive per ounce than all the other places I frequent and I like it when yogurt shops carry more non-fat, but it's nice that they do offer low-fat here.  I like the idea of the rewards card also (buy 8, get one free), although, again the higher price might make my visits few and far between."
4,"I came in for some gelato and it's the best gelato I've had since coming back from Italy last year.  

Amarena Cherry and stracciatella filled my cup and it was honestly great memories of hot days in Italy.

There were so many people walking around with ice cream the night we were here and it was a great choice to go to."
4,"I'm currently on day 9 of my 'two week' gel manicure.  I'm quite pleased.  I got a manicure in prep for my trip to Cancun.  These nails lasted thru a week of sun and sand and more importantly copious water immersion.  The shop was clean and the folks polite.  I will be coming here in the future.  My only gripe, the reason I didn't give them five stars,  i was not offered a beverage of any kind.  I noticed the two girls who came in after me where immediately offered wine etc.  Not cool TipToe."
4,"Great food friendly service, they deliver
Large selection of chicago food. Appetizer options are amazing.."
4,"Great bar to watch a game, especially if you are a Steelers fan like me.  Friendly atmosphere and people are respectful.  Nick, the owner, is a warm and welcoming guy.  This bar doesn't look like much outside but the inside is very nice not to mention spacious.  Large outdoor patio with a TV.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with bourbon bbq sauce and it was very good.  Skin-on french fries loved the malt vinegar bath I gave them.  Cool spot."
4,"Very tasty food. Great grocery store for Mideast products. I have British Lebanese parents, grew up eating all the different styles of this food, one being a bit different than the other. I like this place.This is worth trying..Cheers"
4,"Three words - Chili Tanzanian Chocolate.


Also, as a tip, bring a banana with you if you want a banana split! They don't sell them, but will make them for you."
4,"So, I'm not usually a sports bar person, however, this place makes me appreciate the concept. 

Rivals is off of Smith Road in Middleburg Heights, and looks quite small from the outside...

It's not. 

The place is very large and has a patio outside that's massive. And for a big place, with lots of food and drink choices, I have to say, it's prices are really good, the staff is nice, and the food is REALLY great. It's not the typical bar food; wraps and sandwiches of exotic bent, salads, burgers and appetizers designed to make the tasebuds dance, the place is a real treat. 

The only thing is I think they need to get rid of, say, about ten or twelve hundred yards of the neighborhood to accommodate the local parking,because for a place this popular, the lot is a bit snug, but that just means that if you want their great food, you'll just have to get there EARLY. 

I give this a solid rating; if you want to have a nice date night, an evening out with friends in a casual atmosphere, and mostly if you just want feed the need for tastiness indeed, this spot is a good one to discover. 

In my mind, this place has no rivals, but don't take my word for it, decide for yourself;)"
4,"Don't let the name fool you, this is so much more than a coffee house! This gem is a fantastic restaurant,  that also has a coffee house section. The menu is diverse, with breakfast, sandwiches, wraps, through dinner entrées including a braised short rib dinner. Again, not coffee house selections by any stretch of the imagination.  There were 4 of us dining this evening, and we all had something different, so we got a nice cross section of samples. All of the food was excellent! I had the bbq ribs with the Dr. Pepper  bbq sauce, and they were great.  Tasty, and fall of the bone tender. My wife had chicken parm, which was juicy and very flavorful. My friend had the Pork chop dinner, with an apricot chutney served with risotto. The chop was juicy, and the risotto was perfect, which is rare for most restaurants.  The side dishes were perfect, i had green beans almondine, and they were prepared perfect. Not just green beans with almonds on them, but actually prepared like a fine dining restaurant would with toasted almonds and sautéed beans. I was impressed. This was my first visit, but our friends have been there several times and have raved about the food each time. The atmosphere is simple and un-assuming, very casual, and family friendly.  Because of the high quality of the food, I consider this place an excellent value. (Braised short rib dinner for under  $18!)  Everything is homemade, and fresh, and you can really taste the difference. Oh, the deserts were equally as good! Did I  mention that they serve coffee there also..........

Its great to be able to patronize an independent small business, that offers great food at a good value. Please support these types of businesses."
4,"The breakfast choices are fantastic and full of variety. They have a rewards system that actually is rewarding. The service there can sometime be a little inconsistent, but I keep coming back for the food. I'm glad I do, because each time I come the service gets better and better. Another thing I like is when you're near finishing your meal you can ask for a refill of you coffee to go, which they will gladly do at no extra charge."
4,"I went with a few friends and we split a few dishes, so I got to try a good amount of stuff.  Here goes:

beef shawarma - Very, very good.  Only about $4, so it was tasty and well priced.

flafel sandwich - Also good.  Falafel is incredibly hard to make well, and there's is pretty damn good.  Not the best I've ever had (that was at a street market in Amsterdam), but it was still much better than most.

baba ganoush - like falafel, this is also very difficult to get right.  Any idiot can make a decent hummus, but baba is tough.  Theirs has excellent flavor, but it was served too cold.  I like it to be a bit chilled, slightly below room temp, but this was straight-up cold.  I don't know if they always do it this way, but this was my experience.

meat pie - this was okay, nothing too special.  It was pretty cheap, so I guess I can't complain too much.  

Oh, the garlic sauce was frickin' amazing.  An absolute must have!

other notes:  since it's a market, you're better off buying your drink in the market side.  1 bottle of water from the cooler next to the food register was $1.50, but a package of 24 bottles of water from the market was ~$5.  You decide."
4,"I've been here twice now, both on killer hot days and Ed's IceCream really hit the spot. First time I had the coconut key lime ice cream which was fabulous, maybe wished it was a little more limey (but I am a lime-a-holic so  may just be a little bias). Last night I had the pistachio and cherry gelato, they were both fabulous. When I go back I will definately be getting the pistachio, it had little chunks in it and was not too sweet highlighting the nutty flavour. 
They have a lot of different varieties you won't find at a normal ice cream shop, it's a great option for these hot summer days!!"
4,"My first time trying Ed's was great! Its a small shop so it was a bit crowded when I was there but the ladies behind the counter moved quickly and efficiently. Sizes are kids,regular and large but no matter what size you choose you can have 2 different flavors. I went with the raspberry and mango gelato in a waffle cone. My waffle cone didn't taste super fresh but I love that they put a marshmallow in the bottom so your ice cream/gelato doesn't run down and out of the cone as it melts. Definitely recommend and would like to try more flavors."
4,"Another The Beach/The Beaches local haunt, Ed's Real Scoop is a hot weather favourite. The ice cream and gelato is made in house and with over 80 flavours (many of them seasonal), there's something for everyone. 

My fave is Caramel Nut Bark (vanilla ice cream with chunks of caramel nut bark and a caramel ribbon) but unfortunately quite rare. I snap up several pints when it's there. Another fave though unfortunately seasonal is the Strawberry Shortcake. Story is a whole strawberry cheesecake from a local bakery is dropped into the ice cream maker. For gelato, Pistachio is a worthy stand-by but be wary of the Mexican Hot Chocolate as it's really spicy! 

If you're in the area, drop by but be prepared for a line filled with teens, kids, families and lots of dogs. They all know good ice cream when they taste it."
4,"I'm all about trying new nail places, so we picked this place late on a Sunday when all other salons were closing. It's a little far from my house, but it was a nice experience. They have a nice waiting area with comfy couches and have wine and soft drinks complimentary. They got us in last minute for pedis and manis. The massage during my pedicure was out of this world! (Let's be honest, that's everyone's favorite part.) It lasted forever and was great pressure. The polish lasted for a while, but unfortunately I dented it the same night I got them done but didn't want to drive all the way over to Plaza to get it fixed. If I'm in the area, I would come back here again!"
4,"Always busy, Yugortology is a great after dinner destination. Like most self-serve yogurt business, you start by filling a bowl with frozen yogurt. You can sample the flavors. Then load it up with toppings. I may be mistaken but this is the only frozen yogurt business that offers the option of ""bottomings"" by putting cookie or other sweets at the bottom of the cup."
4,"Tip and tricks, that is the key.

I love pita and hummus, And the do offer this at Al-hana, however do not forget where you are, AT A GROCERY STORE. for .99 you can get a bag (5 or6) fresh still warm large pitas. Then for ~1.50 you can buy a can of hummus.  so for less than $3 you can have a huge amount of this to have with your meal.

As always I opt for the falafel sandwich which at 2.99 is a great deal but a bit small alone.

They do have hot sauce I found, but it is just franks red hot sauce, and it overwhelms the flavors of your food.

Try a Thyme (zatar) pie. for .99 it packs a huge flavor punch.

I recommend brining a bottle of water as there is no fountain for drinks here."
4,"I love breakfast and I love discovering new places so I was shocked when my sister was the one who found my #1 brunch spot in the Cleveland area. Every time I have been here the food was fantastic and I'll come up with any excuse to go. I've convinced many friends, family, and tinder dates to even go with me here. I go for their breakfast buffet on Sunday and it is worth every penny. The last time I went in I wasn't feeling too well and couldn't eat much of the buffet and my server only charged me for a kids meal. She was such a sweetheart. The layout of the place is nice. Even when it's busy it never feels too crowded. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is the customer service has always been very slow no matter how busy it had been. It was too long to be seated, taken care of, given our check, etc. Fortunately, most times I go there I plan on staying for long hours. It's a comfortable atmosphere and I love watching the planes fly by from the airport :)"
4,"shop is amazing, but the asian dude that works there needs a little more training in cs. i know there were a bunch of customers in there, but just saying hello and giving me a drip tip cover and not explaining what to do is not cool at all. thankfully the other guy, can't remember his name was really helpful, sat with me and gave suggestions and helped me the whole time changed my first impression around."
4,"As most reviewers have already pointed out, Al Hana, located in the Baiz Market, is not in the best of neighborhoods but the food, the prices and service with a smile will have you coming back for more. We ordered tabouli, hummus, shisk taook a falafel plate and 2 bottles of water (sorry, no cocktails here). The bill came in at just under $28 and we paid at the counter. Our food was quickly prepared and was ready in less than ten minutes. Everything was delicious and the portions were generous. The baklawa is actually to the rear of the store at a separate counter and there are many varieties to choose from. We will absolutely come back not only for the food but also for the vast selection of middle eastern and international foods sold at Baiz Market. After our meal, we spent another half hour in the store picking up various items to stock our pantry. All meats sold at Baiz are Zabiha and Halal."
4,"I finally made my way to the market and Al-Hana yesterday for a lunchtime feast. I ordered WAY too much for myself and 2 co-workers but everything was just as I remember from my childhood (of eating things most other kids wouldn't). I thought the dolmas in particular had a great consistency, density and flavor. my boss loved the meat and cheese pies, the hummus was nice, not too thick like pre-made hummus, and the babaghannouj was blended to perfection. I spent $27 on what turned out to be 5+ meals. 

YUM! Al-Hana I adore you!"
4,If you're looking for a local cozy place to grab some breakfast or coffee this is a great choice. I love the fireplace and kids books available. I go here often with my young kids and a friend. The service is a little slow so I have to keep that in mind when we go there. My kids love all of the breakfast options and I enjoy the warm drinks and variety of food. Be sure to ask your server about the daily specials and find out what bakery item is recommended.
4,"First time here, appeared to be overwhelmingly busy. Once inside it was busy, but very well staffed, service from door to seat to order to table,very timely. The server we had was very knowledgeable about the menu and very honest. I got the wet Cajun traditional wings they were definitely close to the best I've had,and meaty. Everyone else with me for the Lake Monster, looked very appealing.  The census on the Lake Monster ate mixed.
Overall a wonderful experience."
4,"Ed's Real Scoop is the real deal!  Just one visit and I'm already hooked.  Pumping out that sweet, freshly made waffle aroma toward the street was a cheap trick, and it worked.

The gelato was creamy and smooth, like a good gelato should be.  The pistachio gelato had a nice natural pistachio green and tasted like the real thing.  By far, the best pistachio gelato in town!  

I highly recommend the raspberry and lemon combo.  What a delicious combination!  Refreshing and perfect flavors for the summer.

On my next visit to Ed's, I'm planning to throw in a cooler in the back of the car and bring some of the goodness home with me."
4,We stop in here at least twice a week... More during the summer. Flavors are always changing which keeps the choices interesting. A little pricey and lately their system has been down so the loyalty program is not working... Somewhat annoying.
4,Great customer service. Just not a big fan of the product because I was burning a lot of my coils up fast.
4,"I admit it. I was nervous. This is outside of my comfort zone. But I bought the I Heart Radio deal and I'm so glad I did. 

Dad and I went on a Saturday around 7pm. Sat at a table in the middle, would have preferred a booth but that's ok. 

Waiter, Bryan, was great. Friendly, but busy. 

Beer was awesome, they brew their own!

Food was good! Dad had a steak, he cleared his plate. I had the philly cheeseteak...and if I'm honest, I've been thinking about how I want it again!

The people who frequent here what you'd expect for the area and this type of bar and grill. That's my only complaint, I just don't love that area of town, or the drunk townies who smell like bonfires. But yeah I know that's what I get. I dealt with it and I will again for that Philly Cheesesteak and beer. 

Try it out!"
4,"Amazing food with a unique bar layout! The patio is nice on summer evenings and the crowd is pleasant. Service isn't always the friendliest, but the food quality forgives this. Personally my favorite bar. I believe they have the best wings on the west side."
4,"Rivals is a great neighborhood bar. Large selection of tap beer & a great selection of sandwiches & picking food! What I love at Rivals is the fried bologna sandwich! Its cut a little thicker, so you get the full flavor from the grille in every bite! Great place for a group of friends to hang out reasonably!"
4,Great food and even better service.  They have the formula to success.  Mondays are great with craft beer specials.
4,"Great customer service
Cheese pie was so good ate with hummus
And don't forget the salad so good I didn't share"
4,"I feel pretty, oh so pretty! Great place to relax, always accommodating and they do a great dip. It's the extra work that will cost you but it's always worth it!"
4,"This is an interesting little place. Great coffee, fabulous food, and friendly staff. Very unassuming. It's like a breakfast nook and a coffee house had a baby that was perkcup.  Cozy fire in the winter makes for a nice atmosphere.  Dee is my favorite waitress. Please make / sell more jazzy Java. Order the 'sweet and savory' and drown it in syrup. 

Keep up the good work guys!"
4,"We went for Sunday brunch, everyone ordered the buffet. They had an omelet station, pierogies, chicken paprikash and all the regular stuff. 

Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Coffee was good. 

We will come back!"
4,"Thanks to a recent post on the ""Downtown Phoenix Journal"" blog by Justin Lee regarding cheap eats (11/4), I decided to give this place a try as I pretty much agreed with his other choices.

As I've previously been told many times, 'don't you ever get tired of hummus?', and apparently the answer is 'no'. Even though I had leftover hummus from Switch from the night before, I was not to be deterred from trying a new source relatively close to home (especially since Pita Jungle doesn't seem to want to open up in my lifetime, although the rumor is any day now). 

Sure enough at lunchtime, the place was not too crowded, but did do a solid and steady business. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful and nice when asking for suggestions. Her's was the chicken shawarma, so off we went!  Of course, the crux of the story was to also get some hummus, which she mentioned didn't come with the sandwich, so I'd have to order separately. No prob, mate, its all good, so of course, let's get a small side.

My number gets called and the shawarma comes out more like a wrap, and the 'small' hummus was the size of a 12"" dixie plate - fantastic!!

Net/net - the sandwich was solid and hummus was great.

The kicker is that its inside the grocery, so you get to do a little shopping for middle eastern coffee, turkish delights, cookies, etc., as a side benefit."
4,"En route to brunch on this very rainy day, our vision was obstructed by our huge umbrella, but the sweet smells wafting out of Ed's was enough to make us double back to find out just where it was coming from. That was when the piles of vibrant gelato we found at the store window first made an impression that we couldn't shake throughout our meal. 

As soon as we finished brunch, we hurried back over to Ed's and indulged in some seriously tasty treats. The pineapple yogourt ice cream I got had a perfect balance of fruit and creamy yogourt. My friend's more daring choice of ""red hot chilli cocoa"" proved to be an interesting first experience for spicy and cold.

We both found the waffle cones a little too crunchy (we didn't know that this was possible either!), but the delicious ice cream is definitely enough to make us want to come back again and again. I can't wait!"
4,"Awesome locally owned mom-and-pop type diner.  My wife and I went there for breakfast last night (breakfast served all day!).  I got the pancakes, my wife got the biscuits and gravy.  We were both very happy with the food, the portions, and the price.  The service was a little slow, but we also came during the dinner rush (which, with the number of retired folks in the area, is pretty early).  I'll be back, no question."
4,"We were referred here by a friend who likes deep dish pizza, like us. It was a Wednesday so we figured we'd get a large and have left overs for the next day.
Very nice people, very clean place and smelled great!
We ordered the Italian sub and the large Mojo deep dish pizza. Total bill was $33.00, yikes!  We got everything home within 10 min but by then both were a bit soggy. Sandwich was good but way too much Italian dressing. The meats were good except for the thick slice of ham. Very little lettuce but it was soggy. The bread was a little tough but good.
The pizza crust was unassuming but good. I like a crust that doesn't overpower the toppings but I think maybe they kneeded it too much. It was really tough. We've been to Lou Molnattis in Chicago and that crust is tender and flaky. We loved the favor but because the crust was thin (yes we ordered the deep dish) we didn't really have left overs. The thin sauce was too runny and caused the bottom of the pizza to be soggy. The sausage was so thin I actually forgot we were supposed to be tasting it. Cheese? Not much.
I know I'm giving it 4 stars but that's because it really was good just soggy. We will go back and try it again but it's so expensive that it might be a while."
4,Little no frills cafe integrated with a small international market. Had the chicken shawarma which turned out to be excellent. Could be better with the addition of some side dishes but for those who want a small light inexpensive hot lunch this isn't a bad little gem.
4,First time here and the food was delicious!  I had the beef shawarma and my wife had the lamb kafta with a side of baba ganouj.
4,"Stopped in on a SUPER hot Sunday and was blown away by how wonderful this little gem was! It was very clean, the selection of ""bottomings"", yogurt flavors and toppings is the biggest that I have even seen! The pie crust bites were my favorite, and I wish that I had added more to my yogurt! The girl at the counter was kind of grouchy and didn't seem like she wanted to be there, otherwise this place would be five stars. We will definitely go back and hopefully someone else will be working."
4,"I went back here today with the same cowoker as last time.

This time things were a bit more user friendly. We were offered a full print menul to look at by the register, this listed everything and described it.

I went with the flafil, at 2.99 it is a bargain, and a ""cheese pie"" as the name just spoke to me.

The Flafil was decent, the flat bread is not my favorite but for 2.99 its a good filling meal.  

The cheese pie is best described as sauceless pizza, cheesy bread etc. It was good, the cheese was nicely melted and browned and the crust was good and chewy. at 1.99 is a great addition to any meal.

My coworker loves the fries for some reason. 

He also tried a mint yogurt drink. It may have been bad (but the date said it was good). Maybe that is just the taste, either way it tasted like bad milk wit a mint after taste."
4,Great home cooked food. Best tenderloin sandwich there is. Even better than my grandmas (but I didn't tell you that). And HUGE too. Nice owners/waiters and good prices.
4,"I'm conflicted about this review. My kids and I stopped in one day while riding bikes to have some quick lunch. It was my first visit and I had not heard or read anything about it. My wife mentioned it was somewhat new to the neighborhood and we like to support the local community.

My first impression was that the price was a bit steep compared to other pizza options in the area. But since I heard it was Chicago style, I figured the focus was on the quality. 

To my disappointment, the pizza tasted OK but it wasn't great. Not for the price. It was no better than Papa John's, certainly not as good as Barros, but 30-40% more expensive. Had the experience ended there I would have given them a one star review.

However, the owners (?) unexpectedly brought out some sort of bread w/chocolate and powdered sugar for my kids, at no cost. That made them feel very special, and ultimately what makes them happy, makes me happy. 

So, for going the extra mile by providing a happy and memorable dining experience for my kids, I would recommend them."
4,"To be fair I have only eaten breakfast here but have been back again and again and again.  The portions are large, the food is good and hearty and the 4 egg omelets are the best anywhere.  Fluffy, always cooked to perfection and delicious.  The other day I had the chicken friend steak for breakfast with eggs and gravy it too was wonderful.  The restaurant used to be in a different location.  They have recently moved to the Higley location and the place is spotless and with all new everything.  It is always busy or almost full but because the service is good people move in and out and we have never had a problem getting a table.  From my perspective this place is just an awesome breakfast stop, a place you can go every weekend.  The staff is friendly and nice, the owner is always around greeting people and being accessible.  Good work and thanks for being in Mesa where places like this one are few and far between."
4,"After dinner, my cousin suggested we check out Ed's Real Scoop. I'm always down for ice cream, especially when it's only a short walk away! 

We dropped in on a Sunday evening (around 8:30pm) and the place was packed! Line was out the door. The line doesn't move the quickest but they take your order all in one group and let you sample a few flavours.

The menu is up along the wall; 24 ice cream, 11 gelato, 4 yogurt and 4 sorbet flavours. Prices are super reasonable ($3.48 kiddie, $4.43 regular and $6.15 large). The best part is you get two flavours regardless of what size you order! Awesome.

There's ice cream sandwiches ($6.00) and dessert pies ($20.00) in the fridges. For cones, you have a choice between waffle ($1.33), plain and sugar. 

- Milkshake ($6.50 double) - M went with a strawberry s'more milkshake as he hasn't had one in ages. I tried a sip; decent.
- Creme brûlée and fresh mint ($4.43 regular) - the fresh mint was my favourite flavour out of them all. Creme brûlée was good but paled in comparison to the mint (with chocolate). Yum.
- Tahitian vanilla bean and s'more ($4.43 regular) - vanilla was creamy but it needed way more vanilla bean flavour. Too subtle. The s'more was much better.

The line tells it all. Good quality and reasonable prices. Apparently, I need to come back for their burnt marshmallow."
4,Best fried fish around!  Always great service with a clean atmosphere.  Patio has been a great addition and it has its own bar.
4,"They have bottomings! Haha. Toppings but items to put on the bottom. FIRST time I have ever seen this so its memorable. Bottoming's such as oreos, granola, oatmeal cream pies and other fun stuff to put on the bottom and THEN add the yummy yogurt and fun toppings! 

I was a little nervous because I had read all the reviews and the one thing everyone kept saying was they couldn't get their own samples and that when it's busy nobody is available to help. Maybe we came at a good time but we had no problem with this. Right when we walked in there was someone asking us if we wanted to sample anything. She was super friendly and not rushed, even though I do think she was alone. The place was full so again maybe we came after the rush.  

The yogurt was all good, sampled the mint and it was delicious! Tried the salted caramel and it was definitely caramel flavored, a bit sweet for me but I'd get a little dapple. 

Fresh fruit, chocolates, sauces, all only added to the sweetness of this yogurt trip!"
4,"FIRST, check out their website.  You will find that whoever put it all together understands the importance of providing a vibe and an image that differentiates Rivals from the competition.  You don't have to go far in Middleburgh or Parma to find a Sports Bar, but there are only a few who choose to take pride in their food - and when it comes to pub fare, Rivals Sports Grille is ironically in a league of their own..

Upon our arrival at Rivals, I surprisingly reveled in the atmostphere - TV's in every corner with a wood burning fireplace in plain view - I knew this was not your average Buffalo wing joint.   

The menu was cut and dried and exactly what we expected - this and that fried, burgers wings and fries, with a few daily specials.  Everything I tried was better than anticipated, with at least few items worth mentioning.

They offer 20+ wing sauces along with a few dry rubs.  I chose the 7 pepper rub and the Carribbean jerk rub, and both were outstanding.  The flavors were bold without being too salty, and the jerk seasoning offered a complex blend of heat, spice, sweetness without being overpowering.  The General Tso's sauce is something different, and the Raspberry BBQ has a subtle sweet and smoky flavor as if it were cooked in a smoker with cherry wood.  The dipping sauces are made from scratch, and the honey mustard was sublime.  The buffalo chicken wrap was crispy and well prepared, and the bacon they add is a nice touch.  The spinach artichoke dip featured gorganzola cheese, a change of pace from the dips you find elsewhere.  My only complaint would be that the fettuccine alfredo was a bit too rich and sticky, and the fries were on the greasy side.

Overall, you can tell this restaurant put a lot of thought and effort into their menu and image, which give this place a touch of class not often found at the neighborhood sports bar."
4,"I have mostly given up on brick and mortar vape  shops, but Puff is an acceptable option for those who need juice or hardware in a pinch. They offer discounts on all hardware on Fridays and the staff is always willing and helpful."
4,"Food was excellent.  Service was very sloooow, and place was empty with ample employees.   I saw other similar reviews, hopefully ownership can solve this."
4,"There isn't any other place I think I could eat an entire order of hummus by myself.... This is the Real deal. Yeah it's in a crappy neighborhood, and the food is served on styrofoam, in a market that could use a major overhaul, but who cares?! The food is SO good. 

I'm a vegetarian and have eaten at pretty much every middle eastern place in this city. This one unarguably has the best baba ganouj and hummus ever, as well as great tabbouleh. And that dessert with semolina on top of cheese? Heaven."
4,"Clean, friendly, solid menu & good food....nuff said!  We'll be back"
4,"After Yelp Office Hours on Tuesday (Thanks Again Gabi! :-), Mr. K, Brian S and I decided that we needed lunch...were to go?...were...to...go?

We were sort of in the neighborhood of Al-Hana, (OK, not really, but close enough) and it won out over some of the other suggestions...and I'm glad it did:)

We all like discovering new places and this little spot takes some discovering:)

If you don't know that it's inside Baiz market, you will never discover Al-Hana...and that would be a shame:)

Much like the cafe at Ranch Market (just up the street) this little cafe is a genuine delight embedded in this small grocery market (with, apparently, no end of interesting food items and sundries in its aisles:)

One of the more interesting things I noted, during our visit, was the sizable inventory of hookah's, under lock and key, in the front of the store:)

They must have 50 of these things in stock!

I'm not a hookah marketing expert, but if asked about inventory management of hookah's, I would have said ""hold on there, Earl, I think 3 or 4 hookah's in stock is plenty"" :-)

So, imagine my surprise and delight, when, during a one hour lunch, I saw 2 of these water pipes walk out the door, accompanied by all sorts of tobacco cans, and other paraphenalia:)

And, these hookah's aren't cheap...sticker price looks to be around $200 for the low end models (I really can't tell high end from low end, with hookah's...I'm just going with size as the differentiator:-)

What is cheap at Al-Hana/Baiz is lunch...cheap and delightful:)

I had Chicken Shawarma and fries (I know...intriguing combo:)...quite tasty:)

I got a chance to sample Brian's Hummus and Babaghannuj and I looked over the menu for future visits...because there will be future visits:)

The menu includes kabob's, whole roasted chickens, delightful little meat pies ($.69 each...wow!:), and whole host of middle eastern delights...and fries:)

And last, but not least, the staff at Al-Hana is so friendly, smiling and eager to please:)

It's a stark contrast to the places that think it's enough to just take your order and toss your food at you...the nice people that took care of me just didn't stop smiling the entire time I was there...and I didn't even have spinach in my teeth...this time:)

Half-way between Roosevelt and Van Buren on 20th St.

It's worth making the trip:)"
4,"Service was outstanding.  After my second drink the bartender already knew my name and my beverage of choice.  I was charged for 2 more beers than I thought I drank but I was in no shape to argue so no stars deducted for that.

Everyone was having a great time and the band was pretty good, although slightly off-key.  The place was packed.  They played a good mix of songs that everyone knew the words to.  Good involvement with the crowd with lots of people going up on stage to dance. 

Very entertaining!"
4,"I have mostly had good experiences here. The pizza dough is fresh, wings are great, and baklava is delicious! It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's definitely a good place to try."
4,"This place is great.  The sangria is realllly tasty, and the tapas are wonderful.  It's located right across the street from the Wynn, and at the end of the Fashion Show Mall.  Not a usual place for the typical Vegas visitor, but it's not hard to find.   The service here was great as well.  Would definitely come back here for some more tapas, a switch from the usual buffets and casino food courts :)"

You'll see the sun come shining through
For you.

Light up your face with gladness,
Hide every trace of sadness.
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying.
You'll find that life is still worthwhile-
If you just smile."
4,Great pizza. Extremely cheesy. Philly is pretty good too but not as good as portofinos philly. We usually get pizza from house of pizza and philly from portofinos.
4,"This place is awesome! Ice cream, tortas, tacos, burritos, flautas, even pan dulces bakery style that you can load up on and take to go. I ordered flautas ahogada (flautas drowned in chile sauce) but ordered to go so my sauce was on the side. I actually preferred it this way so I could enjoy the crunch of the flautas. So much flavor and freshness! Their salsa bar was great-really liked their red salsa and red chile sauce. 

Great food and customer service! Eating area is clean and there's a handwashing station next to the salsa bar. The cash register is modern and the menu is displayed on an LED screen. I don't think I've ever been to an authentic Mexican joint that is so updated. 

My only concern was the women's restroom. It was a small space with a diaper changing station, which is fine, but it was dirty! Toilet paper on the floor, pee on the toilet seat, and something on the floor that looked like what I hoped was dried salsa, but I'm pretty sure it was poop. I would suggest to the owners to put a purse hook in the women's restroom, since it is a narrow space, and also do more frequent bathroom checks to make sure the bathrooms match the cleanliness of the restaurant."
4,"The food is excellent, but the plates are incredible small! It was a challenge to eat off of a plate that was a quarter of the size of the utensils, but when good food is around I guess you can do anything. 

I have been to both the Chicago location and now the Vegas location and both have excellent food and sangria! I can't remember everything we ordered (uhh, we were in Vegas!), but I know I enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and the beef tenderloin and blue cheese. I also know I was very excited about the $1.99 dessert menu (the banana dessert and the chocolate truffle were good!). 

If you like tapas, this is a good place to go for a reasonably priced meal when you're in Vegas!"
4,"Omg! Went there and for eggplant parmigiana and veal parmigiana and they were very good! Loved the dinner salad with the house dressing and garlic bread.  The prices are great for the amount of food you get, plenty to take home. Can't wait to try pizza and subs next time! First time won't be the last!"
4,"My friends (3) and I (which makes 4) decided to go here for their 350+ item buffet. Of course, since it's Sunday, all of the local overweight ""Christian""/church going 'folks' attend after their weekly worship, so there was a brief 10-15 minute wait.

Decor: It's Asian-esk with their Asian shrines, ""KOI"" pond, etc. The place has enough seating and was fairly well-maintained. 

Food: The food wasn't actually bad for buffet. It was pretty good for it to be so many items. The seafood seemed fresh enough (there's no really fresh seafood in Charlotte being that I'm from the DMV - land of blue crabs). The hibachi station has several options to choose from and they make it for you right on the spot, which is amazing! The American items I did not try because who wants Asian-ized American food (I don't), so I mainly stuck to the seafood and hibachi. I had about 2-3 plates, which was more than enough. 

Service: It was pretty good, but they should ask if you're done with your plate especially if it's food still on it! I'm not too keen on wasting food. 

Overall: I would go back for lunch, when it's cheaper, but you can't beat that broad of a food menu @ that low of a price. 

Regards,

TrizzyO_o"
4,"Best buffett I have been to, bar none.

Huge place for big groups.

Now, not everything is awesome but with the Hibachi and Sushi bars, you can't go wrong.  I get those every time plus the fried dumplings and salt and pepper chicken.  The ice cream is good, too.  All for $8.22 at lunch as of the date of this review.  I always head back to work super stuffed.  Only thing I wish they had was low-sodium soy sauce (picky, I know).

Give it a shot!"
4,Quality Asain food. The lobster is a hit or miss. Somtimes they serve unfresh lobsters.  Probably cheap black market lobsters that has been dead too long before being cooked.
4,Eggs were good. Generously portioned. The service was good. Would definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch!
4,"My friends and I went there for dinner a week or so ago and we loved it. The portions aren't huge, but it was really yummy. I had the pasta with bolognaise sauce. Very yummy, but a little too heavy for me that day. Lots of meat in the sauce. I'm not sure how the pizza is, but it looked amazing from what I saw. Our waitress was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. She even pronounces the names of the pastas correctly! We had some deserts and they were delish! They have a dish with canoli cream and pieces of the shell to dip in it....mmm that was amazing! We also had their zeppolis...which I have to say were just ok. We're Italian and from NY so compared to home they were small and not as good, but I'll give them effort for trying!"
4,"This place is running by new owner the menu changes slightly. I ordered beef kabab. It's served with bread slides, salad and rice. It really looked delicious. It was not Persian flavor it tasted more like Arab's or Turkish kabab. But it was so tender. Moreover, it's only Mediterranean restaurant  in walking distance of UNLV and offer student discount just show your rebel card!!!"
4,"We got take out from House of Pizza recently and the first thing I noticed is old décor. It seriously looks like they haven't changed in thing in 20 years. It really did remind of pizza places from back when I was a kid. The other thing I really liked about it was that it was very different form a chain pizza place. 

We ordered the house special pizza and it was great. The crust is a little on the thick side, but not as thick as a pan pizza. It is nice and crispy and there are very generous portions of toppings and cheese. I thought the pizza was priced very reasonably (~$17 for a large). 

My brother in law told me he used to have little league banquets here over 30 years ago. It is great a place can stay in business that long and serve consistently good food. I will def. be back here on a future trip to Charlotte."
4,"Sushi Home Away From Home.

I live on the West Coast where good sushi joints are plentiful and part of the regular fare. However, I am from the Midwest, where it is harder to find good, reputable sushi. Sushi is one of my favorite foods, and when I come home (which is often) it is nice to have a a good sushi place to go to.  I have eaten from the regular Hunan menu many times, and it is fantastic in its own right, but the sushi is what I really come here for. My daughter is 11 and loves to sit at the sushi bar. This restaurant is now one of our regular dinner/lunch spots.

There are a couple things you should know before you begin. As this is not a sushi restaurant by definition, they offer traditional seating and a a traditional Chinese and Japanese menu by default. If you sit in the regular dining room, you will not receive exactly the same service as you would sitting at the sushi bar. This is not a fault in the restaurant. For the layman, it is a difference in tradition:  If you sit in the regular area, the service has no way of knowing in advance what you will be ordering, and so they only treat you like a sushi customer in the sushi area. However, you do not have to order sushi when you sit at the sushi bar. The sushi bar area is full service and offers the regular bar and food menu as well.

The sushi menu is actually in two places on the menu, and it took us a few trips before the server pointed this out to us. They offer the traditional rolls inside the regular menu. However, as good sushi foodies do, I'm sure you'll want to see what creativity the chef has to offer. You will find the specialty rolls on the back page of the menu, apart from the other offerings, under the Futomaki heading, and be sure to check the Specials board as there are always one or two special creations that are not on the menu. That is where the fun is. There are many, and I have yet to try them all, but the specialty rolls here are delicious. They are 8-10 rather large pieces each instead of the usual smaller 6 of the standard rolls. There are many specialty rolls to choose from, and they are all presented with flair. Your roll will come out looking like a piece of art, right down to the cucumber display. Nothing on the plate is just ""put there"".   Regardless of which rolls you order, you will find that Hunan sushi is high-quality, fresh, hand-rolled, and does not smell like fish. Their presentation is as artistic as the ingredients themselves, and if you have a large party, your sushi will be delivered on a large wooden sushi boat. The prices on the standard rolls are well below $10, but you will pay closer to $20 for a Futomaki roll; however the Futomaki rolls are well worth the price in both portion and taste.

As picky as children are about their food, especially ""fancy food"" or food that requires a more mature palate, my 11 year old always manages to find something new that she likes when she dines here. I think it speaks highly of the restaurant when they can not only get a kid to eat such food, but to continue trying new things every time we go. The staff is friendly to her and treat her as well as any adult customer. She likes to talk to the sushi chefs while they're preparing food, and they are very friendly and talk back to her, even on busy weekend nights. They do not, however, offer a children's menu or child sized portions on either the sushi or the regular menu, so order accordingly...Sushi may be fish, rice, and veggies, but it is surprisingly filling, especially for younger diners. However, since it does not take long to pepare and doesn't get cold, you can order one roll and then order another later if you're still hungry."
4,"Tortas El Guero,you've been put on notice.  I think I've found a new place to satisfy my Torta needs.  My only complaint is that the milanesa is cut up so small that it is a difficult feat to get the stuff to stay in my perfectly baked bun."
4,"House of Hunan is one of the nicest places to eat in Medina.  Not only do they have a great variety of Asian food they also have a great location.  I love when they open up the windows when it is nice outside and you can look out at the square.  

One of my favorite things to get at Hunan is the sushi.  It is a great quality and not too expensive.  It was even better when they had half priced sushi on Thursdays.  I'm sad they discontinued this.  

Hunan is the only place in Medina you can get Thai, and I love Pad Thai.  Basically you can't go wrong with Hunan.  Make sure to check it out if you're driving through Medina."
4,"I think this place is over rated. Food is decent but not the greatest. I just don't like the small portions of food u get with the tortas and combo plates. I do love that they are very clean, and everything is done in front of u. I'll still be back to try other options as they do have a great variety.  I recommend eating 2 tortas as they r pretty small in size."
4,"Grew up in the south where Waffle House is a staple.  It's grits hash and eggs.  This morning I had extra crispy hash browns with jalapeños, ham, onions and cheese.  Perfect hash brown fix.  Thank you Waffle House for having consistent food for at least the last 40 years.  Because that's how long I have eaten at one.  Damn I am getting old but at least Waffle House is still the same.  An American Tradition."
4,"A solid 3.5 !

By the end of the work week I am DONE with cooking and I often don't want to leave my house ...pizza is nearly always our Friday go-to dinner. I enjoy Hawthornes, but my husband does not...he enjoys Dominoes, but I do not. We both like Intermezzo but it can get a little steep for our newlywed budget so our solution is House of Pizza.

It doesn't look all that great in all honesty but it tastes pretty darn good. They don't skimp on cheese (though sauce is lacking a bit)..so it works for us. Now this isn't the best pizza in the world but it certainly isn't the worst. A pie will set you back like $11 for cheese so you can't beat the price."
4,"Great menu. Good drinks. A little noisy, especially when there are big groups but that's ok. They are happy. We returned our second gay in town and enjoyed the restaurant just as much."
4,"I have been coming here sense I was a child. They have the best cheese steak sub in all of Charlotte. When someone asks me where can I get a good cheese steak without hesitation I tell them House of Pizza.  Pizza is very good as well.  I just can't get myself to order anything but the cheese steak.  I always have them add a little pizza sause to mine, just a suggestion.  You'll be glad you went there."
4,"Pros: fresh squeezed orange juice, perfectly poached eggs
Cons: the service was mediocre and the food lacked flavor"
4,"Really good food. Needs a renovation on the building though, which I believe is in the works for the summer months. We drive 30 miles to eat here. Best Philly Steak around! It is huge and delicious. They use good quality ingredients. Highly recommend."
4,"This is one of the cleaner and newer feeling Waffle Houses... other than it being really cold in there most of the time... I like it, girl doesn't :)

Food is always good, ladies are always very nice. Typical waffle house... I have no issues here and have visited this location many many times and will continue to return.

oh and 24/7... hellz ya!"
4,Loved my breakfast. Eggceptional. Great potatoes and ham with eggs. Brioche French toast. Exceptional waiter who gave us tips about getting around. Nice double cappuccino. Will go back
4,"The name says it all... It's a bar that you can bring your dogs to. Husband and I had a pet friendly Airbnb we were staying at so our 2 pups came with us on the trip. I had heard about the ppave, but didn't realize it was around the corner. A late night in, we came here to grab a drink with pups.

It's like a dog park with alcohol served! The best of both worlds.

The Good.
What I just said above. Also, there's a decent beer selection to choose from. There's plenty of spots to chill at. It has an indoor/outdoor area and there's a covered patio with heaters. There's also a playground area and place to play some giant Jenga.

The Bad.
It's not necessarily bad, but there was the smell of dog pee out in the patio area. It's what you'd expect  being in zone full of dogs, but a human wouldn't mind for it to be cleaner.


It's definitely an experience and if you don't have a dog, but want one... This is the place to get your fix!"
4,im a transplant to charlotte and they have dollar freakin beer....i havent had that in god knows how long...YES I CAN
4,"I don't remember the last time I went to a Chinese buffet but it's been years. We came with some friends for lunch. Let me warn you, this buffet is huge and there are a wide array of options on the menu. It was a decent buffet and rather clean. There is a hibachi section and a sushi section. There is a lot of seating and this would be a good place for groups. Prices are pretty reasonable."
4,"Happy Hour at Howl at the Moon! What a hysterical time.  The piano players are hilarious, butchering every song from Elton John to Biz Markie. The drink specials were just ok, but the wait staff is friendly and extremely attentive.

I really enjoyed the crowd mix; the age and diversity contributed to the music mix and made for a terrific time."
4,"I love the Medina Square, it's so cute and quaint and House of Hunan just happens to be my favorite place to go to on the square. When I think of Asian Cuisine, I normally don't think of Medina Ohio, but dang House of Hunan on the square makes me think otherwise. My favorite thing to get is the Bangkok Galaxy & the OMG Roll &  The On The Square Roll. The only thing I wish House of Hunan would do better is dessert.... Sometimes you just really need to finish a meal off with something sweet. But in the past House of Hunan's dessert menu is unfortunately nothing impressive."
4,"Ruf....Ruf...........if I was a dog my tail would be wagging for Dog Bar.

I do so love this place and for the 40 minutes or so my GF and I hung out here we just loved watching all the doggie drama running around.

Folks were nice...there was only an occassional humping....and no fights broke out...so all and all a good time was had by all.

The inside was VERY cold....it always seems to be that way....and I'm not quite sure, but the bartender was nice and has a good selection of beers to choose from in the bar.

The best thing about this place.........and the worst, was we checked in via the Yelp App on our phones, but only after we walked out the gate...only to find we got a ""Free Drink"" reward on our phones....so we'll be back!"
4,"A great tapas place at the Fashion Show Mall.  Original location is in Chicago, the Vegas one has views of the Wynn.  Tapas are decent, but my opnion is skewed by a recent visit to A.O.C. in LA.  Everything pales in comparison.  Ba-Ba-Reeba *does* have some great sangrias, especially the passionfruit sangria.  The artisan cheese plate was a little boring, but the jamon serrano comes with an assortment of other meats and some tasty tomato bread.  If you want something hot and comforting, the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce is delicous and comes with little pesto-topped toasts.  Although it was my first gazpacho experience, the Ba-Ba-Reeba bowl was so flavorful I'm hooked.  Cold soup rocks!  By far the best offering was the mini desserts menu, featuring small plates of yummy bites, all for $2.  The coconut bread pudding is divine, and little ice cream shots with drizzles of matching liqueurs go down sweet and smooth."
4,"Had some good times and great happy hours here.  Sad to see it go.
This place has been CLOSED since February 15th.

http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2010/2/4/16133/96259/vegas-travel/Cafe_Ba_Ba_Reeba_To_Close_on_February_15"
4,"I've only been here on Thursdays in conjunction with Alive After Five and usually before the real crowd rolls in. There's a laid back environment here with reasonably priced drinks. The music may not get started until about 7:30ish. The singers are decent. Good karaoke level. You'll hear top pop music from the past 20 years and request accompanied with a few dollars will be sang first. Howl serves no food, but allows you to bring outside food in. Fun times here."
4,"Let the fur fly, y'all! I'm babysitting mans best friend and thought I would check out this place. Totes recommending to all my Charlotte bff's, like yesterday. 

The have pretty good parking, except during peak hours. If coming with fellow fur parents, car pool (and reduce that carbon footprint, too). Once here, please go into the bar area so you can admire the wonderful selection of local craft beers on tap. Then, head outside to monitor your fur child and socialize with the other fur parents. They have a few human games for you if like activities. 

You may see many fur parents taking selfies with your fur child. Casual. I know. Please feel free to partake in these selfie shenanigans with their dogs. Now, I gotta go because there is this really adorable boxer puppy and we're gonna take a selfie! See you hereeeeee."
4,This place is awesome! Great egg benedicts and good service. I recommend going if you can
4,"I and my girlfriend wanted morning coffee, and we found it in this place. ""Espresso"" was good and strong like i like. Mygirlfriend order ""latte"" - it was good but not enought. Donuts was freash and tasty. Only minus - waiting. 10 minutes - it's too long for coffee and donuts."
4,"Not going to make this long. It's breakfast. But it's a little fun. I sat at the counter for the first time and it was cool. Fun to watch them cook and wash dishes felt like an old time diner from the 50's. 

I've read some reviews people crying around about long cook times and having to wait for this or that. It's pretty much a given when coming here for breakfast But its worth it. So for those who don't like to wait for something good, please don't come back and that way the rest up us will get sat faster. ;)

If you haven't ever been to a Waffle House you should try it. The waffles are mandatory and it doesn't hurt to try a side of scrambled cheesy eggs. Jen had a omelet and I think not weighed about five pounds. With tip we still walked out for less than $20. Shout out to Keshaun who served us he was very pleasant and made the visit that much better."
4,"Good stuff, nice location and service... A little bit different from others. Like the interior design. Will back soon for sure to try other delicious food."
4,"Sit. Drink. Stay. is the brilliant subtitle of this bar. This is a bar for people that love their dogs and enjoy a drink or two. People drink while their dogs play in a safe fenced in area. Whatever you do please close one gate before you open the next gate when entering and leaving the bar. The bar is located right on the street and this is a safety measure as long as customers use it correctly. If you're lucky you'll get to meet some of the regulars, two of the sweetest Great Danes ever, Skylar and Pierce. Totally one of my favorite bars ever."
4,"Enjoyed my breakfast today! I love trying out places I haven't been befire, and i must say this place is a bit unique. We sat at a table that was connected to the barstools and we could see all things in the kitchen. As simple as the menu is, our service was fast and efficient! When I get back close to another location I'm most definitely going back!"
4,"Very slow service but at least it was service with a smile. The poor girl at the counter was taking orders, getting the donuts and she is was responsible for making the drinks. Poor girl...

My Carmel Machiado was BOMB!!!"
4,"Pretty good place to nosh in funky cold medina.   I had the sushi - especially enjoyed the tempura crispy kind.  My frenemy whom I was dining with that night had some sort of veggie and tofu stir fry offering which looked delish as well.   The drinks were cold and refilled often which was optimal since I was pretty parched.  

Restaurant is swank, comfy cushions in the booths, cool little waterfall pyramid thingy... I felt way undressed in my sweatshirt and yoga ""sexy"" pants.  

The highlight of the meal was our waiter... Mike Carlson.  He had brown tousled hair, which I just wanted to run my fingers through, dorky yet sexy glasses and a cute pixie-like nose.  Carlson was very attentive as a server - very hunky as a man - a total dreamboat.    Now my dining partner even has a crush on him ... (sigh) I guess we are going to remain frenemies."
4,"The Groupon Gods were smiling upon me with this deal!  I got a massage, facial, and waxing last Saturday.  Making an appointment was super easy, and they'll e-mail you confirmation and a day-before reminder.  I hate talking on the phone, so this was a plus. It's located right across the street from Casbah in a converted old house.  The interior has a modern, zen-ish feel, and the staff were professional, accommodating and nice. I started with the Primal Relaxation massage, which was a fantastic Swedish massage.  The masseuse was skilled and friendly, and she worked her magic as I relaxed on their heated bed.  A white noise machine is used, and while it blocked out most of the S Highland Av noise, I could still hear the occasional motorcycle and siren. 
Next was facial and waxing.  The waxing was efficient and not painful.  The Seasonal Organic Facial was your typical facial: steam, cleansing, masque, extractions, moisturize.  My only complaint is that I still have some marks from a few of the extractions.

A few tips: bring quarters for the parking meters & they allow you to tip on a credit card."
4,"If your looking for authentic Mexican aguas and tortas this is the place for you.
The skinny 
I have been coming here for about a year now and they have kept up with the quality waters I have tried the horchata melon limon naranja and piña. All are great my favorite is the agua de Fruta the large drink is 2.70 and is worth every drop ask for no ice and get more :-). The tortas are ok seems pretty average comparing them to other torta places or even filibertos the carne asada is on point and they have daily specials like a torta fries and drink for 5.99 plus tax. They also have a panederia (bakery) with fresh Mexican donuts and breads decent prices you might get same quality at ranch market for cheaper but it's great they offer it. 
The bad 
The front counter is so close to the door I sometimes get confused about the line and it makes for unnecessary confrontations between patrons. While I do speak Spanish I did hear a lady having the hardest time ordering in English until I stepped in to help no big deal but I think they could have handled situation better. 
Overall 
This place is as authentic as the places I go to Mexico especially the waters they are great cooks, quick and affordable"
4,"Their Tapas were good, kinda reminded me of Firefly, but it's not that noisy here. The sangria was really good, service was so, so."
4,"This is my favorite place for Tortas. Everything I have had there has been excellent. So far my favorite is the torta ahogada which is in a pool of tomato and Chile sauce.  That is alone is worth coming to it check out. They also seem to use a large amount of fresh avocado in their tortas (literally they cut them there fresh and on the spot) 

Also they sometimes give you samples of the soups, and let me tell you they have some great ones. I'm not sure what this soup was called but it was a corn cream based style, and was literally one of the best soups I have ever tasted. They also have a fantastic Mango aqua fresca which is out of this world. I don't write many reviews on yelp as much as I use it for a resource, but this place I did because I really enjoy it. The service has also always been excellent. 

 I can't speak for any other items on the menu other then the tortas, soups, and the mango fresca so take this review based on those."
4,"The live music starts off about an hour after they open. I came here on Valentine's and  had a good time. They have rotating entertainers that play throughout the evening. They were able to play all 4 requests that I put it over the course of 4 hours. Our waitress, Callie, did an outstanding jobs keeping our drinks full even when it got crowded. She even went out of her way to help another couple sitting in another section in front of us that was having trouble getting service when the first arrived."
4,"Howl is an unique experience, right in the EpiCentre of Uptown. It's a totally different experience then your typical ""Night Club"". Very laid back atmosphere with fun music, and good drinks. Not a place for a lot of dancing (very small dance floor that never gets real lively), but a great place to listen to music. 

It's a piano bar, so all the music is played by live performers which makes for a great show. All the singers are decent, and play a good variety of music--there will be something for everyone. 

It's a great place to just sit back and watch a fun show!"
4,This is one of the best Chinese buffets that I have ever been to. The selection was amazing and no matter the style of food I chose it was all fresh and delicious. I will definitely come back.
4,"If you get tired of paying a fortune for breakfast and trying to find one that serves something your kids would like, try this restaurant.  Pretty straight forward American-styled egg based diner.

Not a Montreal restaurant experience, but value for money and a break from your Montreal food quest."
4,"Two people told me about this place. Who are these people? What are their stories? The first, my dear, dear mother, who's lived her entire life in Kentucky, Ohio and Florida. The other was a friend of a friend (you know, Brandon) who lived in New York for about a decade. They both recommended the House of Hunan in Medina.

I cannot complain about the quality of the food, the service, the atmosphere or the prices. I'll be back.

I ordered the egg rolls to start. Two in an order. They came out fast and were cut in half - smart. This way you don't burn your tongue on the first bite, ruining the rest of your meal. Crunchy and light - really, no grease at all. They might be my new favorites. They came with two dipping sauces: what looked to be a homemade duck sauce and also our old friend hot mustard. 

Next, I ordered the standard spicy tuna roll. Big pieces compared to some sushi places. These guys didn't even think about falling apart either. Nicely rolled and tasty, with the right amount of pickled, pink ginger.

I almost ordered the scallops for my entree, but the server said I'd like my choice from the Thai menu better. So I got the Bangkok Galaxy. It had a very good blend of sweet and spicy with the coconut milk just giving it a little smoothness. The veggies were cooked well, not overdone and the pork, chicken and steak were very tender.

I have to get back over there sometime. Highly recommend this place for a date or just getting some sushi with friends."
4,"I had a bad experience here and wrote a review about it. The owners contacted me right away and brought me back for a 2nd facial. This was awesome. Audra is amazing, I felt relaxed and my skin looked great. This changed my entire perspective on the place and I am considering joining the spa club. thanks for your superb customer service!"
4,"The older I get, the more frequently I do foolish things. Today, my fancy drove me all the way to Charlotte in pursuit of a cheesesteak.

Over the past three years, I have had several Yelpers PM me, advising me to get thee hence to the House of Pizza if I wanted a great cheesesteak. I was intrigued. Were they right, or were they leading me astray? I would soon find out.

I ordered the LARGE cheesesteak with onions, peppers, and mushrooms. Pepsi. I opted for extra cheese, because it sounded like a good idea at the time. I found out later that this was overkill. The sandwich was served with wavy potato chips and a dill pickle spear. 

Service from the young dude was almost tentative. Service from the young lady, who bore a resemblance to Jolene Blalock, sans implants, was VERY fast and attentive. When my soda ran dry she noticed, and a refill was brought instantly by the bro. In his defense, he fulfilled requests very quickly when asked.

The décor is 1970ish. Pictures are askew on the walls. The ceiling tiles are water stained. The men's bathroom is in desperate need of refurbishing. All the aforementioned minutiae doesn't matter one darned iota. Why? The jukebox was jumping - first with reggae from Bob Marley, then Michael Jackson tunes. The atmosphere was homey and relaxing. Even though I'd never been here before, it felt like I'd been coming here for years. Eventually, I lost track of the music because I was in cheesesteak induced food coma/nirvana.

The HUGE cheesesteak was extremely good. Look at the picture in the listing for this restaurant and that's exactly what I was served. There was a bountiful quantity of perfectly grilled, tender steak, onions, and red peppers. The sandwich was blanketed by tons of thick, melted, provolone cheese like San Francisco is enveloped with fog at night. The bread was fresh with a satisfyingly crispy crust. Even though I hadn't eaten since yesterday's lunch, I had to leave a couple bites on the plate. I ran a good race, but I stumbled at the finish line. 

The Pepsi was served in those big red plastic glasses that one used to find at Pizza Hut, back in the day when Archie Bunker ruled the TV ratings.

When I arrived at 1:00 PM there was only one other couple in the building. By the time that I stumbled out the door in a meat and cheese induced stupor, the place was pretty well full. 

One of my fellow diners was a 30ish active duty Army soldier, dressed in his desert camo fatigues and beige boots. I secretly had the waiter bring me his cheque - so that his lunch was free today! This was undoubtedly the best $10 that I have ever spent. I urge everyone to do the same if you are able, to show that his and others sacrifices are appreciated. This act of kindness made me feel good, and I hope that it brightened the soldier's day as well.

If you want a great cheesesteak, you need look no further. This sandwich was as good as the one that I ate at Portofino on Eastway, my previous best, and definitely in my top three ever. Next time, I will NOT order the large, and I won't add extra cheese or meat, because it is superfluous. The House of Pizza kitchen magicians are already generous with the toppings. 

BTW, as an observant diner, I noticed that the salads were huge. A few of the other diners had to get a take out box for half of their sandwiches. In hindsight, maybe I should have done the same. ;o) 

I will surely be returning to the House of Pizza for my next cheesesteak fix."
4,"This place is really, really good...just like their other location we've tried.  It seemed a bit bigger and busier though.  Got two tortas this time - ahogada and Mexicans, both were very good and was way more than we could eat.  Also got ribeye tacos, which are absolutely the best.  Even though this place was great, they have another ""Street Foods of Mexico"" location on Dunlap that is a bit more homey and is still my favorite place for street tacos in Phx."
4,"I do like a good torta. Currently, in my book the king of tortas in Phoenix is Gallo Blanco. However, sometimes I don't want such a fine dining experience. There are days when I want quick and cheap; and when I want a quick, cheap, and good torta, there's one place that has not let me down: Tortas Paquimé.

As a biographical aside, I actually visited Paquimé, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua back in the spring of 1995. My first torta was prepared by a Tarahumaran Indian over a wood fire at Copper Canyon nearby there.  But I digress...

A buddy of mine who is originally from Ciudad Chihuahua turned me on to Tortas Paquimé when I asked him what he thought was a good, authentic torta place in the Valley. He noted, and I must agree, that the fact that they bake their own bread on-site makes all the difference.  I've had a few of their numerous tortas, and have not had a bad one.  Nor have I heard any of my co-workers who have accompanied me there complain.

The place is spotlessly clean. In fact, the cleanliness and order there is a little jarring at first visit. The staff is very nice, and completely bilingual. And the tortas are not only good, but they are also pretty cheap. All in all, this is delicious food at a great value in a clean, friendly place."
4,"Literally JUST tried this place after years of living down the street. I was told by many that this place is delicious but I just didn't believe it. Today, my husband and I decided to give it a go for lunch. DELISH! We got a side order of meatballs as an appetizer and I could have literally ate them as a meal. So good. Sauce is to die for. We both got a sub...he got the turkey and I got the veal. They were very filling and both were tasty. I wish they had other side options as our only choice was chips, but other than that we had no complaints. Our server was friendly and happy, our beer was cold and our food was scrumptious! We will def go back."
4,S'mores French Toast - Nuttella and marshmallows melted between two pieces of french toast served with a side of fresh fruit drizzled with more nuttella and marshmallows.  Absolutely delicious.  Enough said.
4,"I went here last time I visited family to get sushi and loved it so I knew I had to return again.

House of Hunan is located right on the Medina Square and is quite modern and decoration is clean and simple. Staff are friendly and helpful, able to make recommendations on dishes to try.

On my first visit, at dinner time, I asked the waitress for her recommendation of sushi and ended up ordering that (It was one of the Halloween sushi rolls, I believe it is called the Spooky roll or something like that) along with some fried rice to share with the others. Hands down, this was the best sushi roll I've ever had!!! I've also heard the On the Square roll is also highly recommended.

For my second visit I dined during the lunch hour. I ordered one of the bento boxes (vegetarian and my boyfriend the chicken) and we both really liked them! it comes with soup, sushi, meat/veggie and is quite filling. A great bargain in my opinion! We also ordered some tea to share, which warmed us up during a cold winter's day.

Although more pricey, it is definitely worth the visit as you get good quality sushi at House of Hunan! Go during lunch if you have a craving but are lacking in the budget!"
4,"Location: shopping center in University area
Parking: parking lot
Visits: more than 5, usually at lunch
Customer Service:  friendly, keep drinks full and table clean of used plates
Value:  2 people with drinks $20 
Buffet:  variety (sushi, hibachi, Chinese and American). Something for everyone
Favorites: sesame chicken, lo mein, butterfly shrimp, soft rolls and ice cream
Great for groups"
4,"This buffet is as good as it gets for the money.  Is it a 5 star restaurant?  No... but for a $10 all inclusive dinner or $7 lunch it is hard to beat.  The sushi selection is better at night although they rarely change the items.  I tried this place after Fuse closed (which had started more expensive but much better and slowly lowered prices and quality).

The staff is extremely attentive, and the hibachi is top notch (for a buffet), even has raw eggs you can add.

So all in all it is exactly what I expected.  I great BUFFET for your money.  IMO it is even better then the new one by concord mills. (cannot remember the name)

If you are expecting the higher quality food of a true sushi restaurant or Japanese steakhouse this is not the place, but I think it would be hard to find a better price/quality buffet."
4,"The Staff was super friendly and helpful. Nicest people!  The food had potential but needed some tweaking:  meatball appetizers were very tasty but were served slightly cool (I would have enjoyed them better if they were served hot). The pizza margherita was delightful. Flavors melded beautifully.  Crust was light and chewy. I dipped my crust into my meatball sauce. The salciccia e friarelli pagnotello (wood fired sandwich with sausage, broccoli rabe and cheese) was unique. I enjoyed the broccoli rabe, it added some tartness to mellow out the richness of the cheese. They don't have pasta on the lunch menu but they will let you order it off the dinner menu. Just ask your server.  The pappardelle bolognese was slightly disappointing. The pappardelle was cooked perfectly but the bolognese was bland. It needed some additional seasoning.  Overall a very pleasant experience. I would go back."
4,"This place accommodated the entire party. Their banana walnut Nutella waffles, freshly squeezed OJ, potatoes were all delicious. The service was also great. I didn't give this place 5 stars because it wasn't anything special and more of just a run of the mill type breakfast place."
4,As usual the buffet is always well stocked and everything is fresh and hot. The servers are very attentive and keep your drink full. No complaints from me at all.
4,"I have to come to Vegas a lot for business and I recently found this gem.  The menu includes a wide range of items.  Everything that I have tasted I have enjoyed.

The most recent time I visited I had the lobster paella, which was delicious, filling, and cheap!  I also really enjoy the gaspacho here.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and the service is attentive.  There are several vegetarian friendly options as well!"
4,"It's always nice to have breakfast at 8PM! A nice fiesta omelette (ham, cheese, tomato, jalapeño pepper omelette), sunny side up eggs and bacon always be my number one breakfast item. Top it off with white bread with butter. They offer order as you like for $6.47 which I think it was a really good deal if you are really hungry. Overall, going to this restaurant is really worth my breakfast craving on dinner time!"
4,i had heard about this place so I decided to stop by friday after work. I ordered 2 tortas ahogadas to go for my dad and myself. When I got home I realized they had given me the wrong order. I called in and manager was kind enough to tell me if I went back I would get the right order for free. I went back yesterday after work and I did get the right ordere. My torta ahogadas are very delish. The sausce is very tasty. The whole torta was very good. I would would go back again.
4,"Went with a bunch of girlfriends - we sat at one of the large high top tables. They have a list of local beer/wine and a limited amount of liquor. 

Pizzas are wood fired & personal size - I ate 1/2 there and took the other half home. I got the chicken pesto with grape tomatoes it was good. I probably would get another one next time. Prices are a tad high at $16+ for a pizza for this size (picture shown) 

The area it is in -Langtree lots of options of bars/other restaurants and fun places. In the summer they have live music and lot of events."
4,"Pizza is great here, so is the service.  The place is owned by Italian natives who really know how to cook up a pizza pie!  Dan and I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was hopping, but we didn't have to wait.  Our server was a young Italian woman who made us feel very at home.  We never had to wait for her to refill our drinks and the pizza was made within ten minutes.  I am a vegetarian and Dan isn't, but there was no problem splitting two toppings on each side with no extra charge.  The cheese was scruptous and fresh, and we didn't leave a slice behind.  

Pictures of Italy decked the walls and the waitresses talked amongst one another in a sultry Italian tongue.  It really was an authentic Italian dining experience!"
4,"Sometimes when I think I can't go on with the heat in Las Vegas, I go to the mall. I went yesterday with my American Express and the air conditioning. It was nice to get out of the heat and into some retail therapy. 
Cafe Ba-Ba Reeba is a wonderful Tapas place at the Mall. Yes, our mall is better than yours. 
Actually I hate malls, but I really can't be that mad at this one because there is so much fun stuff there! 
Ba Ba Reeba is more expensive than other tapas places in town, due to its location, but I always seem to eat vegetarian here and so its a little less expensive. If and when it is under a 100 degrees outside,  I like the patio because of the pretty view to Wynn, but inside is really pretty also."
4,"I would highly recommend this place. Great food, service and decor and a certain pride that the management and staff have in the restaurant. Using all authentic Italian ingredients their pizza is very similar to the wildly popular Alino's. The pastas and sauces are amazing and flavorful. The lasagna is unusual in its presentation but possibly the best you will ever have. Desserts are great."
4,I love the sangria and the paella! They have some great tapas! Fun with friends! I love the environment and the food is very yummy! Its a great place for dinner!
4,We had a great time at Howl at the Moon. The entertainers were really good and the bar staff provided quick service. Definitely a good place to visit when you are at the Epicentre.
4,"Great atmosphere, and good pizza. It's a little thicker than what you get in Naples but still delicious. The service was a little disorganized but they just opened so I'm giving them a pass on that, especially because the manager came over and was really nice and asked us how everything was and whether she could do anything for us."
4,"At the recommendation of a co-worker, a group of us from work visited Tortas Paquime.  I'm not a Tortas aficionado, but I'm willing to try something new, especially something that I would likely not try or stop at on my own.

We park and go inside- there is a wait and it appears that the counter service is a little slow.  The place is new looking and very clean.  It is an open kitchen and you can watch the prep cooks prepare your food.  Everything looks great, it's hard to choose.  Fresh avocados abound, and we marvel as the cooks deftly remove the bright green flesh from their skins, adorning our food with these delicious fruits.

The counter help is friendly and helpful.  Our orders are taken and drinks provided.  They make REAL lemonade and fresh fruit drinks.  Bottled Mexican sodas, fresh brewed tea.  

Our party orders a variety of food- Tortas, tostadas, flautas, churros.

I ordered 2 tostadas and likely could have been fine with one.  My pork tostada is loaded sky high with beans, delicious pork, shredded lettuce, fresh avocado, and more.  My vegetarian (bean) tostada is equally delicious.  It was a crisp fresh salad on a tortilla.  My friends who ordered tortas were very pleased, and they know their tortas.

One problem we had was that they had TVs on and the volume was very high.  We asked if they could adjust and they said they could not.  It was loud enough that you had to raise your voice to talk.  Spanish speaking comedy, music, and gorgeous tourism video played.  

I would definitely bring my kids here, as I think they would enjoy the adventure. I'll definitely go again.  I also recommend this to folks who want to try something more authentic and varied, but also want familiar ingredients as an option.  

visit 1/14/11"
4,"This is one of my favorite spots to visit in the Epicenter.  Each time I've been, I've never been able to get an actual seat inside, but the outer deck area is very nice.  There's also plenty of room for dancing (if that's your thing).

 I don't frequent dueling piano bars a lot, but the musicians at this one are pretty decent.  Combine some of the strongest drinks at the Epicenter with fairly good music and you're looking at a really good night.

I recommend trying at least one of the fishbowl drinks that they offer."
4,"Premier brunch à Montréal alors pas de comparaison.
Mais un choix très très vaste sur la carte c'est même dur de se décider. 
Le service est agréable. Rien a redire. Je vous conseille un matin en semaine avant midi pour profiter du calme !
Honnêtement une fois que vous aurez fini votre assiette ne comptez pas manger avant le soir !
Pour commencer un jus d'orange frais pressé. Optez pour le régular et non le petit pour 50cts de plus pourquoi s'en priver !"
4,"Was surprised to see that Cafe Ba Ba Reeba had a lower average rating than Firefly on Paradise. We went to Firefly before and were really underwhelmed by the food there. In fact, every dish we tried (and we tried plenty) was on the average or under average side. 

We're always on the hunt for tapas and hubby was adamant about NOT going to Firefly. I had bookmarked RE Tapas, but hubby wanted to try Ba Ba Reeba while we were at the mall so we thought we'd be smarter this time and order only a small selection in case it wasn't all that great either.

The restaurant shares its space with Stripburger -- very strange because it's so damn confusing. I wanted to sit by some natural light for the purpose of taking photos but wherever I pointed out was not part of Ba Ba Reeba.

The menu wasn't very big so it was quite easy to decide. The young man wanted a pizza and there were only 3 or 4 to choose from so we went for the chorizo. I got some garlic shrimp, sea scallops and Padron peppers as well. 

Sangria is not bad here -- it's not sickly sweet and had a nice balance of the wine to fruit/juice. Very refreshing accompaniment to the meal.

Padron peppers were grilled well with a sprinkling of sea salt to give it flavor. Seared sea scallops were fresh and juicy, well prepared, but the couscous and sauce was what brought this dish down. The flavors were underseasoned and did nothing to enhance the scallops. My favorite were the garlic shrimps. The shrimps were plump and extremely fresh and had a hearty helping of garlic in the dish. The olive oil was infused so strongly with the garlic we all used the bread to soak it up and wiped the dish clean.

I wouldn't ordinarily order pizza at a tapas place but the one here wasn't bad as far as pizzas are concerned. The crust was very thin and the toppings of chorizo, cheese and cherry tomatoes were balanced correctly -- not too much and not too little.

All in all, I'd have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I'll even go as far to say that the garlic shrimps were better than at my favorite tapas place in SF -- Zarzuela. Yeah, I said it. It's better! We ended up getting an extra order of the shrimp since none of us felt we had enough.

The meal wasn't cheap -- a pizza, 4 tapas and 2 glasses of sangria came to almost $80 with tip included. Still, for a highly satisfying meal, I don't really care if it was on the high side."
4,HOUSE OF PIZZA REOPENED TODAY AT 5PM. Back in business. The long wait through the cold winter...and last fall ..... and this past spring..... are over. I even called to make sure. I could smell cheesesteak sub through the phone. THEY'RE BAAAACCKK!!
4,"It's great to have a place like the dog bar in Charlotte, even if you don't have a dog!  They offer drink  specials & always participate in the NoDa Gallery Crawls.   There is a front Patio with bench seating for you & your dogs & an inside bar area with a Wii.  For 1st timers take your dogs on a Sunday when it's quiet & the drinks are cheap.  

side note: Just make sure your dogs do not have problems with XL dogs like Great Danes, there are always at least 3 or more there."
4,I loved that I was greeted so nicely by Maria as soon as I walked in. The rest of staff greeted me with such warm smiles. I ordered a breakfast burrito with bacon. It was good. I ate it with salsa verde. Very good. True Mexican flavored food!!!!
4,I took my kids here on Saturday night. The buffet was delicious. Of course at a buffet there will be hits and misses but I would say 90% of the dishes the kids and I tried we liked. The hibachi was very yummy with a great selection of items. We will be back soon!
4,"This was def the best choice to in that mall plaza section on Las Vegas Blvd.  I've only had tapas a few times and I'm not completely drawn to it because it sounds like I'll order a bunch of things and still not get full.  WRONG.  Well we ordered a lot BECAUSE we were afraid of not getting full.

Walked over here Sunday afternoon and there was no wait.  Awesome.  We got bread and some olive oil right away.  The olive oil was kinda bitter but I don't think its my thing. 

This is what we ordered: 
- Mahi Mahi Tapa (which was the special of the day)  very juicy with yummy veggies with it
- Steamed mussels (my bf said it was good) 
- beef skewers (I like this one because of the carmelized onions and the spicy horseradish) 
- Salmon with veggies
- Seafood Paella (soo yummy but remember it takes about 30 minutes to order) 
- Black Raspberry sangria half pitcher 16 bucks (this was my favorite part because of the fresh fruit!  You HAVE to order the SANGRIA!! 

I really enjoyed the food, had lots of great decorations in the restaurant, and played Spanish themed music in the background which was awesome.  Its just a bit pricey.  It was a lunch for 2 for 75 bucks not including tip.  I will probably come back for the happy hour!"
4,"We ventured in because of the sushi selection reviews. There is a huge selection off rolls/makis (they on working on labeling selections) and pretty respectable nigiri (salmon, tuna, yellowtail). Clean, our attendant is very nice and pleasant. Great meat selection and seafood selection. They have the hibachi grill.  overall better than rest i have been in."
4,"Oh House of Hunan
Your food is tasty
Your location is neat
Medina Square?
It can't be beat!
People might ask me why ....
Six words.
Fun glasses ... Filled with Mai Tais.

Publc service announcement:   Don't steal the Mai Tai glasses.  Buy them."
4,Great breakfast place that gives you a good portion of fruits along with your meal. Their portions are perfect and mine was cooked to exactly what i ordered I would come back to the place again for solid consistent good breakfast food.
4,"Thoroughly enjoyed a nice dinner here after a day of moving family members to Charlotte. It is an incredibly expansive selection, including numerous sushi choices. The staff is very efficient and keeps everything filled at all times. I could've eaten 20 plates of the green beans alone. Delicious and not your normal Chinese buffet fare. The one complaint is that there are not many dessert choices and the ice cream area is difficult to navigate"
4,"As a non-dog owner, this place is fun. The bartender is nice, and it's a good place to hang out and relax on a nice sunny day. They offer several local craft beers and have good beer specials. Not being a beer drinker, I ordered a rum and diet, which was $5 using the house rum (still don't really know what that was), Bacardi would have been $7. After drinking that I noticed another woman drinking a Crispin in a can, (I would think a pint if I had to guess)... that was $4, so score one for that for those non-beer drinkers out there. 

Like some other people who have commented, the conditions can become a bit unsanitary when you think about it too much, but that's why they don't serve food. The bartender is also in charge of cleaning up the poop. After I watched him fix my mixed drink I couldn't get past the fact that he also handled the cleaning up in other areas and stuck to the canned drinks. (Really had nothing to do with him and what I observed, just my mind running around with all of the things that could happen.) 

I think this was a nice change of pace for a Saturday afternoon and a lot of fun."
4,"Really great place! I love going there and I really wished people with small dogs visited it more often. My dog, who is 30lbs, is usually hiding because there's so many big dogs. But he loves it!! He will play with all the dogs and I have never had a problem there. It was my second time visiting and this time there was an overprotective dog who was bullying every other dog and the owner just stood there. I wish there was at least 2 bartenders on busy nights because one isn't enough. I know it was busy but I waited over 30mins just to checkout because she was so busy with people coming up to the bar. It's such an amazing bar and I love being around all the people and dogs. Its a must even if you don't own dogs!"
4,"We had a party of 3 and we ordered the following:


Catalan Guacamole - Solid but tasted like Chipotle's guacamole so nothing special.  Also they disguised the amount of guac you get by putting it on a bed of green lettuce.

Serrano, Salchichon and Chorizo combo - This gives you a nice mix of Spanish meats and cheeses and also comes with tomato bread and olives.

Roasted Dates & Bacon - We ended up ordering an extra dish of these as they were so good.  Everything tastes good with bacon and this was no exception.  The combination of the sweet dates and salty bacon was awesome.

Squid a la Plancha - The squid was cooked nicely and was very tasty with the red pepper and lemon-garlic oil.

One of my friends also got a set of the bite sized tapas called pinxtos.  He liked the shrimp and egg salad on toast and the quince and cheese the best.

This was a great place that's not too expensive and we got to sample a lot of food that we normally wouldn't eat."
4,"Poor ba ba reeba, setting up shop in a veritable ghost town that is Fashion Show Mall. 
We entered this area only to sample the restaurant's happy hour, on recommendation from a friend.

We've been to Spain, and had tapas from a variety of regions. Of course it's not the same. We're also from a town with a Spanish theme that serves tapas so painfully unrelated to Spanish food that Ba Ba Reeba is doing a decent job of Spanish tapas in a tourist strip of shiny lights and gut busting edible junk.

And the happy hour prices are very good deal, especially given the area.
Just my luck that I enjoy sitting and dining at the bar, since that's where the happy hour prices apply. 
If there'd been four of us, we'd have gotten a portion of every item on the happy hour menu, and two rounds of the pintxos. But there was just two, so we sampled perhaps half the menu.

Favorite pintxos were the egg salad and shrimp on toast, and the fried goat cheese.

Favorite small plates include the meatballs in tomato sauce, the jamon with cheese and olives, and the bacon-wrapped dates. 

We didn't go anywhere near the paella. That's one item I don't take risks on, for fear of disappointment.

We shared three glasses of sangria: peach, passion fruit and cava. The cava was our favorite, light and not cloyingly sweet.

My top pick, though, was the bread and olive oil that comes to the table. The bread really did remind of eating in Spain. A little firm, a little chewy and the olive oil had a strong nutty, grassy flavor, like the simple rustic oil I had in southern Spain. Put some better salt on the table, a little wild thyme in my pocket, and a sherry in my hand, and I'm back in a cafe in Las Negras. 

Our bartender did everything right, coming by just when we may have needed her, fretted on our behalf that the bread hadn't come out yet, asked how we liked this and that, and never hovered. 

Bonus: once you're inside, no obvious noises and lights of casinos."
4,"I haven't had a dog in years (tear rolling down my cheek) but my GF does have a little dog, so I've been wanting a good reason to check out the Dog Bar in NoDa....I've traveled all over the world, but never seen a place like this...great idea.

The place was well thought out to accommodate pooches of all sizes and the place is built so no manner of poop or pee pee would really do any damage or impact....kinda like ""kid proof"" but in  doggie type of manner.

If you have ever owned a dog...well owned isn't quite the right word, but I find those folks just nice and laid back....and people are engaging and it's an easy place to strike up conversation.

Beer and liquor is available and pricing is very reasonable, but I'd stay away from the Well liquor as I saw 2 times while I was sitting at the outside bar a big dog behind the bar licking the tops of the Well bottles then bolting off to hump some other doggy in the bar....So go with the canned beer just to be safe....unless you are into that kinda thing??? *grin*

Was there doggy drama...of course....were the personality and looks of the dogs as unique as owners...absolutely?  Will I come here again....definitely?"
4,"House of Pizza is a Charlotte staple. It's a small, family run restaurant that has been around for many years; since I can remember. We often get take out, and occassionally will dine in. The food is consistently good, as are the service and prices. This is not a high end artisan pizzeria, but rather, a good ol' family run pizza joint. We are lucky to live nearby. Being primarily pizza eaters, we haven't tried all of the menu items, but the famous philly cheese steak sub is awesome. The lasagna is good too. The decor is a bit dated and the rug a bit worn, but this is as it should be in such a long running establishment!"
4,"I was quite surprised to find great Chinese food hidden in downtown Medina, Ohio. It has become my favorite Chinese food restaurant over the last few years. Great food (a great secret is the sushi roll dish ""On the Square"", it is not on the menu), good service and a trip to Medina Square is always enjoyable for me. If you get there early enough, you can walk to the bakery next door for dessert. The prices are a little high in my opinion but you get what you pay for in this instance. It also has a fun ""appetizer"" seating area in the front of the restaurant. Don't try to sit there for dinner though, the chubby manager hasn't heard the saying that the customer is always right. We argued over it and I was willing to lose in order to still eat the sushi:)"
4,"I really enjoyed Dog Bar, as did my precious angel, Maeby. She's very social and played with the other dogs at the bar while we socialized with the humans. They have a lot of local  brews and I love that  they let you bring in takeout. 

Some of the other dog parents were a bit over protective (my dog is part border collie and is very vocal when she plays) & I wasn't a fan of them trying to discipline my dog for having a good time (I know, I'm a ridiculous parent... it's a good thing I don't have kids). 

My only reason for not giving Dog Bar five stars is thatt a) I don't like unisex bathrooms and b)they let two chihuahuas up on the bar, which seemed a bit icky to have dogs prancing around where the beer was served. 

All in all, it's a great place in a fun location -we'll be back soon!"
4,"Apparently one of the things about this place is that they serve a lot of fresh fruit with the meal. Having been here once, and shared 2 different things there, I have to agree that this is indeed accurate. Coming from the states, it's nice to see a massive heap of fresh fruit come with your meal as opposed to more potatoes, more buttered bread, or more bacon.

We got 2 things here, the first was one of the many versions of the eggs benedict they offer. As...eggspected...sorry...it was quite tasty. There were a of these offerings to chose from and I have to say that there were too many that it was hard to make any decision at all. In the end we went with 1 of the vast number that looked good and in the end it did not disappoint. 

The next dish was french toast loaded with fruit, lots of fruit. This was a great dish and of course the fruit made it really good. I normally don't get french toast for breakfast but I will admit that I do like it. This was a good choice, and I wouldn't hesitate to get it again if we went back here.

The espresso was decent, not amazing. I did get a second one but I'm not sure I should have. The service was ok but slow. And the price was maybe a hair on the high side. As a meal in-and-of-itself, it was good, I enjoyed it. Given a bit of slow service (to be fair we wanted to hit the road) and a bit of high price, it might suffer a hair on the overall grade. But it was a tasty meal and I imagine we may be back next time we're in the Old Port. 

Worth the trip overall."
4,"Im surprised to see the somewhat low rating.

I came here during SEMA week and had dinner with a few friends.  Please remember that I've never had tapas before so I let my friend do all the ordering.  Oh man I don't even remember what we ordered but the chicken empanada's are freakin GOOD.  I could eat a dozen+ of these things with that delicious sauce that comes with it and still ask for more afterwards.  Cool atmosphere here and you kind of forget that you're in the middle of the Vegas strip for a second there.  Drinks were strong and I had a blast with my friends.  Be prepared to break out the wallet though if you come around dinner time because it certainly isn't cheap here.  Will definitely come back for the empanada's.  =)"
4,"The food was closer to a 3 star rating but the friendliness of the staff, the immaculate kitchen and the relatively fast service bumps it up to a 4.  We tried the torta Paquime and the torta Mexicana.  Both were good but the Mexicana was better.  Saw someone else get what I call taquitos and a huge order of nachos, after we were already eating.  Those both made my mouth water and wish I had 2 stomachs.  Worth stopping in..."
4,"From me:  not bad, not great but not bad.  From my 7 year old son: Really good.  The donuts and sprinkles and smoothies."
4,"I went down to Phoenix for Spring Training and ran across this place in the middle of no where.   Waffle in the name of the joint and I love breakfast food so why not?

Went in there first thing I saw was a Lamborghini outside the Waffle House, and my friends claimed they just saw Amare going into it.  I was too slow to confirm this nor could i get a camera out so oh wells, but if rich people will eat here, why not an average joe like me?

The place is a bit small, I wouldn't bring a group of 5 or more since none of the table can be together.   The wait wasn't horribly long, about 5-10 mins.  When we sat down the waitress was prompt with the menu and gave us some time to order which is rare in a quick serving food joint that's packed.

I got the Special which consist of a giant waffle, 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and 3 bacon/sausages for 8 bucks.   You order this with the warm syrup and bam instant gratification.    

1 star for the food, 1 for the service, 1 for cleanliness (for a diner setting), 1 ease of parking/location"
4,"This is Spanish, NOT Mexican like some others have mistakenly mentioned.  Extensive menu of tapas averaging about $7.50-12 each plate; very few on the lower and higher end of that range.  About 4-6 for two people is what is recommended... so that gives you an idea of how much it will run you.  The portions were quite large for tapas, from looking at the other tables, so it's not totally overpriced.  We got an order of the Mix Paella (serves 2-3) of chicken, pork, sausage, green beans for $26.  It wasn't mentioned on the list, but we also got shrimps mixed in which was nice.  The waiter told us paella takes about 25 minutes to cook; we were starving and ended up getting a basket of bread four times during that period.  They kept refilling it no problem along with our drinks.  Great prompt service."
4,"I love this place! The food is amazing and the service is even better. 

I've tried many different things on the menu but I usually order and highly recommend the Chicken Kubideh Kabob plate for $6.99. It comes with one decently proportioned Chicken Kubideh, Basmati Rice, Pita and a Side Salad. The food is made with great quality. The Taziki sauce is also very good here and they have complimentary Jalapeños and Green Spicy Sauce. 

I've never had a bad experience here, all the workers are extremely pleasant."
4,"I have never been to the Chicago location, but I hope it's as good as this! We had the garlic shrimp; spicy potatoes; serrano, salchica and chorizo and my favorite, bacon wrapped dates!! YUMMM Ofcourse, I could never go here and NOT order sangria. This time it was just ok. The service this time around was outstanding though!!! Ba ba reeba doesn't dissapoint."
4,"Waffle House has never let me down and this location didn't either. It was roomier than others I have been to, so that was a plus. Our server was very attentive and so were the other servers there. I really felt the servers provided exceptional customer service, constantly coming by to ask if we needed anything else. The food was delicious as usual. First time we had ordered sausage there, they use the sausage patties. The waffles were phenomenal! They are a must to order, even if you've never been much of a waffle person before. They can't go wrong with baking in the ""toppings"". Can't wait to go back!"
4,"Overall, the best Mexican food chain restaurant in The Valley.  As far as torta places go, I would rank it in the top 4.  Most likely at #3 right now, right behind Los Reyes de la Torta.  The 2 tortas I have tried so far (the Mexicana and the Cubana) have both tasted great, and the Cubana really was distinct from the other chain 'Beto places in that every meat could be tasted distinctly and not as some meat mash.
However what truly sets tortas paquime apart is its aquas frescas and pan dulces.  Try the melon aqua.  It was almost reminicent of a creamsicle.  And the donas are drop dead.  
Overall, the ambiance,  cleanliness and friendliness of the staff help push tortas paquime into the upper echelon of pheonix mexican places ."
4,"Hey the Dog Bar is great! We had our sheepdogs out there for our daughter's sheep god's birthday party (yes these things are real!) The were a lot of dogs running around and ours got into the mix (and they loved the twin miniature bulldogs they met). We had a good time. 

The only down side were some of the owners who wouldn't keep an eye on their dogs at all. There was one in particular, a born and white dog with an orange color that was running around growling and harassing the other dogs while the owner wasn't paying attention in the least.

You'll have a great time if you just keep an eye on your dogs and hope the other owners do as well."
4,"Great place if you're hungry! The servings are full and they have many options. Also, the place looked clean enough but unfortunately I had heard bad things before. 

I liked the food options they gave and the server was nice enough. Looked a little bored but for the short interaction we had, his attitude sufficed. :)"
4,"I really enjoy going to this bar to hang out with the variety of pooches it brings in. The prices on beers are usually very reasonable and the customers who bring in dogs are very friendly when it comes to letting you pet their dogs. 

The only downside that kinda made me nervous is when some of the dogs decide they aren't liking each other very much. A couple minor frays broke out and even though they were quelled very fast by the owners it left me a little cautious of being caught in the middle of one. 

Also, another thing to note is that if you haven't been here in a while they have remodeled the place some and the bar is back against the far wall as you come in, it really opened up the space and looks much nicer and brighter than the old dark dankness it use to exude."
4,"First timers to Waffle House and we couldn't have been happier. A warm welcome and hello from several employees started this visit off in a terrific way. Lola was friendly and efficiently seated her guests - we waited just about 15 minutes on a Sunday morning in February, Valentine's Day actually. The food smells delicious here and it was. We sat at the high bar after being graciously invited forward by the head chef. Our pecan waffle was cooked to perfection and studded with pecans, warmed over with maple syrup. The hash browns were delectable - cooked crispy brown and filled/topped with our choices - ham, tomatoes, cheese... yum. We couldn't be happier with this first visit and now it won't be our last!!"
4,"First time at this buffet and was pleasantly surprised at the huge selection of food available. I don't think I've ever seen a buffet so big with as much variety. We were a party of 8 and although they were really busy, we were sat right away and everyone was able to find plenty to eat. The lunch price was unbelievable especially considering the amount of choices of food. The servers were very attentive. We will be back!"
4,"My partner and I got a couples' massage and it was very enjoyable. The room was very relaxing and the massage was high quality. My only issue was that my masseuse asked for particular things that are included and I might like, whereas my partner's did not, so we did not get the same options. Despite that, we had a wonderful experience and would recommend it to others."
4,My favorite place in Vegas for a casual and fun dining experience with gal pals.  Sangria and tapas is the way to go - then head into the mall for some shopping!
4,"This is a great little place.

They have almost as many dessert options as they have food, which is unusual in itself.  Check the website menu for a full list.

We had the rib-eye tacos and the Cubano torta.  Both very very tasty and a good value for the price, and both were very well-seasoned and yummy.  Big chunks of avocado on each taco, and a salsa bar with a lot of good options.

They also have....
.
.
.
get this...
.
.
.
chocolate covered strawberries for 75 cents each.

One of the best values on THAT product that you will find anywhere.

It was clean and shiny in there too, and open, and overall just a pleasant ambiance.

Definitely a spot I will return to, probably many times.  Highly recommended !!!"
4,"We come somewhat often. The tortas are good but but something about the potato chips just makes me want more! I think they are homemade.  The best for thing about this place is the cleaniness of the place. Always, always clean no matter how busy they are."
4,"The Bravacado version of eggs Benedict is a good option for gluten free folks. If you like avocado that is. The eggs and sauce sit upon half an avocado. I never considered that before but it was very tasty. I certainly miss my English muffins , but this is a great alternative.  Their menu does strive to provide healthy options. I found it a great way to start the day! Large pancakes came with my sons order of pancakes with scrambled eggs. The French Open happened to be on the TVs they have while we were there. A neat experience being in Montreal while attending the Formula One Grand Prix. I found Eggspectations while on Yelp searching for a cool breakfast place. Thanks again Yelp! The good reviews are right on the money!"
4,White peach sangria for the W haha. This place is on the outside of the fashion show mall and has a great darkly-lite interior with a full bar and very modern decor. Onto the food: awesome; get the paella their house specialty and don't be afraid of the mushroom empanadas they were amazing.
4,"I have been eating at Waffle House for many, many years.  They have the best waffles , chicken breast and hash brown in the buinsess      
Waffle houses at times get a bad rep, open 24 hours , so called truck driver stop. Truth be told they usual live up to that hype.   I just so happen to bump into a very nicer waitress names Andrea , very out going and attentive to my family's needs."
4,"Great service and atmosphere.  Can't go wrong here.  The staff is very friendly. The food is really good.  Usually get the zucchini spaghetti. Pizza is delicious (would be great if they offered a gluten free option in the future).  You can go here for drinks, appetizers, dinner and/or desserts."
4,Tortas are not the only Mexican fare served up here but are the reason I return! I tend to keep it safe with the ham and cheese torta (part sub/panini). The bread is so airy and has the right amountof sweetnes to make you just forget about the ham and just nosh on the bread. They bake it daily and bread is not for individual sale. Boo! Their fruit drinks are yummy; dining area just got expanded with a side bakery. TV's are kinda loud; needs more ventilation; parking is limited and next to tire shop but well worth the visit. Oh yeah; it's in the da hood too! But so far so safely good!
4,"My wife and I love Tapas and this is one of our favorite places for Tapas in Vegas.

We've eaten there a couple times and the food and service has always been good. 

A great place for a larger group, it's fun to order a selection of Tapas to share & pass. Be sure to also leave room to try the Paella, which is very tasty. Also, they have a variety of Sangria's worth trying.

Considering this is Vegas, I was pleasantly surprised how reasonably priced everything was. 

Even though this place is in a Mall, it doesn't feel like it. If you can, get seated outdoors. It's a great view of The Strip right across from The Wynn and fun place to people watch."
4,The best place in Charlotte for a Cheese Steak!!! Yummy!!! I've been here plenty of times and never even had a slice of pizza (and I LOVE pizza lol) but I'm too obsessed with the Cheese Steaks to even try!!! Delicious!!!
4,"Well, well, well. This past weekend I traveled up to NC for the ACC championship game. Lucky me, I used to live there so I stayed with a close friend, no need for the extra expense on the hotel. 
It was my first time being back in the city since I turned 21 and I decided to have some fun. After the game, I was feeling a little down, so we headed over to the Epicenter. This whole place was new to me. We decided to try this place out on the top floor. 

Cover was only $3 if we had a ticket to the game. So me and 4 of my girl friends went in and needed a drink right away. My eyes caught hold of this gigantic bucket thing. We rushed over to the bar and looked at the menu. We spotted the buckets and decided to start with the Adios Mofo....yeah Adios is right. Now between 5 of us we finished the night with 5 buckets. We switched back and forth between that one and the Fruit Roll Up which is my personal favorite. They have numerous other drinks, shots, bones, etc. Overall prices were decent. A bucket was 20 bucks....split between 5 people, it isn't bad. 

Howl At The Moon is a dueling piano bar. Now I have been to others, and this one is definitely the most fun. The best part about it is, they only play songs that the audience requests. You fill out a piece of paper and it goes into a pile and then they play the songs. They whole bar sings along, and has a great time! 

I do have to say, we finally got a table and sat down and the wait staff was very rude. She started off super nice, but then completely ignored us and didn't even want to take our orders anymore. Regardless, I had a GREAT time and I hope to visit one of the locations in Florida! 

This is a must if you are in the area looking for a fun night out to just let loose."
4,"My experience here with Tokyo Buffet has been all positive. Especially their selection of sushi available at this price point of restaurant. Yes, I'm sure there's a bigger and better sushi buffet available in Charlotte. But one gets typically what they pay for and this is certainly a bargain.

The typical Chinese / Asian food items were are just that - typical. Nothing outstanding, but certainly still good. Like many other reviews here, I did not try the American food items offered. Does not make sense to me to eat these while in a Oriental food place."
4,"If you've not been to a Waffle House before... well... that's pretty odd, but this is a good one to start at.  Basically, they have delicious breakfast foods, and then a variety of other lunch/dinner options, but if you're at Waffle House and you're not eating breakfast, you're doing it wrong.

It's a diner, so the atmosphere is great.  Sit up at the bar and watch them prep the food and enjoy the delicious smells, or grab a booth by the window and stare out into the parking lot while you try to ignore your hangover.

The people working here are friendly, and the establishment is clean.  The food is prepared well, and delicious.  I recommend the biscuits and gravy."
4,"This is my go to buffet in Charlotte. Well that and it's ten minutes away. Many food selection here, waitstaff is nice and clean up quickly so that plates don't pile up. The food tastes better than most buffets I've been to. The sushi is good; no fresh seafood in Charlotte and I'm from Hawaii but it was pretty good quality. I LOVE their green tea ice cream."
4,"I forgot all about ""Tuesday Sushi Slurp,"" but we were close and just love the place.  How bad could it be?

Crowded.  Packed.  Waited at the bar half an hour, finally snagged a table.  Here's something I hadn't noticed the first review but have in the dozen or so visits since:  The wait staff is scruffy.  And a bit ill-trained.  A few even appear to be dazed, kinda woozy.  They rotate waiters and bartenders, like they're exactly the same job.  Nuh-uh.  And that's the only real flaw in this otherwise fine grub factory.

If seems hardly possible that the same folks who run the House in Akron, and the one in Fairlawn also run this one.  This place is so, SO much nicer.  If they could convince the staff to tuck in their shirts, learn the menu, that sort of thing, it would become a destination restaurant.  It ain't that tough.  (I'm never going back on a Tuesday, though.  Every manner of street life was there.  Camo.  Honestly.  Camo, in a restaurant.  And is it even hunting season?)"
4,A classic egg breakfast joint. We loved the American branches of Eggspectation and today we are breakfast in the home town of Eggspectation. What treat. Fabulous smoothies like Go Bananas. Great omelettes. Terrific Belgian waffles. Great meal!
4,"Any good sandwich starts with the bread. The torta roll was soft, sweet, and lightly toasted.  They used a sweet mayo which I normally don't like, but it worked so nicely with the meat.  I got pork...Mmmmmmmm!  It was tender and tasty!  The thing that made this torta so delicious, was the avocado.  They generously covered the roll with soft perfectly ripe avocado...and it was warm. They also put a little pickled jalapeño which added a nice tang.  I could have used a little more heat.  If I lived out here, this place would be a regular spot!"
4,"This is my new sushi spot!!!!! Great place for the entire family. We Had a great time. Very large selection on the buffet bar, salad bar, sushi bar and desert bar. Fresh sushi mouth watering good!! Can't wait to go back!!"
4,"Alright, this place gets four stars because of the pizza here. It is one if the best places for pizza in Charlotte. They are also fast and friendly. I have never eaten dine in but I have ordered many take out pizzas of all kinds. 

With that said, the only reason I did not give five stars is becuase I have not had luck with other entress. I tried the meatball sub, which I will never order again, and the philly, which was so so. I have heard the italian sub is great. 

I do recommend here, but mainly for the melt in your mouth pizza. Hey, why order anything else when the name of the place is House of Pizza."
4,I stumbled on this eatery. I enjoyed the most wonderful quesadilla. Will return if I'm back in this neighborhood.
4,"What a surprise from the high-priced, huge-portions of most Vegas restaurants, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was a little place that we found one evening. We arrived early (between 5 and 7 is happy hour) and were presented with half-priced sangria's and a $3 Tapa menu.

This was the best dinner we had while in Vegas - try the roasted pepper tapa and the olives, as well as the mushroom empanada - very good. Also, the White Sangria was great - we started with half a pitcher, and quickly ordered a second half. Our whole meal was under $40 (for two people) and we were very full afterward!

Definitely a place to visit - and sit outside to people watch!"
4,"Ambiance: Most will find this to be a more modern torta restaurant compared to a traditional torta joint. It has flat screens menus to order from, tablets for payment and a open air kitchen. It's a medium sized restaurant with 13 tables inside and 4 tables outside. I would say it's on the large size for your typical torta place. Very clean and well cared for. Pan Dulce and helados sold here as well. Patrons are of all ages and backgrounds. This is a well established torta franchise in the Valley for the past decade. 

Food: Tortas most popular here but I went with the fish tacos. Pretty damn good! Cabbage was fresh, fish was lightly breaded and slightly spicy. Try the Mangoneadas a delicious frozen mango pulp with a slightly spicy chamoy (red glaze).

Price: With it being modernized I was worried prices would be inflated but they are totally fair.

Overall: A great torta/taco restaurant with a traditional backbone but modern touches."
4,"Dinner Buffett is only 9.99$ . It was very busy and food was coming out  quite often . My waiter was pleasant and kept our waters filled consistently .  They have a great variety of food  options to choose from . I'm personally in love with the salt and pepper crabs , I just love the seasoning on them and they are  quite meaty too . My only gripe with this place is the hibachi grill, this guy CAN NOT cook  that well . My food is always burned and just doesn't taste that great .  I try to just stay close and alert him when it's ready to my liking but yea.. Doesn't work that well . So now I just avoid it altogether .  Otherwise it's a good place to eat for a relatively low cost . It's not the BEST Chinese style food but it's filled with many options,low cost and quick."
4,"Cool place! The definitely is different, and is crafted to fit the place's style."
4,"Huge selection of food my god , there's literally everything here . I wouldn't say it's the best quality food we've had but for $10 you can't get much better. It was so busy , but I'm presuming it's always like that . If you're in the area and hungry give it a try."
4,"I love tapas, and this place was pretty good!   Except I was a little sick, and drinking... so I don't remember much else to type anything more."
4,"Something about walking into House of Pizza makes me want to quit life and open a restaurant. (Which is funny because I already work in a restaurant.) Maybe it's the homey atmosphere, maybe it's the food that's so good you want to hug it, maybe it's the waiters so cute you want to hug them. This is definitely one of Charlotte's hidden gems.

On the surface, it's not much to brag about, but the food more than makes up for it. From pizza and sandwiches, to Greek favorites like gyros and spanikopita, to desserts, you can't go wrong. And it's so low-priced you might as well get one of everything. Definitely a winner in my book!"
4,"Bomb.com love this place and it's yummy drinks and Popsicles!  My kiddo loved the Hawaiian torta, and the guacamole is good. Good beans too! The veggie torta could stand to be improved! It's pretty plain with mayo tomatoes and avacado ."
4,"The place set up and decor is very minimal, but how many places you could go hang out with your friends and at the same time you don't have to leave your dogs at home.  There are plenty of sitting, dogs could run free, and you are allowed to bring your own food since they don't serve any.  This is not a place for you if you want to see and be seen, but this is a very good place if you just want to hang out with your friends along with your four-legged friends."
4,"We have been there several times and had great service and food each time.  Love their pizzas as well as their Caesar's salad.  Very reasonably priced - food delivered quickly, even when crowded.  We look forward to returning often."
4,"Great food,friendly service, great location, good prices and nice comfortable surroundings . One thing guys you need to do something with the entrance, it has a feel of walking into a run down corner store !! I really feel this could put people off. If I hadn't read the reviews here on Yelp I would have kept walking !! To end on a plus I will be back and I will be telling others !!"
4,"Me gusta mucho! I was torn between three and four stars but decided on four because the prices were so reasonable. Although the food wasn't fantastically memorable, it was very good, especially since there were so many vegetarian options at a tapas bar. And I discovered I like quince. Yay! Love adding a new enjoyable food to my repertoire. Waitress was incredibly helpful and even listened to my veggie rants while also recommending wines and taking my vegetarian suggestions into consideration. Will return!"
4,"I like my hash browns covered, chunked, smothered, and diced. Then I order a plain waffle with butter and syrup. Yum! Granted there's always some shady people hanging around but it just adds to the adventure."
4,"Ah, we've been dreaming of good pizza, and Novanta doesn't disappoint.  Located in Langtree, they have an open concept, with a combination of standard tables and long tables for family style seating, as well as seating at the pizza and pasta bars.  We chose to sit at the pizza bar so we could watch the chefs in action.

We started with the Fritti appetizer.  Yes, it's all fried, but wow, was it good!  You get arancini, fried dough, and fried pasta.  I love arancini, but my favorite was the fried pasta.  It's basically meatball-sized pasta, rolled in a coating, and the deep fried.  Yum!

For our entrees, we had the Strizzo ""pasta"" (me), and P & A pizza (my husband).  The Strizzo's pasta is made with zucchini and squash, so the ""noodles"" are slightly crunchy.  The sauce is a super rich cream sauce that is absolutely delicious.  

Their pizzas are personal sized, and my husband's P & A (which stands for prosciutto and arugula) was very good.  Pizzas are made to order, and have just the right amount of toppings.  My husband only wished that larger sizes were available.  

Service was quick and friendly.  It's a real treat to sit at the pizza bar - everyone is so friendly!  

We'll definitely be back!"
4,"3.5 stars 

Howl at the Moon is one of our all time favorite places to go to and have a good time. I had to dock a star for a previous experience with a power hungry bouncer, other than that experience, its all good. I like to get there a little early to score a table and avoid the cover charge, it gets really crowded around 9, don't expect to get seats after this unless you play the vulture for your group. I advise finding drinks specials elsewhere or pre-partying at home before coming in, drink prices can rack up here on a normal night and drinks aren't particularly strong either. Once you are at your good spot, this place is so much fun. The pianists are great and can sing very well too. Be ready to sing along and dance. 

I do like the 2-3 hour happy hours you can win here, they give you special priced drinks and your first two drinks are free! There is also a small buffet included but I never tried the food. Howl at the Moon is pretty lenient when it comes to bringing outside food in, I love bringing in Libaretto's or Five Guys. 

I definitely recommend Howl at the Moon when you and your group are looking for a good time. When its time to leave, Rooftop 210 is right next to it alongside the other eateries and pubs in the Epicenter. Cheers!"
4,"Really good food here! The sour cherry tea was amazing, the owner says it is a special recipe so I will have to come back and get it from him.

I had the lamb, I guess it is marinated for 3 days before it is cooked and it was very tender. The hubby had the chicken and it was tender as well. The nan bread and hummus were dish..

Place is pretty big, but it was quiet when we went, looks very clean and the chairs are padded (a nice touch) looks like there is outside dining as well.."
4,"3.5 stars. This place has a cool vibe and is always playing live music, which I'm a huge fan of. The bartenders were all extremely nice and helpful (much better than the rooftop place across from it). Drinks were strong!!!! And I thought priced pretty good for the amount that you got. We tried the hurricane one in their ""medium"" size cup which was plenty for two people. The band that was playing that night wasn't the best but it was hilarious to listen to. My bf and I had a great time and would return!"
4,"I can't believe I'm reviewing Waffle House, but here goes.

If you have never been to a Waffle House before, the food is exactly what you'd expect: greasy, unhealthy, and strangely enticing.  I normally wouldn't put Cheese Eggs and Grits at the top of my ""to-eat"" list but few things sound better after a night of drinking.  

If you have been to a Waffle House before, the food is exactly the same as you remember.  The only distinction this location possesses is that it is very clean.  Pristine, even.  I don't know if it is always so immaculate, but I was shocked.  I'm used to a Waffle House that looks like an unkempt trailer on the inside, not a passable budget restaurant.  

The food is really worthy of only two-stars, but this location gets four because when you eat there, you feel like you must be part of some rare historical accomplishment.  My compliments to the janitor."
4,"Indulgent breakfast. Huge portions.  Eggs benedicts were amazing so were the potatoes.  I LUV Montreal breakfasts.  Seems like they always come with a bagel too, as if a begel isn't already its own meal!"
4,Never had a bad dish & love dining in at this location. Service is usually top notch.
4,Definitely the nicest Waffle House I have ever been to. Really friendly service and delicious breakfast.
4,"Come for the delicious pizza, and stay for the amazing conversations! 
While the look of the old building and interior decor may not seem that impressive, the pizzas that they make are well worth stopping in for. My wife and I each got a small salad and then split the veggie pizza.  The pizza sauce was a little sweet but not overly so.  They are very generous with the toppings, and the crust (flaky, soft, and yeasty with a nice handle on it) was perfect.  The best part of the ambience here is the motley crew of folk who dinner here, from local urbanites to nerdy blue collar types who just want to talk about movies and games with their colleagues while chomping on some fine Italian fare.  Be sure to bring a few bucks for juke box and listen to the local chatter in between jams. Also, on the positive note the price is right and staff are friendly."
4,"Love the Pizza, salads and subs not to mention the great smells inside. Personally I do not care for the pasta dishes because the sauce is a little  heavy for my taste. Overall I really like this place and the service has always been great. It is a nice place to chill and chat with friends or family."
4,Just a good ol' American breakfast with hearty portions and good presentation - not to mention delicious!  Love the hash browns with grilled onions ... oh so GOOD!!
4,"I came here with a Bachelorette party, so my review might be skewed a bit. It was so much fun - I hadn't been to a dueling piano bar since college. 

They basically played all the songs I requested (win.) and humored the Bachelorette by getting her up on stage to dance (great photo-op.) - everyone was friendly, which helped as well.

$1 beers - nice. And the slightly nasty-tasting buckets of random booze and girly mixers were the best $70 I've ever spent in the name of my friends."
4,"Nice place with the usual breakfast fare you would find in an American diner. Prices not bad for the area. Most of the food was very good. Only complaint was an order of eggs over hard. Usually, the yolks are broken but they just flipped them and left them on the grill until the yolk was hard. This made the rest of the egg fairly inedible because it was way over cooked."
4,New open feel is nice. Still working out the kinks but smiles all around and food looks just as good as before. A long line to go.
4,"comfortable environmental, great service, good food and convenient.  nothing bad to say, and they can accommodate a small group separately if needed."
4,Great breakfast.  Large portions so be careful how much you order.  The waffles wee excellent.  The blueberries pancakes were just OK.  Too cakey for me and not many blueberries at all.  You do get real maple syrup but that seems to be the case all over Montreal.  The fruit plate was huge and had a great assortment of fruit.
4,"I cant believe Cafe Ba Ba Reeba was one of the best meals I had in Vegas.The food and drinks were really good and our service superb, much better than at the Chicago location. I had two different types of sangria to start. The passion fruit and blackberry. The blackberry was definitely the better one.For food, we started with the Pintxos platter which was so good that we ended up ordering another before leaving. The quince and cheese is not to be missed even if it sounds like an odd combination. Another seemingly odd combination that works is the shrimp and eggsalad pintxo. Yum! We ordered some standard tapas restaurant fare such as bacon wrapped dates and empanadas and others. Good times. Good food. 

Overall, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba was one of the less expensive but very enjoyable restaurants we enjoyed on the Las Vegas strip. Also, hit up their happy hour for a delightfully drunken time. Or so I hear..."
4,"Was looking for a new place to try in the Lake Norman area for a rather large party for a birthday dinner.  Called around to several places, with no luck for reservations since it was Valentine's weekend.  Novanta gladly accepted our large party and so glad they did!  I have to say I was a little concerned over the menu not having a large selection of items, and many of the people in our party being picky eaters, but when the food came out, everyone was happy!  The toppings on the pizza are high quality, and cover just enough of the pizza not to overwhelm the chewy pizza crust and delicate tomato sauce.  We also tried the lasagna, which had layers of flavor (especially in the bottom of the dish!).  

The only downside was our waiter was apparently in the weeds, and with a large party, was unable to keep up with refiling of beverages and totally forgot the appetizer.  Perhaps putting two servers on a table that large would have been better, especially seeing how busy our waiter was.  Overall, they got our party seated on time and the food came out perfectly, so I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area!!"
4,This was fine for a breakfast joint. Prices were reasonable and the waitstaff was great. The only problem was how long it took the food to come out. Even though it wasn't busy it still took about 30 minutes before our breakfast was served.
4,Loved it all the way from Toronto...food was amazing but the noise wasn't pleasant .. I'd reccomend getting the all American
4,"Ok so here's the deal with BaBaReeba's. I've been going there since they first opened. I was excited to know that we were gonna have a Tapas place. So It's on the corner of the outside of Fashion Show Mall next To Ra Sushi and Capital Grill.  This is a Spanish Restaurant. I watched people walk out because they didn't understand the menu or they were looking for Enchilada Especial...WHITE PEOPLE....THIS IS A SPANISH RESTAURANT. SPANISH  DOES NOT EQUAL MEXICAN....So of course BaBaReeba's changed their menu to better suit the Vegas crowd. They added Mmmm mmmm Entrees. I do miss a lot of tapas that they removed. But the entrees aren't bad.  They have the cold and hot tapas menus ranging from the Gazpacho soup - to the stuffed mushrooms, the cold platter with ham, chorizo, manchego, and olives with toast with a fresh tomato puree. Mmmm....
The paella isn't bad. They also have skewers of meats to select from and a caldera....Mmmm Different meats, seafood, etc. The Caldera is pretty salty - if you can't handle it, I'd stay clear. Desserts. are cute little morsels that a big guy like me can chew like a stick of gum. But otherwise delicious. The different spanish wines and sangrias are great. I actually took one of their Passion Fruit Sangria and made a few changes to make it my own. 
So Babareeba's offers paella cooking classes, happy hours, wine tastings, scotch tastings, flamenco dancing, and special guest bands. It's pretty cool. I can definitely stay there for hours and chit chat about things. Never had a problem with service - but you know some times you get a bad batch of employees. I agree with the Firefly. Very good, but sometimes I can't hear myself there. It gets a little crowded. But this place...decent. Try it....you may like it."
4,"Great restaurant... Clean, positive ambiance and a welcoming environment. Staff has always been helpful and prompt in processing orders.

The food is fresh, and the signature bread is freshly baked right before you order. The kabobs are tender, well marinated and overall, do justice to the authenticity of this Persian food staple.

My largest complaint with Flame Kabob is what seeks to be, oddly enough, a supply constraint. On 3 separate occasions, I have gone to the restaurant to order my favorite dish, the chicken kubideh plate, only to find out they ran out of chicken. To me, this is unacceptable, especially if it is such a popular dish. I hope they remedy the situation in the future."
4,"We came around closing time from the airport desperate for some food. They were kind enough to accommodate us.

Food was really good!!

We got the chicken shawarma - I loved the spices on the chicken! So different than what I've tasted before!

Also got a chicken kubideh wrap. Was tasty, unique and had rice in it too! 

Overall, a really good place to eat! Not the best regarding ambience and the location but then again, we were there really late when all the stores around them were also closed. 

Recommend the chicken shawarma and chicken kubideh wrap!"
4,"Saved by the hostess. Palma greeted us with a warm and sincere smile when we walked in. We were off to a good start. The waitress was more blah, which probably related to it being late in her shift. 

My son and I ordered two cheese pizzas, both of which came with salads. The salads were superb, but the pizza tasted very plain to me, and my son wasn't a fan. This was surprising for both of us because we love sweet and the sauce is very sweet. Additionally, it's the same owners as Brooklyn South, which we love. Just different.

The atmosphere is borderline perfect, the place is clean, and the hostess is excellent at her job, so 4 Stars. Palma told me the Chicken Parmesan is incredible. I'll be back to check it out, but at $22, it better come on a gold platter and have my first name written in the cheese. 

On the way home, my son and I sang along to two rap songs:

""I only love my bed and my mamma"" 
and
""I got diamonds by the bollo."""
4,"For a waffle house this place is a little better than the others,, Staff is exceptional, and the place is always VERY Clean.... Awesome job..."
4,"If Yelp wasn't so hung up on integers, I'd give this place 3 and a half stars.  It was a HOT July evening in the Queen City and so the wife and I decided to cool off by going to a Greek pizza joint and getting HOT food.  Choo godda poblem widdat??   As others have said, the meatball sub and the steak sub seemed to be the signature items.  Meatball sub was a bit salty and it was overflowing with meat and cheese.  At first all I could see was cheese but then the cheese seemed to vanish in front of me and I actually wanted more cheese (must have been the heat, it was a HOT day).  Went through two soda pops because it's HOT in Charlotte in July. Wife really liked the steak sub.  All in all, it was a satisfying meal.  Good people watching too.  We were in and out in 30 minutes and for under $20.  And when we got outside it was still very HOT.  We really enjoyed the HOT of PIZZA and all the HOT food they serve.  Oh my freakin' lord, it is so very HOT in Charlotte in July."
4,"Do not let the location scare you off. It looks pretty trashy in that area but so far I have met nice people offering quality at the busineses I have used. Like that $3.00 car wash down the street. I am there every week.

So for Tortas. I agree it is not fast but you see them cooking your order with fresh ingredients and that just takes some time. If they are real busy at noon just be ready to stand in line.

I had the chicken Torta and I did not add any sauces - do that because it is a little bland. The people next to me said it is just understood you will go to the sauce bar and get what you prefer to spice it up. Lots of food and I enjoyed every bite. The fries were delicious but on the greasy side. 

The restaurant is clean and they have lots of seating. In addition I have found that places like this have a clientel that is ready and willing to talk to you so ask about what they ordered or meet a new friend. Try that out in Scottsdale or on Camelback and you get a very different response. (My staff hesitates to go to lunch with me because I ""meet"" people).

I will be going back here to get tacos and some of that other wonderful stuff they offer. Red Devil (best ever wings) is just down the street and  now I will have to share where I go while my car gets washed."
4,"Great food. Wait was a little bit too long, we are looking around 30-40 minutes AFTER ordering the food. But over all it was good experience. Need to hire more staff to keep up with the customers coming in. My eggs beni were amazing, super fresh and perfectly made, not too oily or overdone. Just perfect"
4,I love the 31 flavors ice cream inspired iced coffees.   I've had the butter pecan and rocky road.  Their inexpensive breakfast wrap and tasty hash browns make this trip complete. Yummy!
4,"Solid breakfast spot. Lots of options- omelets, pancakes, waffles, etc. Went to this place for brunch both days. Good service."
4,"My wife and I have been getting regular massage here and absolutely love it.  Easy to schedule an appointment, great location across from Casbah, etc.  they have these massage chairs you sit in while you wait that are awesome.  Nice staff.  We'll keep coming!"
4,"One word for this place! DELICIOUS! 

Of course you have to wash down your delicious Torta with a aqua fresca!!! I will be back for sure!!! Haven't tried the ice cream but it looked very good! We need one in Chandler or Casa Grande!"
4,"I love Waffle House, I really do. Unfortunately in the 3 times I've come to this location, the waffle has been burnt. Today I got a burnt waffle AND my order was wrong. I ordered a waffle and a covered hash browns (covered means with cheese) and I got a waffle that was so obviously dark and burnt and a hash browns with no cheese. I pointed out the no cheese and the waitress was very nice so I didn't send it back. But then I dug into the waffle, I mean, maybe I was wrong and it just looked dark. They wouldn't give me a waffle that was burnt or not up to Waffle House standards would they? And while the great taste was still there, it was so crisp as to be hard. The syrup had to soften it up a little. I looked around at other people's waffles and they were light in color so I imagine they were soft and fluffy in texture. I pointed this out as I paid and the cashier very nicely offered to not charge me but of course I paid for it...I ate the whole thing and it still tasted good, not just the awesome waffles ice come to expect from Waffle House. I don't send stuff back unless it's just horrible, plus you have to wait a long time for the replacement. I just wish this Waffle House could be consistent. It's always a gamble when I come here and I have to go in knowing this and be okay with it."
4,"Really good pizza. Good service. Interesting atmosphere. Sort of European. NOT noisy! I was able to have a conversation with my wife. The don't put salt and pepper on the table which always strikes me as an affectation and there are no paper towels in the restroom. You have to use those nasty fart blowers or wipe your hands on your pants. 
We would go back. Did I say the pizza was really good?"
4,"All you can eat special is a great buy. Food is served hot and accurately cooked to order. Service is very friendly. Nothing fancy, good comfort food better than fast food."
4,"It is a nice place to listen to live music, drink with friends but not the best place to dance because the little space in front of the stage is small. 

That didn't stop us from dancing. My friends dragged me and my wife to the front and we had everyone's eyes on us. It was before 11pm and not many were drunk or dancing. We had quite a few shots and started dancing and soon the whole crowd joined us.

It was fun! But do keep in mind that early to mid twenties might feel a bit out of place. I'm in my early thirties btw. And most ppl there are late twenties to forties.

As for the drinks, they are good. Jaeger Bombs and tequila shots are great! Definitely recommend it."
4,"Went on our 2 year anniversary.  Sushi is awesome, I wanted to try the duck which was suggested by our waiter.  The sushi when it came was colorful and was wonderful.  My wife and I loved the sushi and she was full after her 2 rolls that she ordered.  When my duck came it smelled great, but that was about it.  The duck was chewy and lacked a great plum/spicy flavor.  Some of the duck was very chewy and some pieces where way over cooked and crunchy.  When the waiter asked what I though of the meal he suggested I told him that the duck was not all that great and he apologized.  Overall the meals where good, the atmosphere is nice, tables are clean, staff is nice, and a great location for a summer night stroll or winter night stroll for some coffee if your bundle up."
4,"Awesome Happy Hour!

We came here at the tail end of our time in Vegas, if only we had found it sooner! Loved the Sangria, I tried the one with frangelico and it wasn't my bag so the server let me switch to the house white sangria. It was sweet, fruity and very refreshing on such a hot day. A steal at $3 a glass, so I had 4. We should have just gotten a pitcher.

We also had practically everything on the Happy Hour menu, some standouts for me where the bacon covered dates, the chicken and chorizo skewers and the spiced potatoes with tomato aioli. Yummmmmmers! I do wish they had lighter and fresher choices like say a ceviche. The seafood salad was close but could have used more salt and lemon. Also more veggie options would be good, the mushroom empanada was good - but very heavy.

I had the the coconut almond cake and apple crumble for dessert. I have to say the coconut almond cake was really delicious.

Considering we paid as much for 2 appetizers at Social House the night before, $50 for 2 people to eat some tasty treats to their hearts contents was Alright by me!"
4,"Gawd - I wish my dog was canine friendly. But he's not. So, when I'm in NoDa and I want my puppy fix, I can just head to The Dog Bar and play with some pups. As you can probably tell, this is not a bar for every dog. If your pup is teeny and/or easily intimidated, it may not be the best fit...especially during a busy night. 

As Tonya said, if you're not a dog person, I wouldn't venture in here. The dogs are friendly and sociable...many of them have no qualms strutting up to you, asking for an ear scratch or a belly rub. Cuetness. So, it really is a dog heaven and haven - astroturf, plenty of bars, areas to sniff and play, etc. And the bar is pretty sweet too! Drinks are affordable, the owners friendly and the patrons cool.

Even though Riley (my dog) will never be a guest of The Dog Bar, I'm happy to go in his honor every once in a while to grab a beer and give some love to the neighborhood pooches!"
4,"They've got a couple vegetarian menu items, which is good!     And overall a good variety of food.       I really enjoyed the Burrotote,  which is carne asada with beans and avocado in a burrito.      Very filling,  very satisfying and the ingredients seem good quality and fresh.   

They do a lot with avocado here,  if the menu is any indication - mmmmmmmm!"
4,"I would rather eat anywhere else other than a buffet. If i had the choice of buffets though, I would come here. My family has been coming here since they have opened because it's spacious enough to accompany my huge family and has a wide selection of food. 

The best thing about this buffet is the amounts of seafood they have. Many Chinese buffets have started to charge extra for crab and I can see why, but it steers people away. They don't have crab legs here, which kinda sucks, but imagine how much profit they could make off of that. I love the chicken wings they have here! It's so succulent and the flavor is so different than other wings at other buffets. The sushi isn't half that bad for buffets either. Some things though I think could be a little more fresh. It wouldn't hurt to have different choices of fruit or putting out a little less gruesome looking oysters. No matter what though, Tokyo will still be my family's one stop buffet until a better one opens up around the area."
4,"The pizza is great! The staff is quick and friendly. The appetizers and salads are also delicious. They make their own mozzarella right on site, which is pretty neat! We've been multiple times and will definitely be going back!"
4,"I've been going to this place for many years. They are renowned for their steak subs, and not there Pizza. Their steak subs are superior to anything on the menu. Nowhere in the Charlotte area has cheese steak subs like House Of Pizza."
4,My wife and I had breakfast here twice during our long weekend in Montreal. We really liked the food and when we are back in town we will definitely stop here again.
4,"Dogs and alcohol!! Whoohoo!! Who wouldn't adore this idea?!  I love coming here and seeing all the dogs having fun and playing.  It's a very relaxed atmosphere...fun, carefree, and just al over cool.  It's surprisingly clean and neat...I guess depending on the day.  The dogs have special area to play in and there is an indoor and outdoor section for patrons.

The staff is friendly.  I really couldn't say anything bad about this place.  Whoever thought of it was a genius.  Good people, good drinks...best of all, dogs!!! Love it!"
4,"I was 100% skeptical of this place. I live right around the corner and have passed it many times. I finally decided to give it a try one night when I was looking for a certain type of pizza, totally greasy and bad for you. Well this place hit the spot of exactly what I was looking for. 
I went in to place my order since it was the first time I had ordered from them and honestly the inside did not impress me, in fact it made me a little worried even. With that said I don't know that I would take the time to go in and eat but I will probably be ordering to go from here a lot in the future. 
I ordered a large pizza with pineapple, half with jalapeno and the other half with black olives and it hit the spot. I think next time I will get light on the sauce as I am not a huge fan of sauce but it was exactly what I was looking for. I also ordered the mozzarella sticks which were just frozen and fried, don't know that I will get those again but the pizza I will for sure!"
4,The food is good and the place is pretty big and clean. I went with my family and the staff was nice and knowledgeable but its a little pricey compared to my regular kabob spot.
4,Food was excellent.  Service was excellent.  Value is good.  Entire staff overall very friendly.  I will be back for sure.
4,"I've been a fan of this place for years. Over the weekend, I took a group of friends for some hangover food. They were very skeptical when they saw the decor. One friend actually said, ""worst decision ever.""

Always remember kids: never doubt the 100 pound girl that eats like a 300 pound man. Write that down.

House of Pizza is not the fanciest of places. I'm pretty sure that if we could go back in time that everything would still look exactly the same. Probably reminds you a lot of a pizza and sub place from your childhood.

I'm a big fan of their subs. I bounce back and forth between the Philly and the turkey. They even have one simply called ""bacon."" Warning: my friend had to take a bacon induced nap after wards. Although, I still think that may have had to do with the fact that he also consumed a dozen wings.

Great prices on the menu. They also run a daily spaghetti special. The salads are good sized. Very old school. For the Greek, they bring the bottle of dressing right to the table. The pizza is pretty good as well.

The staff is friendly. It feels warm and inviting when you walk into the restaurant. The service is okay. Some days slower than others... but nothing to complain about.

My friends offered up an apology to me after our adventure here. They are new fans... and will definitely be going back."
4,"Really was a whole lot of fun! Wasn't expecting much so I was pleasantly surprised. We were there for a Humane Society of Charlotte event on Friday and had a great time. Free food just okay, but the entertainment was hilarious!"
4,Lots of different options here for breakfast.  My Mocha Coffee was very good and they offer fresh squeezed orange juice which is always great.  My wife loved her omelette and especially the potatoes.  I had the bacon waffle eggs benedict but was disappointed in the waffle.  Capped it off with a nutella banana crepe dessert which was delicious.
4,"The food was good here and the staff were very nice and helpful. Service was quick and the ambience was quiet and low key!


Perfect for a quiet brunch over conversation!"
4,"Came here directly after arriving from the airport.

Ambiance: Spacious with a diner meets restaurant feel. The bathroom is downstairs and it feels a little sketchy because it faces an underground parking lot.  It feels like anyone can come and kill you and no one would hear you scream.

Service: Good

Food: They have a whole page on egg Benedict so it was on!  I had the California  Dreaming with bacon and their quinoa. It was so, so good! The boyfriend had the Montreal Benny and it was good as well, but I liked the California Dreaming better.

Would definitely return (but might skip the bathroom)!"
4,Awesome happy hour spot and always good times. They play anything from Motown to Jay z!
4,What can you say about any Waffle House. They do an excellent job at being what they are trying to be. I always enjoy the food and the service. If you're expecting it to be something it isn't then you'll likely be disappointed. I will go back to this one and enjoy every greasy morsel.
4,It's not fancy and sometimes it can be a little ghetto depending on the folks inside but the food is good and the service excellent.
4,"This is a fun bar with dueling pianos, drums, and other musical instruments.  There are four performers who take requests and they were good, wow.  The service is friendly and attentive.
Patrons danced and sang and everyone seemed to have a great time.
We had more fun here than Whiskey River located one story below."
4,"One of my favorite truly local Charlotte spots.  It feels like you are walking into a restaurant that hasn't changed a lot over the years.   Quality Italian dishes, my favorite being the Ricotta shells and cheese!  The garlic bread is fantastic.  Their pizza isn't the best in Charlotte, but it's very solid.  I've also had their toasted Turkey and cheese sub, which was very good.  Prices are very reasonable!"
4,"Found this place on yelp had pretty decent reviews I did try the chicken tacos all I can say is WOW.
Service was okay but in fairness this place was very busy which is also a good sign for this part of the valley.
I don't get down this way much but when I do this will be on my short list."
4,"Good customer service. Food was good and fresh. The only thing I didn't like the way the hash browns were made. It was too oily and had a strong oily smell. It smelled like a strong canola oil. Not sure. Either way, the smell was just too oily. It tasted good, but could have been better. Their coffee was great. They are not greedy in regards to coffee. The sizes are big. Love it. As I said the only downside was the oily part. Otherwise, it is a good place"
4,"Great service (unless it's right before closing), great food every time.   Creative drinks that don't disappoint!  They have doors that open to the picturesque square."
4,"So I have passed up this place because it's teeny bopper college crowd type. I went the night that Miami played Clemson and it was so fun. It was a more mature and calm crowd. There is a live band I am not sure how they pick the songs they sing, but I started making requests as the night went along. When I arrived it was 90's rock n roll and country hits as the night went along I heard more current tunes hip hop and and hits I enjoyed. FYI-It's super loud! There was one bar tender I liked and she made the drinks strong I don't remember her name, but she had black hair. The other had a resting bitch face so I avoided her. It's a great place to get drunk for an affordable price. I liked the bathroom attendant. She was kind and helpful to so many of the tipsy woman in there. The restrooms were clean. They also have a groupon currently and you can use it for entrance and drinks good to use for a party of two or more. It's super crowded typically. I recommend."
4,"I've been to this location twice.  The first time was two years ago on a Saturday , and it was amazing!  We had so much fun and sang along all night long. 

 My most recent experience, a Friday evening, was not as fun.  Very few people were dancing, possibly because of the songs people were requesting.  To be honest, on of the performers was not that good of a singer, and we could hardly hear her - even with a microphone.

Both times the service and the drinks were outstanding.  If you go you should check out the buckets of booze for groups."
4,"In a bizarre turn of events, not one of the 6 people at our table ordered pizza in this supposed House of Pizza. Apparently our friends who brought us here have never even tried their pizza and they used to frequently order from this place when they lived nearby. i for one was very satisfied with my decision. i ordered the lasagna which comes with a salad and garlic bread. The salad is bare bones with lettuce, peppers, a tomato, onions and dressing. The lasagna was delightful. There was no burnt edges, just perfectly cooked as promised. Rather than just a slice of garlic bread, it is really more like a small loaf of garlic bread. It was perfect for making little lasagna sandwich bites with the garlic bread that i so thoroughly enjoy doing. Why don't Italian places offer a lasagna sandwich? or do they?

As far as draft beer choices: Budweiser....and Budweiser.  That's it. Figured what the hell, haven't done the Bud Heavy in years. For $2.25, it came in an overly frozen/frosted little mug. It worked."
4,"As others have said, it's a Waffle House and you need to base your expectations accordingly. HOWEVER, the staff here was AWESOME when they were short handed and slammed on Mother's Day. Once seated, they got our drinks out quick and kept checking in. We were in the loop on where our order was (behind 2 x mega-take out order) and they apologized to us for the wait. When they missed an item from our order, it was taken off no questions asked. They called in what looked like a manager-type / off duty bouncer to help expedite orders and food began to fly out of that kitchen. I'm impressed, really. I get less attention and care from ""better"" restaurants and this place needs some respect. Good work to the crew on Sunday morning! Recommended."
4,"Excellent deal on Happy Hour! it's Monday-Fridays I believe, and you have to sit at the high tables around the  bar.

Most happy hour places in town are only until 6 pm, and I found out this place has it until 7. All the sangria are half off and $3 tapas (about 8 or so you can select from the happy hour menu)

We tried a pitcher of their blackberry sangria (it's about 6 small glasses), beacon wrapped dates, calamari and some other stuff that i forgot the names of. But the dates and calamari are a must! it's soooo good!

I didn't give it 5 stars because the lighting on the inside is very dark... I could barely see the menu. I'm sure it's more for ambiance, but they could turn up the light a little bit. Also parking in the Fashion Show has  become a pain. I went during mid-week and still spend a while looking for parking spaces in the garage."
4,"Three words: half price sushi.

Sure, it's only on Tuesdays and you'd better make a reservation 2-3 days in advance, but you'll be glad you did.

House of Hunan was the first restaurant we ate in when we came to Medina, and it set an expectation that was quickly deflated when we realized it was one of the only refined restaurants in town.  Ah, well.

The funny thing about House of Hunan is how much Asian influence there is on the menu.  Japanese, Chinese and Thai are all represented.

My hubby and I are (borderline) sushi snobs, and we've been impressed every time with the variety and freshness of sushi and sashimi here.  One of my favorite dishes to order for lunch is the Chirashi.

Plus, they have a waterfall wall and private dining areas where you remove your shoes and sit at floor level while letting your feet hang in the area underneath, and they give you little chocolate mint sticks with your fortune cookie at the end of the meal. 

Did I mention it's walking distance from my house?  

Bonus."
4,"We had a 3:30 fly out of Vegas, so we decided to go and have a quick lunch.
We had the 4 different tapas (the ones recommended by the menu) and were outstanding, I wanted to try the Paella but i was the only one who want it and is recommended for 2 or more people and I didnt know if at the airport they would allow me to have restaurant left over, so we decided to have just the tapas, the sangria is great and I had 2 mojitos which were really good.
All and all, great food and drinks, we'll go back again and try different food."
4,"The ice cream is great, the rib eye tacos and burritos are good, the tortas are ehhhh."
4,Great friendly service. The servant took his time to explain the menu and the surrounding area of fun things to do. Food was good & a large menu options.
4,"First thing about house of pizza is that the atmosphere is wonderful. The dim lights and the old decor shows that this place is a place of character.  

Second is the food. It isn't fine dining or a hipster modern menu, but an old school Italian restaurant classic to the style of the     
Southern States. The spaghetti is great, the lasagna is delicious, the pizza ironically is so so. ( not bad at all, but not awesome) 

Third is that this is a local restaurant, and not a Chain. I felt noticed and cared for here. I felt more treated like a person and not just another customer.

I will be back sooner than later. Especially because their spaghetti lunch deal seems very good."
4,"Does your dog love to meet new people and make new furry friends? If so, tell me what that's like because I have one angry six pound Yorkie suffering from little man syndrome. He's the bully on the playground.

Anyways, this bar is not made for my tiny terror... but it is still one of my favorite spots to grab a beer. A great place for dog owners and lovers. Enjoy a drink outside while the pooches run around and play. 

My group of friends actually ended up here one night on a birthday bar crawl. A roll-the-dice event and someone randomly picked The Dog Bar. Hands down the best stop of the night. The owners and staff were so friendly. The patrons all laid back. It was a really fun night... and none of us brought a dog.

So if you've got a friendly dog or just enjoy dogs in general, this is the place for you. Warning to non-dog owners, one stop here may make you want to run to the Humane Society and adopt one immediately."
4,"We came here for breakfast after stopping by a different location to eat. We walked in and was greeted by all the staff members which were very friendly and helpful. We were given a table and drinks immediately. We finally decided what we wanted to eat it within five minutes of ordering our food was hot fresh and at our table. 

This is all we ask for a friendly service, a good meal and quick. If you're looking for breakfast lunch or dinner and have a quick with the friendly staff I would recommend this place.  I am sure others have had different experiences here, but as far as my experience I will be returning to this Waffle House."
4,"I just went to House of Hunan for the first time yesterday. I heard from some friends it is a cool place with great food. I went with a couple friends and we had to wait for a table to clear for about ten minutes before we were seated. Mostly our fault it was packed on a Saturday afternoon. My initial impression was a good one, the place had a cool layout with Asian decor, a minor complaint was I wish they had more booths and tables. 

The menu had a good amount of variety: Sushi, fried pork and chicken meals, tofu, and a lot more. Our dishes were fantastic and didn't take long at all to bring out. Each of our dishes came with a side of rice of our choice but no egg rolls. I had honey walnut chicken, came out hot and could tell was made with love and not thrown together carelessly, which was fantastic. At the end the bill was $60 for three people, which included the sides, drinks and dinner. I think it was a bit pricy, so do keep that in mind if you want to come here.

In all The House of Hunan is indeed a very nice place to come and try if you want something new. But you may end up with a larger bill than expected, so this may not necessarily be a place to go to every weekend but more a once in a while type place."
4,"Usually when I have a falafel, I review those chickpeas, but in this case the bread is the clear standout. It is not a Pita Bread, but the menu says Persian Bread and its like a flatbread. In this case it was hot and fresh out of the oven, but it still was able to fold and form a sandwich around the small pellets of falafel and lettuce, tomato also. Falafel was on top of this bread becuase it wasn't a pita so that was different. I went in for the $3.99 special (which is just sandwich), but for $5.99, you get great fluffy rice, one dolma which was perfect and then a small side of marinated onions which were great for the falafel. The Tzitica sauce was good, but you will need more than what they give you. It is tasty. Looks like kabobs are the specialty and the falafel itself was also way above average - brownish in color inside, hot, small and well spiced. A very good falafel in a town of pretenders and its not even all abiout the falafel."
4,"It's in a little abandoned strip mall and its a little hole in the wall, but I really liked it. Walked there from campus. This place was my first gyro of all time and I happy it took my gyro virginity. Get the lamb gyro with fries and a diet raspberry snapple. Quality for like 6.99."
4,"Pretty decent breakfast place with a lot of options. The portions are pretty substantial, and the waiter was especially polite. When I didn't finish my meal, he came by to ask if I had any feedback."
4,"Cheap, fresh food, fast... 24 hours a day.  What's not to like?  Sure, sometimes it's a lil greasy but, it's not as bad as some and in a 24 hour breakfast joint like this, a lil grease is to be expected.  

This location is a lil newer and cleaner than the average Waffle House.  They make up food that's just as good as all the others... my typical orders are the biscuits and gravy, grilled chicken sandwich or various breakfast combos (but never the waffle - don't go there).   They have a pretty good salad, if you're ever in an no-grease mood while at Waffle House. lol

Trust me and try the biscuits and gravy (gluttony) or plain grilled chicken sandwich (healthier)... they delish!

Good people watching.

See ya there!"
4,First time to Waffle House and we were not disappointed. Selection is basic but service was friendly and the hot and delicious was served in under 5 minutes. We were headed out of town and this place was perfect for a hot meal on the go.
4,"The first time I went to Howl at the Moon was with my brother.  I spent the night singing loudly along with every song and continuously requesting songs that I hadn't heard in awhile.  The musicians are very talented, but I would not recommend coming if you're not ready to sing along and enjoy the music.

I felt the drinks are a bit pricey, but affordable, and the service is pretty good...even on really crowded nights.  If you are planning on going on a weekend, you might want to get there early if you want to sit down.

I don't think this is a ""regular"" spot for most people, but definitely worth visiting every once and a while."
4,"The Dog Bar is a great concept & it always appears to be a happening place.  Unfortunately, my Milo is still ""intact"" & won't ever be able to partake in the fun here.

My boyfriend & I came here on Saturday & they were having a St. Pawdy's Day party, which was a lot of fun.  Plenty of people were out hanging out & there were quite a few doggies.  What I like is that they're free to roam about the fenced in bar & they even had kids swimming pools set up for the doggies to get in.

The atmosphere is very casual & not pretentious. I love the recent remodel they did, with adding a long, huge table out front & a nice awning-type roof out front.

Keep in mind, parking there is extremely limited & even more so if the food trucks are there."
4,Reminds you of buffets when food was good and inexpensive! Service is great as well. They have a regular buffet but also have a sushi bar and hibachi grill as well!
4,"Good brunch menu with many options. This location feels like a bar. I have been to other locations with outside seating and preferred that. 

They have free wifi if you ask for a password which is great for yelping ;)

As for food - my eggs were great. I liked the pairing of the greens with the eggs, bread and sauce. It was well executed. The potatoes were a bit blend and dry for my taste. I tried to add ketchup to them, but didn't help.

I liked that the served fruit with the dish. I enjoy fruit at all times of the day.

My freshly squeezed orange juice was sweet and tasty. My boyfriend ordered a smoothie. The smoothie tasted healthy. It tasted like it had fresh fruit and yogurt, but needed something extra for flavor.

Overall, I liked the place and will be back. Hoping to try the crepe next time. Will avoid the potatoes."
4,"No more half price sushi.  

I've been in mourning for the past three months, since they discontinued the popular Tuesday night offering.  Not to worry, they still have tasty happy hour specials and their food really is worth the full price.  

House of Hunan caters to larger groups (if you call ahead), and if you come with someone celebrating a birthday, they will bring a scoop of ice cream with a sparkler out after the meal.

Now that it's summertime, I suspect they will start opening their front windows during the day.  Those are the seats you want, and sushi really is a nice meal on a warm day.  Be sure to ask about their specialty rolls.. the ones not listed on the menu.

Service with a smile, and still walking distance from our home."
4,Good Asian food for a great price! The seaweed salad is pretty good and they have a wide variety of sushi too
4,"My friend and I stumbled upon Tokyo Grill & Buffet because another buffet restaurant that we were going to go to was closed for remodeling. We actually ended up here after searching for another one on yelp. Thank you fellow yelpies! 

This place opened up in a strip mall that is close to UNCC next to Big Lots. If anyone has been in this strip lately they know that a lot of the businesses have moved out and it is looking a little rundown. Even as we pulled up, my friend and I kind of gave each other a look like ""are we sure about this?"" But do not let the outside discourage you! 

This place is AWESOME!! The buffet has everything you could ever want! There are Chinese, Japanese, and American options. They have sushi and hibachi stations. The buffet has tons of seafood options. 

The price for the buffet is steal. It is only $6.99 for lunch and $9.99 for dinner. With all of the amazing options on the buffet it would be hard to leave this place and not feel like you got your money's worth. In fact, you are going to leave this place feeling like you stole from them! That's how good it is for such an amazing price! 

Lots of businesses in the University area seem like they struggle to stay in business. My hope is that place will be able to survive."
4,"We went here for breakfast with the wife and 2 kids. I ordered the veggie omelette, the wife ordered 2 scrambled eggs with sausage and the kids ordered bagel with cream cheese. The toast was excellent. My omelette was good, though not ""eggceptional"". I might have ordered the wrong item on their menu. I should have gone with their Benedict dishes. The service was awesome, and is worth going back for. Will order the right dish next time."
4,"I have lived down the street from The Dog Bar for over 5 years but only ventured in this past Fall when my sister got a pup.  It is really great for not just the dogs but the humans too!  They have great beer on tap, prices are very reasonable, bartenders always friendly and there are cute dogs running around having a blast!

When we bring the puppy here she is legit tired for the next 3 days, its a great way for her to socialize and us too.  99% of the people I have encountered here are great except you do sometimes get people who openly admit to not liking dogs and then get mad when one of them jumps on them, uh hello its a dog bar don't come in if you can't deal with that!!

My only tiny complaint is that there are times when the bathroom smells like the dogs and maybe some cats have been using it, but other than that it is surprisingly clean and people are good about cleaning up after the dogs.  Overall though I really like it here and will continue to come down so the puppy can get her play time and I can get my drink time in!!"
4,"There's a part of me that wants to give this restaurant like a 2, and part of me that wants to give it a 5. It's great for what it's great for, but you should be aware when you're going to hit this place that it's a particular type of Italian food that I like to refer to as ""ghetto Italian."" 

It's kind of like the Italian food you'd make at home, but slightly better. I haven't had their pizzas, but I've had their veggie lasagna and a few other pasta dishes. They are always delicious, but not date-night, wearing your stilettos delicious. They are delicious in the, ""Hey, I just was shopping at Wal-Mart and I'd like to pig out on a huge lasagna"" kind of way.

The service is pretty fast, the decor is pretty cheesy, and the food is solid. It's worth investigating...and it's the kind of place I come back to again and again, without really meaning to. It's just there, and the hot ravioli calls to me like a beacon in the night."
4,"Let me start by saying how much I hate Las Vegas but am forced to attend an annual conference there. In this city of waste, it is hard to get past worrying that by the time you get home, all of the natural resources of the planet will have been used up. 

One of the few bright spots is Babareeba. I was introduced to this fun spot by a friend a few years ago and keep going back. Crazy for their white sangria. The bits of fruit are a delicious touch. The small plates are great and really enough to share. The food is tasty and delivered quickly. My favorite this time around was an empanada with goat cheese and raisins. Fantastic! 

A nice pairing of this cafe is to visit the Guggenheim exhibit across the street inside the Venetian. You can almost forget it is Vegas..."
4,"Right now, you can get a lot of value at this waffle house. From 2-9pm everyday, you can order off of the all you can eat menu. They make whatever you order fresh and it comes right off the grill. During that time, it's hardly anyone there (not the best breakfast time I guess). However they have burgers and breakfast sandwiches on the menu in addition to eggs and waffles. Also, dare I say it one of those things called a salad (tasted pretty fresh to me, but pretty basic). They have new staff there since March and very little turnover since March. Tell Nancy that Dom sent you and she'll take care of you."
4,"""Surprisingly great food at the mall! Lobster paella was tasty, sauteed squid was Great, manchengo anything was superb, goat cheese dip was yummy. Bacon wrapped dates were great too. Keep away from the red meats though....those were pretty tasteless and disappointing compared to all other super flavorful dishes. Yummy! Will definitely be back for more!"""
4,"Regular crowded bar, casual style, somewhat high priced. Convenient location in the Epicentre"
4,"House of Pizza has been in Charlotte forever.  Its a little hole in the wall type of place, but the food is really good.  Their pizza tastes like as if I am in New York.  Their pizza is extra cheesy and the cheese just slides off."
4,"Just REALLY good food. We had the lamb kabob and pomegranate chicken. Absolutely delicious! Only complaint was the amount of pomegranate sauce that soaked into the rice, making it a little overwhelming. Bread and hummus was great, as was the rose iced tea. Great value with a coupon! Just wish I had more food. :) shady area and storefront but great hidden gem."
4,"its fun. drinks are great, entertainment is great, i just think they shouldnt charge the entry fee."
4,"Went here my first day in Vegas in February with a friend.

We ordered a little bit of everything: 
* mushroom empanadas, 
* baby spinach salad, chorizo bits, piquillo peppers and egg
* seared spanish sausages - chorizo, txistorra, butifarra & morcilla
* salmon, artichoke & fennel confit
* skewered chicken & chorizo sausage

Everything was absolutely delicious.  A great lunch.  Service was fabulous.  Very attentive.  It was crowded at 3 p.m. and we still got great service with a busy afternoon.

Our bill was $70, without the tip, but it was all well-worth it because it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.

Everyone should stop by while in Vegas."
4,"This is a great breakfast option in Montreal. I had the veggie omelette, fruit, and wheat toast. All of the food was fantastic. I ordered iced tea initially, but it was too sweet. The kind waiter suggested their fresh-squeezed orange juice instead. It was fantastic."
4,"HOUSE OF PIZZA IS NOT CLOSED!. Just a lengthy renovation. As of 3/21/18, should be open again in about a month. Resurfacing the parking lot. 
As for the food...I've never had the pizza, or the lasagna, but the salads are large and good but the one thing that keeps me coming back, time after time are the SUBS. Especially the ""Famous Steak Sub"" loaded however you like. I can't wait to have one again. The reno looks like its going to be worth the wait though."
4,"Wow, tapas in Vegas has not disappointed me!  Three words:  bacon wrapped dates - omfg, delicious.  I think I almost finished a plate on my own. The scallop were also very good as were the peppers (not that spicy!). We ordered quite a bit of food and two pitches of sangria AND a paella (which, warning, is HUGE...and delicious).  I think the total for our large group was $35 a person...extremely reasonable by Vegas standards.  The outdoor dining area is huge - great for people watching."
4,"Yay! I'm a fan. I mean I USED to be a fan. This is one of those places that make you a little sad when they close the doors. Hubby and I used to ritually come here for lunch and drinks while in Vegas every trip. I'm going to miss those little tomato toasts with the Serrano ham. They were the MOST PERFECT hangover food EVER. 

RIP, you will be missed!"
4,"this is the place to go for happy hour if you want something out of the norm! sangria + tapas dished for 50% off...

if only we knew it was happy hour before having a seat in the dining area. so minus one star for that. if it wasn't for my friend who read the poster above the urinal in the restroom, we would have never knew! wish our waiter told us...

but i guess that's no reason to give this review any less, because the food here is delicious... small... but delicious. i recommend the empenatas, any paella dish, and their stuffed mushrooms. what else that is awesome about this place is you can order off the strip burger menu as well. i'll be back for happy hour next time..."
4,It was our last stop on a birthday hop.  Grabbed some late night libations and listened to some darn good dueling pianists that had us all singing!  Crowded for a Thursday night.  Can only imagine what its like on the weekend.  A few rambunctious tables around-kudos to the staff for dealing with them so quickly and quietly.  Fun place!  We'll be back
4,"I'm ashamed of the reviewers here. This restaurant just opened! How about some grace, people?!?! It's not like they are striving for a michelin star for heaven's sake, of course it is going to take them more than a day to work out the kinks. 

In addition, as a Mooresville resident, who is very excited to have a new non-chain, fast food restaurant to choose from, I am thankful and overjoyed to welcome Novanta. I certainly hope that these over zealous and over critical reviewers (how about we come review you at work!) do not scare off would-be customers of this establishment or potential, future restaurateurs of which our town is in great need of!

I visited with a large group within the first week of opening and although the service was a little slow, our waitress (and other staff) were extremely friendly and gracious, doing the best they could given the fact that every table in the place was full. We had several appetizers, pizza, pasta, and drinks. Everything was enjoyable, and I'm sure, with some fine tuning (as they catch their much needed breathe) will be great!"
4,The food was delicious and service was superb. The green sauce they have for free is a must try. The only reason why I gave it a four star is because they were doing some kind of renovation to the corner of the restaurant and cushions were everywhere. Sore for the eyes hahaha.
4,I needed a massage after a long week.  I got exactly what I needed.  I did the 60 minute relaxation massage with Matt and it was wonderful.  He worked my shoulders and upper back (where I hold all my tension) and had great pressure.  The spa was cute and well appointed.  The only thing is I wish there was a Shower and place to really relax afterwards - but that seems like something they don't do in Pittsburgh.  Matt was great and even offered advice on self care between appointments.
4,"Feel like like a celebrity when you eat here!  Well, not really, but it's a great place to ""people watch"".  The food is pretty good, and the staff is friendly. I eat there a couple times a week. Free coffee on Sundays for those who wait for a table."
4,"House of Pizza is just like your favorite pizza, pasta, and sub joint from childhood, right down to the gaudy, dated decor.  I had not  yet found a really good pizza parlor in Charlotte in four years of living here, but I think I just did yesterday.  I like big portions, extra cheese, and images of the Parthenon and old school Jesus at my pizza parlor, so I'm giving my excursion to H.O.P. 4.5 stars!

The restaurant occupies a weathered building on Central and Eastway-where restaurants can be real hits or real misses.   I was a little worried about the quality when I scoped out the interior.  But I was quickly seated and my order was taken a minute or two later-a house salad with ranch dressing and a personal pan pizza with Italian sausage.  Check 1 for good service.  They didn't skimp on the dressing like more frou frou restaurants and the lettuce was still crisp; check 2. Then they brough out my pan pizza-hot, covered in a quarter inch of gooey mozzarella, homemade sauce, and real Italian sausage (not that freeze dried matter you get at Domino's).  Mamma mia, I'm marrying an Italian girl one day!!!  My waitress made sure my Diet Pepsi was refilled and my food was satisfactory.  My bill came up to $13, so I walked away fat and happy. Check 3, 4, 5, and 6!!!

 Based on other Yelpers, the subs are equally good.  I guess I'll be flipping a coin on my next visit.  If you miss the days before pizza became a culinary craft, you'll fall in love with this vintage pizza joint.  I know that its going on my ""circuit"" of comfort food joints."
4,"Thanks to Groupon, I had a facial and massage here this past Saturday. The spa is in a converted old house. It is a great relaxing atmosphere. The staff are all really friendly and knowledgeable. 
This was the first facial I have had, it was pretty relaxing. The massage was really great. One of the best that I have ever had.
The prices are reasonable, and if you book your next massage (not sure about any of the other services) right after your appointment, you will get 10 percent off, and 15 off the next time. 

I would defiantly recommend this spa."
4,My husband and friends all loved this place! We missed the happy hour so it got a little pricey ordering so many different tapas. But you only live once and enjoy life. Tapas were $6-$13. My husband had the chicken paella and it was decent. Nothing spectacular. We absolutely loved the stuffed mushroom caps and the beef skewers were great. I had the berry sangria and liked it better than the peach sangria. Their sangria is sweet and that's what I love about it. The server was really nice. We are definitely going back to this place!!
4,"I had never been to Waffle House before today and I was pleasantly surprised. It may not be asthetically pleasing and pretty sure one the patrons who looked like a Waffle House regular farted right next to us, but the food and the service was pretty good! It's a very cheap and quick place to get some good eats and they have a variety of tasty breakfast options. Definitely give this place a try at least once!"
4,They have the best authentic persian food ! They have this rose tea that is simply amazing I would and will be going back it was a little hot but it's well worth it! Food is simply amazing
4,"I really liked this place! It was my first experience in here. Facial was amazing! Probably the best facial that I've had in Pittsburgh . Massage was very nice too! The only thing that a little disappointed me was that instead of 60 min massage I received almost 40 min. And for some reason they charged me extra money, instead of given price by phone. But anyway, I'm definitely coming back here again!"
4,"On a whim I bought the refresh package to use on a day off. This place is up the street from the apartment and I've been curious since we moved in. 

My first impression was of urban chic and calm. The dark wood and ambience were welcoming, as were the two ladies manning the front desk. I arrived 5 minutes early and my aesthetician was waiting for me so we started straight away. I was a little disappointed I was not offered any refreshment before beginning my treatments but that's a small thing. 

Facial was with Carie (sp.?) And it was amazing.  Relaxing, but definitely cleansing.  I loved every second of it. She asked about my skin before she started and walked me through the various stages and products (including a chocolate mask that smelled like frosting). My skin looked and felt am at when she was done. 

Next she gave me a robe and a bag for my things ( nice touch) and walked me to my massage. Only downside:had to walk through the waiting room where dudes were waiting in the robe. I'm sure they didn't care but I felt a little self conscious.  

Massage was a solid OK. Not bad but not great. In fairness it was a short one as it was part of the package but still. She didn't ask about problem areas or things I wanted to focus on. She did good work on my shoulder blades but I honestly was not happy with the way she scratched my scalp (!) For what felt like a long time. I give it a 6/10. 

Onto the manicure.  So this is a really mixed review. I had told them ahead of time I had gel polish on so that was ok. What I wasn't told was they would upcharge me for the polish removal. Look I would have said yes and paid it but I didn't like only being told at the end of the service. The manicure itself was actually lovely but it was supposed to be a ginger manicure as part of the package.  It definitely wasn't. And the space where they do the manicure was terrible - cluttered,  covered in all sorts of supplies.  Definitely not conducive to a relaxing or pampering experience.  Kristie the manicurist was pleasant and chatty but forgot to ask me what color I wanted at the start. In the end though I loved how the manicure looks - so am trying to balance reviewing the experience with the end product. 

All in all this felt like a small urban spa that's a few steps away from being an amazing retreat. Small things like refreshments,  a neater workspace and a reconfigured waiting area would make a huge difference.  The price point is excellent and I will definitely be back for facials."
4,"I give Novanta a 4.3, and I would definitely recommend going if you like authentic Napoletan Pizza. If that's the case, it's worth going out of your way to give it a shot. First, the positives, which greatly outweigh the negatives.

The house salad that comes on the tray with the pizza is lightly covered in Balsamic Vinaigrette, and the vegetables are fresh. The salad is an easy 10, and probably one of the best salads I've had at any restaurant in my lifetime. The pizza is a 9 for me, but wife gave it a 9-10 (she's not very specific at times). My son also loved the pizza, which is amazing because he usually backs off when a lot of sauce is visible The atmosphere is excellent. Very clean and comfortable. The service was superb (friendly and attentive). 

The only negatives are minor. The biggest one is that the chairs are not comfortable. They're tiny. If you want more comfort, sit on the couch side. Another minor negative is that the Gelato doesn't taste like Gelato and much more like Vanilla Bean ice cream (if you order vanilla). Regardless of what flavor you order, it's going to taste more like ice cream than Gelato. If you want Gelato, go to Alino's (also in Mooresville). 

Another side note that is neither a positive or a negative is that you will likely be ordering a pizza/salad for each person at $10/clip. This is a good deal for an individual, but it can add up for a family or group because it's not like going to a traditional pizza shop and ordering a pie that several people can share. Just think of it as paying a premium for a more unique experience. 

Overall, recommended. We will be back."
4,"Had breakfast here this morning. Service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  Food was great, well prepared and cooked to order. Overall good experience!"
4,"The man and I needed to refuel after a long day of shopping. By refuel I mean getting back that necessary Vegas buzz of shop, drink, drink, shop.......
     We were here at happy hour and it was well worth it. The margaritas were yummy were mixed right. We indulged in the $3 yummies. We ordered the meatball and the mushroom empanada. The meat balls were served in a Spanish style tomato sauce with potatoes. The meat ball was very moist. The empanada was excellent. The crust was flaky and the mushroom filling went very well with the aioli. The portions looked small but were quite filling.  The only drawback was that the bartender needed  more help. It wasn't super busy but I felt the service would have been much better if he had a hand."
4,"I am blown away by this place-
Nothing like any other spot in the area. The food on the bars was fresh, which is a surprise in and of itself being a buffet, they have the normal fare for a chinese buffet with several japanese items as well, a decent American section too. I don't eat buffet pizza, because I am a snob, but I have to say the pizza they offered actually looked tempting, which is a huge compliment from me.

Not only do they have the staples you expect (seseme and gen. Tso chicken, cheese wantons, egg and spring rolls, etc)
For i went for lunch on a tuesday (not a special day in my mind) and they had pot roast, ham roast, several fishes and more premium items, for no additional charge, as well as a sushi bar that rivals the better sushi buffet lunches in town, and a lovely hibachi.
All this for $7 at lunch, no drink. I feel like I robbed the place it was so cheap, i wouldve paid $10 for that lunch and still felt it was a superb deal.
I give four stars because thats the highest a non-Vegas buffet gets from me, they are top tier at what they do.
Kudos!"
4,"First, this is The Dog Bar...you are welcome with or with out dog(s), but you have to enjoy the company of dogs..

I have two dogs and I enjoy The Dog Bar, but I think a lot of the experience has to do with the dog owners.  It is positive when dogs are playful and cleaned up after.  It is negative when dogs feces are not cleaned up and dogs are too rough.  The staff at the dog bar are friendly and it is just a chill place-dog feces are cleaned up by the staff, but really if it is your dog it is your job to take care of it...

They do NOT serve food here (sanitary reasons), but NoDA has so many food options there are not issues with finding something delicious."
4,Like dirty martinis? Get a vodka (or gin) with the wasabi cream cheese olives... Or just ask for some olives and skip the alcohol (although I wouldn't recommend it) Also try a mango mojito (it's not on the menu but the owner makes a wicked one!)
4,"Great place to sit and have a drink and listen to music.  I was there for a work event and had a great time.  The beer was cold and the music was great.  If you are in town and looking for a place to go and have a drink, this was about the best place I found in Charlotte."
4,Cleanest Waffle House I've ever been to. The service was great and the food was quick and delish!
4,"Went here for a friend's bachelorette party with a group of 7 girls. We had a table reserved right in the front which was nice. We were given a complimentary bucket of some fruity, girly drink that was really good just not my style. We arrived around 9pm on a Saturday night and the party was in full swing. I am a huge fan of piano bars having been to two much larger ones before (Croc Rocks in Myrtle and Bobby McKey's in the National Harbor) this was pretty up to par! The crew is great; they played lots of good songs. At first I was really turned off because they played 7-8 songs that are every weddings worst nightmare. Songs like Brick House, ABC, Respect etc. But thankfully after that they went into more current songs and then the best of the 80's and 90's.  The crowd was awesome, everyone was singing along and dancing, we all had a blast! Our waitress was great; she was attentive and kept the drinks coming.  They also called our bachelorette up on stage and they played a song while we all danced, it was nice that they gave her special attention! I mention this because there was another bachelorette party there and they did not get asked to come on stage lol 

There is a super sweet lady in the bathroom that has all sorts of toiletries that you might need; gum, deodorant, hairspray etc. which I thought was neat."
4,"I've been here before, but it was a while ago and the first couple times were mediocre. I decided to go here again out of convenience and I thought why not. I had noticed that since the last time I had been there,  they lowered the prices a bit. Lookin good already, I thought.  I proceeded to order the number 1 combo,  which is their ground beef kubideh. The guy who rang me up was very pleasant,  not just to me,  but to the others who were there. Perhaps they saw their negative reviews? 

You need to try the rose tea and sour cherry teas. Delicious.  I got my order and jeeze, I don't remember the meat being this juicy and flavorful. I remembered it being slightly dry. Maybe the lunch hour has a different staff because dinner here was great. The yogurt was perfect, the bread was fluffy, and the rice was buttery. All very delicious. I could probably go without their salad though."
4,Food was good. Takes a while to get your food. We have been their twice. We would go back again. Some gluten free options but not many. I ordered the Montrealer and it came with a pickle (that's what it said on the menu) and on my plate they gave me a sliver of a pickle... about 1/10th of a pickle. Better than  Tutti Frutti. I would recommend the dish but ask for a full pickle or else you will receive a bite of one.
4,"I came on a Thursday night and there was no cover and $1 beer (for a specific type). I don't drink beer, but my friends took advantage of this. It wasn't too crowded... we found some seats by the upper bar. They musicians had a great energy and most could play multiple instruments. We could also get by with song requests for $2, which was nice. The one in Chicago takes at least $10 to get them to consider your song.

Also, it's in a great location because there are tons of other bars nearby on the top floor of the Epicenter. We floated in and out through the night and had a great time!"
4,"Love the ""old school look, feel, and juke box."" I've been going here for about 25 years. It began with my grandparents after church on Sundays for lunch. Now that I've moved further away I still make time for a chicken parm sub when I'm in the area. Huge portions of spaghetti that can feed 2 or you can eat on it later."
4,"I love the food from this place.  Always freshly made to order and the owner waits on you himself.  Very friendly and the atmosphere is legit.  Don't let the empty neighboring spots scare you.  They just opened not too long ago, so they are trying to garner some satisfied customers and they're doing a good job of it.  Their baklava is handmade and is cooked fresh everyday.  Overall a great place!"
4,"Fabulous pizza, desserts, coffee!  Fresh mozzarella makes the pizza delicious. If you are craving Italian, give this a try. Staff friendly and prompt."
4,"Hands down the best place in Epicenter.  Definitely worth checking out at least once.  As others have mentioned the dueling pianos with band makes for a fun vibe.  And taking song requests lends itself to some interesting covers.  Even when he doesn't take my requests the Dave Foley doppelganger piano player has some fun with my snarky comments.  I'm not a huge fan of bathroom attendants as I think at this point in my life I've mastered the skill of washing my own hands...but with that said the guy who mans the bathroom is one of the most entertaining guys to talk to in all of Charlotte.  Definitely earns his tips.  Why not 5 stars?  Just little stuff- could be a bit bigger, sometimes the drink specials are a little confusing (ex. a poster will say one thing but actual special is a little bit different).  But nothing to get my BVDs in a bunch about.  If you're not feeling the whole fist pump club thing make sure you check it out."
4,"Its not easy finding cheap eats and drinks on the strip. That's why we love to hit up Ba Ba Reeba when we come to Vegas. 4-7 Happy Hour, the website says M-F but we've been there twice on the weekends and they were running the happy hour. $3 Tapas and 1/2 pitchers of Sangria, which is a Great deal in Las Vegas! 
My favorite Happy Hour Tapas: Spicy potatoes, Mushroom Empanada, Bacon-wrapped dates and the fried peppers. I didn't really like any of the skewers. 
The classic sangria and the peach sangria were my favorites! Take a pitcher to go! They will even give you to-go cups!!! Gotta love Vegas!!!"
4,Coffee tastes great however they didn't have the almond joy which I get all the time. So I got a vanilla iced coffee with 2 shots of coconut.
4,"So this is not the greatest Italian place in the world, but it's definitely good.  You get a good value and good food.  Is it as good as Mama Ricotta's?  No.  But for a divey Greek/Italian place it is worth visiting for sure.

The large subs are pretty big so be forewarned.  Most people would be fine with the small."
4,"I actually love this little place. It's clean and the staffs are friendly! 

First time I came here I got the Torta Cubana and the Torta Mexicana. Both tortas were good, but I definitely loved the Cubana much more. The torta (I think this is the bread part) is tasty and soft. I could probably just eat the bread itself, but the mix of meat and the juices...that's a whole new taste bud there...so good!

They have a few salsas and grilled veggies free for grabs. They also have ice cream or gelato; not sure which one. I haven't tried any of the desserts, but they look tempting. 

Came back and got the Tacos de Ribeye which is so good!!! They give you lots of meat and I love how it comes with a slice of avocado on each taco! 

I didn't even know they had pastry on the other side of the restaurant until the second time I came...LoL! I came here 3 times within the first week that I discovered this place. I'm actually not much of a sandwich person, but the Cubana satisfies me completely. =o)"
4,"Looking for a fun place to party with your canine friends?! Grab your leash and drag your human down to the dog bar because this place is all about us: the dogs!

Leave that string of restraint at the door and let loose your inner puppy that the humans won't let you do at home. (No running in the house Fido! Scratching up my bamboo floors...) But you can run here! Have a ball of a time with the regular pals and meet some new guys and gals too. Keep it clean - any bar fights and they'll boot you to the curb and tie you to a sign alone! (Same applies for the humans!) Go anywhere you like and literally ""go"" anywhere you like - the floors can handle it. (Sorry humans, this only applies to the dogs - it's a sign you've had one too many!)

Water is around by the bucket! (Spirits by the bucket-load for humans!) Space caters to canines for wrestling matches, rope tug-o-war and some light fetch. But it might be a good idea to stay ""in bounds"" inside the fences. Watch out for the little humper - we all know he's trying to make up for his size with a little bit of a domination Napoleon complex. And be sure to give any human that dares to walk in here food-in-hand the group stare down because they just ought to know better! Teasing us dogs that way... Most of all just have a dog-on good ol' time because that keeps the humans hanging ten with beer in hand. (See it can be good fun for all!)"
4,"We went here expecting a light lunch, but came out being stuffed! It was my first time trying Spain food so I didn't know portion sizes. I thought tapas were little plates of appetizers so we ordered several along with the lobster paella. We were full even before the paella arrived (paella takes 30 minutes to cook so place that order first). Even though we needed to save room for the paella, everything was so yummy we kept eating! next time, I'll come with more people so we can share. Then, paella came, and they serve it table-side. The paella is SO GOOD. I was in love with it. I can't believe I was missing out for so many years. I crave paella a lot these days because of this place...mmm yummy."
4,My third visit today to this location. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a friendly guy behind the counter. I will visit again because of his service. In previous visits the service was mediocre and not very welcoming. This one employee redeemed the rest.
4,Came here on Christmas Eve and it wasn't crowded at all. Prices are reasonable for brunch. And food was good portion.
4,"Really cool concept, but seemed a bit unsanitary. I came there as a non-dog owner but one who loves dogs. There were a few dogs fighting that weren't really monitored which made me a bit nervous. I would go back because the beer selection was good (lots of good local beers) and I love dogs, but you must be okay with the concept to like this place!"
4,I went here for a bachelorette party Ina Saturday night. We got in right away. Music was great. Singing was awesome. The whole atmosphere was entertaining. There was a good mix of people there of all ages. I wish the place was just a tad bigger. We never got a seat or a table but other than that it was good!
4,"Waffle House is Waffle House. Of course you don't expect it to be fancy but it's cheap good eats. 

This particular location is clean. They clean off the tables and sweep the floor/area before seating the next party.  I went on Sunday around 11:45 and was seated in about 15 minutes. It took about another 15 minutes for the food to be served.  The location at this time was busy but they kept it things moving along.  If you're in the area and looking for a traditional breakfast diner experience stop on by."
4,I just love this food! It's always delicious and the service is pretty good! I am the kind of girl that just likes good food and this is the kind of spot that keeps me coming back for more! Yum!
4,"Loved this place...our waiter was hot and funny.....the tequila shots before dinner were strong and stiff.... and the food was great... really enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms..and the cheese platter and olive plate...

Good times...."
4,"This is a different type of bar.  A Dueling piano bar to be exact. If you're looking for a fun show and a few drinks this is your place. If you're looking to get smashed and dance your night away in a club- I would venture across the epicenter to suite ( if it's even still named that- clearly I'm aging myself) 
When visiting my old stomping ground my friends and I stumbled into Howl at the Moon by accident due to the rain our plans changed. 

We all had a good time. A few drink specials- nothing too exciting but  at least we had options between beer and shots. 
The guys playing the piano were really talented. They even rocked out a lot!! Everyone gets a free first song suggestion and after that your songs cost money- I'm not sure how much. If you find yourself in the epicenter and want to do something different- Howl at the Moon is a perfect spot."
4,"The interior is really beautiful and the lighting is dim, making this a great place for a date.  I went with a group and we sat at this floor level table, but it was comfortable.  The food and sushi were great and the prices were reasonable.  Overall a great experience and I would definitely return."
4,"Not all Waffle Houses are the same, this one always seems a little bit better. Food is solid, service is excellent and friendly and they're always open! LOVE IT. 

I mean a Waffle House is pretty much a Waffle House... but this location was a regular haunt for me and my friends for years when I lived in 'Tukee...
I don't live close by anymore but when I'm nearby I wouldn't hesitate to stop by. It's much nicer of a location than the one on baseline & I-10"
4,Very nice find in downtown medina.  The decor is very feng shui.  Plenty of options in the menu including Chinese and sushi.  We had the tuna/avocado and spicy tuna roll for an appetizer.  Both very tasty.  I had the red curry entree - also very good.
4,"So I was in Charlotte over the weekend and before heading back to Atlanta, my brother's family and my family decided on Asian buffet. It's cheaper, more variety, and kid friendly. My niece really wanted sushi so I looked around and found Tokyo Grill & Buffet. A few years ago, we went to another buffet in Charlotte but it has closed since then. There was another buffet closer to the hotel but we opted for Tokyo Grill & Buffet instead. 

Restaurant opens at 11 am but we arrived earlier and already saw people walking in. We were able to walk in and get seated at 10:45 am. Service was fast and prompt. The food is really good. Flavors are on point. For a buffet, I really like it. Desserts included ice cream too. I was surprised to see green tea flavor.

Our waiter is amazing. He refilled our drinks without us asking. Our dirty plates did not pile up, he came by and picked them up every time. We were all impress with his service. Next time, we're in town again, will stop and dine in again."
4,"This place has amazing tapas. Don't get suckered into the entree dishes that were put there for dumb ass tourists who don't get the tapas thing. The empanadas are amazing, as are the bacon wrapped dates and the pasilla peppers.  All three are MUST haves at this place.  We also like the chicken and artichoke hearts paella, the goat cheese app, and shrimp in olive oil and red peppers.  Oh yeah, the Sangria rocks!"
4,"The menu is big and there are a lot of options. Be prepared to wonder if you can get a sampler platter of some sort so you can try a little of everything. 

This isn't a big place so be prepared to wait, especially if you go during peak times. Luckily, we went on a Friday morning so we didn't have to wait, but it was still pretty busy. The menu is diner style food which is perfect because I just wanted something simple. I ordered the Smoked Meat omelette and it was a perfect choice. There was plenty of large pieces of smoked meat in the omelette and it was accompanied by their Lyonnaise potatoes and toast. The potatoes were out of this world! They had this crispiness that was quite as crunchy as a french fry, but they weren't soft and mushy either. My bf ordered a Benedict and a Caesar and the Caesar was really good. I was jealous that I didn't order one.

 They didn't have any menus in English when we arrived, but, luckily Google Translate saved the day. The hostess spoke broken English but she was nice enough. We sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't very friendly. I understand she was the primary person to make drinks and such, so we weren't expecting her to hang around and chat it up with us. However, it would have been nice for the few interactions we had with her to be decent."
4,That spicy red sauce needs to be on everything. Flautas were just a vehicle to transport cheese and sauce into my mouth. They actually did a poor job so I grabbed a spoon. The turkey butt torta was pretty good. The meat itself was a little fatty and gelatinous. We finished off the meal with some ice cream which tasted like those little clear cups with the strawberry stripes along the side.
4,"The baba ghanoush is incredible! ... and an absolute bargain at $2.49.  I am quite a connoisseur of this mediterranean specialty and this version is exceptional.  The owner told me that is a 100+ year old recipe, and it truly shows.
I also had the chicken shawarma and it was very good too.
Worth at least 4 stars, easily.
And the staff is very caring and friendly.
I will definitely be back."
4,"For those unfamiliar with tortas, they are the quintessential Mexican sandwich. Tortas Paquime is a place to get these wonderful sandwiches. It is also a bakery and a place to get Mexican refreshments and ice cream. 

The restaurant is clean, and appears to be well maintained. The service is quick and efficient any employees appear to know what they're doing. 

I ordered the torta paquime, the restaurant is named after it so... It was pretty good, but I think I'll try something different next time.  It appeared to be some type of pork that was cooked beforehand and serve in kind of like a cold salad . It was roughly diced and put between 2 soft pieces of bread with tomato avocado and possibly mayonnaise. Not exactly something I would normally order but good nonetheless. I also ordered a vegetarian tostada, to try something more familiar, and it was excellent. I also had the soup of the day, which was like tortilla soup without the tortillas--very good. I would return just for the soup alone.. I wouldn't want my lack of knowledge regarding tortas to cloud my review. I will be back to try more items."
4,"It's about as good as you are gonna get in Medina as far as Asian food. It's a stylish space with moderate pricing (especially lunch hour carryout.)
Most dishes are a couple notches above standard carry out. They also offer sushi which is nothing great, but it's at least comparable to Shinto, which is popular in Strongsville up the road.  
One downfall is their lo-mein. I tried it twice and was let down. 
Overall, it's pretty good for the price. Combine that with the nice decor, and charming location in Medina Square, and you have a pretty nice place to get some Chinese food."
4,"We visited The Dog Bar on a Sunday afternoon just to ogle other people's puppies.  Such fun!  Although we didn't have any dogs, the staff appeared to be friendly and accommodating, and I was impressed at the availability of hoses (for obvious reasons), water bowls and decorative fire hydrants on the large patio.  The seating was pretty cool with what I can only describe as tall, two-seater Adirondack chairs around the patio perimeter, and some high top table and picnic style tables in the middle, on top of astro turf. Ha!  The beer selection was mostly local brews (OMB, NoDa, etc.) and came in plastic cups, so you're definitely not coming here for the brews, but the friendly dogs, patrons and staff are more than enough!"
4,"I'm very happy with the massage service I have received at Evolve.  After reading the excellent reviews, I decided to buy the 3-month membership package--unlike certain unnamed chain spas, you don't have to pay a membership fee, so if you plan on getting 3+ massages or facials (or some combo), it's a great deal.  I have gone to Becky for both of my massages and she has been really good in working with me on longer-term issues (e.g. posture) and ensuring that I still find the massage relaxing.  

I've had positive experiences with the other staff--there was an issue on my last visit with a dog barking, and they gave me a voucher for discounted services without me saying anything about it, and I stopped in a separate time to inquire about other services and the woman at the desk was courteous and helpful.

I'm not much fussed about atmosphere, but I have to say I was impressed with the high-end feel despite the very reasonable prices."
4,First time visiting Waffle House. The food was very inexpensive and very tasty. My server was very sweet and attentive. I'll be back again.
4,"Submitted for your approval:  The First Real, Complete and Objective Review of the Medina House of Hunan.  Ahem.

Saturday night.  THE night for eating on The Town.  Oh, wait.  This is Medina.  Not Manhattan.  Not even Manhattan Kansas.  But then you walk in... and the place is just so nice, stylish, even... and the mood is good... and the service is good... and the food is way good... and you start thinking you could walk right back outside and the streets wouldn't be full of Nascar junkies and hand-to-mouth wage slaves and right wing zealots.  Okay.  That's not going to happen. (I did see three non-White people there.  They were with me.)

What a rare and delightful treat.  Here in the very heartland, hard by the Town Square, location-of-choice for Ford Motor Company commercials, as it just screams Middle America.  Cross over the street from the square, and you'll walk RIGHT into Hunan.  GreatGodAmighty this is one sweet eatery.  Service top-notch.  (Although they parked us in the bar, well after our appointed reservation time, gazing longingly at no fewer than three open tables.)  Food just so very very very good.  (Although I think the waiter took my table mate's request for ""mild spiciness"" as my own request; the Hunan Trio was very VERY mild, not the bite that I'd hoped for.)  The waiter cautioned that my pot stickers would take fifteen minutes; I have to believe they weren't just thawing out during that time, but were actually being hand-made.  The drinks weren't up to the standards of the rest of the night (would it have killed the lady to fill my martini glass, any of three times I asked?), but I would still recommend this House most highly.  Good work, folks.

A bit loud.  Lots of people, having a great time.  Active bar crowd.  I kept thinking perhaps I really WAS in another place.  You know:  a CITY."
4,Eggcelent choice for breakfast/brunch in Old Montreal. (See what I did there?) Service was quick but warm & friendly and the food was perfect.
4,"We go to Novanta at least once a month, and have settled on a few favorite dishes.  Their salads serve as great starters.  While their sizes are shareable, my husband and I usually get our own.  He likes the Dolce e Crostata--with goat cheese, golden raisins, and candied walnuts--while I prefer the grilled Caesar--with deliciously charred romaine, tomatoes, and sliced bread, and homemade dressing.  We also love the arancini, and do often share that when we are not in the mood for a salad.

For entrees, you can't go wrong with their pizza.  It's one of our top favorites in the CLT area, as it's cooked in a wood-fired oven, and is perfectly crispy on the outside - no soggy crust here!  I like their pastas, with their lasagna being truly exceptional, having fresh layers of pasta, mozzarella, and meat sauce, all made to order.  

If you have room for dessert, I highly recommend the deconstructed cannoli.  It's homemade, and divine.  Their gelato is well thought-out, served with a side of espresso to soften the ice cream and add a unique flavor.  

Presentation is very careful and well-thought out.  Service is always good as well.  The gentlemen at the pizza bar are especially friendly, and fun to talk to.  

We love this place, and will keep it on our ""short list"" for nearby dining!"
4,"House of Hunan has been one of my favorite Northeastern Ohio Asian restaurants for many years now.  I have had the pleasure of sampling a wide array of items on their menu.  In over 20 years, I have never had a bad meal at any of their locations (2 Locations also in Akron, Ohio), including this one which is my favorite.  The food not only is always fresh, and has a very balanced flavor, but it is also presented very well, and often has a certain elegance about it.  Their won ton soup is exceptional!  If you like Pad Thai, it's definitely worth having here.  Also, I recommend the Empress Chicken if you want something slightly sweet, but tangy too.  I would also like to mention that I live about 45 minutes away from House of Hunan, but I will make an extra effort when I am in the area to make sure to stop in for lunch, or dinner.  

In regard to service, I have noticed that their service staff does seem to change frequently.  However, I have enjoyed good service there over the years regardless of the size of my party, or whether it was during lunch, or dinner.

The dining room has a trendy, Zen inspired Asian design.  I would describe it as leaning towards a casual, but slightly more upscale type of ambiance which is suitable for a date, or just a casual get-together with friends and/or family.  In warmer weather, they often open the large sliding panel windows that look out onto the square, and if you are fortunate enough to have a table in the bar are, the people watching can be both entertaining and quite comfortable.  

House of Hunan is definitely worth experiencing for yourself if you enjoy casual, but full-service Asian dining with a comfortable, Zen-like vibe."
4,"This is really a mixed restaurant with Japanese name but Chinese boss and Chinese waiters. Food is mostly Chinese and some American, Mexican. The only Japanese food might be the Sushi which is average level at most. Anyway this is really a cheap bufet and you can even get a discount if you bring a student ID with you"
4,"Went here for my 3rd time. This place is great specially if you're wondering the fashion show mall and you suddenly realize you starving, and you just know the food court isn't what you had in mind...

Today I got both of the specials- swordfish and the lamb (both awesome) I say,...always order the specials at a tapa place- rarely will they let you down!

FYI if you want the happy hour half off tapas you have to be sitting at the bar in order to do so. Which is kind of stupid, but that's just how it goes.... the menu is smaller but hey if you want to save some that's an idea."
4,"Last day in Montréal so we headed out at sunrise for a last breakfast.  We picked this location based on yelp reviews & were delighted w/ the selection & the food!  

Service was fast & attentive.  The menu selection was vast & the choices were hard as it all sounded good!  I wish we lived closer as I could come back a dozen times & not get the same thing!  

The portions were plentiful & the quality of the food was excellent!!  The scrambled eggs were fluffy, the sausage was perfectly cooked & the flavor of the meats was Delish!  The brioche French toast & the real maple syrup was the finishing touch!   Well done Eggspectations!!"
4,"Expensive, maybe. Tasty, most definitely! 

Located right across the street from the Wynn Casino Resort, this place rocks with a delectable menu of tapas of all sorts...well, within limits of the menu. They have these mini tapa samplers that you can try and oh boy, were they tasty! We had the shrimp on toasted bread and tomato beef on toasted bread.  

For the main course, we couldn't resist in ordering the chicken paella and also tried the other tapas, like mussels with a caramelized sweet sauce (absolutely delicious). We also ordered a pitcher of the white peach sangria and that was pretty good, too. 

The service was good. The manager was the one who came out and served us and that was a plus.  Also, there's like a bar right next door to the restaurant, so if you dine outside, you'll hear the music. You may or may not like it, depends on you. 

Visit this place!"
4,Great music and atmosphere   Live Band is always a plus.  A great hang out in the epic center.  Variety of patrons and the waitresses are phenomenal.
4,The food is outstanding. Traditional Italian pizza is well done. Some of the portions are a little small but the quality makes up for it. Service left a little to be desired but it is a new restaurant and that will be worked out.
4,Great atmosphere that is only exceeded by the food. Quality light Chinese food that makes you want to keep coming back for more. Waitstaff was very knowledgeable and helpful
4,"I haven't ever got a great vibe from the managers on duty that are at the front to greet you as you first walk in the door - at least seem a little enthused about being there.  However, don't get too hung up on that as the atmosphere and location are great being right on the square in an older building.  The Sushi is always consistent and VERY tasty, VERY fresh.  Check this place out, it won't disappoint"
4,"I got a gift card to evolve so I went in to get a facial. What a great experience! One of the best and most relaxing facials I have ever had- I even fell asleep briefly! When I first arrived I was not sure what to expect because the spa is in an old Shadyside house complete with creaky floors and funny drapes. But I was completely blown away! Olga is super knowledgeable and helpful. She suggested I add dermablading to my facial, which really helped brighten my skin. She is also certified to do extractions so I definitely recommend Olga for facials. I will be going back for sure. PS- the entire place smells amazing."
4,"Really cool concept, but seemed a bit unsanitary. I came there as a non-dog owner but one who loves dogs. There were a few dogs fighting that weren't really monitored which made me a bit nervous. I would go back and am giving this place 4 stars because the beer selection was good (lots of good local beers) and I love dogs, but you must be okay with the concept to like this place!"
4,"So far so good. After reading the reviews I am a bit skeptical. There's a dog bar in Lake Norman where the staff picks up after the dogs so we don't have to worry about mess. From what I've read you just have to hope owners do it themselves which is ok  as long as they do. However, this place allows 18 years old and up where as the other only allowed 21 and up so that is awesome. I am excited to try this place out and hopefully write a good review later."
4,If you have pets and want a beer then you must stop here. THe pets even sit next to you at the bar. This place was really cool and the bartender knows how to make some very tasting drinks. I had some salty pretzel drink did not taste like alcohol at all. I wonder what the
4,Tired Novanta for the first time and will be back.  The door was warm and inviting.  The wood decor and open kitchen was very nice.  We started off with the Antipasto Plate and then Pizzas.  Everything was fresh and delicious.
4,"Had a wonderful dinner here on Christmas Eve.  Space is right on Medina Square and has a modern, airy feel with flowing water and a large fish tank behind the Sushi Bar.  Began with steamed Pot Stickers and Egg Rolls which were great.  At some places, these apps are often an afterthought.  Not here!  For main courses, shared:  Mongolian Beef, Pork Fried Rice, Szechuan Fish, and the Sesame Chicken.  I even had an Eel Roll from the Sushi Bar.  Everyone was thoroughly satisfied and we ate everything that was plated in front of us.  Of particular note:  The Hunan has a fun/expansive cocktail menu to begin your dining experience.  We definitely took advantage.  Will be back again..."
4,"I've been to worse piano bars.  There was no cover charge which was nice.  The Pianist themselves were not bad, not great, but not bad.  Really the piano playing was excellent, vocals struggled from time to time.  I was very impressed with our drink service.  Our cocktail waitress seemed to always be around when we needed a refill."
4,"I went there for lunch today.  The park lot is small that is near the building, you can park on the side of it for more room.  The place is set up to order at the counter.  

I had the quesdilla paquime with chicken $5.25.  The chicken was breaded, pounded thin,  and yummy.

I eye balled the deserts (ice cream, pudding, flan, cakes, popsicles, etc.)and different drinks (bottled sodas, canned sodas, shakes, & fruit drinks).  OMG!  Too bad, I was already full."
4,Breakfast...good fast cheap. I like sitting at the bar so i can watch the staff cook all the plates. Thats another feature i like watching them cook and work in the open. Dani is an awesome server with a dry wit...don't get butthurt ok
4,"Very tranquil place from the moment you walk in. I was warmly welcomed at the door and by my server, always makes for that much better of an experience. Im realizing, its the little things in life. The center aisle-seating is pleasantly set next to a running water, fake wall we'll call it. Chef is nestled kindly in the back corner, as to oversee all of the customers, as well as put on his show of creating excellent dishes. 

Now for some constructive criticism, I am an avid sushi eater. I like to think of myself as a conneuiseur of the cuisine. pseudo fantasy. Anyways, I would definitely buy my seaweed wrap from another company, it was a little tough and dry-tasting, which is in no way a knock on the chefs skills. Everything else could not have been better. 

Now for a little story on my experience here. I was called upon to work out here in lovely Medina due to an unrelated issue that is out of my pay-grade. No problem, here I come Medina! I stopped here for lunch, put in work at the office and home I went. It was not until then I realized I did not have my bank card, back to Medina I go. I called to make sure it was there and it was, luckily. The lovely hostess remembered my face, I will never forget hers either, gave me my card and back home I went. I could not help but sing my senior class song all the way home. Check it out...

4,"I've always loved this place until they started allowing patrons to reserve tables weeks in advance. My party of 5 showed up at 8, paid the $5 cover and went inside. ALL of the tables & chairs were roped off as reserved!! We asked management how they could charge us a cover when the entire place was reserved? They just shrugged & suggested we complain to corporate. At least they gave us our money back (hence the 2 stars!) and we went elsewhere. If you're looking for a last minute party, this isn't the place for you! 

I felt that I needed to update my review to say that management contacted me and asked that we give them another chance and even sent a giftcard. Very classy and we definitely will be back!!!"
4,"We ordered and I drank a lot of our full pitcher of Black Raspberry Sangria, so I'm hoping that what I remember about this dinner is accurate.  =)   I know that the sangria was pretty tasty.  They had a good baked crab & shrimp dip, house marinated olives is an assortment of 3-4 different olives, and the chicken empanadas were yummy.  We ordered a bunch of tapas and everything was delicious.  A table near us order paella and it looked pretty good and didn't last long, so I'll try that next time."
4,"Robyn of Evolve displayed excellent customer service and looked into my complaints. I went back for another massage and Nora was fabulous. And yes, it was a good one hour and over. I also love their new tie-up with Yoga Hive and Nora also has some specials for when you go back. MY neck and shoulders are thanking you guys!"
4,"Food was good. Was also able to sit outside in the middle of February, not bad. It's tapas though, which means high prices, small dishes. This holds true. Just make sure you order enough quantity for your table, I think the quality is good."
4,"We tried this place one night on a whim for a very late dinner, and were pleasantly surprised!!  This isn't thin crust gourmet true Italian pizza by any means, but it was delicious! I have no idea what they put in the crust, but I really liked it. Slightly chewy with sweet and savory notes -- different and it totally works with the pizza.  I ordered the Greek pizza, and it was awesome!! I was craving a gyro and pizza, but couldn't decide between the two... This was the perfect option.  Super cheesy, lots of awsome toppings, and the perfect balance of meat with olives, green peppers, and feta.  The only thing that I can say is that it was definitely more of a ""fork and knife"" kind of pizza -- not a thin foldable slice lol.

In any event, we will definitely be back whenever we crave good old fashioned cheesy down home pizza!"
4,"Stopped in for a late breakfast, which really meant this was our lunch, I had The Classic, my husband got The Montréal Benny, and we had ordered some Poutine since we've never had it in Canada before! Overall the food was pretty good, the poutine I'd pass on in the future- I've had better. But the menu has A LOT of options and it has something for everybody. I also ordered a mimosa which was a bit pulpy for my liking but it was good. Waitress was nice, but service itself was pretty slow. We could see her running all around as it was a busy morning. Would definitely go back again!"
4,Good satisfying food. Comes out fairly quick and the staff is nice and friendly. If you are getting an order to go they yell out your number in Spanish so get ready to use the Spanish you learned in high school 15 years ago if your a pinche gringo like me.
4,"I've never been to a dueling piano bar, so I didn't really know what to expect. I did read through the reviews before coming here - my friend was celebrating his birthday and so picked the joint. Sorry Chad - they aren't offering specials anymore.

Quite loud, but the music was solid. The folks up on the stage were rocking and rolling and I thought that they were talented. Maybe not the greatest musicians, but they clearly knew how to keep the crowd active and they absolutely understood how to make the bucks! Not just the progressive pricing to get your message written on the mirror, but the subtle plugs for the $20 ""play it now"" requests and the $40 ""I promise I won't suck if you let me come up on stage and sing"". And even when the request is a slow downer - Eric Clapton's ""Wonderful Tonight"" - they played it quite uptempo to satisfy the request and still keep the vibe going.

Drinks aren't cheap and they are hit or miss. I had one that was very weak and one that was very strong. I skipped the girl selling Jello shots, but we did buy one for my birthday friend. Be ready to take a picture when they do. Next time, I might just stick with the beers. The drink menu does not have prices and the server didn't give me an itemized receipt, so I can't even guess at how much they cost.

Book a table. Seriously! We were lucky because we got here early and managed to snag the second-to-last at 8:00. The three reserved tables didn't show up until 9:00 and by that time it was SRO.

Parking in Uptown is a challenge. You might be lucky and find a space on the street if you're lucky, otherwise there are expensive parking lots everywhere.

A really rocking good time. I'm sure we will be back."
4,"I've always had a nice experience on the multiple times I have visited here. The staff is extremely friendly, and the service is quick. I've tried their donuts and also the bagels. Both of these were made fresh and tasted delicious. I like to get a six pack of donuts as it is just enough for me and a few of my coworkers. Try the everything bagel toasted with cream cheese - this is a delicious and quick breakfast. I've used the drive-through as well as gone inside to order. The interior is bright and clean. This is a great place to stop in for a quick morning boost!"
4,"Great salads
Great steak & cheese
Good pizza

Two things to fix:
-Bathrooms are in miserable unsanitary shape.

-take out that juke box "" it's outdated "" customers has to pay to music??
Otherwise you can just have silence or listen to other people's conversations ?"
4,"After craving Chinese buffet for a while, I finally made a trip to Tokyo Grill. This place is pretty good buffet joint by far. I may have found a new favorite buffet! There are plenty of seats, good, and clean food. A lot of selections, the best hibachi, and the best sushi buffet I've ever had with inexpensive price. Sashimi is very huge compared to other sushi places. My favorite part is fried blue crabs. Hands down!
They have a lot of ice cream selections, plus they offer oreo cookies and whip cream, just wow.
4 stars for some menus that too sweet. 
Staffs are also very friendly and attentive.
I recommend this place if you are not picky and have very high expectations for a buffet place."
4,"Great portions- freshly made, no UNLV discount and no wi-fi. A business across to UNLV should offer both! Ill be back, but would be back sooner if they had wifi!"
4,"So much food!  Service was awesome.

I over-ordered big time!

I ordered some biscuits and gravy, that is completely a meal on its own!

And then I two normal burgers with some stuff in it, that was another meal easily.

Then I got a large crazy filled order of hash browns, oh man...

Awesome place!"
4,"Our last meal in Montreal was at Eggspectation and it was really nice.  Everything was cooked well and although our server was new, she was really good and kept my coffee as full as I wanted.  The only problem was that one of the potatoes on my plate had a big black spot and really shouldn't have been on anybody's plate, but it was easy enough to push it to the side.  The space feels sort of new and modern, but we've been eating in restaurants that looked like the old city and so it was a nice change.  I'd definitely go back."
4,"This restaurant was doing a quiet business on a recent Monday night. Located on Medina Square, it is contemporary and appealing. It featured special pricing on wine, beer, and some appetizers and sushi rolls. I believe the special pricing continued until 7:00PM.

I had a good Chardonnay and the pour was generous. I could only drink part of it. My friend started with beer. We shared a small version of gyoza, a little  over-fried, but still good.  We both ordered the Alaska rolls and thought they were very good. I also ordered the shrimp tempura roll and it too was good.  No complaints on the sushi rolls. Couldn't quite finish those either.

The bill came without the advertised discounted wine price. After I pointed it out to our server, she rectified it. I recommend this as a desirable restaurant in Medina."
4,"My first time here and it wasn't that bad. I love Mediterranean food and i wanted to try something I haven't tried before so i went with the Lamb n Chicken Shwarma combo. The meat was good as was the side sauces n rice. Pita bread was warm n delicious. Food took about 12 min but they said it was cooked to order with fresh ingredients so idk. 

As for the restaurant itself, it was kind of plain and needs remodeling. It felt like i was in a cheap dollar store. I would probably go again only cuz the food was pretty good. I heard their special tea was good so maybe ill try that next time i go."
4,"A few good singers at this place!  Actually played some new music which was nice.  Not your typical piano bar stuff, but I guess the crowd tonight had something to do with it."
4,"Like some of the other reviewers, I checked out Evolve Wellness Spa because of a Groupon. I go to the Waffle Shop more times than I should admit but never noticed this place before and am glad I did buy the Groupon. Groupon was for a facial and massage. Unlike other spas that I have been to, I was not directed to a women's locker room to change (i changed simply where I got my first treatment and put the contents into a bag) which I thought was unusual but the spa is in a house so I went with it. 

Gosh - I just wanted to eat my own face during the facial! The woman giving me the treatment used organic fruity product and I just remember the sweet smell of strawberries and blueberries. And then I got my first hot stone massage and that was heavenly. The staff was incredibly friendly and I have since been thinking of when I will go back next."
4,We had a great time until a group of people threw drinks on us. We were kicked out. Way to blame the victim.
4,"I love dog bars. I love hanging out with my dog while having a beer, and I love not feeling guilty about leaving said dog at home while having a beer, but I do not like constantly having to untangle my dog from her leash while tied to a table. Dog bar is the answer. The dogs run free, and have a great time so you can enjoy yourself as well. I also appreciate any bar I can show up in yoga pants to. Their beer selection is great. Not the cleanest place, and the smell isn't pleasant, but, dogs. Even if you don't bring your dog the entertainment factor of dogs running around playing with each other or laying on the bar is pretty great."
4,"This is truly a unique restaurant in my opinion. I love the quaint sub-city feel of Medina square and House of Hunan really plays on that vibe. There is a modern feel with a hint of an offbeat layout. The front windows open up on warm days to the busy sidewalks from a drink lounge with leather chairs and cocktail tables. Past the lounge area, there are some booths and regular tables next to a indoor water fountain in the middle of the restaurant. Next, you can sit at the sushi bar accompanied by a very large fish tank with many exotic fish to look at. Finally, there is an area where you can actually enjoy your meal in a floor pit that gives the illusion you are sitting where everyone else is walking. Basically you're sitting in the floor. Very cool.

The food is just as imaginative and fun to look at. Sushi comes beautifully prepared on the plate with other forms of seafood on top of it. Shrimp, caviar, all sorts of stuff! The General Tso's Chicken isn't the best I've had around the Cleveland area, but I would definitely recommend the sushi here. I would love to review some other dishes, but I'm afraid I'm a creature of habit when it comes to Asian foods. Give it a try!"
4,"When I get to play tourist- there are things that I do, that I probably wouldn't do at home. Howl at the Moon is one of those things. 

I've been to Howl at the Moon locations all across the country- from Hollywood, to San Antonio, to Orlando, to my home town of Chicago and now Charlotte, Howl locations crack me up with their unique combination of the talent of the dueling piano players coupled with the entertaining banter and dances. It's the perfect place to laugh the night away. 

The music runs the gamut- from the 70's to today. A tip along with a request will get your favorite song played. Want it played sooner? Put in a bigger tip. 

On this snowy night in Charlotte, the place was only half full so there was plenty of room to slide some tables aside and dance to all our favorite songs (hey- if no one else is going to suggest a song . . .we're not shy!) This is a place where audience participation is a must so don't even enter the place if you are not ready to sing along, dance or just bob your drunken head to the music. 

Our servers kept the beer (and shots, oh my aching head the next day) freely flowing and they were quick with the clean up when the guys next to us tipped over their table and sent bottles flying to the floor. 

This location is on the 3rd floor of the Epicenter which is quite the climb if you can't figure out the maze of stairways to get you there. And careful on the way down- a few drinks in you might have you careening off the top level! 

Not an everyday spot , for sure. But if you are looking for a fun night where you can laugh at yourself and marvel at how those piano players know ""every song"", Howl at the Moon in your place. 

Oh. And keep your eyes peeled. You just may find me slipping the pianists a $20 so I can regale you with one of my favorite songs sung at the top of my lungs! Watch out, Charlotte!"
4,"Well worth a visit.  Clean, fairly priced, good tortas served with a handful of potato chips.  Great stop for a quick meal if on the way to Sky Harbor.  Deserts are not cheap but quite good.  Go to Carolina's from the airport if 
arriving early to Phoenix and here if leaving late!"
4,"This place is really bomb, lots of options and the price is great! Would definitely come here again."
4,Great sushi. I had the salmon and tuna sashimi. I also had the blackened tuna roll which was awesome. My wife had the dragon roll and it was good too.
4,"Pretty good Spanish place in Vegas. I was surprised at how good the food was. We have a lot of Spanish places in Miami and this is one I would frequent if we had one here.

We started with the flat bread appetizer, which was good. We had to stop ourselves from eating every last bit for fear of not leaving room for our food.

My wife had the Valenciana paella and I had the meat paella. Both were really good, and came piping hot in small paella pans which they then plate for you at the table.

Service here was really good, too, and the restaurant had a nice decor."
4,"This is a REAL Hibachi Buffet! I mean what! Really??? Okay, so think about the best Chinese buffet you've ever been to.... & now think about any Japanese Hibachi place....& fuse them together! So those were the PROS! Now 4 the CONS... they don't cook the food in front of you at your table while you sit. No fire tricks or tossing food into your mouth. However the food is cooked in front of you at a grill station. He may do a fire trick if there's a crowd around & he wants you to put a tip in the tip jar. He also may walk away & go into the back. Loll. The food is amazing at the buffet. However the Hibachi food...beef, chicken, & shrimp.... looks iffy. Its not moist or mouth watering & juicy. Its thin sliced & dry. The idea is great, but its no Kabuto! The lunch prices are very reasonable & hostess & servers are very nice & friendly. You don't have 2 wait for your drink to be Almost empty or worry about them rushing you by giving you your ticket/check too soon. The buffet options are endless & always fresh. Enjoy! Look up Frenchi' J. On YouTube to see my Birthday experience here. Where I show the food & the establishment!"
4,"Ok reviewing the Waffle House is kinda lame, but here goes.  If you have lived in America at any point in the last 50 years you know they have good waffles and hash browns.  Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  It's just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever.

So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House?

1. Lots of parking
2. It's not in a shady part of town
3. It has a really nice staff 
4. They are fairly speedy
5. The restaurant is clean

So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area."
4,"I liked this place very much. I wish we had one of these in DC instead of subpar chains like La Tasca and Jaleo.

The sangria was delicious - we ordered a pitcher of the Passion Fruit and couldn't stop raving about it. And all the tapas dishes we got were absolutely delicious. My favorite were the spicy potatoes with the tomato aioli - so good we got a second order. The skewered shrimp were also remarkably tasty. .

I also had a bowl of the gaspacho - it was very like the kind I'd had in Mexico. 

Service was pretty good, perhaps a tad slow, but it was a lazy Sunday afternoon so we were happy to just sit and chat without being rushed.

Can't speak for the paella - none of us like it so we didn't order any."
4,"We decided to give the Dog Bar a try last Saturday night.  Our dog Ross is 4, so we figured he was old enough to drink legally now.  We had a fun time watching Ross socialize with other dogs, as he never gets a chance to.  Yes, he tries to sniff the occasional butt while we're walking through the park, but it gets crazy there when you're trying to get some exercise.  Plus, at the dog bar, at least we can have a drink in our hands while Ross does his thing.  All of the dogs were so well-behaved, too.  We were amazed.  Maybe it's the beer they have in the dog bowls?  Kidding.

This is a great concept and I love the option of taking your dog with you on an evening out when you have such little free time as it is.   Other than the adorable dogs, I can't  much about the atmosphere of the Dog Bar.  They could use a little more decor and sprucing up to make it even more dogcentric than the one fire hydrant.  Plus, the service was a bit lacking, the beer warm, and they were only accepting cash that night (who carries cash anymore?).  So it really is about the dogs and the company you bring with you."
4,"I love tapas. However this place can get pricey just think of the location. I ate here once with a friend and it cost us $65 a piece. The food was delicious though, we had the shrimp sauteed in garlic and butter and the octupus which was great. We had a lot of other items on the menu. Their sangria is alright. Not as good as fireflys. I like this place. I would come back definitely."
4,"I was craving some wafflehouse, and after spending the AM at coffee buzz, I decided to drop in here.  Ive eate at this location before, but not in some time.  The service here is usually pretty consistant.  Its one of the cleaner locations too!  I ended up getting 3 eggs over easy, with toast and hashbrowns.  YUMMY.  Bill was cheap, and I was in and out in no time!

Will most likely return again when I am on this side of town. This location is one of my prefered Waffle Houses!"
4,very excellent breakfast tortas! First time here and very impressed with service and cleanliness
4,"This is still one of my favorite hidden gem places in Charlotte. 

If you've never been to House of Pizza, there's a good chance you've driven by this place and never even gave it a second thought. It looks like a total dive.

Here's my suggestion for ordering: take a friend. Why? So you can order a cheesesteak AND a pizza. Duh. #SharingIsCaring The house dressing they bring to the table for salads is money. You may walk in and think you don't need a salad. Yes, yes you do. The answer is always yes.

Is it the best food you'll ever have? No. Is it great for what it is and price? Oh hells yeah. Since I can't actually live in a house made of pizza, this is the next best thing."
4,"I like this small dog bar. It's in a very artsy part of town. It's all fenced in and dogs can even sit on the bar. I saw that and had to go! I picked this as destination for my birthday weekend. The locals were very friendly, service was good, and drinks were flowing. They have a kissing booth and pool for the dogs. I got the best photos and had so much fun with my husband and pup for my birthday."
4,"I went here twice already. The most recent visit was because of a doggie's 2nd birthday party., awesome place for it. If you have the love for dogs. This bar is like you died and went to heaven.. Dogs galore. And their owners are understanding and are aware of their dogs and their dogs surrounding.. and to top it off, your dog can run freely while you socialize and have a few drinks. I mean I can't complain. Just perfext!"
4,Always on the hunt for some Mexican food that reminds me of the Jalisco style when I lived in Michigan.  This place serves Tortas the way I remember and they were good.  Place is very modern looking for an Arizona Mexican Joint and I am OK with that.  Food was good.  Had the Milanesa will go back and try again.
4,"Order the Asian Pear martini and the Hawaiian Roll. The Hawaiian roll is unlike any sushi roll I've ever had! It was so delicious and only $13!

The inside of the restaurant is beautiful!"
4,"We stopped in to Howl at the Moon around 11 on a Friday evening. There was a decent crowd but it wasn't too crowded, we were able to find a table for 6 easily. Corona's we're on special for $3. The atmosphere was lively and fun. There was a server walking around with shots and they have your typical bar drink buckets available. 
    The band/entertainment sounds good and was interactive with the crowd. The music selection is picked mainly by the crowd.  
   Overall, a fun place to stop in with friends for a few drinks, some music and dancing."
4,"A very clean place, good food and great service. :)
We'll be back again soon. !!!!  Delicious *********





F"
4,"I was told the pizza here was delicious, authentic brick oven pizza, but I opted for a can't miss...  Chicken Parmigiana, and it was quite nice!  My husband got the pizza.  It was a big hit with him.  My sister opted for Chicken Piccata.  I tasted it, and yes...  I was pleased.

The food was hot and fresh!  The portions were large and service was fast.  We were seated immediately, and didn't wait a full 15 minutes for our food to come.  I wondered why we didn't get bread, but I guess they don't offer that here.  

When you come in, the warm atmosphere and open floor plan are a good start.  Parking was plentiful, and the bathrooms...  Immacolato!  

Other patrons seemed to linger.  I think this place may  be a local gathering spot.  There were after work crowds, people of various age groups and lots of families with their small children here.  

The prices and foods quality lean towards finer dining, but it is a very casual vibe."
4,"Ah, Ba-Ba Reeba, how I love your happy hour.....Half price sangria, $3 tapas, yummy grilled squid, great decor and atmosphere, great bar service........
I don't bother going for lunch or dinner, however. Tapas in general are over-priced and I'm not into paella."
4,"I don't go to DD often (trust me, I'd like to, but my waistline begs to differ) but decided to pop in just before closing. The staff was super welcoming, even as I entered just minutes before they locked the doors. The place was clean, modern, donuts were still fresh. The variety wasn't too terribly wide, but for obvious reasons. I was only going to get one for the road, but the guy at the counter ended up giving me a handful for free. Again, yes I know it's because they were closing...but it made me feel oh-so special."
4,Came to Waffle House with my kids to get waffles for dessert! I don't really get the food but I feel Waffle House has the best waffles! The best part is that they are cheap! I got waffles for the three of us and spend less the 12 bucks. I also get the waffles to go and they stay hot till I get home. Absolutely a place I would recommend for a waffle. I was in LA and had Roscoes waffle and I feel Waffles Houses waffles are better.
4,"This review is based on the fact this a buffet, so expectations were based upon that. I went with a party of 7 and we were seated right away. The food was good. I went for the sushi and was not disappointed. It was fresh and tasty. The other seafood was good as well. My family enjoyed the other foods. Everything was hot and tasted good. Only negative thing was the people that were next to us, but you can not control who comes to the business. I will eat here again. You can not go wrong for $10.00."
4,"House of Pizza. Not to be confused with some of the other Inns and Huts. They can't hold a candle to the House. They've been here forever, and walking inside feels like time travel (in all the good ways). With specialties in pizza and subs, with Greek influences sprinkled in (like any good restaurant in the QC), you need to get to House of Pizza. Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it.

I've not tried the sandwiches yet (next visit), but the pizza is incredible. The sauce has great flavor but doesn't overpower, and they are generous with the toppings. Now, I'm not a fan of the floppy, ends-up-in-your-lap NY style pizza. House of Pizza has those big slices, but the crusty is substantial to support all the goodies on top. Finally, someone who gets what a crust should be!

The people who work here are absolutely great. The whole place feels like sitting in a relative's kitchen. One of the best pizza places in Charlotte, hands down."
4,"I had such a great time while eating at the Ba-Ba-Reeba. One was because of the great view of the Encore and the Wynn as well as location on the strip. Most important reason of all why this place was soooo good was the quality and variety of the food. 

For drinks you must try the white peach sangria by far one of the best sangria's I have tried before. I don't know if its because of the fresh cut pieces of peach in the pitcher or the quality of wine they use to mix but what ever it is you gotta try it. 

For tapas we shared the following: 
- PINTXOS which are six small bite size tapas ($8.95) great to order because of the variety of small tapas it comes with. 
- BAKED GOAT CHEESE with tomato sauce and sic pieces of garlic toasts. The entire combination was to die for. Garlic toasts was fresh and the goat cheese tasted as if it was just cut from the block ($7.95). 
- MANCHEGO which is an assortment of Spaniard meat. Included in this order are 4 small pieces of bread with a good spread, 2 types of cheese and a side of olives which all calls for a great combination ($10.95). 
- BEEF EMPANADA thick crust and full of meet ($8.95) 
- TOMATO and CHEESE FLATBREAD kinda like a thin crust pizza, very salty but full of flavor. The fresh cut tomatoes on the flat bread makes its oh soo juicy. 

With all of what we ordered (drinks + tapas) the total came out to $85 included tax. Well worth the money because of the quality of the food and service. 

With all of the drinks"
4,"A co-worker took me here today, I was expecting a hole-in-the wall or dive type place, but it turned out to be super clean, friendly, and delish lunch! I love mexican food and this place will be in my top favorites now. Clean, fresh, and non-greasy mexican food! Yes, I said non-greasy!

The price is right, the food is fresh and the people are friendly! Kudos, peeps at T.P.!!! I'll be back next week!"
4,"I've been to Howl at the Moon 3 separate times and had a great time on each occasion. I've been on Saturday night twice and a Friday night once. The Saturday nights were the busier nights when I went but with my limited number of times I've been, I can't say if that is the norm or not. They charge covers on those nights and I believe it was $8 a person. The musicians are decent but they know a wide variety of songs and really are great entertainers. Everyone seems to have a great time and the drinks are priced just like any other normal bar. Overall, it is a fun place to stop on a night out."
4,"Loved my first ever (sober, that I can remember) trip to Waffle House. The place was pretty clean, fast, and the food was good. The service was great, and the staff there are awesome."
4,"This was our first time here. The restaurant is very nice inside. Warm and welcomi

I ordered wonton soup - was nervous when it came out bc the broth was so dark but it was DELICIOUS! My husband got sweet and sour soup and said it was really good too

We ordered crab and cheese appetizer - which is crab rangoon. It was very good! 

I had the seafood nest. It was so good! 

My husband had the peach schnapps chicken and it was amazing! 

So glad we tried this place!! We will come back!"
4,"Colleagues of mine decided on House of Hunan for lunch as they are fans of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is very nice and has a modern and zen feel to it.  The menu includes Chinese and Japanese selections.  I opted for the beef and broccoli and one of my colleagues ordered a sushi roll.  My dish had a good sauce but I was disappointed in the quality of the beef - there was a lot of gristle.  I also did not care for the fried rice.  

I have to comment on the service because I was very impressed with the server.  Our server had excellent manners and served us very well and in a timely manner.  That was the thing that made the best impression about this restaurant for me.  I was also surprised on how affordable our lunch was.   

Overall, I think House of Hunan is a good option if you are in the mood for Asian food with a good variety of menu items."
4,"Just ate here and it the food was good, the atmosphere was nice and the menu is pretty awesome, a lot of cool dishes and drinks on it. The only reason they aren't getting a 5/5 is because the service was just okay, kinda slow and not very attentive. Other than that it's a good breakfast spot."
4,"For a chain Asian restaurant in suburban Ohio, it's not bad.  The Chinese food seems a little heavy on the MSG, but I've been happy with the appetizers and the Thai dishes.  The spicy dishes are genuinely spicy.  On several occasions, I've asked if I could substitute tofu for chicken in a dish, and every time it was done.  Furthermore, the tofu was always properly fried and cooked.  Hooray!"
4,"I have eaten here many times with friends and family and the food is always outstanding! The pot stickers and wonton soup are the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, it seems that the level of service they offer has continually declined. On our last several visits, the waitstaff has been borderline rude and disinterested, and we have experienced very long wait times on our food. Hopefully management can turn this around!"
4,"This is absolutely one of our favorite places to go. It's a very laid back, fun atmosphere! Anytime we can manage a night out with friends this where we head to !"
4,"One of my favorite places close to home. tortas (Mexican style sandwiches).  Love the tortas of turkey butt (colita de pavo) delicious with the fresh avacado.  Yum!  My mouth salivates just thinking about it. Love there salad at the restaurant, the take home... it seams, its not the same.  Love their daily soup with a side of their in house potato chips.  The potatoe chips taste like salt and vinegar. Delish!  The chile verde burrito has great flavor, while I'm not a big fan of their red.

The place is very casual.  You can also get some ice cream and fresh fruit drinks like melon, fruit punch, horchata, etc. Oh, there are great sweet treats!

You order, pay and sit.  They will call your number once it is ready.  One thing though... be ready to grab your drink, if fresh fruit drink, if you don't take it someone else will gladly take it for you. :-P"
4,"We, party of 4, came here for dinner and we all wanted to site in the patio. Great place to catch things up with friends and family. 

Our server Martin was very attentive and asked if we needed drinks when it was emptied on the table. Didn't take too long for him to get us drinks. 

We ordered 2x Non-alcohol and Cheese Soup, 2x Caesar Salad with Bacon, Smoked Salmon, Veg Out Pizza, Curry Bowl, and the Classic 10oz Medium Rare Steak.

My guests can't get enough of the soup, delicious, creamy and not too spicy. A fantastic dish to start. Salmon was a little dry but it was pretty good, says one of my guest. My other guests really enjoyed her Pizza, vegetables and the olives were all fresh. My wife loved the Curry Bowl, a great touch to add a few Naan in the bowl. The cherry tomatoes goes very nicely with the curry. My steak was cooked perfectly. I asked for medium rare and that is what I got, it was spot on. Mash Potatoes was alright, nothing to brag about but would been nice if there was gravy. I really enjoy my steak though. 

We really had a great time at this restaurant. The patio we got was a great spot. Great dinner!!!

Food:  4/5
Ambience:  4/5
Quality:  4/5
Service:  4/5"
4,"It was such a nice cloudy day so sitting out on the patio that day at Jack Astor's Bar & Grill was actually really nice without too much direct sunlight.  

I ordered the vegetarian burger which was really good.  It was called Hold the Beef and I chose the House Salad as its side.  This was my second time having a vegetarian burger.  (The last time I had one was at Johnny Bistro's which also was made with a black bean patty.)  I especially liked the abundance of goat cheese in it.

K got the Miso Sesame Tuna Bowl which I was really impressed about as well.  Jack Astor's seems to have improved their game!   The ingredients in the bowl were so fresh and the seared tuna was so perfectly done.  I liked the crispness of the snow peas and the slight sweetness of the miso sesame sauce.

The service here was really good too.  Our server made sure we were content during the whole meal."
4,"Wow! What an awesome concept. The theme is definitely like an intimate fish market with public seating. While it does smell ""fishy"" you would expect that at a fish market and it didn't make the atmosphere uninviting in the least. It was awesome to see the fresh fish displayed in the showcases and the market price menu readily displayed to see oyster varieties, lobster roll and shrimp M/P and other options. The beer/wine list was helpful and so were the staff!

We arrived around 8:30pm on a Saturday evening to find all of the tables full and a noisily chattering crowd of diners. The staff greeted us and we stood at the counter for a while before purchasing some beers. We decided to wait until a table was available to order, and it only took about 15 minutes before a group of four left and we happily took their seats. 

3/4 of us ordered the Allagash White and my husband ordered the Blue Blaze Yellow Blazer. They were priced at $6-7 per bottle/can with some cheaper and more expensive options in the case. We started off with poke nachos, seaweed salad and my husband ordered 2 oysters ($3 each). Everything was delicious! The seaweed salad was definitely a smaller portion than I've seen elsewhere, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

3 of us ordered the make your own poke bowls and my husband ordered the Rainbow Tuna bowl. This is where my only true disappointment came in. The poke bowls were absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. The ""regular"" portion is perfectly sized for a meal with appetizers or late (both of which applied to our evening). My disappointment came in that some of the ordered toppings were left off (RE: Avocado on mine and watermelon radish on my friend's bowl). This was only disappointing in terms of realization because they were truly awesome.

This was my first poke experience and it certainly won't be my last. We will definitely be back to Hi Tide!"
4,"Thoroughly enjoyed the ahi tuna bowl. Fresh fish and vegetables. Will definitely be back for this. The lobster roll is small, too small for $22.50. Would have rather had a larger roll and paid $28.00. That being said the roll wasn't tail. It was packed with succulent knuckle and was tasty. But, I have had better, thus the 4 stars. Also, those that are saying the portions are small for the bowls, I don't agree. 8.50 is reasonably priced! Considering Charlotte is very behind every other decent city when it comes to a variety of food, I will be back!"
4,"Couldn't believe that a veggie burger at a bar could be so good! It's a fun place to go with a group of people and the waiters/waitresses are really cool. Reasonably priced, an upbeat atmosphere with pool tables and great drinks, this is one of my favorite hot spots to spend a Friday night with coworkers after a long week."
4,"A surprisingly solid bar nestled in MGM! 

Hubs and I stopped here for about an hour before we popped over to dinner at Nobhill. The circular bar is pretty dark with a myriad of TVs above and a nice mix of booths and seats. 

The cocktail list is nice and inventive, with martini/mojito/margarita prices in the $12-$15 range. I went with the coconut mojito and, honestly, I'm going to have to find a way to recreate it at home. The flavors were delish - nice, light and flavorful! I just wish the bartender would have taken the time to actually muddle the mint...had to do that myself with my straw! 

The drink waitresses came around often enough and there was a nice mix of music to apease just about everyone. I heard everything from Kanye to Adele to Train. Centrifuge is a more than adequate stop for a drink or two while you're walking through MGM!"
4,Spent a few hours here playing video poker watching football. Its an easy going environment. Nice service...basic drinks are free if you playing video poker there.. will return.
4,"Was here with my buddy Sat/13 Jul about 9:30 pm.
- Nice new bar, standard Strip strip cocktail prices, easy to find seats, good service from the waitress
- Best part was the people watching since we had a good view of the ladies in line to get in to Hakkasan (which opens at 9 pm on Sat/13 Jul but I think the line was already forming before then because Tiesto was playing that night)"
4,"Great beer and tasty pizza. This place is not impressive from the outside, but is quite spacious inside.  As you'd expect for a brewery, the specialize in craft beers, and they've got some good ones!"
4,So nice going to a car wash where you don't feel pressured into buying a new windshield or into getting a wax. The place is clean and the cashier was very friendly. Will definitely come back in the future.
4,"Good drinks here, don't come cheap. Try $15 for a Long Island Iced Tea. I like that this place has a dim lit, lounge type area to hang out it with your friends, random dancing on the bar by the waiters and a feel good vibe. Overall a good hangout spot if you don't mind the pricey drinks!"
4,"Pretty good poke, but they need to have aioli on the table as well. Shrimp roll was not good."
4,"I've always liked this Lounge. Good comfortable couches and lighting. Excellent people watching right outside the night club lines. Have a cocktail and watch the parade of posturing guys yelling ""Vegas baby !"" And women trying to walk in heels for the first time while drinking. Have fun kiddos. I'll be here enjoying centrifuge."
4,"I had a fun time at this bar located in the MGM playing video blackjack and drinking vodka tonics.   The bartenders are really nice here and I didn't have to pay anything for my vodka tonics because I was gambling.    Every 20 minutes or so the bartenders would stop what they were doing and dance on the bar to music.  They danced to Micheal Jackson while I was there.   

This bar plays really good music (hip hop and top 40).   I ordered a glass of wine toward the end of the night and payed 10 bucks for it but the bartender poured it all the way to the top of the glass which was unexpected but awesome.   

My only complaint was the guy sitting a few seats over puffing on a cigar in my direction.  Made me sick to my stomach to smell that.  I wish that they wouldn't allow cigars in the casinos."
4,Loved the food awesome service . Their poutine was excellent. We shared enterees and they went the extra mile by giving us separate portions . Sangria was also amazing .
4,Very good oysters and ahi tuna but pretty slow service from the kitchen. Still worth the wait.
4,"Appropriately and perfectly named as the space is circular with the spheroid bar centered in it. The bar is then surrounded with the bar stools accentuating the circinate theme. Then, the lounge table and seats are situated on the inner circumference of the venue. The only factor that could out the disk-esque them would be for the bar to actually spin! That would empasize the layout in 'centrifugal' terms.

The thing I don't like about round bars is that is is difficult for bartender to see all the customers behind them if they are facing the outside of the circle. If the bartender is facing the shelves of booze  which are in the center of the bar, it blocks his/her view of guests on the other side. I wish I could draw this out to explain but you'll just have to use your imagination. So when we first got there we sat down for a bit  but then I realized that we couldn't see the bartender and he couldn't see us. So I had to go find him. Phew.

I wish I could remember his name as he was very polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the beers. I didn't expect that as Centrifuge is chill yet clubby - flatscreens with sports on but in a low lit and high-ceiling environment with ambient music playing. If the manager is reading this, our bartender was young and African-American. Give him props!

Centrifuge surprisingly has bottle service. But it's at a much lower cost than at the clubs. So for those of you who are on a budget or just don't like clubs, for whatever reason, this is decent option."
4,"I was pretty impressed with not only the service here, but the available items to choose from.

If you aren't into raw fish it's still a great salad place.  They also have oysters.  

The pricing is decent.  A small bowl is plenty for one person ($10-11).  They have a menu but you can build your own bowl as well.  Everything looked and treated super fresh.

The interior is that rustic industrial that's so popular now but works well with this concept.  Plenty of seating inside and they are working on expanding their patio and getting it covered.  

I'm glad I tried it and the location is central to Uptown, Myers Park and is right next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill.  

I'll eat there again."
4,"A flight of 6 beers for a low price of $10 can't be beat.  There were no duds in any of the offerings.  I had the H2P before, but thought it tasted a little stale this time around.  Breakfast of Champions was very well done.  I bought bottles of the Hoodoo so maybe my opinion may change but they do not have a standout beer that forces me to go there.  Don't get me wrong, it is still worth the trip all the beers are solid and the decorum is great."
4,"Food very very delicious,but very expensive. This plate with coke 29,00 dólares. 
great service. Very cool environment. I recommend"
4,"Glad to see such a great a great brewery come to Pittsburgh.  I wish this location was a bit bigger but that is likely because I have been spoiled by their Meadville location's sprawling digs.  The beer selection is unique as is the firehouse atmosphere and artwork.  As an IPA fan there were plenty of delicious selections to sample and the H2P that my server suggested was fantastic.  I did invite a large group here without knowing that there was a benefit going on and that there would be a cover charge.  Not a big deal as the $10 cover went to a good cause (and a beer ticket), but I wish the event would have been posted on their site earlier so I could have let others know before arriving.  Good experience on the whole."
4,"Went here for lunch with a coworker to try something new.

We preserved the spicy tuna bowls and half kale and white rice.  

The lady walked us through some recommendations and we both chose to go with the same bowl.

It was delicious and there were a couple of sauce options that were really good.  

There is cucumber infused water which is a nice touch.  

They have a rewards program which is an added bonus."
4,"Came here twice: first was for a food truck roundup and the second was to have drinks with some friends. I enjoyed both visits but coming here on a regular night was so much fun. 

Voodoo was once an old firehouse so it's just one huge square space. Walking in, there are some small tables and then two long communal tables. You order beer in the back right corner and their menu is on the black board on the right wall. You just stand in line and order. The decor here is definitely eccentric; there are mannequin legs and arms all around the place. Although a bit weird, it totally works for a place called Voodoo. 

My husband and I ordered the two nitro beers they had: Jerry and Cowbell. I'm not a huge beer drinker but both of these were so delicious. My favorite is the Cowbell (double chocolate milk stout), which looks to be a winter seasonal offering according to their website. Our friends got the Mango MetMosa and Hoodoo. These were great too, particularly the MetMosa as it was sweet and refreshing. 

I would definitely come back to try more beers here as I was a fan of every one I tried. I like the method of ordering too which makes it more casual than having servers/bartenders bring your drinks. Great place for great beer."
4,"Nachos are a must here with added beef and guacamole. 

Alex was a great server who recommended Somersby Cider with a shot of butter ripple. O.M G! Caramel apple bliss right here. 

Got the chicken tenders in medium, yummm. I always ask for honey garlic on the side so u get spicy and sweet in one bite. The chicken is always so tender and juicy. My go to food always. Everything else at jack Astor sucks arse haha


Conclusion: drinks are great, only get nachos, fajitas, or chicken tenders. DO NOT GO ASIAN (i.e pad thai)."
4,Service was excellent.  Food was okay.  Place was extremely busy because of the Christmas season.  But food came out quickly.  Menu seems fine for lunch but probably wouldn't come here for dinner.
4,"Pass on the Chinese food but snagged some OX tail ( BULALO) soup. Huge portions, good flavor and just in general can't go wrong with it. Quick food. Again pass on the Chinese food!"
4,"I like this bar because of the seating and location to the sports betting area and Hakkasan Nightclub. The drinks are okay though. I felt like it could have some more alcohol. We order stoli with Sprite and slice of orange. One came with an orange slice, the other a lemon. Eh I still drank it. I wasn't going to make the bartender make another one when he seemed overwhelmed with guests. We just left Hakkasan and everyone just moved right outside to Centrifuge. Prices are high. You are in Vegas. Think I'm just going to order my drinks while I gamble from now on. Those prices are much better- Free! 
The lighting is great at this bar! Upscale and professional appeal."
4,"This place just has a really cool vibe.  It can get crowded, and when it does, it seems to be even more fun.  The hot bartenders getting up and dancing on the bar are a favorite part of it for my wife and I.  The drinks are reasonable for Vegas. When busy service can be a bit slow, but we just can't not spend a little time here whenever we're at the MGM, which is pretty frequently."
4,"I'm so excited this place exists!! I love fresh ingredients and fresh flavors. Suggested combos looked great, but I decided to make my own. Was very happy with the fish portion I got. Waiter was super nice and helpful. Beer and wine selection is decent. Can't wait to go again soon and try all their combos!"
4,"I got my breaks fixed here. Their prices were a tad higher, but Discount Tire referred them, so I gave them a shot. They matched a competitors price (which I appreciated) and the service people didn't seem like shady or slimy car people. I didn't give them five stars because they quoted me one hour, and took over two.. But other than that- I'd go back again."
4,With coupon this place is worth the money. It is the one of the few car washes that is done by hand. No so called soft bristles slapping your car. Plus join their loyalty program and you get 5% back. Don't have a coupon then go to their website for one. I believe they also offer discounts if you come back within a week with a receipt. For a hand wash this is by far the best place with a coupon.
4,"My car was filthier than a two dollar hooker during Fleet Week.

I was also in need of an oil change.  This location is right around the corner from my house, and they did a fantastic job.  I pulled in and right away was assisted.  I got the oil change and a full service car wash.   I love that they didn't try to up-sell me on all kinds of additional services, like air filters.  I did decline a decent deal on steam cleaning the interior, but I know they will probably offer me that same deal anytime I go, so I wasn't that worried about passing up the deal of a lifetime.

They changed the oil in about 15 minutes, and then washed the car.  They spend a long time going over all the cracks and seams with compressed air to blow all the water out, and then hand wipe the car down.  When they were done, I didn't even recognize my car - I had forgotten what color it was under all the Arizona dust.   (FYI - it's red).

I have a clean and happy car, and they even found a mailbox key that  had been lost for about 7 months!"
4,Very interesting brewery! Located in a very old cool looking building in Homestead. Loved the feel and decor of the brewery. I enjoyed a flight to taste some of their hoppy beers. The beers were pretty good and refreshing. They have an awesome food truck that serves some great food. We didn't eat here but the people sitting next to us said it was amazing. Very hipstery vibes but nothing wrong with that. My complaint is there was no AC so it was humid that day and we had to leave early because it was so hot. Being in an old building it's understandable but there was no air flow. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed it!
4,"My friend recently moved into the condo's located at the ""Shops at Don Mills"" and this has be our go to spot. We have been there twice in the last week alone. I enjoy the service and the customer interaction. When we arrived last Friday night we were hoping to be seated in the bar. they only had a table to seat 5 guests and in total we would be 6. Since all the guests have not arrived as of yet the hostess suggested that we take the table for 5 and when another table opens up we can move over to that area. I was a little hesitant because it was a night filled with different important sports games on all screens. We happened to be very lucky because as we sat down another table close by was leaving and they attracted the table to ours to accommodate everyone. That night we noticed the food was delicious, service was fast and the environment was welcoming. 

They second time we went we sat inside the lounge/dinning area.. great service just like the time before.. our waitress was great with product knowledge, and helping my friend decide on what to order. She was extremely peppy and upbeat. Great attitude for sure which is what will keep us coming back"
4,"Small... but I like it a lot!

Centrifuge sits on the casino floor right across from the entrance to Studio 54.  Pretty good location and at least for the duration I was there (weekday), the crowd was a mixed crowd with young and old.  They have nice booths and tables you can sit at and if you can get a table or a booth, it's a great place to people watch, either at the people in the bar or people out at the casino floors.  Vegas never fails to produce some interesting people haha.

Bartenders here are great.  Talkative, nice, and make fairly strong drinks.  Prices are average for Vegas, which is nothing to be surprised about.  They have about 5 beers on tap with a nice selection for the bottles.  One bartender even gave us a beer each on the house even though we've only been sitting there chilling with our beer.  Needless to say we gave him a nice tip in the end.  

One fun thing is that when certain songs are played, all the bartenders and wait staff will get up on the bar table and dance.  Even though they aren't that great, it's entertaining nonetheless!

This place is pretty ideal on a weekday to chill after work, and I'm sure on the weekends it can be much more packed."
4,"If you are in it for a good bar food (nachos are the best) and loud noise, you are in a perfect place."
4,"If you're looking for a quick and cheap lunch/snack and you are downtown, try the Lanai Express in the Fremont.  It's served cafeteria style so you can see the food before you buy.  They have good turnaround so the food is fresh.  The prices are cheap.  Seating is good.  I love getting the spam masubi there.  They make it ahead of time and nuke it in the micro but it works.  The spam and rice come out with good consistency."
4,"This place is a classic Casino circle bar....and I mean that in a good way. When you stumble out of the club at 2am there's nothing better than to mellow down at a bar with other fun-loving tourist who are looking for the late night chat. Even in a huge casino with thousands of people around, you magically feeling like you're at CHEERS ~ only with the amazing music."
4,"If you don't want to wait until 11pm for the Market Street Café at the California Hotel to offer oxtail soup, come over to the Lanai Express at the Fremont Hotel.  Served all day.

The Express is located in the food court.  So it's cafeteria style.

We took ours to go.  We purchased 4 orders of oxtail soup to go.  You also get white rice with each order.  The worker scrapped the bottom for the 4th order of oxtail soup.  So we thought all out for the night.  She didn't say she could go to the kitchen for more.  We paid at the cashier.  I happened to take a look, and behold, a whole new pot!  Now why couldn't she go and get a fresh pot while we were there?

We could have bought a 5th order for sure. The oxtail falls off the bone and is very flavorful.  Has shitake mushrooms in the broth.  Make sure you have them throw in the green onions and cilantro.

If you like oxtail soup prepared Asian style, this is the place."
4,Basic menu but food I'd good. Restaurant can get noisy so make sure you don't mind that type of atmosphere
4,"We go semi-regularly - maybe every couple of months. It's not fancy, not ridiculously expensive, and they take reservations on weekends, which is a nice touch.  The food is reliable, and the service is generally very good.

I just wish they could train their servers to know which table is which - I almost always get one stopping by to ask if we've ordered something, only to find out it was the next table over, or occasionally not even near ours.  We once had them bring us an appetizer for someone else while we were eating dessert. 

The free ""world's best dad"" glass for Father's Day was a nice touch - thank you!"
4,"Great place to unwind, listen to cool music - and get the d'lo on whats going on from the bartenders - if you play video poker they will comp your drinks, and I had WAYYYY too many sugar-free Red Bulls while there.
Apparently the new club Hakkasan is putting the pressure on, made them quit dancing and tone down the music.  God forbid people see they can have fun without paying $200 just to get in the door of Hakkasan.
I hope Centrifuge survives, would like to come back again."
4,"I've been here a few times, usually early in the morning to get breakfast before I head into work. This place shuts down at 7am so I get here early enough.

What drew my attention to this place was that they Portuguese sausage eggs and rice, very popular combo for a local Hawaiian from the islands.

The staff is friendly and the portions are more than enough! I've actually heard customers in the nearby seating area mention the same thing.

From biscuits and gravy, corned beef and hash, French toast, country style potatoes with red and green peppers, there's something here for everyone.

I stick with what I like the best from this place and that is the Portuguese sausage and eggs.

The above mentioned are from the food line, there is an overhead menu if you'd like to order a la cart.

This also another place to get some really good oxtail soup!

I mentioned this place closes for breakfast at 7am, then it re-opens and turns into a Chinese food place.

I've not had their Chinese food but I wanted to give it a mention.

I have given this place only 4 stars because I've tried the other breakfast offerings and I honestly didn't enjoy it. I believe it's because much of the food had been sitting in the heated food line and loses its flavor appeal. 

But, If you're creeping back to hotel in the wee hours of the morning on Fremont, you know you can stop by this casino and grab you some breakfast.

:)"
4,"Great beers.  Love the voodoo love child  and grand met and OJ that my wife ordered was a good surprise.  Glad they allow outside food. The place across the street, Capri, had the best smoked ribs and chicken.  Perfect afternoon!!"
4,"Fresh, quick, good sauces. Fish was fresh, topping choices were fun. Especially helpful to our son with some allergy needs. Putting their right foot in at the hoke poke."
4,"Homestead is begining to make its mark on the beer map and Voodoo Brewing is a welcome addition. Taking an old fire station and transforming it into the eclectic environment that it is takes an extraordinary vision. Getting around the PA alcohol laws to even make this a reality is even more extraordinary.

The bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable. It's a joy having a VooDoo brew while talking with them.  My only knock is that they can't serve food here. Thank you PA polititions for looking out for our best interest. 

Side note: they're starting up a homebrew club here.  Not sure if it's going to be bi-weekly or monthly but the meetings will be at 7:00 on a Tuesday. If interested in homebrewing give them a call and find out when the next meeting is.  Remember,  meetings aren't only for Alcoholics."
4,"Jim and the guys at the shop have done a great job not only fixing but also standing behind their work when a part has been defective.  I drive a European sedan notorious for problems, and im not gonna lie I have spent a lot of money fixing my car issues with them but they have always stood behind their work and the parts that they have sold me.  I actually had a coolant tank sensor go bad 3 times within the span of a few months and with out any issues or charges they have replaced it 2x free of charge.  It's important to understand that things may be expensive to fix where ever you go to get your European auto fixed but when the shop warranties their work it becomes very cost effective.  Thanks jim for your assistance in fixing my car."
4,$.99 shrimp cocktail tastes really great as a snack and my wallet is enjoying it too!  Actually I didnt know this was in which hotel.  Now I know this is in Fremont Hotel.
4,"I really like this Jack Astor's location. I live in the area, so I've had the chance to eat here several times. The service has always been great even when the restaurant was very busy. The chicken fingers here are great and as a lover of hot sauce, I love that they offer the sauced up version. Their veggie burger is pretty good too, although there is a lot of cheese on it so keep that in mind if you're watching your calorie intake. The pad Thai is also decent. It's obviously not as good as pad Thai from an authentic Thai restaurant, but still yummy. My only complaint is that it was not spicy enough for me and I wish they had given the option of choosing spicy or mild. The one thing on the menu I would definitely recommend is the bruschetta. I get it every time. I'm not sure what kind of sauce they use on it, but the mixture of the cheese and tomatoes with the sauce is pure heaven. It's usually fairly busy here, so be sure to make reservations or come during an off period if a crowded restaurant is not your thing."
4,Yummy yummy Lobster rolls. The lobster rolls are on special for $16 on Monday's. These are Maine style lobster rolls with a bit of mayo and celery. They're on the correct bun and they give you a nice portion. I'm not a fan of the Maine style lobster roll (why I deducted one star). I'll ask next time if they can make Connecticut style.
4,"This place is a small food court inside Fremont Hotel and Casino. I was too exhausted to walk to California Hotel for their popular oxtail soup as part of their graveyard special. I've landed here instead since it's been a few years I've had their oxtail soup.

I received my order almost instantly since there was no line going into midnight. The soup was served in a medium sized disposable bowl with a scoop of rice on the side. I was impressed that there were ample portion of oxtail meat (big and small) with lots of cilantro and portobello mushrooms.

The meat was surprisingly very tender but were not falling of the bones which I like. The broth was really good and not too greasy or salty, but having lots of portobello mushrooms does change the flavor of the oxtail soup due to the woodsy flavor from the mushrooms.  

The only downfall with this meal to me, the bowl  was not the right size  to enjoy this meal. I had to put some of the meat to the side to give more room for my spoon to move around. The soup was warm and not hot and that shouldn't matter what time of day someone would be dining in. This soup can use more broth and that would be greatly appreciated. 

Yes, I still prefer the oxtail soup at the Market Street Cafe inside California Hotel, but this does the job as an alternative. If they just pay attention to the small details, this would be a delicious soup to savor and I may go out of my way to dine in frequently when I find myself at Fremont Street Experience with all the interesting crowd around."
4,"This is what im talking about. Another small local brewery opens up a tap room (garage) in a questionable neighborhood. What's not to love? Their beers arent quite on Fat Heads level, but with so many breweries popping up in the area, Voodoo is towards the front of the pack."
4,"Love the detail that the staff includes , even on a basic wash and always offer a great deal for other services as well. They do take time to get in the cracks and crevices and do a fabulous job, so plan on being patient as its well worth it!!"
4,"Stopped in here waiting for a friend and the name just drew me in . Too bad the drinks do not get served in a centrifuge, but it is a quaint little place in the middle of the MGM. Great staff and wonderful place to meet a friend, since it is write in the middle of the casino. Ordered a vodka on the rocks and ended up setting me back 15, which is pretty normal for Vegas."
4,"This place has an excellent selection of beer ranging from IPA's to some dark delicious porters, the staff is friendly and are willing to Sherpa you through the mountains and valleys that is beer tasting. They will give you tasters so you don't have to purchase a whole beer just to try it, I would suggest for first timers to get their flight, you pick 5 beers you want to try it's great.  I docked them a star because they don't inform you if he tap is out until after you order.  Oh also they have a food truck which is awesome and they serve some healthy food along side some bar room favs"
4,The oysters are always fresh and taste great.  I love the horseradish ice that they provide.  I ordered the spicy tuna bowl but asked to sub for coconut rice.  When the order came it was there regular rice.  The rice was cold and hard to eat.  It didn't break up easily.  Overall it was a great experience.
4,From the time you drive up until the time you leave quick and courteous service. Can't beat the price for a handwash. Quick oil changes too. A+!
4,"Great suggestion by my colleague! I wasn't sure what to order, so I checked Yelp for an idea! The majority of people raved about the nachos...so that's what I ordered. Was I pleased, YES!! The bowl contained: fried wontons, Ahi tuna, avocado, scallions, cucumber, seaweed salad, tomato, pickled red onion, togarashi & unagi sauce.  I only wish I had a more tuna to match the proportion of wonton chips and sauce. It was very filling.  My friend ordered the poke rainbow, which I will try on another visit. All in all, this is a delightful restaurant with a variety of beers and beverages to sate any palate."
4,"I like their level of service and that they provide roadside assistance for a certain time after your maintenance work/checkup, encouraging you to be good about the upkeep of your vehicle.  Service time is good (usually done in less time than they prepare me for) and they are helpful, plus the occasional promos really help."
4,Better than expected.   Less wait time than the Val Vista/ Williams Field location.  Thorough cleaning for the basic
4,"The 9 was for sure on my Cleveland bucket list since the minute it opened. My husband surprised me with a night for after game 1 of the ALCS. I absolutely loved the room. It was spacious enough and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. We stayed on the reserve floor and for a small fee more there was happy hour with unlimited alcohol from 5-9 and dinner which was some assorted cheeses, spaghetti and meatballs, breadsticks and cookies. The food was just ok. It was said there would be snacks offered all day however we only saw fiber one bars available  there is pop, water, and coffee available at all times however they didn't keep it well stocked and there were no waters at midnight when we got back from the game. 

Breakfast was also included and they had muffins, fruit, cereal, bacon, and eggs. I was also offered a mimosa. After all was said and done not sure the reserve floor is worth it but did enjoy the happy hour. 

The reason I gave a 4 star instead of 5 is when we received our bill they had charged us for several items like an iPod charger kit that can be found in the room which we never opened or used. We addressed it with the front desk and they took care of it no problem but MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR BILL AT CHECKOUT!!!!"
4,"We were on a poke kick after all of the new places started opening in Charlotte so we decided to stop here and give it a try. 

This one was unique compared to most other poke places because you order from the menu at the counter, but you don't see the ingredients when you're ordering and you don't watch them make it. They had a large variety of ingredients, but it was hard to order because I didn't know what several of them were. The person taking my order was helpful and tried to explain them to us. 

We got our food quickly and really enjoyed it. The ingredients were high quality. They had most of the sauces on the table so you could try as many as you wanted. 

The restaurant is fairly small inside, but there was plenty of seating for us. We sat at a large community table in the middle. In addition to poke, they have quite a few appetizer and seafood options. 

I would recommend checking this place out if you are a fan of poke/seafood."
4,"One of my favorite lounges in Vegas.... And it's not even a big time or main stream lounge to begin with. Located in the heart of the MGM Grand is Centrifuge.  A circular lounge comprised of a round bar and booths/lounge seating around the perimeter.  The bar itself is artistic which has LED lighting, bottles wrapped around the backing, TV's surrounding the top and an artistic moving object above the entire lounge (hard to describe).
So why is this my favorite?  Well, it's because of the bar staff.  I've been coming to this lounge for the past 4 years and each time I've gone, Lora has been my server.  She's cute, super nice and loves to be social.  She makes all the difference for me.  
She also allows my group to sit at the VIP booths which are reserved for bottle service.  
The go-go dancing is also nice too which seems to happen every half hour...  =)"
4,Came here couple nights ago.  Good atmosphere.  Very open and large bar area in restaurant.  Service and food were good.  Got trashed again with my quebecois friends (seems to be a trend here in TO). Good sit around and chat with friends atmosphere with sports on the big screen tracking most games.
4,"Cool place to come for some before or after dinner drinks or some pregame drinks. Sits between the MGM sportsbook and Studio 54.  Nice décor, good vibe and good music playing. Very cool bartenders that give good recommendations on drinks of your type/choice. They make great drinks as well!

Its also a great spot to just sit, enjoy a drink and people watch. Since Centrifuge is a bit close to some the main doors that lead out to the strip. So you'll get a good crowd to look at coming or going. 

Had an apple martini and a midouri sour. Both were yummy. 

No complaints on my end."
4,"The suite was lovely, we had a great stay. They let us have a later checkout we didn't ask for till that morning. It was important and they accommodated. 
The restaurant was good, closes at a weird time in the afternoon. We had just made it in time. I will be staying here again."
4,"Stopped in today with my boyfriend after apartment viewing for a few hours. We were really hungry; and they were not busy at all so our food came pretty quick. Small restaurant that also played as a small fish market. They had different types of oyster ranging from $3-5 each with half off Monday to Friday 4-7. It was a clean establishment. We had the lobster deviled eggs that both my boyfriend and I LOVED. Then he ordered a poke bowl, (portion was really small), ahi with seaweed salad, kimchi, onions etc.... He said it was alright; nothing beats our poke spot in Ballantyne. I had the seared ahi burger and it was a big burger for me. The ahi has sesame seeds on it and had a good flavor. Our bill was $33 something so the prices wasn't bad. Our male server was nice and attentive and tipped 20 percent for him. Definitely will come back and will try the oysters during happy hour."
4,"There was only one two issues with the drinks and the bill, but other then that, it was and had a magician that gave us some puzzles to work out while we waited. Over all a good night and lovely food plating might I add."
4,"My truck needed to be washed inside and out in a bad way.  I have a yellow lab that rides in my truck every day and sheds his hair horribly.  I dropped my truck off at 7:30 am to do inside detail with a wash and wax.  I was so happy with the results.  For the money I paid, I couldn't have asked for much more.  They shampooed the floors and seats and got 98% of the dog hair out.   It was a little pricey, but they were able to do the detail, an oil change and a radiator flush for $170 out the door.

Well done fellas!  You have earned repeat business from me and my family."
4,"Tucked away next to Hakkasan, so it doesn't feel deserted like your normal casino bar. Expensive drinks, but nothing unexpected. Solid spot for people watching if clubbing isn't your scene, and the bartenders were really friendly and willing to give drink recommendations."
4,"Update: they have changed the French dip special. It is now $5.99 for the sandwich and REGULAR fries (no more waffle fries, SOOO disappointing), no drink included now so you would have to pay for that separately :( It's not a big enough price difference to make me boycott their kickass French dip and fries but it's disappointing that there is no combo that includes a drink now.

I have changed my mind on their ""Chinese"" food as well. I'm not imagining it, in all truth I get a really bad headache when I eat it. I don't know what they use to make it but it's happened numerous times and the only variable is eating that food. So no more Chinese entrees for me. The French dip is delicious and I've never had a problem with it. They still have a decent variety of foods and awesome breakfast specials from midnight til 7 am. Their breakfast potatoes and bacon are really good, and for lunch I sometimes get a chili dog or a chili bowl. Mm!"
4,"It's that damn poke! It's so hot right now! -Mugatu (probably). God bless Zoolander. 

Located next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill, this spot serves up fresh poke bowls, oysters, and seafood rolls. There are 10 Hi Tide Signature Bowls (Regular: $8.95, Large: $12.95) to choose from and you can add toppings to those. There's also the option to build your own bowl with a laundry list of bases, proteins, toppings, sauces, etc. There are sauces on the table as well. 

The lobster roll (as well as the shrimp cocktail) comes at market price (check the board for the), it has a good amount of meat in it. Personally, I think steal of the menu is the Poke Nachos ($8.95). They are delicious and a great sized portion. The unagi sauce is so tasty on this. One word of warning: they were kind of on the salty side. Next time, I will ask to see if there's a way to get it with no salt (I have high blood pressure, so always something I have to monitor). I am a HUGE oyster fan and they have a nice selection. Seeing Hog Island on the board instantly took me back to some great trips out to San Fran. They will be starting oyster happy hours soon (I'll update when that info is out). 

Along with beer and wine options, you'll notice a few drink fountains behind the registers. I highly recommend the Hawaiian Coconut Iced Coffee. So damn good. 

The staff and management here are all super friendly and nice. A heads up: the parking lot is a little small. You may have trouble finding a spot during peak lunch time. 

The Stars are Just Like Us: my last trip here Coach Ron Rivera sat at the table next to me, so if anyone asks I technically had lunch with Riverboat."
4,"We created our own poke bowls, one large and one regular and both were hearty portions and tasted great. We got the poke nachos on a whim and they ended up possibly being the best part of the meal!"
4,"4 words can sum up my experiences here: awesome atmosphere, better brews. 

It's a slightly industrial space with a bar and a food truck, but what more does it need? All of the seating arrangements facilitate socializing, which is just what you want from a place like this. We attended on a trivia night, and although we didn't place, we still had a blast! They have a brew on tap for every palate, although I stuck to their White Magick of the Sun, which is a delicious spiced Belgian. If you're in the area and into craft brews, I'd definitely give this place a try."
4,Best thing about this place is the option to build your own. They don't nickel and dime over every ingredient so you can make your perfect bowl and not feel guilty. Doesn't hurt that the sauces are amazing with quality meats.
4,"In my search for my *bestie bartender in the world* ~ I walk into the MGM Grand only to find that my teeny tiny little bar that housed my favorite bartender was CLOSED! What?!?!? Ok, now what do we do? ... oh lookie ... another bar!

MAJOR points to the bartender here, as soon as we ordered drinks, I frantically asked, ""Where's Lisa from the City Bar that used to be upstairs?"" He cracks a big smile and gave us the directions to the new bar where she is located inside the MGM.

Me and the girls kicked it for a while, enjoying the ambiance, house music in the background, sipping our lemon drops.

Now we were all warmed up for Jello Shots with Lisa ... off to 32 Degrees!"
4,"LOVE this place! I go here when I'm craving a French dip. They have a combo, which includes the sandwich, waffle fries, and a drink for $6!! It's filling and reallyyy good. You do have to wait a bit longer for it though. They mix the Coke there quite well. Also they have a 99 cent shrimp cocktail, and their Chinese combo plates aren't bad. The prices on everything are extremely reasonable. Lanai Express is a gem if you're Downtown."
4,"It was a friends 15 year old daughters birthday and we were getting together to celebrate this milestone, so we allowed her to select the restaurant for us to take her to. Most kids would pick a South Street Burger, 5 Guys, or even a Swiss Chalet...she wanted to go here because, according to her, the food is amazing. Regardless, it was her choice. I had been to Jack Astor's in the past (the one in Vaughan) and wasn't all that impressed, but that was a while ago so I went with an open mind.

Anyways, we were seated as soon as we arrived. Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and it was not that busy (it was Easter Monday).

Our server, Josh, was at our table shortly after we arrived and took our drink order and returned shortly thereafter to take our food order. He made the visit memorable. He was funny, attentive, engaging and helped steer us through their menu. He recommended Pad Thai, stating it was one of the best he's ever had...so I went with his recommendation and he was bang on...it was excellent. Kudos for knowing your menu so well. He also brought out a brownie at the end of our meal to acknowledge the 15 year olds birthday....then lit a ""sparkler"" saying that every girl should have some fun on her birthday. He made her day with that small gesture/comment and made fans of the adults. 

Besides my Pad Thai (which was excellent), the 15 year old ordered a Deluxe Burger with fries, which she loved. My other 2 dining companions each ordered the Steak Sandwich. While both said the steak was cooked as ordered and was delicious, it was an open faced sandwich, which they weren't expecting. However, this did not prevent them eating everything on their plates. If it wouldn't have been too embarrassing, I'm positive they would have licked their plates as well.

All in all, the food was excellent, atmosphere good, service spectacular (thanks again to Josh).

It's interesting, I would have most likely not visited this restaurant based on some of the negative reviews, but glad that I did before reading them.

I WILL revisit this location again."
4,"I got the basic car wash for $14.99, which included washing the exterior, vacuuming the interior, wiping down the dash, and doing the windows. This was my first time going there and and at first I thought the price was high. 

Two people do a hand wash of the car. Once it comes out one person vacuums the interior, wipes down the dash, cleans the interior and exterior windows, and dries off the car. The guy who did the vacuuming, wiping down the dash, etc. was very thorough and was knocking himself out to clean my car.

Given that it was a hand wash and the thoroughness of the cleaning it was worth it. 

The place was busy, but not swamped, and it took about 30- 40 minutes."
4,"Located inside MGM Grand and right next to the entry of Hakasan nightclub, it's a nice bar with lounge seating.  Seems like a lot of casinos have this design like a donut, which is a pretty good idea.  Entry ways like the north, east, south, west pole.  We grabbed a complimentary drink off of MyVegas points.  We asked our bartender what we could order with the voucher, and he said well, nothing like Louis the XIV (darn it!)but he could pour a relative top shelf cocktail.  So we had our drinks and got to do some people watching, which was a nice way to kill about an hour and joke about the crazy people in line for Hakasan.  The drinks were steady pours, and our bartender chatted us up as much as he could since he was quite busy."
4,"We stayed here over the Browns/Raiders (woof, woof!) The room itself was awesome! We booked the king suite (I am a government contractor and received a hefty discount). The suite was an open floor plan, so the bath and shower were not enclosed in a separate room. The toilet, thankfully, was. The tub was extremely large and featured a shower head attachment. The room had a distinct living area with a flat screen tv, wrap around couch, ottoman, chair and footrest. The living area also had a fireplace, but it was decorative. There was another flat screen television across from a queen sized bed. 

I didn't check out the amenities but was told there is a nightclub and theater with reclining chairs. 

My only disappointment was room service. It simply wasn't good. I also wouldn't book the room for business (no desk). Finally, if you need a fridge, you'll need to order one from the front desk. Theirs is stocked with a private bar."
4,"Service was very fast and very friendly. I think I just don't like poke...I was expecting it to be warm for some reason. But it was cold, tasted very fishy (like it's supposed to, just not for me) and I personally didn't like the flavor combination of coconut rice and pinapple with the seaflood flavor. If I go back, I will definitely try something different on the menu, probably salad."
4,"Wow.  And I do mean WOW!   Yet another Marriott hotel in downtown Cleveland and THIS one is a real Gem.  Gorgeous entryway, helpful staff and elevators with no keypads.  The Hotel emphasizes Green, so they have very nice touches such as a master power switch that turns all lights on or off to conserve energy (takes getting used to).  Great choice to put Samsung televisions in, and the free wi fi (completely free) will hopefully become a trend for all Marriott properties.  

I have Gold status, but there's no concierge lounge is the only drawback to the property.  But only a minor drawback, the lobby and bar areas are so inviting that you'd rather hand out there anyway and get work done; or in the room which is very well appointed, very comfortable ... ... and a real threat to nearby sister property Ritz Carlton.  

Will definitely be back on next visit to Cleveland."
4,"Chill bar to have a few drinks at. Nick the bartender and the rest of the crew were awesome. You can use your drink tickets from the Sportsbook here. You can bet a horse race for $10 & get a drink ticket to redeem for a drink. Or pay $11 for the same cocktail. Beers run about $6. They had a special going, $5 Tecates. I wouldn't consider it a deal. 

It wasn't too busy while we were there. People were cool inside. It was nice to see some people hanging with their grandfather and others having a little fun. People from all walks of life just passing through. They play music in the lounge. Some good 80s and 90s in the mix. 

Most importantly,  remember to tip your bartender. Stop by and have a drink or 6. Happy drinking!"
4,Not a bad chain restaurant. Garlic bread was good. Lettuce wraps were good. Jerk pork was good. Milkshake was good. Added a star because the server brought a big bottle of cock sauce (Huy Fong Sriracha) to the table.

I went to this car wash many times since it was opened.  Usually, I receive a quality hand wash and drying.  This afternoon, my car was hand washed and then wss pulled out in the hot sun, before anyone went to dry it.  I asked the manager of that department, JACKIE, to pull my car under the shaded area in order to finish it off.  My car is a dark blue sedan, which will spot quickly if it isn't dried quickly.  At that time, there was only one other car to by dried.  The wash line was empty also.  JACKIE refused to do so and said my car would be dried immediately.  A person started to dry my car, then JACKIE called him over to chat, and my car sat there unattended for at least 10 more minutes. At that point I went inside and was met by ROBERT.  He took over and pulled my car around to the washing area, sprayed my car with water, then returned it to the drying area (under the shaded covering).  He and ENRIQUE dried the car properly and applied a spray wax on the painted surfaces.  In my humble opinion, JACKIE needs to be trained in customer relations, before she is placed in contact with any customers.   Also, ROBERT and ENRIQUE should be commended for a job well done!

4,"Ordinarily, a place this kitschy, phenomenal, and serving such great brews would earn 5 stars from me.

However, despite the H2P (an 8.5% ABV Simcoe-hopped IPA worth returning for) and Pittsburgh-pride-inducing Homestead location in the old municipal firehouse, I subtracted a star for something that rarely happens at a Pittsburgh start-up brewery:  poor service.  

The boyfriend I learned recently that Voodoo had opened a tap room in Homestead and we went to check it out yesterday, given our #PCBW 2015 zeal.  (Why not keep the good times flowing?)  We were impressed with the digs, loved the different ceiling panels by various artists, grooved on the voodoo theme and incredible artwork, and most importantly, dug the beers.

The boyfriend got a flight of 6.  They were having trouble with their Hoodoo tap line, so he swapped out the Hoodoo (their flagship IPA) for the Breakfast of Champions coffee stout, which he pronounced delicious.  While I'm not a brown ale gal, I was impressed with the Wynona and would have complimented the server...had we not been bizarrely invisible to the bartenders.

Yeah, so that was the weird thing.  It was the kickoff weekend for PCBW, so perhaps they were hungover.  But after we walked in and sat at the bar, we couldn't get someone to pour us a beer.  For about 10 minutes.  The bf tried flagging down. We both tried eye contact. He called out. Considering there were only 6 other people in the building total, it was a bit bizarre.

Did we eventually get served?  Yes.  Was my H2P (served in a 12-oz tulip) delicious?  Yes.  Was the bf's flight interesting and provocative? Yes.  The Voodoo Love Child was something else -- the sour cherry and raspberry flavors were readily apparent.  So perhaps it was an off afternoon.  Whatever the case, the beers alone are enough to tempt us to a return visit.

Oh, side note: on Sundays (which was when we went), they make a Met-mosa, combining their Gran Met or Love Child with mango oj.  I'm sure it's amazing.  I'll save it for next time -- and hope my cloak of invisibility has worn off by then."
4,"fuhhinally tried HI Tide Poke & Raw Bar last night and I was not disappointed.

I ordered...insert Justin's eyeroll...a custom bowl (because I always DIY if it's an option, okay? and I know it might seem like *excessive* when I rattle off 15 ingredients whenever we go somewhere that is an option, but it just makes my meals THAT much more enjoyable and interesting. It's like I'm cooking for myself except not really)

I digress. I added, said, 8 or so ingredients (which, by the way, is about the SAME as if I had ordered an ""off-menu bowl). Sorry, I digress again.

Ahi tuna was yummy, I didn't feel like it was fishy at all. They did forget the pickled onions, but I didn't ask for them so I can't ding a star.

Justin had some other type of bowl with rice in it (I opted for quinoa).

I wish there was a note on the menu that said quinoa contained nuts. I am assuming it was the quinoa. I do not have a death-allergy to nuts but I try to avoid and I was surprised they somehow ended up in my bowl.

Staff was all-hands and super friendly.

For a quick meal that won't bog you down, we'll probably be back again.

Their fish and beef prices were pretty solid, too, so I am glad I can finally get my hands on some more Faroe Island Salmon! Oh, and maybe some Waygu..."
4,"Went here with a big group of friends and this is the perfect place to do so! With really long high tables that can seriously seat like 30 people, Voodoo is an awesome place to bring your WHOLE group of friends. You get great craft brews in a super artsy yet chill location. My friends helped with the construction, and because of that, they got to contribute their names on the wall behind the bar that lists all of the volunteers that helped set up the Brewery. This adds a really great local feel to a brewery that's known nationwide. A must-do with visitors to the burgh as well!"
4,You get what you pay for but I enjoy their food. A burger and fries for $5.99 with American or Swiss cheese. Shrimp cocktail 99 cents. They have Hawaiian and Chinese food too. Great prices and it tastes pretty good. A quick meal to prevent a hang over.
4,"Got the Ultimate Wash for 44.95. Includes 20 cent/gal discount on gas. Staff was friendly they were pretty thorough with the minivan. I liked how they shampoo'd the floor mats and put them in the trunk because they were still damp (no sense in putting damp mats back).

They would have gotten 5/5 stars, but when I asked them if they vacuumed under the last row of seats, they said they blew everything out; I checked and sure enough, there were food crumbs so I had them redo it. No biggie, but if you are not sure, you should always double-check your work.

Note: gas after the discount was 3.12/gal!"
4,"Received a mailer and was due for an oil change- so I decided to stop by.  The staff was very friendly and the establishment was very clean. They promptly did the oil change in the time they advised, my service engine lite was on when I stopped in for the oil change and they ran a diagnostic and informed me of the code- they did not try to up-sell me at the time or pressure me into any repairs right away, but I was very appreciative of the knowledge they provided to let me know what the diagnostic came back with so that I had a starting point.

Thank you for a good experience- much appreciated!"
4,"I loved the .99 cent shrimp cocktail! Shrimps are small, but there are plenty of them! The cocktail sauce was spicy, which I loved. I got in line just for this item. The workers are slow! Took me at least 12 minutes just to get my item. I wanted to enjoy my shrimp cocktail with my drink upstairs in my room, but my drink was half gone by the time I got upstairs! Still enjoyed everything though."
4,"Awesome snack-food and fast-food place!

We wound up here while waiting out the midnight special at Tuscany, after arriving at 7PM.  Blind luck, I saw the ad for 99 cent shrimp cocktail and decided to see if it was true.  Was it ever!  The shrimp are kinda small but you get plenty of 'em in a plastic cup.  Cocktail sauce on the bottom so eat as much or as little as you want.  What'cha want for 99 cents?  This fit the bill well.

But there's more!  The jumbo hot dog is truly huge, and my kid loved it.  $3.50 or so for a hot dog and soda.  My wife had a pretty-good French Dip.  There was more we didn't try, but it looked like you could come several times and not repeat a menu choice.  

This place is a good reason to come into the Fremont hotel and since they're treating you so well, why not stay and gamble a bit?"
4,"Paid my first visit to Voodoo (Homestead) over the weekend. I've visited the one in Erie so I was excited to be back. 

We arrived around 9 for drinks and were lucky enough to grab some outdoor seating with the barrel tables. The bartenders served us quickly and were super knowledgeable about each drink. I ordered the pomegranate mead wine. It was okay. A bit dry for my taste. The beers looked good and the board games are a great addition to any laid back night. We were so full from dinner that I didn't feel like doing a flight. I'd love to go back and try the wine and a variety of beers.  

Cons: unless you're going to the waterfront the location isn't ideal. 

Pros: I did not have the pizza, but it look just as amazing as I remembered!"
4,"This place is the best bang for your buck in Gilbert. I'm usually pretty satisfied with how my car looks. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that sometimes they miss the trunk and the cup holders, but it is definitely worth the money."
4,"My wife and I stayed here for a quick weekend getaway.   Very friendly staff,  nice rooms, clean and excellent location.  Champagne upon check in was a nice touch.    1 star subtracted for the little things that need touching up -- lightbulbs in room burnt out;  window leaked during a storm;  no water in the room.

Great bar though (shout out to Jen and Kate), excellent gym,  and free wifi.   we would definitely stay here again."
4,Very nice lounge in MGM Grand.  This is where we did most of our pre and post concert celebrating.  The 311 concert was legit and the Centrifuge kept things rocking all day and night.  Loved the ambiance and the mix of musics and people.
4,"Incredibly impressed with their customer service. The hotel is swanky, rooms are spacious, location perfect. I had annoying special requests and they accommodated me with a smile. Their valet were also exceptionally helpful. I stay in hundreds of hotels a year and ""the 9"" was a breathe of fresh air."
4,"We rolled in on a Monday, excited to try the Lobster Roll special. Neither my husband or I had eaten a lobster roll before (I know, crazy) and I had heard that theirs were tasty (small, but tasty). We started with the Poke Nachos and I llllllooooooovvvvvveeeeddddd them! They were so good! A lot of times, dishes like this have few toppings and by the time you get half way through, there are just plain chips left. Not these! Even at the bottom, the wontons had some toppings on them. So tasty!

On this particular day, I was feeling crazy and decided to try my first raw oyster. My husband loves them so he ordered a few. I tried one (didn't die but I am not a fan). My husband loved them and said he would definitely get them again.

Lobster rolls were full of yummy lobster meat. I was expecting more of a sauce but either way, it was tasty! My husband's roll had a few pieces of lobster shell in it that he picked out but mine didn't. Neither of us particularly loved our sides (he got fries, I got chips), but we were so full from the Poke Nachos that it didn't really matter.

We will definitely be back and next time, my husband can keep the raw oysters for himself!"
4,Other than one time where my ac worked worse when i left few years ago.... this place has been GREAT. Would have to say from the manager to the techs ive delt with all have been upfront and cool. My car is here now getting oil. Good place.
4,"Great suggestion by my colleague! I wasn't sure what to order, so I checked Yelp for an idea! The majority of people raved about the nachos...so that's what I ordered. Was I pleased, YES!! The bowl contained: fried wontons, Ahi tuna, avocado, scallions, cucumber, seaweed salad, tomato, pickled red onion, togarashi & unagi sauce.  I only wish I had a more tuna to match the proportion of wonton chips and sauce. It was very filling.  My friend ordered the poke rainbow, which I will try on another visit. All in all, this is a delightful restaurant with a variety of beers and beverages to sate any palate."
4,"We were able to grab some seats at the bar, play video poker, score some discounted drinks all while watching the live feed of the iHeart radio concert happening 100 yards away.  Standing ovations while watching a concert on tv was pretty cool."
4,"What a cool place in an unexpected location! I'm so happy to see more restaurants and breweries opening up in the Homestead area. Voodoo's space in particular is extremely unique. The old firehouse has been transformed into a modern brew pub but still manages to keep remnants of the the location's history in the spotlight. Even if you don't like beer, you need to come see the interior of this place.

That being said, the beers here are wonderful and reasonably priced. I especially love the White Magick of the Sun and the Voodoo Love Child. Both are great summer beers and are extremely refreshing. 

Right now there is not food available at the brew pub, but food trucks often come by and you are welcome to get takeout from a nearby restaurant and bring it back. We often order from Capri Pizza down the street. They are planning on having a menu sometime in the future. I look forward to trying that!"
4,"Love this location, especially summer time when you get to dine on the patio. Service and staff were average during this visit.

Just got some dessert to eat today--these deep fried cheesecake spring rolls with strawberry and caramel dipping sauces--that tasted delicious. I tried the To-Tea-To drink jacked up which was kind of disgusting (I was hoping for it to taste more like a mojito but it didn't).

Anyways, although it wasn't the best visit I've had at this location, I love the area and service is usually good  so I'll come back."
4,"I've yet to visit the Meadville location and have big plans to do so this summer. So my new thing is to collect baby growlers, as I call them from different breweries. By baby I refer to the 32 ounce growler. These things are perfect for keeping drinking water in the fridge. That is until the next Voodoo visit when it's time to fill up. Love the rustic set up and decor. Super laid back with a great staff. Something can certainly be said about people who clearly like what they do for a living.
Big Black Voodoo Daddy is hands down my fave. Cowbell is a close second. Gran Met which unlike the first two mentioned, I think is available year round and it's so light and refreshing. Honestly there are no bad choices here."
4,"Surprisingly affordable and hearty fare given that downtown prices are usually jacked up, also your source for late night owl specials to eat while surrounded by drunkies. 

Overnight $3.99 ""The Deuces"" special (11pm-7am) is all steam tray food that is very comparable to a Lee's Deli if you've ever been to one, but it's edible and they do give you a HUGE pile of everything. 2 sausage patties, 3 bacon strips and a huge amount of eggs and potatos or rice. Lots of other stuff for $5-6 as well including a burger/fries.

During the day, burgers and Asian food with lots of stuff at the $5-6 price point. Also the .99 cent shrimp cocktails which somehow still exist in 2016."
4,generally speaking franchises dont impress me.much so my 4 is a bit generous.  id say 3.5 is what my true rating is.  however the food was good.  steaks were cookéd to.perfection.  it took a little while for the food to.come out...but the place was ramned and extremely busy.  the service was decent.  all in all pretty good experience and not disapointed in any way. :)
4,"As we were staying in the MGM Grand, my wife and I stumbled upon this bar while waiting to kill some time. It's located right inside the Las Vegas Blvd entrance, next to Studio 54. It was dimly lit and the outfits the waitresses had on where the sexiest ones we saw on any of the staff at MGM. 

The drinks were expensive, but what do you expect of a bar inside the MGM Grand? The waitress we had was fantastic. When we entered we grabbed the last table/seats available in the bar. She came around on a regular basis to check on us to make sure we were okay and we never went long with out a drink.  The service was some of the best we received in Vegas. 

My wife got a kick out of them dancing on the bar. I can't remember what song they danced to, but they were entertaining.  

It's not a place I would want to spend a lot of time as it is small and expensive, but for a drink or two, I wouldn't mind coming back."
4,"While the beers are not my tippy-top favorite of some of the new local breweries, the decor is awesome.  It's in an old firehouse, and I'm personally looking forward to going back when the weather is nice and the big garage doors are opened.  The long wooden tables and colorful chalk ceiling murals make for a place I'd really like to bring friends for happy hour.  The Gran Met and Big Black Voodoo Daddy are especially worth a try."
4,"Based on yelp reviews I decided to skip the steak and lobster special at Tony romas and choose the Oxtail soup at lanai express.  I think I made a good choice.  The Oxtail soup was good, only issue I had was you have to eat the bones with your hands and the white rice tasted old.  For $10 it was surprisingly decent though.  My girlfriend ordered the 3 item combo but that didn't look very good.  Depending on the time you eat the hot food has probably been sitting out for a while and looked brown and soggy.  Can only recommend the soup."
4,"I feel almost awkward award Jack's a really good review as I had relatively little positive things to say about the chain for a few years. But ultimately, things can change, and you just have to be honest and give credit to where it's due.

As I mentioned in my review of one of their locations in Oakville, they've clearly stepped up their game in more recent history. We had out-of-town guests who also had kids with them. As much as I would've liked to find a more unique place to eat when in the city, you just have to be practical when there are 5 kids between the ages of 3 and 10. Fortunately, I knew that aside from being practical, we'd all still find something we'd enjoy.

They really do a terrific job of serving fresh food. They don't even take shortcuts on the kids' dishes as things like chicken fingers are made in-house. I'm falling in love with their tuna sandwich which is made from a perfectly seared tuna steak and a very generous serving of avocado. My wife got their wings, which were great and tossed right at the table.

My friends had never been before and loved the Cobb salad and soup, as well as the fact that their kids really enjoyed their meal. They had a great impression overall.

There was even a magician who went around to all the tables that had kids. If you don't have kids, this may understandably sound cheesy or unnecessary; but if you're in my shoes, it was great to see the kids entertained and thrilled at all the tricks - for free no less.

I felt that the waitresses sexed-up image was a bit OTT compared to other locations I've been to, and the fact that they're still clearly trying to appeal to families as well. In fact, most servers in other bars in the city (read: not family friendly) don't seem the feel the need to put out the vibe to the extent that they do here. With that said, our server was very friendly and geared her approach appropriately for our table.

Jacks is on a role, and the expression ""Jack of all trades..."" fits as there's something here for everyone, which they pull it off quite well."
4,"Very cool atmosphere. Large bar area with long tables for seating groups. The ceiling is amazing! Make sure you look up! I love seeing small businesses tucked away in neighborhoods. Bar staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. There is a food truck with limited changing options. I had fish tacos and a hummus plate, which could have been better for the price.Their beer is unique with a lot of bold flavor. I tend to stick with IPAs, they did not disappoint."
4,"What made me get a high rating was the oxtail soup! Sooooooooooooo good. That is a must try. And also those huge ass hot dogs. Do the chili cheese way. One more thing is the steak and eggs for $6.99 is amazingly delicious.

The only bad thing is that the workers are kinda rude but food makes up for it."
4,"My family and I came here for a late lunch.  My wife and I split some nachos and wings and our daughter had the kids pasta with tomato sauce.  The nachos were good and cheesy - they used queso and shredded cheese to make sure they were ooey gooey.  The one thing I would have liked is jalapenos on the nachos, but that's just a personal preference.  

The wings were also very good - good size and the sauce had a nice flavor and kick.  They did this flaire thing where they tossed the wings in the sauce at the table.  This was a little unnecessary and just seemed downright awkward.  I'd rather have my wings sauced in the kitchen.  

My daughter didn't really like her kids pasta - the tomato sauce was too spicy for her.  We decided to send it back; that's right my 2 year sent her first meal back (she's gonna be yelp elite in no time).  Our server, Chris was very understanding and happy to switch the tomato sauce pasta for a butter sauce pasta which my daughter very much enjoyed.  

Overall the food is good and the staff are very friendly.  I would recommend coming and would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area again."
4,"We walked into this restaurant with just over an hour to spare, as we were going to the cinema afterwards and hadn't eaten any dinner yet.. The service was great and food was served in record time! The only reason I gave a 4/5 stars was because my sauce in my dish was spicy and it probably wouldn't be noticed by some, but I hate spicy food so I didn't enjoy the dish as much as I'd have liked, and plus there was no spice in the description on the menu so.. Otherwise no complaints, staff were lovely, food was great and we got dinner and our movie without throwing the food down our necks!
Great atmosphere 
Tv screens everywhere so great if you want to watch a game?
Quirky touches like bottles fitted to light fixtures
Free wifi
Free drink top up"
4,Cool place to hang out at..or to people watch. right outside hakkasan.
4,I always have a great time when I come here. Is usually it's a Saturday or Sunday for lunch. It's not too busy surprisingly at this time. Service is friendly and quick. Food tastes great and freshly made. They make the wings and toss it for you at the table. It's a great place for kids. The kids menu has good options and the food is always fresh and good portions. Love the take home freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. Will be back again.
4,"Beautiful, trendy hotel in downtown CLE! Feels like you're in NYC when you're here! Everything is upscale! Rooftop bar and the Vault are a bonus to the uniqueness of this hotel! Definitely worth the price to stay here!! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a really cool and fun place to stay downtown!"
4,The poke nachos was delicious and a very big portion for the price.  Parking was a pain!  We were ordering to go and there was absolutely nowhere to stand not a designated section for people to wait for their to go orders.  Price is super reasonable for poke.  Will definitely come back aside from the parking.
4,This place is ridiculously beautiful and high end. A group of friends and I went in the volt and it was like nothing we have ever seen! Had a super fun New Years here. My only complaint was the hotel room. Although furnished beautifully it had horrible cheap curtains that let the light from the street lights in. Also the noise from the street and a car alarm were very load. Once that was off hallway noise was excessive (at 2:30 am). View from the window here is of an ally. For a hotel that costs between $200-$300/night I was surprised by these problems. I could not sleep at all due to the light/ noise. Staff was wonderful and attentive. They probably need to get better curtains and sound proofing. Then they may be worth 5 stars.
4,"This was our first dinner in Canada. Great service, fun atmosphere and yummy food. We had a classic poutine and a lobster dip to start, both delicious. The table had fajitas, fish and chips, 5 cheese Mac and cheese an my favorite the Hold the Beef (a great black bean burger with goat cheese). A nice place for a family since you can color on the table."
4,"First time trying this cuisine although I did not get a poke bowl. I tried the nachos and the sliders. The nachos need more sauce and toppings, but they were delicious. The sliders were wonderful with a perfect balance of toppings. I would definitely return and next time I will try a bowl."
4,"Not sure how to pronounce ""Poke"" - but heard
It was a thing so my wife and I came here for lunch today. The Poke bowls were great, I had the Spicy Ahi Tuna and my wife had the Salmon. You know how you can taste if the fish was fresh... it was fresh. Actually all the ingredients were fresh and in good combinations. We ordered the regular vs the large bowls and that was plenty of food. Cool space, clean vibe with good sized community table and places to have one on one conversations. I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 because of the price of the beer. Cans are in a cooler next to the cash register and we grabbed two local / non-seasonal / did I mention local /beers. No listed prices anywhere we could see and paid $7.00 and $7.50 for two local beer cans. I expect that pricing at a concert or sporting event, not for a quick lunch.  We will be back, and will order waters - unless they allow BYOB."
4,"I'm a big fan of what's happening at Voodoo in Homestead. My husband and I first happened in here on a snow day in January (as teachers we are victims of circumstance, tough life) and decided to do some sampling. Their sampler comes nestled in the holes of a repurposed dresser drawer, a
DIY inspiration! 
Their taproom is nestled in an old firehouse with imaginative chalkboard art on the walls and ceiling. You'll feel very enlightened when you gaze up and are met with the Creation of Adam scene from the Sistine chapel above you. There are two garage doors, adorned with colorful graffiti, that can be opened to welcome a summer breeze while you sit at their reclaimed pallet tables and sip a delicious brew. Bring some food, friends and a few games...leashed dogs are welcome too! 
As far as a drink recommendation I would steer you in the direction of the Grand Met which can be mixed with OJ into a ""Metmosa"" (pineapple OJ pairs nicely. My husband, who is a fan of hops and spice, would recommend the Old Guys'r. We were a little disappointed yesterday that the tap wasn't working and that brew wasn't available, but hey..it happens. 
Looking forward to another trip!"
4,"So here's the low down on this place. So you come to Vegas and you might have failed at the pre-partying so you arrive at the club and you are shocked by the prices of all the drinks at the clubs. $20 a pop and even $10 for a mini size bottle of water because they won't serve you plain iced tap water. So you still get a round of drinks you are down $200 in a matter of five minutes. That is for reals a bummer. You aren't going to find anything cheap in Vegas unless you are sitting at a table or slot machine and waiting for the cocktail ladies to come by and then you tip her for her courteous delivery of your drink. But that takes forever and by the time she comes by, you might also be down $150 in blackjack...

So Centrifuge is right outside Hakkasan. So why would you want to pay $20 for a drink when you can pay $10 or even less? So you must arrive at Hakkasan a bit early to ensure that you can still get in or else you are just as screwed because you will be waiting in a massive line and your buzz will be gone. Anyways, definitely come here for the cheaper price drinks. When I went, they had a beer and shot special for $8. That's like winner winner chicken dinner in my book. The drinks themselves are OK. Nothing too special but seriously, they taste the same inside Hakkasan anyways; the bump to 4 stars is really for the deal that you will be getting for drinking out here right before entering the club and paying an arm and a leg. Why not use that extra money and put it on #00 at the roulette tables?"
4,"Went back on the 72 hour rain guarantee, service was much better. The guy washing the car took so much care and detail, even on a free wash. Left my car looking 10X better than the wash I paid for, and I even left a good tip. Takes a lot to get me to leave more than a couple bucks. Will try again with full service when they wash interior as well. Hoping I can get this place to 5-star! Mind you my interior is never that dirty, my car only has 2500 miles so this shouldn't be a difficult task."
4,"Tried Hi Tide on a Tuesday night - food was delicious. Started with Poke nachos which were absolutely delicious - then shared two dozen mixed oysters. We ordered a dozen at a time and the second round took FOREVER to come out. Fresh, tasty, and enjoyable nonetheless. Two long multi-patron tables and a few small round tops, temperature was a little hotter than one would prefer but not enough to ruin a dinner. All in all - a great concept, delicious food, and despite the long wait on round two, we'll be back!"
4,"Service is quick and friendly. Overall food are delicious. Burgers and sandwiches served with fries, soup or house salad.  Definitely will come back again."
4,I had the classic poke. It's a smaller size with clean flavors that work nicely together.
4,Cool open atmosphere. Excellent beers. Food is coming soon apparently so it's a good reason to come back.
4,Great service and strong drinks! Visually appealing and just a fun place to hang out. It wasn't super crowded but had a great upbeat feel.
4,"Great Fresh Flavors!!!! Amazing staff great prices.  A lot of work goes into the prep and you can taste it.  Authentic Asian ingredients and fresh fish make this place awesome. 

I dropped one star cause the ambiance is a little off.  Many of the Poke bars I've been too are similar to the Chipotle method of Orderring.  This place chooses to use a menu.  They are also mixed with a seafood store/aged meat seller. It all seams like a weird mix.  Plus the music seams loud. 


Overall a great meal and a unique consent for the Queen City.   I wish them the best going forward.   Check this place out!"
4,"Came in late on a Saturday night and it was almost closing but the service was still on par. She was very accommodating to our shellfish, nut, and soy allergy at the table, so we knew which bowls and sauces not to use. I got the poke rainbow bowl which appeared to be a great way to taste the main fishes plus many of my favorite toppings. I enjoyed everything except for the milky rice. Don't get me wrong, I love sticky rice, congee and all but didn't care for the taste/texture of the milky rice base. Next time I'll definitely go for a substitute grain or just build my own bowl. 

The atmosphere was chill and I liked the decor. Not sure how it gets when it's super busy but I'm willing to go again."
4,"Good music, and great spot to grab a drink during the day or at night. Located next to Hakkasan, you feel the vibe of the people and of the environment."
4,"Oh Man! This is such a fun bar! You gotta go here! I'm serious!

It's not your typical club or anything, it's definitely just a bar, but the bartenders make it so fun! They get up on the bar and dance and it's so fun!

Great music, great drinks. Go for it!"
4,"Boyfriend and I were in for an Indians game. We arrived quite early and only expected to valet our car and have bags checked. However the desk clerk told us our room was ready, but awaiting inspection. We headed to the rooftop bar, which we enjoyed many times during our stay. The room was clean and well appointed. We both agree that we'd stay here again and I've already recommended to friends."
4,"I blame Centrifuge for beginning my obsession with PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE MARTINIS.

Omg.

I didn't know what I was ordering when I picked it, I just *instinctively* chose the first thing on the menu that caught my eye.

IT'S A MUST TRY.  Tastes so much like cake.  And pineapple.  And the splash of grenadine is perfect.  ($14)

Long Island was also good, traditional.  Don't forget to ask about their happy hour specials if you're drinking mid-day!"
4,Free inspections and courtesy code-reads for dash lights and warnings. I come here to get my car maintenance done even though I live on the complete other side of town. The people here are friendly and knowledgable.
4,Large space for group events and great service. Food is decent as well - a good go to if you're in the area and just craving drinks and basic food
4,I've always liked Jack Astors.  Im a fan of their menu.... when it doesn't change!!  Stop trying so hard to change menu.  You finally find something you like only to find out months later they changed their menu AGAIN!  I know it has nothing to do with this location and that's why I still give this 4 stars.  Actually I give it 4 because of the servers.  Why are the women here all models and the ones in the 905 area resemble walruses?  I guess your competing with your neighbor at Joey.  Good job.  It works!
4,"Definitely the hot place to be right now. Contemporary, clean, sexy, right down to the art on the walls and bar napkins. I love the attention to details. If looking to add a little spice to your life, this would be the place! 
Bring your spouse for a sexy rendezvous! Or go stag and meet someone!"
4,Great atmosphere.  I actually had a kobe beef hamburger here that was really good.  I was here for a business function so I tried many different kinds of food.  Everything I had was great.  The wait staff was so friendly and my glass was never empty.  Fun place.
4,"Jim and his team of mechanics do a great job at Meineke.  I've been taking my company car here for the last 4 years and have never left disappointed. They're so efficient here.  My regular car maintenance is usually completed a lot sooner than their original quote.  They're honest and will tell you exactly what's wrong with your vehicle. I recommend this Meineke for your regular car maintenance. 

TIP:  This location is only a 6 minute walk to In-N-Out.  You're welcome. 

2017 Yelp Review #73"
4,"I have been to VooDoo Homestead a couple times. I have yet to try the food (FooDoo) but the beer is spot on. The regular brews are great and the specialty beers are about what you'd expect from a craft brewery. Of those I've been to this is at the top level of craft brewing in my opinion, but I can't say there is too much that sets it apart from the rest. The beer is not brewed on premises from what I can tell but still great."
4,NIce bar with chill vibe.  Nothing too special with drinks or anything like that but just a good place to sit back and watch the game or chat it up with some friends.
4,"Hung out with friends and we got great bottle service, the manager gave us a good deal on a couple bottles.   Music was just OK, but the service was great."
4,"My family and I stayed two nights (Saturday/Sunday) at the 9.  Glad we did.  We were in town for the Cleveland Browns / Green Bay Packers game.   Hotel was clean and fun.   Lots of energy in lobby.  Rooms were quite (except for the usual drunks at the elevator)

We ordered dinner with room service.  Came on time and tasty.  

Bed pretty good and far better then the last series of Marriotts we have stayed at.   Pillows ok 

Water pressure not great - maybe because of the rain shower

No coffee in room but free coffee in the morning at the lobby. 

FYI - easy walk to Browns Game.  No need to drive"
4,"Newfangled. Mouth-watering. Costly. Chic. 

I've driven by Hi Tide daily on my commute to work. When it opened I doubted it would last. After having a bowl tonight, I can only hope it does. 

I chose to build my own bowl since I have dietary restrictions. As i was going through the list i was surprised by the options and how much I could pack into this vibrant bowl of fresh healthy foods. 

I opted for the large, a $5 up charge, and I'm so glad i did. It was filling, but not too much (especially scone I had mostly fruit and veggies). The crispy tofu was better than most and didn't seem greasy. 

I can't wait to take my husband here for the lobstah (New England way of saying it) roll. He will be wicked happy!

I don't think you could go wrong with the menu options or something you create yourself. 

Next up for me, those nachos!!"
4,"We were told by locals in Las Vegas that the Lanai Express has the best oxtail soup, better than the California Hotel and Casino.  Sure enough, the portion of oxtail was so generous and the
broth was rich and tasty, packed with shiitake mushroom, peanut and not to forget the cilantro.
 
If anything was missing, it was the anise star in the broth seasoning. This oxtail soup was so hearty, onolicious that could satisfy any local stomach from the Hawaiian isles. I absolutely agree, the Fremont oxtail soup is far better than what California serves."
4,The guys and gals at Classic Car Spa regularly deliver a great performance. Bring my Tesla here for some TLC and the wife's ride as well. Happy wife - Happy life. Check them out on Living Social for a trial. You won't regret it.
4,"A poke invasion has finally swept through Charlotte. I'm not mad about it. 

Located next to Dilworth Neighborhood Grill, this spot serves up fresh poke bowls, oysters, and seafood rolls. There are 10 Hi Tide Signature Bowls (Regular: $8.95, Large: $12.95) to choose from and you can add toppings to those. There's also the option to build your own bowl with a laundry list of bases, proteins, toppings, sauces, etc. There are sauces on the table as well. If I'm getting a lobster roll, I'm dipping my fries in the sweet soy reduction. I also throw some sriracha in my ketchup.

Specials alert: all day long on Monday's: lobster roll with your choice of seasoned chips or fries $15.99. Big savings, they are usually around $23 (market price). Monday-Friday they do oyster happy hour from 4-7pm. 1/2 off fresh oysters. Note: regular price of their cheapest oyster is usually $3. I still say the steal of the menu is the Poke Nachos ($8.95). Delicious, big portion, and the unagi saucy is tasty. 

They always offer free cucumber & mint water. They also have fresh daily made frescas and a delicious cold brewed Hawaiian Coffee with coconut cream. There's also a cooler with wine, champs, and beer options. 

A heads up: the parking lot is kind of on the small size, you may have trouble finding a spot during peak lunch time.

The Stars are Just Like Us: Coach Ron Rivera sat at the table next to me during a trip here, so if anyone asks I technically had lunch with Riverboat."
4,"Gamble and the bartenders will hook you up. Nice quiet place in the middle of MGM grand. Cool set up, with game screens around the bar , and tables on the outside. Drinks are not spectacular yet strong! That seems like a trend in Vegas though. Recommend this place for a quick laid drink rather than some of the more popular or crowded bars at MGM"
4,"Actually, I really liked this little bar. Its pretty much in the center of the casino at MGM Grand. Its a bit like a really upscale version of Coyote Ugly, minus the bar whores and white trash. The bartenders danced on the bar in scantilly clad outfits. The drinks were reasonable Vegas prices and pretty strong. I will definitely have to remember to come back next time."
4,"Cool lounge *very sleek and modern), but crazy expensive drinks.  Great place to pre-game it before Hakkasan."
4,"This is one of my favorite bars in Vegas.  First of all, it feels like a haven from the busy casino which is right outside of the circular bar.  The lighting is dim, the bartenders friendly, and the drinks are strong.  The circular shape of the bar also encourages conversation and socializing between others.

There is a bi-hourly dance session on the bar by the bartenders & waitresses which is pretty cheesy, but it keeps the spirit lively and interactive, which is a good bar feel."
4,"First time poke bowl experience.

Overall I thought it was good, I don't know if I would get it again--but that is simply off of personal preference. I may try to build my own bowl and see if that makes a difference, I just didn't enjoy the seaweed salad in the bowl with some of the other ingredients. In my specific bowl there were too many red onions, and that flavor kind of took over.

The ingredients were fresh. I ordered the Ahi Tuna bowl with coconut rice. Everything tasted good, I was confused on the sauce situation--the bowl definitely needed some type of sauce on it. But the quality of the fish was fantastic and all the veggies etc. were crisp and yummy. I absolutely loved the pickled radish and would return simply to eat more of that. I got the regular and the portion was perfect for lunch. 

I'm interested in other items on the menu such as the lobster roll and raw oysters, I love the concept and the interior is really bright and inviting. I think they will need to figure out additional seating because it's a popular spot with very little room to sit inside--the parking lot is also small FYI. 

Again, overall it was really good. Ingredients were fresh, service was great--I'd like to go back and try some other items!"
4,"I headed over to the location at Shops at Don Mills to take my interns out for a goodbye luncheon. There were 7 of us that day and we were seated at a rather cramped table that was maybe only meant to comfortably seat 6. I didn't complain too much though because I prefer round tables over rectangles, so not a huge deal.

First off, service was amazing. Food, on the other hand, was meh, but the service definitely made up for it. We decided to start out with the spinach artichoke dip. Now, this is probably one of the only things that I get from Jack's when I'm sober because it's actually good, so I was pretty excited when we ordered this. I was pretty much drooling as I was waiting for the dip to come out, only to be gravely disappointed at the quality of it. I get this at least once every 2 months, either from the Yonge and Dundas location, Yonge and Bloor location, or Scarborough Town Center location. Not once has the dip been watery like soup, but for some reason, it was at Shops at Don Mills. God, it was horrendous. I didn't even bother eating it, so I just sent it back. Even my broke interns didn't want to eat it lol. No more than 2 mins later, the manager came by and said ""Congratulations! You're the guinea pig table for our spinach artichoke soup. We hope you liked it!"" I thought he was being serious for a second, until he sincerely apologized for the quality of the dip. He then took it off the bill immediately. 

Next, we all got our entrees. Again. I try not to eat at Jack's unless I'm looking to get day drunk on their mixed drinks because the food isn't that great unless your senses are compromised. I got the sauced up chicken fingers .The sauce is way too oily, but the fries were good. Then again, I was on a clean-eating binge for a week, so anything fried, salty, and oily tasted great. One of my interns ordered a pasta that was a little too dry for her liking, so she sent it back and the manager promptly apologized again. 

At the end of our meal, platefuls of surprise brownies were served for the inconvenience that we experienced that day. Although the food wasn't great, the service was amazing and I'll def be back to bring my next batch of interns for their goodbye luncheon. Thanks Jack's! If I remembered the manager's name, I would've posted it here, but I don't. Great guy though."
4,"Centrifuge is one of the bars we frequent when going to Vegas. Sit where you like, order a drink and relax, musics playing, every half hour the bartenders dance on top of the bar. Great place to rest your feet and have a great drink."
4,So this little gem has 99 cent shrimp cocktails! I mean for a buck I wasn't going to pass it up!! A hair spicy on the cocktail sauce but otherwise delicious!
4,"I came for their $15 lobster rolls (plus chips or fries) on Monday. 

Off to great start when I ordered my to go order at the register. I was given an infused water to sip on while I waited. And waited and waited. Call ahead for your order as I waited 30 min for two lobster rolls and fries. 

That said, can't wait to come back to grab sushi grade fish to go or enjoy their wide selection of oysters. 

The lobster rolls were stuffed full of sweet meat. The fries weren't special but the lobster more than made up for that."
4,"Great hangout place. Definitely get the Pierogi. Burgers are small, all well done, average. I'd get more pierogies instead. Good beer selection."
4,"This place is a favorite on a warm day.  They open the garage doors in the front to give it a great open air feel.  Giving 4 stars because some of the other local breweries offer just a bit more in options for non beer drinkers.  However, definitely recommend stopping by for a beer and some food.  Be sure to check out the attached art gallery and arcade for a little added fun while sipping on your beer!"
4,This was one of my favorite places in Vegas. The bartenders were nice and know how to make strong drinks. I'll never be able to find a better Coconut Mojito than I've had here. Every half hour they dance on the bar which is fun and the music is good too. Very chill and a great atmoshpere to spend a couple of hours at.
4,"Downtown prime location. The restaurant has very good food. The rooms are clean. The rooms seem to be retrofitted from an early era when not a hotel. It is an awkward arrangement. I have to say the beds are not  very comfortable and there is NO coffee machine in the rooms. We had to get up and go down the elevators to the lobby in the mornings for our first cup of coffee.  We are told you can order a pot in the mornings. Electrical outlets not on both bedsides, pillows are super big--the type that give you a stiff neck. I wouldn't consider this a luxury hotel, but the people are nice and the cleaning service staff works hard. I am stretching to give this hotel 4 stars. There isn't a desk and the living area and bedrooms are together. There is no way to call ""housekeeping"" nor is there any concierge services."
4,"Hi Tide Poke & Raw Bar is a nice hybrid of a casual poke restaurant / oyster bar and (small) seafood market.  

I stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday evening around 6:30 pm and had my choice of tables.   Oysters are half-priced from 4 pm - 7 pm -- they had about 6 options ranging from $3 - $5/oyster (before the happy hour special).  The oyster selection is up on a chalkboard - check out the 1-5 rating to determine salinity (5 is super-salty).  

We started off with half a dozen oysters (3 varieties - all D-LISH) and a bowl of seaweed salad.  I love, love, love seaweed salad and order it frequently.  I have never had a seaweed salad like Hi Tide's version.  It's make up of 3-4 varieties of seaweed, sesame seeds, crispy garlic and mixed with a very light dressing.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.  I think it was an interesting flavor - worth trying - but, not something I would necessarily order again.  

We both ordered large poke bowls (they're not huge - I would recommend the large for an average sized meal).  The fish and toppings were fresh and crisp.  There were 4 different sauces on the table to add to your fish (in addition to the sauce that came with your bowl), if you so desire.

They have a nice selection of beer, wine and sake.  Overall, this is a great option for a casual, fresh meal that feels a bit ""fancy""."
4,"Centrifuge is still a fun place to go to kill a little time listening to Pop/Rap/Hip Hop music, play a little video poker and drink.   I paid for my first drink before I started playing video poker and gave my bartender a nice tip.  After that all the drinks were on the house (Tanqueray gin not the house gin) which was very nice.   Had a great time people watching and watching the bartenders dance on the bar every 30 minutes.   Will be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
4,"Very cool bar! I really liked the decor, and OMG the music! The playlist was put together by the bar staff, and boy do they have a GREAT taste in music. 

They have over 7 different dance routines that they perform on every 30 minute basis. 

The staff was very friendly, and they were great dancers. 

This place is super cool."
4,"One of the best deals in Downtown!!  Yes, go for the oxtail soup or the saimin.  And who cares about the service!  It's a fast food joint!  And thank GOD, one of the few places in Vegas that still has late night specials, like breakfast items!!!!!

Their Chinese food is OK.  About the same as what you would find at Panda Express.  

And hands down, the best deal in town for a good footlong hot dog!!!  It's a shame you can't find this on the Strip!  I don't even know if Slots O Fun still has it."
4,"Ended up going twice while I was in town. Good drinks, good service, and cool atmosphere. I will definitely go back next time I am in town next time. Plus I liked when the bartenders were dancing on the bar! :o)"
4,"I went here to get my car waxed. I was impressed with the prompt service. The service was typical with what you'd find at a car-wash place. They tended to me like a customer.

However, I noticed the wax finish faded away quickly - about a month and a half. I'm not a genius on car waxes, but I recall wax holding its glossy and protective structure a few months. 

The price was nominal for the labor involved. $130, I recall. Wasn't a great deal, but wasn't bad, either. 

The gas prices here are reasonable, but not a steal. They don't get a whole lot of gas customer traffic, so they pass the costs onto you. 

I'll probably be back again. Nothing would abstain me from more car waxes except money with this place. :)"
4,"It is, like all tourist attraction bars in this fabulous city, WAAAAY overpriced! But if you like to shop for your next boob job, this is the place to be since most of the lady bartenders have undergone this procedure. 
I actually chose mine base on one of the ladies :)"
4,"My friend and I came here on the opening day. We ordered spicy tuna bowls. Hers was on rice and mine was on soba noodle. Both were delicious. It took a while for us to get our order but it is understandable since it was their first day. The only flaw I saw was the toppings in the two bowls were slightly different and mine didn't have the spicy sauce.

The staffs were super super friendly. They let us take time to order and always walked by to check if we need anything. I got their peach green tea which was really good. They packed another cup for me to go when we finished our meal. 

We will definitely come back."
4,$6.99 steak and eggs breakfast from 12AM-7AM. Best $6.99 I ever spent on steak! Cooked to perfection!
4,Must say. The Decuces combo is pretty decent and ok for its price. USD 3.99. Customer service is pretty ok given it is 4am. I'd eat here again
4,"This is quite a nice hotel. Very good restaurant attached in which we ate breakfast every morning, very comfortable sleeping room, and helpful staff. Located right down town within walking distance to many attractions, such as Progressive Field; we did make it to an Indians game during our stay.

We were on our annual summer father/daughter trip in which we catch some concerts, visit attractions, etc. and this year we started in NJ (our home state) and made our way to Cleveland. We traveled by car on July 21st from NJ after a concert, knowing that we would arrive at the hotel very late. This reservation was made 60 days in advance, and I called on July 21st on our drive there to confirm the reservation and also advise that we would arrive near 2:00am EST. We arrived as scheduled, and was checked into Room 408 quickly and without incident. The next day, we slept in, and then headed out to enjoy the city. We observed an odd sight while we were waiting out front for a cab; blue plastic tarps are completely covering the alley between our hotel and the building next door...and lots of vehicles and activity. The next day, we were off to Warped Tour, and around noon my wife emails me a link to a story in which a dead body was found in a guest room at the Metropolitan 9....as it happens, the body is in Room 406, next door to us! Needless to say, my daughter is now freaked out, as we still have another night to stay there. I convince her everything will be fine, and we will be out and on the road very early the next day, which we were. 
What I can't understand is why did they check us into the room that is 10 feet away from a room where a dead body is located? The body was discovered on July 21st during the day, and was still in there when we checked in! It was removed the next day, on July 22nd, based on the tarps and the article that I read in the local paper. My feeling is, checking us into the room that they did, was deceptive on the part of the hotel staff."
4,"good gawd, that oxtail soup is so. good. ginger-y broth, succulent fall-off-the-bone oxtail, and loads of cilantro and shiitake mushrooms on top. like, why get anything else? I ordered the oxtail with rice on two separate visits to lanai express, and each time, fellow visitors stared perplexed at my order.  I educated them on the deliciousness that is oxtail, but alas, they ordered orange chicken. thx, tourists, more oxtail for me."
4,"Always excellent service here.  The sauced up chicken fingers are my go-to faves and the burgers are always delicious. Food is well priced, but the drinks are quite expensive. The friendly staff and short wait time keep me coming back!"
4,"Wow!i came in last night at 926pm... with a friend . No one available to do our pedicures.. I said ""don't call some one in , I will come back. Asked what time they opened next day, 930am.  I have now been here since 920am... it is currently 1010am. No one here, door locked. Called other location twice and they assured me they open at 10am even though sign says 930am. Not a good way to start off a business... I live so close I could walk, but will gladly drive where I know they want my business.. sorry I really wanted this to work. 

UPDATED
After finally getting a hold of the owner Dan, he rushed in and apologized for any inconvenience. Dan was very courteous and made things right. And was very attentive to my needs. Cat came in after Dan and started on my manicure.. they were both awesome and made me feel better about it all. I will for sure give them another try. I do understand that they are working out the kinks being newly opened. Give them a try I'm sure you will not be disappointed. It is very nice inside and so is the owner and staff."
4,Their lounge fries are fantastic. Always get them. Service is usually very good and I have never had a problem. Another good menu item is their buffalo chicken flatbread.
4,"Two battleships to go..cheese steak was awesome..add the mayo to the grilled chicken and its yummy too. You will wait in line, no matter the time I hear, so prob best to call ahead."
4,"Ok first I want to say how funny I think it is that some of the reviewers ate at this buffet and found that it wasent the Ritz.  It a buffet. what did you expect...
With that said I have eaten here twice and brought some family once and everyone loved it, is the beef and broccoli the best in the world, of course not but its pretty darn good for a buffet.  Over all the food was above average buffet quality, the selection was great, the mongolian bbq was great and the service was really good."
4,"I (finally) gave Jamburritos another chance this morning after having a yummy sample from them at an event earlier this year. This morning the husband and I shared a chicken jamburrito... it was legit tasty. It had yummy bold flavors, fresh ingredients, juicy chicken, and ...the best part?.... green peas.... yum! It was served with a spicy red sauce and a mild green sauce... the red sauce was delicious, the green sauce was nothing special. The burrito itself was huge, more than enough for the two of us. I would come here again for sure. Glad I gave them another chance!"
4,"popped in here for a few drinks before the bank and though it was tinier than expected i liked it.  caramel is the perfect name for it.  smooth..warm..cozy.  they were playing hip hop/r&b, which was an added bonus."
4,"Beautiful dining room. Delicious petite filet. I ordered mine charred medium rare and it was cooked to perfection, The runner, Felix could not have been more attentive. When I spoke with the manager to extend my compliments he said that Felix has been in the building since the Elvis days. If you love a great steak, give Edge a try."
4,"NPL is a great restaurant and I go there weekly.

The good:
- Tons of appetizer choices for sports bar food. Wings, Pretzels, Big fries with cheese/bacon, nachos that are good but will make you poop green, onion rings and other things.
- I love their burgers. My mom hates them but I really enjoy them.
- I don't eat much fish but everyone loves their big fish sandwich.
- You will have something to take home, especially if you have an appetizer.
- The walking manager is really a great guy. He is the heart of NPL.

The bad:
- The bus boys are like hawks preying on little birds when there are empty plates or glasses around. They watch and wait and glance at you multiple times, begging you to finish. It gets annoying.
- They have TV's at all the booths, however, the TV's have maybe 6-7 channels. 1 is some kind of poker game, 1 always has no audio and if there is a Pittsburgh sports game on, it will be on multiple channels, meaning you get maybe 3 different channels to choose from. 
- They have new booths and there is one by the door that is only meant for people under 150lbs. It was the first booth I couldn't fit in ever in my life.

TIPS:
- They take a long time to make burgers and other meats.
- They ""stagger"" food and appetizers. This means that after you order an appetizer, they will wait however long they feel to put in the order. Tell them not to ""stagger it"" and you will be out of there A LOT quicker."
4,Pretty good deal we got. We drove in from California a week ago and the car has been getting slammed with bugs and dirt with all the driving we been doing in town. We decided to get the ride cleaned up and found TNT. Not only was the price reasonable but with the yelp checkin we got a $2 discount. There was no wait so they had us in and out in no time.
4,"one of the few chains i would go over and over again and proud to say i go to. quick, easy, tastey = never disappoints!"
4,"When I'm in the mood for pizza that's a step up from Costco and Pizza Hut, Barro's is definitely my go-to. I've only had their regular pepperoni pizza and their wings, and I have yet to be disappointed with the food. The sauce is delicious and the pizza has always been cooked to perfection. They can definitely get pretty busy, though, so if you're placing a to-go order on one of their busier nights, you might need to wait an extra 10-15 minutes on top of the estimated time that they give you when you place your order online or over the phone. 

This place can also get super packed with kids since they have a game room in the back, so if you don't want to hear a bunch of screaming and yelling, you should probably get your food to go like me.

Their medium pepperoni pizza runs for about $10 and feeds two people. Definitely a safe bet!"
4,"Small seating available but service was prompt and friendly. 

The portion of the sweet potato fries was quite large but a bit over fried. 
The sandwich was good but a bit to much mayo. 

 If you are looking for an alternative to Burger and regular fries this would be very similar but with an Asian flair. 
I love the cilantro that they include in the banh mi. 

Great for a quick bite on the go. 
Street parking tricky to find as it is located on Yonge St. 

Also, they always play 90's music which I love. 

Enjoy!"
4,The experience was exquisite but few remarks on not salting or buttering too much.  The staff was excellent & the service perfect. Mark was an excellent advisor for choosing the wine  & Felix a nice waiter kept attending to us. The edge was a great choice

Caramel is sweet. When my company comes to Vegas for CES, you'll find us at a table all pimped out in our logo-ed, polyester, sweater vests- cause that's how we roll in Vegas. 

- Bottles of Grey Goose, Voss, Black Label, and Pierre strewn across the table.CEO:  ""I don't want an EMPTY space on the table- KEEP them coming.""
- Hot hostesses asking for my Directory of Sale's number (on a napkin).  
- Oh look, Paris just walked by. ""What's up, girl! DAMN, your feet are big (size 11)!""
- Girl accompanied by her boyfriend to my female co-worker: ""Hey, let's go back to my room. I'll leave my boyfriend down here."" 

Leather chairs, marble tables, super-sized ottomans- have I been transported to a Pottery Barn Design Center?

It's intimate, it's cozy, it's loungy- just like me. 

I've never looked so good in my sweater vest on a leather chair.

4,"Happy Birthday to my Hakka Wife!

This restaurant was another recommendation from my co-worker Eli.  It was Saturday night and I was planning to take my wife here for her birthday.  We decided to ixnay on the reservations and just go and wait.

We park on the street and walk to the restaurant.  There was only one couple in front of us which was great.  The host said that it would be a 20 minute wait, and it was that long.  All the tables were filled and man, it's so loud in there.  When you walk inside, the famous Italian mom Rose was cooking in her tight little kitchen.  She had about 6 helpers/servers to dish out her cooking and clean.

The place itself is kinda tiny, I think max 50 seats available.

The menu is always changing so this time, it was Veal Lasagna, Linguine with Rapini and Orecchiette with Ricotta.  $10.75 a bowl?  You can't go wrong!  A table for 2 opens up and we are seated.  We are told everything is tomato based pasta which was fine.  I saw a whole ton of peeps buying the veal meatballs and it looked delicious.

We decide to order veal lasagna, veal meatballs and orecchiette pasta.  The waiter gives the bread and within 5 to 6 minutes, I kid you not, our food came out, hot and fresh.  The food was steamy but we couldn't wait, we fork it out our mouths quickly.

Veal Lasagna was good!  It was not intact in a square like in other restaurants.  It is more of the shredded kind.  It didn't blow me away but it's homely, tomato-y, and rich as hell.  You totally need to eat it with the complimentary bread to dilute the sauce and oiliness.  2 Veal Meatballs came loaded with tomato sauce and was absolutely tender.  We pushed a fork in it and it crumbled.  Delicious and soft no doubt.  The cheese in the veal lasagna and the veal meatballs have this distinct flavour.  I was not really a fan of it because it was strong.  It kinda reminded me of lamb, which was weird.  I trucked through it and was really satisfied.  The best part was that my Hakka Wife enjoyed eating her pasta.

What was kinda annoying was that it was so loud in the restaurant.  I found myself shouting at my wife and asking her to repeat what she said.  After a few people left, the sound level got better.

This comfort food just sticks to the bones and although rich and oily, gives a taste you will remember, just in case you come back for more.  It's great knowing that it comes from a real Italian mother and a very affordable price.  Stays true to the authenticity of the cooking.  I plan to return in the distant future."
4,"First time there, had 10oz filet. steak was good nothing above expected. Mushrooms were good, Brussel sprouts were bit undercooked somewhat too aldente."
4,Wings and burgers are always good here! Generally packed so plan to go a little earlier if you are going for dinner.
4,"Dumpling is in their name and I didn't try one! Darn it... next time! I did try their Kung Pao Triple lunch special. For $6.25 I got a combination of beef, pork & shrimp along with fried rice and soup. Not bad! It tasted good too. I felt my wife got a bigger portion in her lunch special that was mere .30 less than mine but I had a nice combo of meats. I have eaten at another little Dumpling location across town and have no idea if they are connected but this location is much better. This is a great place for lunch."
4,Came here for late lunch with my husband and son. They served us pretty quick. Our servers were very nice and friendly. The chef also came and greeted us and check to see if we were ok. The food tasted ok. Not horrible at all for the price we paid. Will definitely go back.
4,"Great drink
Great atmosphere
Love the old school games
Love the selection of drinks

Only downfall bartenders only focus on people at the bar"
4,"I got a grilled catfish burrito for at the Phoenix Public Market, and it was really good! The lady was also offering hush puppy samples, which then led me to get them with my meal. The burrito was way too much food, and I don't know whether it's just me and southern food, but after eating about half, I didn't want to eat it anymore. I wasn't really full and it was delicious, but I just didn't want to eat that anymore. The hush puppies were delicious as well, and I definitely wanted to eat those. Food is good, but I suggest sharing it with someone else!"
4,"Banh Mi is that place to go when you want to spend five bucks on some trendy food and feel pretty satisfied afterwards.  

Look,  this isn't some fancy shmancy place, but hot dang it's tasty.  The menu is small and simple.  

I've had the pork belly sandwich,  Kimchi fries,  and spicy pork belly steamed bao.

Pork belly sandwich: good,  filling,  generous on the meat portions.  A little bit plain and could use more sauce and less bread,  but well priced and decent.  

Kimchi fries: I will return just for these fries. These are life changing. Get them with some spice,  you won't regret it.  

Pork belly steamed bao: really well priced,  very very delicious.  Get these over the sandwiches!

May Update: PLEASE get the kalbi sandwich. I take back my previous sandwich comment as long as you get this one! IT'S AWESOME."
4,We have been eating here for years.  We never have a bad meal.  The fried zucchini is great.  The garlic rolls are to die for.  The salads are really good.  My husband likes the pot roast and meatloaf.
4,"1st time experience ... very positive. Great atmosphere, high energy, a little bit of a wait but that was expected. Seafood Gumbo was very good only surprise was the use of Fried Catfish bits (vs shrimp or scallop) but it fits with the rest of the menu offerings. Very tasty, use of Okra was great to see, just a bite of of spice for my taste, so I did add more from selection of Hot Sauces available. Pricing was reasonable for the portion. Service staff were friendly, fast and accurate. Overall ambiance at Public Market also good, clean with people coming around to help clear tables, area was packed so seating at a premium but everyone looked to be having a good time, very much like a street fair. Looking to go back soon"
4,"Awesome place checked on after a Dbacks game. Great selection of beers and and an even better happy hour. The vibe is chill and they have a bunch of board games you can play while drinking.  The it reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the service was slow. They were doing the best they could with only 2 people working,  but come on you know that it is game day."
4,"What I love about Yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the ""Nearby"" search and prior reviewers telling you, ""it's okay, try it!""

The grilled chicken burrito I had was delicious. What makes their burritos is the tortilla!  Their tortillas are the best I've had in a long time. Add the great salsa bar (small but fresh) and you have a great local neighborhood gem.

I would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat, which I love but isn't for everyone.  The smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful.  It also had delicious Mexican rice & just enough melted cheese.

Their salsa was so good I finished every chip!  This place would be compared to a locally owned Baja Fresh, but so much better ingredients and true Mexican flare, right down to the mariachi music being piped in!  You order at the counter and listen for your number to be called.  The staff is great and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables.

Thanks Chico's I'll be back."
4,"Went back to Lazy Daisy's after a long time of not going there as I don't recall it being stellar, food-wise.  I went there on a Monday and was surprised to see they had a promo called ""Mama Mondays"", that gives 10% off the whole order.  I had an iced latte, the farmers club sandwich and a caramel chocolate brownie.

The sandwich wasn't a huge portion, which you think would be more for the price but given that their ingredients are naturally raised meats, etc and there was a lot of it, I was okay with the higher price point.  The chicken breast was great and of course the bacon.

The iced latte meets expectations of a local coffee joint.  It's smooth and delicious.

chocolate caramel brownie: omg.  so good. must go back for another.

What I loved though is as a mom, I can eat there and my older child can be entertained and the food there is healthy (just don't get the decadent pastries for them.. save it for yourself!).  The 10% discount on Mondays is also a nice touch.  the food isn't particularly creative but they do a good job of sourcing quality ingredients and it shows.  The portions are also not the largest, so I wouldn't go in if you're starving."
4,"I'm a student and I can't seem to work at home so I enjoy travelling to cafes to work for the day. I arrived around 11am and ordered an almond milk cappuccino. One of the best I've had, so smooth and velvety. Their prices are in the midrange. I've definitely paid more for coffee. They didn't mind me sitting all day which is nice some restaurants try to rush you out. A couple hours later I ordered lunch. I got the breakfast burrito. This usually comes with chorizo but I am a vegetarian so they happily substituted portobello mushrooms for the sausage. I highly recommend this menu item. They grill it and serve it with a couple pieces of fruit and a side of hot sauce. Delicious. Overall a good experience. The only two downsides for me was the screaming children (although to be fair they do warn you it is a child friendly environment) and the cold air that blows through the vents all day. Other than that friendly staff, cute atmosphere, delicious food and coffee, great for students."
4,Great local cafe with delicious eats & treats. Always in for a London Fog and the hard-not-to-get Grandma's Butter Tarts.
4,I came here just before walking over to The Bank and they definitely got me excited for partying all night with their great music selection.. The staff is incredibly friendly and took great care of me and my girlfriends.. After a free round of drinks we were escorted to the club and waited in line for only 5 seconds! Record breaking.. The only con about this bar is probably the size of it.. The drinks tasted great but the venue is definitely one of the smallest I've been in.. Great for a lounge if you're into intimate settings but I'm all about the party and prefer to be in a larger space with more of a crowd.. I gotta give it up to Moody and Brady for the great service though! Thanks for everything guys [:
4,You can't go wrong with this choice.  A huge menu and bar area will satisfy even the most picky eaters in your party.   I have never had a bad thing to eat here.  They also have a great selection of wings and draft beers at reasonable prices.
4,"Just like most Waffle House's... excellent service, good food, cheap."
4,"Lazy Daisy's is such a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. I'd love it just because it's the only cafe within a ten minute walk of my house and they serve great coffee (Te Aro - locally roasted and delish). But to my absolute delight it gets even better than that! 

They offer a wide and interesting (spiced cheese and apple? I can't wait!) array of sandwiches, breakfasts, soups, and baked goods, all of which are made with local ingredients (there's even a cute little map posted of all the different farms they buy from). Food seems reasonably priced, with sandwiches ranging from 4-8 dollars and the chili (the most expensive thing listed) topping out just shy of 9. They even have some gluten-free baked goods (today I sampled the peach and oat mini tart - mmm) as well as a gluten-free bread option for their sandwiches. Love.

Add to that the comfortable space - it's rustic meets urban chic, with worn hardwood floors and vintage wooden boxes as shelves alongside sleek white dining chairs and leather armchairs. And the free, no hassle wifi. And the fact that it seems like they really want to be a community cafe (there's a little kids corner and enough space that I can't imagine feeling like you're 'in the way' if you linger over a book) and we have a definite winner. 

I am so sold. I may never spend a homework day at home ever again. Ever. 

Best of luck, Lazy Daisy's! I'm really happy to see you in the neighbourhood!"
4,Haven't been there in a while but had gone the other day. The food is still great!  The best in the area!!
4,"MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.

This is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos. 

They have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.

The portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.

The tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.

The California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.

The restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.

And if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)

PS I think they are closed on Sundays"
4,"Of the million trips I make to Vegas, I somehow always end here at the end of the night. Maybe it's because of the no cover charge, good music, strong drinks, great company, and chill environment. I am always bound to have a good time here. You do not have to pay bottle service to get a seat. There are a lot of seats here. 

If you're looking for a low key night in Sin City, stop by Caramel. It's a great alternative to a popular nightclub."
4,I like this place. It has some decent fast Mexican food. The chicken is delicious. I do love the greasey foods when the craving calls for it. I recommend the Asada Platter or the Achiote Chicken Salad. That is my absolute favorite. And don't skip on the Churros.
4,Excellent service and really good food.  The chef was very accommodating to our dietary requirements.  The only criticism that I have is that the dining room is really bright as compared to the warmly lit bar area.  Particularly the lighting over the booth tables - distractingly bright.  A dimmer atmosphere would enhance the ambiance and overall sophistication of the dining experience.  I really hope this is addressed;)
4,"Solid 4.5 stars.  

I, like the review by Jeff F., stopped in for Food Truck Friday on 4-22-2011 and had almost the same thing he had:   the chicken and okra gumbo and the fried catfish SANDWICH special.  

Both were definitely super-tasty.  

The gumbo was a $5, decently large portion that was yummy, not overly salty, and full of large chunks of chicken and okra and sausage with a saucy white rice base.  I was amazed at the sheer number of chunks of meat or okra - it never ended, all the way to the last scrape of the paper-lined cardboard bowl.

The catfish in the sandwich was coated with your basic cornmeal batter, served on buttered Texas toast, with some kind of mayo sauce and lettuce and tomatoes.  It was large enough that I saved half of it for part of  my breakfast on Saturday.  I'd like to add that the catfish fillet was VERY THICK.  One of the thickest catfish cuts I have seen in this town.

One of the best uses of $10 I have seen in a while.  Worth the money, tasty as all get-out, and a signal that eating again off this truck is in my future."
4,"Worth the trip just for the ranch dressing alone!  I haven't been here in years and as native Pittsburgher returning to the area - this is the kind of food I've been missing!  Good service, lots of choices, fast and fresh!  I had the chicken tortellini salad....and I'll be back to have it again and again!"
4,Perfect sub in a real PGH neighborhood... TV's and pounders to make for a great weekend lunch spot.
4,"So while my in-laws were in line to order plain hot dogs because they weren't willing to even try the combinations this particular food truck was offering, much less see which other trucks were at the festival, I wandered off and settled on Jamburritos.  

I returned to the band of boring and enjoyed my catfish plate.  My perfectly seasoned catfish was served with a spicy jambalaya rice and crispy hush puppies.  I ate every last bite far beyond the point of being full just so everyone could see what they missed.  ""Is that catfish?""  ""Yep (with full mouth).""  ""Is it good?""  ""(Swallow) Yes.""  ""Where did you get it?""  ""(Takes another bite) At a truck that was not at the entrance so you didn't see it.""

Thanks Jamburritos."
4,"The lounge fries. Oh god, god yes. That's all you need to order, and that's all you need to know.

Oh, and the beer and the people are also both great."
4,"I've been a Wacky Wings customer for at least half a decade now. It's a huge space that's split 50/50 between a sports bar and a pool hall. Theres even a mini arcade as well as an overflow dining area with smaller TVs for when it gets extra busy. To give you some sense of scale, this overflow dining area is bigger than most restaurants!

I most frequently come here to play pool, which if it hasn't changed, is half price before 5pm. Last I checked, it was $12/hr, but they may have raised it to $14. Pricey. The layout is good though - the lighting is perfect, and the table spacing is adequate enough that you won't be hitting other people. Each table has some sort of seating - either at a table or a countertop so that you can chill and watch the numerous TVs and even have a meal. They have full waiter service in the pool section.

That's the pool side.

I'm less familiar with the sports bar/dining section. I rarely eat here because the times that I did, it was just standard, nondescript bar food. They try to put interesting twists on items though, which I appreciate. I recently had their loaded wings, which was a set of 8 boneless wings with some toppings, interestingly plated and served on an iron skillet. These were solid in terms of creativity, but overall quality wasn't the greatest. 

Their namesake dish, the wings, are definitely the more popular option here. They have at least 50 flavours, many of which are unique and interesting. Their hottest wing flavour, Devil's Inferno, is one of the hottest wings I've ever tasted in my life. On Wednesdays, they have AYCE night, where you can get AYCE wings for $19 with the purchase of a drink. With the drink, this'll end up being about $25, which is likely more than you'd pay for a night out eating wings anyway... So I'm not sure it's worth it, but regardless, I hear it's packed every week.

Drink wise, they don't serve pitchers. In their place, they serve 80oz towers of beer. These are huge and are good for 5 full pints. Their beers are reasonably priced and are sold in this 80oz format as well as 16oz and 32oz.

The TVs here are a huge draw. They have a massive projector screen surrounded by like 10 TVs on the main wall, and there are TVs scattered everywhere else in the venue. A screen will be within view from every square inch in this building.

Service wise, things are okay. Beers took a little long to arrive considering all they were doing was pouring... But it's not too bad. Food came in a reasonable time. One incident that bothered me is that the first time I ordered Devil's Inferno wings, they served it without tossing them in the sauce. The wings are considerably hotter with the sauce, so we complained and got the sauce on the side. However, had I not been with someone who had already had the flavour before, we would never have known as this was not disclosed to us. Another thing that bothered me is the lag between some of the screens. Watching the TFC playoff game yesterday, some TVs were ahead of others by about a second. I was watching the late TV and noticed when hundreds of people were cheering on a goal before me. So service wise, Wacky Wings is passable but could definitely be improved.

Overall, Wacky Wings is solid in the aspects that are most important. They have screens everywhere, the pool area is fantastic, and the food is good enough. It's no surprise how popular they are for a night out."
4,"Love this place! They have board games and a nice staff. I tried the German chocolate cake beer (in honor of my birthday, this is what the bartender suggested when I told him I like heavy dark beers) while my friend had a peanut butter and jelly beer. Both were very tasty. We did not try the food so I can't say anything about it, but they have so much variety when it comes to beer and wine."
4,"Yummy waffles, quick, friendly service and a simple and inexpensive menu..... what more could you ask for?"
4,"Gonna get some cold cuts today!  I must say that they know how to make a quality sub or ""BattleShip.""  You come in to this place and you know its quality by the line stretching to the door. I saw one guy walking out with at least five. I've ordered these for parties and events but will always stop (even if I'm not hungry) when I'm in the Swissvale area.  There is just something about these subs I can't explain.  They do everything right here.  From the breads to the meats, to the shredded lettuce these battleships are legit!  They serve 40's too!"
4,"This is my go to spot for Chinese takeout. The Thai is slightly above average. Avoid the teriyaki as it's pretty plain. Prices are cheap and the staff is friendly. Too bad it's smack dab in the middle of my commute. Here's a tip though, their delivery radius is much wider than you probably think. Call them and ask if they can deliver and you might be surprised. 

Dishes that stand out:

Walnut shrimp (I don't see it on the menu for some reason, but I order it often enough to know it exists. $9 for about 20 large shrimp!). Pork with Hot Garlic Sauce. Singapore Noodles. BBQ pork fried rice."
4,"Came in for brunch this Saturday morning and I had a pleasant experience here. The environment is very comfortable and if you had some work to do, you could bring in your laptop for afew hours, given that you don't mind noise. I'm saying this because there is a kids corner where they can play so if you're looking for some quiet, look for another café. 

I ordered a chai tea latte ($3.99) and a breakfast burrito which has avocado, monetary Jack cheese, scrambled eggs, and sausage bits (~$9). The price of the food and drinks here is a little expensive for me. But! The chai tea latte was the best I've ever had and the burrito was delicious! When you order at the cash register, they give you a number and you can take a seat. The server will find your number and serve you your food. 

If you're in the area, do try it out :) just know its a family style cafe where people bring their kids!"
4,"J and I decided to go to First Friday, just for the sake of trying out the food trucks!  We discovered the little gem, Jamburritos!!  

$6 Chicken Jamburrito = tasty and very filling!!  :) And more than enough food to feed both J and myself.  I will say though, that the burrito could have been rolled a little tighter. 
$2 hush puppies = Super tasty!!!

The jamburrito had a nice little kick of spice to it.  Very Tasty!!  J and I were stuffed after each of us having half of the burrito (along with sharing half a hamburger from Ralph's).  Well worth the $8.00 for the burrito and hush puppies."
4,"Mmmmmm thicc and fried potatoes....with kimchi and mayo...huge carb overload thats so delicious and worth it...if you ever stop by any Banh Mi Boys you've gotta order their kimchi fries! I also got the pork bao which was delicious as well. Prices are also fairly reasonable for the portion, quality, and taste."
4,I've ordered in and had it delivered many times from here.  It's a good little place and the prices are great.  Hunan Beef is my favorite (add extra spicey)
4,"Giving it 4 because the toppings & fries were good. Don't go expecting Quebec style poutine. You will be dissapointed. Not even sure the cheese was curd. If it ain't curd, it ain't poutine!"
4,I enjoy Chicos Tacos when I am downtown.  Delicious!
4,Peep deez FRITES. Big portions and good food. Wouldn't recommend the panko crusted steamed bao though.
4,"They have quite the extensive menu , all poutine based. This was my first time having this treat in Canada itself. We had the peppercorn chicken, a small. Now if splitting, the small is just a snack size for two. If you're hungry j recommend getting your own. There wasn't much chicken in our poutine, so I was a little disappointed in that sense. Overall poutine is a decent dish. The environment here is pretty chill, casual, laid back. Nice place to stop in for a snack!"
4,"Awesome food!. We were here  to be close to a show and to celebrate my sisters birthday. And I was pleasantly surprised . The chopped salad was so good and fresh. I had the 20 oz steak with truffle mac and cheese ,my sister had the Beef Wellington  and sautéed mushroom. When I say that this food was so good I mean it. To top it off our server Mark was the best . He checked on us constantly and  even held our left overs until after the show. Felix was also super nice and Cheryl OMG even walked  us to the box office to pick up our tickets. This was by far the best dining experience ever."
4,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel. After reading the negative reviews, I was a bit skeptic, but everything was really nice. The front staff was wonderful. The manager's reception was pleasant. Great breakfast, clean rooms, etc. I was a little annoyed I had to pay for WiFi, but fortunately I was traveling for work. The only downside here is the area of town it is in. I walked to the convenience store down the block and that was a mistake. Creepy, creepy."
4,"I really like Embassy. The size of the rooms, great breakfast and happy hour altogether are reasons to continue to be a patron of this hotel.  I like that they have an indoor pool so that no matter what the weather is... You can enjoy. It's not too far from the EpiCenter."
4,"So earlier this year during all those snowstorms on the East Coast and all eastbound flights were being canceled, I somehow ended up grounded in North Carolina. Now I've vacationed in NC before and I know it's beautiful but in the dead of winter with my flight canceled and me looking at having to cough up extra $$ for a hotel, I was none too happy about being in North Carolina, beautiful or not.

Since I knew I had no other choice except to spend the night in Charlotte, I wanted to make sure I wasn't stuck in some seedy motel. As a female traveling alone, I didn't want to take any chances so decided on the Embassy Suites Hotel since I'd stayed at one before and knew that even though it wasn't overly luxurious, at least I'd feel safe. There was a free shuttle bus transfer to and from the airport which was very helpful since I didn't need to worry about cab fare.

For what I paid ($99 for the night which was decent considering there were probably hundreds of stranded travelers like me calling in to find a hotel room that same night), I got a very nice suite. The front desk was very helpful and sympathetic to my situation and gave me a nice room. It was actually sort of too big considering I was all by my lonesome and didn't even have any luggage except a small duffel bag.  I made the most of it by grabbing dinner downstairs (review to come), taking a bath, and ordering a movie. The bed was soft and comfortable and I slept like a baby.

The next morning I had a great breakfast they'd set out downstairs and I took my free shuttle to the airport where I caught a flight to my destination. 

A nice stay if I do say so myself. 4 stars for service and amenities."
4,"Food 5 star...service 3...
Too bad we didn't  know that locals get 25% off.
Wonderful decor but table lighting is too bright.  We unscrewed a couple light bulbs at out table. Food was excellent but pricey. Limited options for those who don't eat meat.
Service is slow. Waited too long after being seated for a waiter to come by and acknowledge we were there. Once given the menu it was another long wait to order. We had the Edge salad....very good, too much dressing though so the waiters assistant graciously got me another  with dressing on the side. Waiter did not offer pepper for salad but his assistant did when he brought my second salad. We had the salmon...so good.  We ordered the fries and as always I asked that they be very hot. Well, they weren't  so the manager brought me new ones and waited to watch me try one...he wanted to see my face...they were indeed hot...perfect. We asked that the wine come at the same time as dinner, well, it came a bit after we started eating. We were told fresh bread was baking...it never came. 
When we made the reservation we were asked if we were celebrating anything tonight , we said our anniversary. At seating we were asked again...why?  Not sure. We thought maybe a little dessert. Nothing...so why ask! 
Excellent food, service not so good. Watched other tables and  the waiters were not very attentive. Need to check on tables more often.
Nice romantic place."
4,"I actually like this carwash, I would use them more, but the location is out of the way.  They have great detailers so I use this one for cars that need a good interior shampooing or wax.  I do not use them for regular washes, but I have had great service on detailing.
I usually ask for  Steve to help decide what detailing package would be the best  for the car I have that day.  If you stop here ask for Steve, he has experience and has made one of my red cars shinny again when no other detailer could.  
I also like this location more that the one in Surprise since it is surrounded by shops and resturants.  That is a plus if you plan on getting your car detailed and you have  no one to pick you up. Could be a few hours on a  detail  service.  
I also like the fact that they do offer Mobil  1 full synthetic oil changes here.  Less than my local dealership to do it and you can watch from the waiting room as they work on your car.  Waiting room is stocked with candy, soda, etc. but as mentioned before plenty of other eateries and shops within walking distance."
4,"Yum.
You should try this.
I split the steak Jamburitto with my husband ( and still had leftovers for lunch)  and the very friendly man taking our order urged us to get the hush puppies.  Glad we listened 'cause Yum.  Really liked the hush puppies."
4,"Been here before wasn't impressed but this time they had a great selection. Their crab legs were dry. But their Mongolian grill was great. The sushi looked great, but it was a no carb day. I don't know if this is the norm or holiday weekend made it better."
4,"Recently a friend at the gallery was very excited because it was Dollar taco night a Chicos.  That is fine if you have any idea of where it is.  Turns out I had been by there more then a few times when I went to the Safeway and Subway at 7th st and McDowell.  It's a little place in a very small strip center.  It's very much a neighborhood
place,  clean with an upbeat atmosphere and a few tables outside.  That's about all I can say about the setting.

I was surprised by the variety of meats that one can get on the tacos.  The tacos aren't  to exciting but on the whole are fresh and have a good flavor better than I would have expected.  That is all I had but from what I saw of the meals around me, hey looked pretty good as a whole.

I will go back to Chico's.  It definitely has fare that is better than the local fast food in the same price range.  Not an exciting place but pleasant to think of returning to.  I went there after a very long day so that is saying something.  Just the enjoyment of quite of the few people just sitting down and having a good time rubbed of on me.  I needed it!"
4,"Lots of good things at this hotel. My wife and I enjoyed our king bed, and the way the room was segmented like a mini apartment.

Breakfast was awesome, they have a station that allows you to get cooked to order food. Managers reception was a nice addition, get a few drinks while snacking on some chips and enjoying the amazing atrium.

My one complaint is how wifi was advertised as free on our booking website, however its a 24 hour charge. Luckily the service was excellent and I got a coupon for the night."
4,"Fun place to go to get your drink or grub on...  We went on a Sunday afternoon and had lunch.  I ordered the Colossal Fish w onion rings, my son ordered the Chicken Flatbread, other son ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and my wive ordered the Cuban.  The fish could feed 2 people, the flatbread was delicious and the quesadilla was gone before I had a chance for a bite.  The Cuban was the only problem.  It came out w a full plate of fries but the sandwich was very 'wet'. Not sure if it was butter or what from putting it on the griddle but even after sipping it up w a napkin- it wasn't very appealing.  The inside filling looked great but the wet bread kinda ruined it.  Watching all the other delicious foods coming out of the Kitchen ensured we'll be back and I'll be the one to select my wife's meal."
4,"The NPL is a ""Cheers""  type of bar/restaurant. A lot of the patrons appear to be regulars, judging by how often I hear a waitress greet a party with a Pittsburghese ""How ya doin', hon?"" They have an extensive menu with many of the expected items such as a giant fish sandwich (and I mean GIANT), hoagies and burgers, as well as a good number of full entrees featuring chicken, steak and pasta. 

The walls are decorated with large pictures of golden age movie stars and Pittsburgh sports themed items.

They also serve some things you don't see everywhere else, like a sandwich with ham, fried egg, tomato and french fries. Decent beer selection. Daily dinner specials. 

I'm a fan of the giant fish sandwich, the cajun pasta and the italian hoagie.

They have added an outdoor dining area to their already large seating area. Don't be apprehensive when you see a crowded parking lot - they can accommodate a lot of diners. But Friday and Saturday nights will probably mean a wait at peak dinner hours. 

The service is always friendly and prompt. Prices are on the low side of the moderate range for meals.

Review based on about a dozen visits."
4,"Though NPL boasts an extensive menu with lots of good choices, I'm awarding a fourth star for one appetizer (which might as well be an entree): the delicious, creative, and well-executed BBQ Chicken Ranch Dip.  A multi-cheese blend is swirled with barbecue sauce and a hint of ranch dressing, topped with a generous helping of chicken chunks, and served next to a basket of tortilla chips with which to scoop the gooey and hearty symphony of salt, meat and cheese.

I haven't had the chance to explore a significant number of the offerings, but I suspect there are a few other gems scattered throughout the less impressive options--which are still not bad."
4,"I really liked this hotel and would stay here again. We stayed in room 434 which was on the corner and set back a little from the main hallway, so we don't have any noise complaints like I've read here. 

The room/suite itself is great for a family or for someone travelling on business. There is a microwave/fridge, an office area (with a TV and couch), the bedroom, and the bathroom. If someone in your party wants to sleep and someone else wants to play on the laptop or watch TV, it's perfect for that. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had Crabtree and Evelyn brand shampoo and conditioner. 

The hotel is decorated quite nicely. The garden in the lobby is pretty amazing, it makes you feel like you're somewhere other than near the Charlotte airport! There are fountains, statues, and lots of places to sit and chill. In the evenings between 5:30-7:30 there is a manager's reception with free drinks and a few snacks like pimento cheese, pub mix, etc. 

If you really like breakfast, this hotel is your place. The eggs and omelets are cooked to order on the buffet each morning. On weekends, breakfast is 7-10, weekdays it starts at 6. Along with eggs and omelets, there's grits, pancakes, French Toast, oatmeal, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and your traditional cereal and pastries. You can go through the line to get the made-to-order or just eat at the little buffet they put out. The made to order line was long but moved quickly. Our omelets were great. 

The hotel is convenient to the interstates and airport, however, you will need a car to drive to get something to eat. There's an Omaha steakhouse on site and a few places deliver, but no restaurants within walking distance except a seedy little sports bar. We had a car with us so we drove to places to eat downtown and at South Park (the hotel is convenient to both). 

Also, the wi-fi is not free so be prepared to pay around $10 per day. That was the only negative part about this hotel."
4,"Nice place.  You need to call from the airport for the shuttle and it might take a bit.  However, I arrived early and was able to check in.  Good rooms to get work done-lots of plugs and a nice desk.  I'll admit that I'm used to staying at higher priced hotels and have been spoiled.  That said, the managers happy hour was almost ""OK"".  Nothing within walking distance like restaurants.  I ate at what seemed to be the makeshift restaurant and it was OK.

OK seems to be the best to describe this.  However, if I need to stay near the airport again, I'll be back."
4,"North Park Lounge is a place I go to regularly because it's just so darn good and consistent.  Get the Lounge Fries (maybe with a side of Lipitor??) because they're fried, cheesy glorious-ness.  They are a must have at NPL.  As far as entrees go, I have many favorites.  The Black and Blue cheeseburger is delicious with caramelized onions and bleu cheese on a 1/2 lb quality patty of beef.  The Italian hoagie has the perfect ratio of toasted crustiness to softness of the bread.  The meat isn't that mystery meat you get at other places but lean, flavorful Italian meats.  The French Onion soup is served in a generous crock with an even more generous portion of cheese melted and gooey on top. So good on a fall or winter day.  The salads are huge.  The steak salad is one of my favorites in the area and is served ""Pittsburgh-style"" with French fries on it (of course!).

The servers are friendly and many of them have been there for years.  Always quick to refill your drink or give you a recommendation if you can't decide what to order.  There are a TON of TVs, so definitely a great place to catch a game.  They have lots of events and contests that go on (Karaoke, Trivia night, etc.) so something to check out when you're there."
4,"Not bad at all... 

An oil change and  full service car wash for under $40 is good in my book. Quick too..."
4,"Very nice hotel with super spacious, clean and nicely decorated rooms.  Very pretty atrium. Complimentary breakfast was good.. Coffee only ok.  Staff was pleasant and professional.  
What was very unsatisfactory was the shuttle from airport to hotel. I waited over 30 minutes and when driver finally came, she whined about working for Embassy and said she'd be calling in sick tomorrow because there was going to be snow.  No apology for the long wait in 25 degree weather at 10p"
4,"This is my 1st visit here. I paid $35 for a gel manicure and received $20 off of a $25 pedicure, which made my total (not including a tip) $40. I'm pleased with my services and most everything else. The salon is tastefully decorated and extremely clean.  

The only issue I have is their stamp card policy. On the back of their business cards they have their stamp cards. After 9 services totaling $25 or more you get a free service. I tried to start a stamp card after I paid for my services but I was told that since I utilized the discount of $20 off of a pedicure that I couldn't get a stamp. The card says that you can have a stamp as long as you pay $25 or more for your service. So if I'm not gonna get a stamp after paying $40 then they should either change their wording or change the policy. 

Something else that's small but pretty awesome: when the receptionist retrieved my chosen gel nail color, she automatically brought a matching nail color for my toes. Amazing! I didn't have to ask and I didn't have to search on my own.

Other than the ridiculousness with the stamp card, MD Nail Spa will probably get another visit from me."
4,"Just visiting area staying in a nearby motel. Drove by and saw a parking lot full of cars so decided to give it a try for a casual dinner. Both wife and I picked the ""small"" fried cod fish sandwich. It was great. A thick piece of flakey cod fried to perfection. So big it stuck outside the big bun about 1inch on both sides. I can't imagine the size of the large sandwich. Actually, my wife and I could have split one sandwich and been satisfied. 

Sandwich came with an over abundance of French fries and a tasty dish of Cole slaw. Service was most friendly and meal was served most promptly. We would both order the fish sandwich again at the NPL. There were many other interesting options. Place was very busy and TV's filled the walls. Will return when in town."
4,I went past a couple times before I stopped in I'm from out of town and the neighborhood looked a little sketchy with not a lot of parking. But once inside it was small but nice with a few people in line to get subs. I ordered a corn beef/pastrami sub and it was really good. Customers I talked to said all the subs are delicious. It's a must stop if your in the area. The menu is posted in the pics they have different sizes I got the medium.
4,"This place is so bomb!!!! But surprisingly there is never any people inside eating? Maybe I'm not coming during the rush but I'm not complaining at all. 

There baja fish tacos are like crack to me. SO GOOD!! There chips are addicting. Just the right amount of salt to go with there even better tasting salsa bar"
4,Great selection of beer and wine.  Staff is extremely welcoming.  The grilled cheese sandwiches are terrific but they need more food variety.  The brownies are the best!
4,"Had the traditional poutine, fries were well cooked, very crispy, first time I have it, I loved the gravy and cheese... not sure what to compare it to, but I would go back there again."
4,"The food needs to be rotated out more often so it stays hot n fresh, but it is really good otherwise.  They do not use MSG and have more than enough choices that should please anyone. The take out is by the box, not weight, so that is a plus, cram that thing full...  Anyhow, the hot tea is not complimentary, which is odd, but the drink prices are low and refills are free for soda.  The music is WAY too loud most of the time and the waitress once they bring the check expect you to pay or sign your slip right away and can be a bit annoying by saying; you need to sign, you need to sign now and keep walking by, very rude!  Anyhow, if the place could get a couple of those things under control, it would be just about perfect.  The bathrooms are clean and they keep the food area clean. We will come to eat here again, but if the music is loud again, they will either need to turn it down or we will leave..."
4,"I have been riding by this place when visiting Safeway and finally decided to try it for breakfast after boycotting America's.  I was not disappointed.  The ham breakfast burrito I had was very filling.  My wife had the Chorizo breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint.  Most importantly we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome.

My second time here was the same.  I decided to try the Wednesday special, Arroz con Pollo and my wife had the chicken chimi.  We again were satisfied.  I hate to compare Chico's to a Filiberto's but it is similar in style but provides a better product and friendlier staff.

I am looking forward to spending happy hour here one day as it runs from 3 - 7pm and offers $2 imports and margarita specials.  If you have not checked Chico's out, just do it!  When there don't forget the salsa bar.

Thank you Chico's we will be back."
4,"A decent local place to get some food. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of beers they had, both on tap and draft. There was a pretty good crowd for a Saturday night too. The outdoor porch was covered and heated, which was actually very nice to sit in despite how cold it was outside. The food was very good! A giant pretzel for an appetizer was delicious, and my salmon was perfectly cooked. Good atmosphere, I would definitely come back."
4,"The taste of Louisiana literally on the go!  Being only a little more than a year removed from a Mardi Gras trip to New Orleans, this truck brought back some fun memories I thought I had drunk away.  Jamburrito's is a regular staple at Food Truck Fridays at the Phoenix Public Market, and on my latest visit to the weekly roach coach festival (I say that lovingly) I decided it was finally time I give it a try.

I had to go with a catfish jamburrito.  In addition to the menu saying it was famous, the uniqueness warranted a try.  Catfish jambalaya wrapped up in a burrito, how do you go wrong with some cajun-mexican fusion?  The catfish is cooked well and the spices are hot!  The hot sauce served on the side only makes the dish better!  The lone issue I had with the catfish jamburrito was the cheese.  Every time I got a bite of cheese and fish together, it just didn't taste right.  Despite the culinary faux pas; For just $8, it comes in a very generous portion which will fill you up for the rest of the day.  I probably should have stopped after eating half, but I wanted to get my money's worth!

Another cool thing about Jamburrito's.  It's not a cash only truck.  They take credit card, and will text you a receipt if you desire."
4,"Came here just to relax and watch some football after hitting the batting cages at playdium. 

We got two wing samplers so we could try 8 flavours. See pics for flavours. The wings were delicious. Megan fox hot has some heat but won't kill you.

There's lots of TVs and a huge projector screen which was pretty clear.

Service was great and helpful. 

Also they have over a dozen pool tables in the back. Two are coin op for $2 which is really good imo.

Overall my experience here was a 5/5. I would def go back."
4,"Mmmmmmmmm Chico's.  I consider Chico's to be on the high end of the Filiberto's/Eriberto's/Algoberto's type places.  It's good, fast, cheap Mexican food that is heavy and greasy and you want to be sure to have no plans after eating, so that you may lounge around feeling large.   They have a pretty good sized menu, with a few vegetarian options as well.

The chips are good, which is a huge deal to me, as many of the fast food Mexican places have terrible chips.  Salsa is even better, and they have several kinds that you can help yourself to.  Add in a cooler full of beer and some Flan, and I'm una huera muy contenta."
4,"I would of gave it 5 stars, I absolutely love the food and drinks! The service.. if I could give it Lower the  Zero, I would! Now everywhere I go, I tip.. even if it is okay service, I tip. I tip no matter what, what can I say, my heart is pure. I came here with my uncle and his lady friend and we were in a extremely great mood, and our waitress had to literally ruin our thing we had going on. First off, personally think she was just jealous and having a bad day, because we were being so nice to her, we were nearly KISSING her ass, despite her negativity  (I don't believe in steeping low, to others level) not my cup of tea. It was like the nicer we got the mooore rude she became.  I had to ask.. I said ""did you make any tips today, or did you have a bad day? Your giving us Awful Service and I'm just curious""? She looked at me and rolled her eyes and replied ""I'm not doing this"". And walked away. Anyway, I gave her a 15 dollar tip. Payed my bill and left uncomfortably. All because of Her, I will Never come back to this restaurant again and it's sad because I adore the food and drinks. Know who you are hiring before making any body make your restaurant name look bad. You never know who your serving. Respect comes before ego or pride.  I feel sorry for that restaurant if they do not let that girl go, they already lost somebody who would of constantly been a regular there (me). And that's not a good look. I'm known to buy the Whole menu in a restaurant if I genuinely like it, and I tip well. Hopefully she got something nice with that 15 dollars. Damn she pissed me off, why did I even tip her? Anyway guys.. great restaurant, HORRIBLE Catty Service. Never going back. The end :)"
4,Breakfast is yummy! I really enjoyed the biscuit sandwich over the other options. The coffee was ok nothing special. I think our favorite thing is they support local farmers and growers!
4,"Good Chinese. I ordered delivery here. It was very fast and easy. Plus they understood me on the phone which was a relief. I had general tsos and it was very tasty. Not gonna say much since it was delivery but for sure fast, easy and yummy! :)"
4,"It's pretty far from where i live but if im ever in the area on a Wednesday I will come again!

On wednesdays they have all you can eat wings, starting with 15 wings ($17 after you buy a drink- which isn't refillable.. :S)

then after your first 15 wings they give you in intervals of 5 wings.

The service was alright, not the best. The wings were huge and saucy! What sucks is that you can only get one flavour for the night, but that's ok

Overall it's great on wednesday when im having huge wings craving

p.s this place is jammed pack with highschool kids 

3.5/5"
4,"Finally got around to visiting this place after being a transplant to Pittsburgh from Philadelphia-South Jersey. Starting off I decided to give the battleship cheesesteak a shot to see if I could sink it! First off Triangle uses a pretty much identical sub roll from Philadelphia-South Jersey it's cut down the center then split open, stuffed with the goodies and not baked. The sub roll it self has a bit of chewy-toughness to it this is how it should be hence the Philadelphia-South Jersey in me. The meat was good a bit on the drier side just not greasy but don't get me wrong it tasted great. Regular american cheese it is no Philly wiz here stick with your tried and true keep the american on it a winner every time! Keeping it still simple let's just do lettuce. So next time around I'm going with the extra cheese to add some extra bite into the taste buds and then top it off with some other goodies which should make it even harder to sink the ship lol. All around it's a solid place to grab a sub it's been around for years and there is a good reason. $20 cash gets you a 2 foot long sub and great customer service to boot. 4 out of 5 all day long on the cheesesteak review next time an Italian sub is on the agenda I got a feeling were going 5 stars!"
4,"Today, my son and I had the 5 taco deal for $7 and their chorizo and egg breakfast burrito for dinner. The food and service was very good. I used my $10 for $7 coupon from Yelp and when I asked for extra chips, they were nice to give us more. I am liking Chico's Tacos more every time we visit."
4,"Ahhh, Roach Coach - how far we've come!
These days, Phoenix is finally starting to get the hint that GOOD food on mobile trucks can work - and work well!

My first introduction to Jamburritos was at the Great Cajun Cookoff and Food Fest.  I would have written about the gumbo - but as I was on the planning committee for the event, thought it would be a conflict of interest.  And, by the time things slowed down enough for me to actually eat that day, only a handful of the restaurants still had food.  I didn't want to skip kudos to a great place just becuase I was too slow in getting there.  That said...the experience I had that day was certainly good enough to get my attention.  I ""liked"" them on Facebook and have had a great lunch with them that past 2 days.

I saw the Facebook update that the truck would be at the Ford dealership on Camelback  yesterday and today.  I made plans with Kim T to meet for lunch today...but I couldn't wait!

Yesterday I tried the special - 2 catfish po boy sliders.  Nice fresh rolls, perfect remoulade, shredded lettuce, 2 good sized cornmeal breaded catfish filets fried to perfection and a dollop of black bean salsa.  YUM!  Adding hot sauce made it perfect.  The only problem (which I was sure to share with them today), I took the platter home, left it on the table for just a minute to get a drink...and my dog Layla stole one of the catfish filets!  So - not Jamburritos fault at all, but I was left a bit hungry.

Today I met Kim T.  She had the K-sadilla with fried eggplant, I had the steak jamburrito.  We were both happy campers!  Her K-sadilla was enormous, and had to be eaten with a fork.  There was just so much good stuff in there, the tortilla never could have held up!  The steak jamburrito was HUGE, and filled with chopped steak, slices of andouille sausage, rice, beans, cabbage and cheese.  Every bite was amazing...but did I mention it was HUGE?  It's seven hours later, and I am not even interested in dinner.

Prices are VERY low for the quality and quantity of food received.  Yesterday's special was $3.99, the highest on the menu, I believe, is $6.99.  I could be wrong about that...it may be the $5.99, which was the price of my burrito.  

Fresh, hot, delicious food and WONDERFUL people in the truck!
Mark Brown, the owner, came out to chat with us - before we even got our food, we were made to feel like family.  (Meant in the good way!)

Definitely worth finding on Facebook or following on Twitter to see where they'll be serving up next!"
4,"Staff, facility, digs and such all good... TGIF... 

HAD a blast over all of the 22 hrs. On property... 

Here is to short nights and long lives...   RAH!!!"
4,Missed this place for about seven years while I worked elsewhere. It is every bit as awesome as it was when I worked downtown many years ago. Superb variety of menu items. i go for the diet-friendly chicken tacos and the amazing salsa bar. The staff recognizes regulars like me and they're super friendly.
4,"Recommend prefixed menu that includes dessert, 10oz filet and more.  Don't be in a hurry as courses are methodically slow to come out but all is tasty."
4,"I've always loved Barro's pizza but I hardly ever order it because I know if I did I would eat all of it in one sitting (one of the downsides/perks to living alone).  Then one day one of my coworkers brought in a little box and said they have lunch specials where you can get just a slice!  I decided to check it out on my lunch a few days later.  Unfortunately they stop serving the pizza by the slice at 3:00 and I got there around 4 so I decided since I was there I might as well just get a small pizza and then share with my coworkers.  The wait for it wasn't too long, about 10-15 minutes and I think it was only around $7 or so.  About the same as you'd pay for a lunch anywhere else.  It was hot, cheesy, melty, gooey, and delicious.  I still want to try to get there for a slice one of these days but I mean really any form Barro's pizza comes in you know it's going to be delicious."
4,"Caramel is a little room that is in between check in and O at the bellagio. Its right in the middle of the action. I think this is a super cool lounge area of the hotel that you could slip into if you were staying at the hotel. Its really pretty inside with dark wood and nicely lit. I would really give this place like 3.75 stars if I could, but oh well.  There is a middle table if you want to socialize or tables to the side that you can slink into and have a romantic cocktail with your sweetie."
4,"Friendly and professional service. Love the manager happy hour which me and my hubby enjoyed before we headed out to the hornets game. The breakfast was by far the best continental breakfast I've ever been to. They go all out , the staff are friendly from the front desk to the bar and just anyone you see that works at the hotel they were never rude always polite. 
Just one incident our room door was unlocked on the last day don't know what happened but nothing was out of place or taken but we didn't have to use are keys to get it. We report it right away but it was strange but we were checking out that morning so be sure if you leave your room double check if the door is throughly locked. 
Aside from that I'll stay here again when I come back down to Charlotte."
4,"GREAT CHANCE FOR A DELICIOUS MEAL, AND A CHANCE TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO INVENTED WHAT YOU'RE ENJOYING
We came here because they're one of three Italian restaurants in Toronto doing something to help the people of Amatrice, who are still getting over an earthquake.  They donate the proceeds from a dish founded in Amatrice, and named after it: called ""alla matriciana.""

Because the earthquake made it impossible for the people in Amatrice to produce and export their prized dish, the restaurant didn't have the pig cheeks needed to make the dish the way it was invented. So they made do with prosciutto, cut by the restaurant staff to imitate the real thing. 
They did a fantastic job. 
Now I'm really looking forward to the real thing.

One reason why Italian has spread around the world so easily is that the ingredients are relatively affordable, thanks to the fact that Italians learned to cook for kings on a pauper's budget. Like pork cheeks and pasta -- what could be cheaper, or more delicious?

From Rome south to Sicily and north to Turin and Milan, they all have a city specialty. What a country!!"
4,"My friend and I went to the restaurant for the first time this evening.  The staff was most welcoming and helpful.  She ordered the eggplant parm and I had the veal lasagne.  Both came hot and were delicious.  As we had theatre tickets we could not linger.  The only down side was the noise, as there was a large party and with the low tin ceilings, it was a stretch to hear.  Will go back again as the food was excellent."
4,Adorable little cafe for a light lunch or snack.  The teas are delicious.  I came here with a friend to catch up and we quite enjoyed ourselves.  Homemade treats and friendly service.  The only real complaint was the group of screaming children hanging out for the first half of our lunch.  Not really the cafe's fault though!
4,"Super tasty fun!
The place is massive, and delightfully tacky.
Sports sensory overload with all of the TV's...whenever the NHL gets their act back together, i'll be watching some games from here!

The AYCE night is a great option when you have 5-6 people. You can only order 1 flavour, but are allowed to share.

When I am there on my own, or with one other person, i usually get their sample platter, which gets 4 flavours, 20 wings for $20someodd

But I am in LOVE with teh Dr Pepper flavour! I thought it would be weird, but its actually really good!

For you Yelpers, there will be more UYE events here in 2013! Woooooo!"
4,"North Park Lounge is a great place to meet friends for Happy Hour drafts and fish sandwiches on Friday after work. The best bar food around the North Hills and a friendly atmosphere make North Park Lounge a place you want to hang out with your friends and relax. 

In addition to the fish sandwiches, the barbeque chicken dip is always a crowd pleaser!"
4,Great sandwich! As big as a canoe! Really enjoyed it. I will be back. I must lay down now. The meat sweats have arrived.
4,"I like this place. They accept Paypal and deliver through eat24.com which is a hug plus for me. Food is always hot. Love the curries, crab ragon and sesame chicken. I order alot and the food is always correct."
4,This place always has great meals!! Appetizers to lunch or dinner!! You can watch a sports game and hang out with good people.. when I lived by here in the late 90s I  used to go more than 2-3 times a week. Whenever I'm in the North hills it's a must visit. The staff is AWESOME! Enjoy
4,"Great! Banh mi was really good value in terms of quality (fresh bread, decent meat) & portion size (large)."
4,"If you have kids and want to enjoy a casual lunch or brunch out of the house, go here. There is a great train set that my toddler loves to play with and it's close enough to the tables that I can sit and eat and still keep an eye on him. The food is great - not the cheapest - but that's typical when you get fresh local food. Its a weekend staple for us now."
4,"Very nice place to drink craft beer and/or wine. Very good beer tenders, very enjoyable experience"
4,"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end expensive restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

I have been looking for a local Chinese food restaurant that didn't serve ""glop"" with sodium (Panda Express-ish).  We've found it in this little, tucked away restaurant. This is exactly what it looks like - a no frills, good service, freshly prepared delicious food restaurant.   No hot dishes of food sitting over sterno or on a steam table drying out and loaded with salt.

The food is fresh, made to order (so there is a little wait if you dine in), and delicious. Service inside is excellent.   The portions are HUGE (we ordered Lo mein, Vegetable Fried Rice and Salt and Pepper Shrimp) and very reasonably priced.  We are big eaters and we made almost two full meals for two out of this order.

The Shrimp Lo-Mein had plenty of shrimp in it, wasn't greasy and was very flavorful. The Salt and Pepper Shrimp was excellent - both Salty and spicy from the Pepper. Really a good choice.

They have an extensive menu.  They do an extensive Take-Out business and we are personally so happy to have found a terrific Chinese Food restaurant!  Give it a try."
4,"You know, this may be a huge chain, but this one works like a well oiled machine on crack.  I kid you not, the husband and I were in and out of here with full bellies in a matter of 23 minutes.  This location is certainly one of the nicer looking ones and it offers some of the best people watching ever.  Almost as good as the airport!  Service here is great; fast, efficient, and no-nonsense.  The food here is good, exactly as good as you expect from the Waffle House.  Don't come here expecting anything more refined than Denny's and you will be a happy camper like me."
4,"Positive:

 This place has GOOD tasty food. You can smell the steaks grilling as soon as you open your car door. But that door to your car better be a sleek Benz or Lexus if you're a regular. The prices ain't cheap. The area is more upscale and prim, with tree-lined streets and quaint shops and the nose-in-the-air crowds, so you can expect them inside this trendy uptown spot.

It says ""casual"" but casual means your Siwy jeans (ladies) and your good shoes (men). You'll have a fun time, the service is timely and the waitresses are very friendly! I expected the aura to be more standoff-ish but the waitresses didn't mind that we took our time to order. 

We came on a Friday night and it was honestly PACKED and it was just great--a lot of the 20s and 30s crowd and drinks going around. I'd definitely come back here for tasty Italian."
4,"Well we have another good Chinese super buffet in the valley and it is pretty good. They offer a few taste treats you do not see at the other Chinese buffets like bacon wrapped shrimp,stuffed chicken,steak kabobs,Polish sausage grilled and bok choy all of which were real good.The service is quick and friendly and the place is clean. So Yay I am a fan. With all these new super buffets opening up they just keep getting better and better, one year ago I would have given them 5 stars but now there is to many good Chinese super buffets to give them all 5 stars,but this place is close the food is good and you will leave HAPPY."
4,"I like this hotel.  I've been here a lot in the past few months and they have never left me disappointed.  Every single time the van has either been waiting or is pulling up as we are walking out of the airport.  Maybe that's just lucky timing but in my line of work, it's one of the tiniest things that I actually appreciate the most.

The staff here is pretty nice overall.  I've gotten attitude from the front desk in the morning while trying to sort out a last minute schedule change but oh well, maybe she was having a bad day.  The rooms are cozy and the beds are one of my favorites, I never fail to sleep well here.  I love that they are suite-type rooms so I can close a door if the atrium area is being noisy (which it generally never is).  

The wifi is fast, the breakfast is fresh and delicious.  This is a big business traveler spot so beware, the gym is packed first thing in the morning.   Overall, not a bad place to stay for the night!"
4,"Wacky Wings is hugeeee!! I was amazed when I walked in.  The atmosphere is amazing for any sporting event as they have tons of TV and a huge one in the bar area.  They have pool area and games from Playdium as well.  They were always having a mini hockey tournament and giving away free prizes, mostly from the beer companies.

The food itself - the wings were okay. Smaller in size to most wings places and the flavors doesn't stand out too much to me as most were bland and uninteresting.  The spice level is low unless you order the super hot ones.  I can't eat food that spicy but even I was ashamed that they called some of them spicy as I didn't even get a kick from it.  Like there was no spice at all.  

Service is pretty bad. Took us a while to get out order taken and took us another 30 mins to get all out bills and for her to process the credit cards as she keep leaving so we had to wait 2-3 mins each time for her to come back to process the next payment."
4,"Wacky Wings why do you look oh so familiar? Oh yes it's because you look like the hybrid love child of WEGZ, Wild Wing and Dooleys all in one! 

You've got a cornucopia of television screens in ever possible corner, compete with a set of mega awesome screens surrounding the main dining area. Speaking of the dining area it too is massive offering a horn-o-plenty of seating options done in beach wood style tables and chairs and fencing. Surrounded by pool tables and arcade stlye games this place is a man bday party waiting to happen!

Service was on point this evening despite it being all you can eat wing night - we never were left to wait long for a drink, attention of food. That's right for $15 you could have all-you-can-eat wings of one flavour all night. Protip - go with a group like we did and each order a different flavour and then share. This way you can have as many flavours as your group can handle while still obiding by the one flavour per person rule.

Flavours I partook in tonight were: buttermilk dill, habenero thai, spicy thai, honey garlic and spicy garlic Parmesan! Unlike the standard wing joints each of their 150+ cornucopia of flavours was delicious! None were overly vinegar-y and the spices and flavours used were excellent!! Really enjoyed the wings here - more so I have in other places for a while.''

Last cool point was my $15 purchase of of a Stine of Steam Whistle Pilsner - AND THEN I GOT TO KEEP THE STINE!!

SOLD! I'll be back - it's super convenient and located a short on the TO/MISSISSAUGA border!"
4,"you walk in and are no longer surrounded by flashy lights and slot dings. it is nice and dim so that all the ashlee simpson look alikes are hot.
4 stars for the hipster watching. its like im in SF! 
5 stars for the drunken bachelor party in the corner. there were some hot girlies dancin up on each other. whoowhee
expensive drinks, but at this point im expecting it and dont bat an eye."
4,"This place is awesome, I wish I found it earlier. We got the Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was AMAZING. The only complaint was that they were 15 minutes later than they said they would be, but seriously it was a Friday night and the place was packed. Which, now I see why. They included free egg rolls and crispy things in the to go order. Very generous with the rice that they gave us. I seriously plan on making this place a regular. Way worth the price. Its tucked behind starbucks."
4,"The lunch time deal is amazing. Good pizza, wings. It's nice if you wanna get out of the house but still have pizza. Def will keep coming back."
4,"Pretty low key downtown hangout. My friends and i came here after starting out at the Vig. It wasn't too crowded and we got a seat at the high top with a set of cards against humanity on the table. I got the free on chocolate brownie for checking in. Pretty decent size and I paired it with the PBJ mead. I like the vibe here, you can hear everyone talking and the availability of table games is a plus."
4,"I actually really enjoyed the meal and atmosphere here. It's relaxed, the poutine was hot and melty with plenty of flavor. The staff was friendly and courteous. For those that are trying to compare this place to others like it that they know of, let the place stand on its own. I for one am glad I didn't listen to the reviews comparing it to places hundreds of kilometers away. I will be returning, no question."
4,"Came here on a Sunday or Monday night after hitting a few places prior. On the surface it looks like a subdued, upmarket lounge, but if you look closer...It is a bit of a surreal scene.  First off everyone is extremely inebriated, in a almost coma like state- in fact some patrons were so pissed they were sleeping in fetal-like positions. People dancing with themselves- it seemed like something out of a David Lynch movie. Management didn't seem to mind either- encouraging some of the most shit faced clientele to have more wine, etc. Sat next to a guy that looked exactly like Eric Stoltz and asked about the happenings in the city. He  couldn't give me a clear answer and was a bit of an asshole. Definitely one of the better bar nights I have had, just an interesting scene."
4,"My chicken quesadilla was REALLY good. Chicken, pepperjack, cabbage in a perfectly grilled tortilla. Nice and spicy. Hope I see them around again!"
4,"Never ate here before and I'm always up for trying new places 

We were greeted immediately and promptly seated. 

I went with with a group of 3 adults, 2 teenagers and a child

Our drink order was also quickly taken. 

We started off with lounge fries and fried cheese
The lounge fries were a meal in themselves and super delicious. The fries cheese was also very good.

Between us we ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, 2 taco salads, child's pizza, pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese and an order of chicken tenders. 

Everything was delicious. They accidentally made my chicken wrap plain grilled without buffalo sauce...but I'm not one to fuss even though the waitress offered to fix it for me. I just had her bring me a side of buffalo sauce and all was well.

The taco salads are huge and come in a tortilla she'll as the bowl.

After we ate the youngins took off to the arcade where they played games and won tickets to exchange for prizes.

We were there for about 2 hours and most of that time was hanging out and waiting on the kids as it was not a busy time. 

Our waitress was fantastic and on top of keeping our drinks filled and checking in on us. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and will go back to try other things on the menu."
4,Taco Tuesday is ok. they raised the prices but the 2$ beers are still a great price. sometimes the tacos are better then other days. hit and miss. the salsa bar is Aplus..pico is good. Try the Chicken salad its like a meal!!!! real good chicken..charbroiled..yummy. the ladies working here make it worth coming back.
4,"Friendly staff, clean environment and reasonably priced beverages (ex. $1.25 for water & canned soda, $1.75 for San Pellegrino) Food is as good as other locations, I just wish it was open a bit later (to 10pm during the week.) Well executed panko tofu bao: not greasy, toppings and condiments did not overpower and bao was soft and fresh."
4,"Friendly vibe from the server when I picked up a hawaiian pizza with bacon and pineapple. It was pretty tasty, although probably a little greasy. Looked like a nice place to dine-in sometime."
4,"After looking at reviews, my wife and I decided to try NPL on a Friday night.  Like most restaurants on Friday, either show up early or be prepared to wait.  Even though it was a cold night, we were sat on the patio.  It was nice because they had a fire place and heaters and the patio is less crowded and cramped than the seats inside.  

The wait staff was ok, but i was not overly impressed.  It is tough to judge on only one visit, but I don't like to have an empty drink cup for as long as we had.

The food was above average bar food.  We ended up ordering the Lounge fries and the giant fish sandwich with a side of onion rings.  The cheese sauce on the fries was delicious and much better than the neon orange cheese sauce you get at a lot of other places.  The fish was cod and was pretty good but a little greasy.  Overall, we did not leave hungry and I would order everything we did again."
4,"First time in Calgary and the fiancé and I had to stop here. Contrary to other reviews, we received exemplary service from the guy at the register. Wish we could remember his name, but strawberry blonde with a pony tail :) We had the Notorious P-I-G, which if you're a pork lover, it's for you. I'd rather try the corned beef with mustard and pickle or the hamburger one next time. They also have a macaroni cheese brat I could see myself enjoying. Don't miss out!"
4,"The pizza & wings are the best in Ahwatukee! Love the hot wings, the service is also great."
4,The fried catfish is to DIE FOR!  Simple but delicious...i go back specifically for that and the hush puppies.  It's a good portion for the right price.
4,"I just bought my first destroyer Italian hoagie.   It looks delicious can't wait to try it 
Triangle Bar And Grill is mostly a take out order place for sandwiches and hoagies"
4,"The truck came to our office today and everyone was raving about the food.  I went down to get the catfish, which a coworker had and it looked amazing, but they had just run out.  To prevent a total loss, I just go an order of hushpuppies and there were great!  My only complaint is that the sign said they were $2, but I was charged $4, and when I said something to the employee, she said nothing and just ignored my question and continued my paying process.  As good as the hushpuppies were, $4 for 9 of them is pretty steep.  Hope to catch up with this truck again and try the catfish."
4,"When we tried this place out it was on a saturday afternoon when I was really hoping to stroll in here in late hours in a more belligerent state (wait are they open late?).

I decided to try out their traditional poutine: yukon potatoes, quebec cheese curds, and gravy. It tasted ok and plunked down on my gut like a heavy brick of carbs.  I regretted not being adventurous enough to try their more adventurous creations like Mucho Italiano or the NOTORIOUS P.I.G. (R.I.P. Piggie Smalls)

The scenery of the joint was slightly overwhelming, for a small space there certainly was a lot of swag on the walls. I hereby decree this place as the ""Jack Astor's"" of 17th Avenue. In truth I'm actually rating this place as three and a half stars, but something tells me I'll be asked to come back to this place again, and something tells me I wouldn't put up a fight either."
4,"I've eaten here so many times now. The value is incredible, hard to beat. I've tried the entire menu and my favourites are the fried chicken on any carb and the pulled pork. Every time I go I also order either the kimchi fries or the jicama salad, depending on my need for fresh vegetables. Both of those sides are equally delicious. One of my favourite things about this place is the music they're always playing 90's music and it feels so good. I also love that they serve Tahiti treat, such a good drink. A little too sweet to drink the full can at times but it's such a good treat."
4,"The family deal is a great choice!!!!  It can easily serve a family of four!  I like my kung pao chicken spicy, and the first time i had it here, it was lacking that kick.  The next time i asked if they could make it a little spicer, and boy did they!!!! It was WAY better, and i appreciated the fact that they did what i asked, and i will totally be back!"
4,"So happy to discover that Banh Mi Boys is veg-friendly! There is a tofu option for banh mi, Korean taco and bao. Being a fan of the fluffy white buns, the bao is my go-to. The combination of panko crusted tofu and sliced veggies in a fluffy bun makes for a satisfying snack. Their sweet potato fries are thin, crispy, well-portioned and basically a steal at $3.25. This is fusion fast food I can get behind!"
4,This place is very convenient if you park in the Collier Center garage.  It's a great stop if you're going to a game or concert.  They have a ton of canned and bottled beers and a pretty good tap list.  I had a BFF IPA from Stone/Pizza Port and it was outstanding.
4,"Caramel is a great lounge inside the Bellagio. It is gorgeous inside, and I have to admit, the waitresses and bartenders are SO HOT! My guy friends are always ogling over them and waiting for a chance to talk to them. It' s a pretty upscale place that doesn't get too crowded. Usually the booths are empty, so you can feel free to sit at them until someone comes and gets bottle service.

My favorite part of this lounge is the music. I can always hear it from the casino, and they play the best music. It makes me want to dance right then and there! They play some great old school hip hop too that is perfect for those in their 20s and 30s. 

Watch out for guys handing out buy one get one free drink passes outside the lounge. That is usually extra incentive to get me to go and save $11-$14!"
4,"Just had take-out from here. We ordered online and the order took about 25 min to be ready. We ordered LG mongolian beef, veg. lo mein, crab rangoon total of $23.35 - sounded like a lot to me at first but when the order came SO MUCH FOOD! OMG we had left over for everything (for 2 of us) they also give you those lil crispies you dip in the red sauce, gave us 2 eggrolls. We could have been more than full even w/out the crab rangoons but all was delicious! I'd definitley come back. 

What I enjoyed most was this place had the beef that was great tasting.. not touch and chewy like other chinese places. I loved it. Went on a saturday night and there was several others in the place all waiting for their take out food. 

If ur wondering where thsi place is: I wouldnt have seen it unless I was looking for it: Stephanie/W. Horizon Ridge :across the street from Metro Pizza/Timbers and caddy corner to Albertson's and Bella Terra.  Its on the west side of the 215 & Stephanie."
4,Very cute and charming restaurant tucked in the Eglinton area. Food was very good - I really enjoyed the duck leg and the beef carpaccio! I like the use of the iPads for menu as well - very convenient and unexpected twist for such a rustic place.
4,"Nothing to write home about, but when the girls were tired of watching the boys gamble...we had a good time in here!!  It was nice in there, there were chairs to sit on, it was not over crowded or too loud.  Good time!!"
4,Good place to eat...nice waitresses and clean
4,It was our pit stop while we waited to get into The Bank for dancing.  We were given 2 for 1 drink tickets while we waited which was nice.  Good atmosphere.  Served it's purpose :)
4,"Went on Friday, March 24th at 6:30pm as a work dinner. We reserved a table and were able to be seated on time. Our waitress was phenomenal.  She had 2 large parties and was still fast and attentive. Our food was great and arrived quickly. Portions are huge! Our waitress checked on us and kept our drinks updated. The only downfall is that parking is HORRENDOUS and the place is extremely loud. We were in the patio section, but the windows were closed. We could barely hear each other."
4,"I just went here for the first time and got 1 order of chicken and broccoli for $6 incl tax to go, it was ready in less than 5 min and was totally fine, so I hope that they get more good reviews because there are barely ANY restaurants in Henderson that are worth going to~  I was in and out in ~5 minutes. Maybe if you had a bad experience here it was just an off night!"
4,"The staff is nice & friendly. The salon is clean & cozy. The pedicure room has soft lighting & good music. Trish gives a good leg massage, she cut my big toe nail on an angle & it looks odd, I don't think that was intentional. There were 3 customers talking loudly on their cell phones during most of my pedicure, not very relaxing. There should be a no phone zone when other customers are trying to relax. Also, I put my purse in the chair with me, Trish took it & put it in the chair next to me, which made me a bit uncomfortable. Then, another tech took it & he put it on the shelf behind me, when he wanted the chair for his customer. That really made me uncomfortable, no one should touch anyone's purse."
4,"An excellent place to stay if you're in the Charlotte area. I spent a couple of nights there and the room was always perfectly cleaned. The suite arrangement is very nice. You have space to work / relax in one room and sleep in another.

The layout is impressive with an open atrium that runs all the way up and looks down into a central area that they use for the morning buffet, fountain, etc. And the morning buffet (included with your room) is tasty with lots to choose from. Even a chef to make custom orders.

I was also at an event held on the patio and exterior rear of the hotel that was catered by the hotel's restaurant. Everything was fabulous, even for a crowd of several hundred people. I'd definitely return and highly recommend staying here."
4,"Delicious! Love their tofu tacos - lots of bright, colorful veggies. They tend to put an excessive amount of mayo, though."
4,"Oh wacky wings the pinnacle of sports bars in Mississauga. It has more tv's that you can look at, it has clean and well maintained pool tables and even different arcade games. All together this is the place to be to watch any sporting event or for a night out. I went here with some friend to play some pool and watch the UFC, I was surprised by how well the tables and cue were taken care of. We didn't go for food this time, but from the times I have been here before I recommend going with any of their wing sauce.  I haven't found a bad one yet."
4,"As I have come to expect from the Hilton family of hotels, this Embassy Suites was no exception. I was staying with my husband and a friend of ours after a wedding and we were all very happy with the hotel. Despite one rude encounter with one singular night staff front desk employee, everyone we talked to at the hotel was very friendly, helpful and generally awesome. Even the cook-to-order chef at the included breakfast area was very friendly and super nice, at 6am! The lobby area was very nice and welcoming, well kept and clean. The rooms were the standard suite style rooms, plenty of space, which nice accommodations, decor and very clean. The pool area was slightly awkward, as the pool was indoors but there is an outdoor area to lay out on lawn chairs and sunbathe. The bartender at the manager's reception was super nice, and made some great suggestions for local dinner places to try. They also have a shuttle that will take you within 5 miles of the airport, and dropped us off at the lightrail station to get into downtown Charlotte. I was pleased with our stay and would recommend the location to anyone visiting the area (if you don't mind a lightrail or car ride into the city as it's a ways out from downtown)."
4,"After we had dinner at Fix, our hostess brought us over to Caramel to have a round of drinks.  Lucky us, we had a bottle comp'd to our table and also got a free round of shots from one of the guy's in the table next to us.  Caramel is a really nice place to grab a drink before heading out to really party.  They played a good mix of music - 80's, 90's and Top 40.  The ambiance was pretty dark and chill - we only stayed there long enough to finish our bottle of vodka and leave to The Bank so we could get the party started!!"
4,"Great menu!  I'm going to talk about the mains, the Jamburrito and the Jambalaya.  You have your choice of meat: chicken, beef(carne asada), pork, catfish and a vegetarian option.  Each of the matching meat (or non-meat) options has their own set of ingredients to match.

I chose the Chicken Jamburrito mainly because of it's chicken etoufee with creole sauce.  I also got hush puppies.  It was shared between two people and I have to say the portion is perfect and reasonably priced for two.  We are full!

The hush puppies sauce is very good (I think it's their Cajun Tartar Sauce), so here's a tip.  I recommend asking if a spread can be added to your Jamburrito or on the side.  I found this by accident and it made a great burrito even greater.  It's the same sauce on the catfish Jamburrito I think.

The hot sauce isn't hot so I'm guessing mild is really mild. 

I'd give it a 5 if the truck made its rounds regularly once a week at the stop here today.  There's a great deal of quality and its portion for the price you pay."
4,"Layers of cheap cold cuts, lettuce, onions and tomato on fresh Italian bread doused with the perfect amount of oil, vinegar and oregano.  Enough to feed four, but if you're saving it for yourself it only gets better the next day."
4,"So this place was featured on a past food network show called Cheap Eats and naturally when we watched a re-run of it on Sunday morning before the Steeler game, we knew where we were headed for dinner at halftime later that day.

Around 630 that evening we headed over to Swissvale.  Without knowing about the place or checking the hours they are open, you may not even realize its there.  We went in and it was exactly what we expected - a sub shop. No frills, no fancy décor.  It's a neighborhood bar that whips up huge, delicious sandwiches.  There were 2 or 3 televisions with the game blaring through, some bottles of liquor on the back bar and coolers full of 40s, pounders and 12 ounce bottles.

This place does not have anything except sandwiches and a few sides - no wings, no chicken tenders, no fries, no salads, and no appetizers.  That was perfectly fine with us.  I was fully prepared for a Sunday cheat meal (as I don't often eat sandwiches anyway).

We ordered the 26 inch (destroyer? .. $20) steak & cheese sandwich to split.  It came with shaved steak, provolone, lettuce, tomato, vinegar, mayonnaise and fried onions & mushrooms.  We also got a side of potato salad that was in a medium sized Styrofoam container and was more than enough to share ($3). It all was EXCELLENT. It reminded me of my absolute favorite sandwich place at IUP when I went there except Triangle's bread was MUCH better and extremelyyyy fresh.  Bobby went to order a captain and coke and we were told ""we are more of a shot and beer bar..we don't have any ice right now"" LOL which was funny and perfectly fine - we both settled for beers.

Please note that they are cash only. There is an ATM, but it wasn't working while we were there so Bobby had to run down the street and withdraw money while I waited for the food. Once we were finished, the guy behind the bar came over to check on us.  He was shocked that we had both finished our 13"" halves (please......we didn't come here to mess around).  It was honestly more than enough to take home for another meal, but I couldn't stop!!!!!!! It was so good!

Triangle is a great local little spot to stop and get a really delicious, filling meal at a cheap price.  It seems they do a good takeout business.  We'll be back! Huge fans."
4,"What can one say about Waffle House????

Texas bacon cheesesteak (somehow trademarked) melt with hash browns smothered, covered and topped (with Bert's chili, again trademarked). 

Tastes great, but I'm sure it shortened my life!"
4,"Tasty pizza for a reasonable price. Definitely a step up from the other chains nearby! 
Delivery guy was friendly and courteous. Pizza delivered within 45 min of ordering on a weeknig"
4,"the perfect dark ambiance for a group of friends to relax, have some upscale cocktails with plenty of seating, and listen to DJ'd music in an overall relaxed atmosphere."
4,"Great food, but I think the service is what really makes this place a gem! Our server was awesome. I wish I remembered his name, lol but I had a few drinks.. and you know how that goes. 

Great place for that splurge that you need once in a while."
4,"I stopped here one evening with a few friends and was glad to be greeted with amicable and friendly service.  The restaurant itself is tiny, so don't bring a huge group.

As a herbivore, my choices were not entirely limited and the staff was willing to make accomodations.  The boccaccini was delicious and the fried artichokes were good enough for seconds (which were promptly devoured).  The only problem I had was that not all of the dishes came out piping hot. 

Hopefully, once I have a job I can afford to taste the rest of the menu."
4,"Stopped in for a drink; service was excellent! They have over 125 craft beers, can't go wrong there! They also have a great wine selection. They have great happy hour specials and board games around the place. Fun place for happy hour of a stop on a pub crawl."
4,"New owners and management.   Worth giving another try if you live in the neighborhood.  Recommend you ask the manager, Rambo, to put his best guy on your car if you have a beauty you care about.  Manager is ferociously customer service oriented and gets it.  He is all about service and happy car owners.  Although a bit over-priced, with a request for extra attention to detail - the money is well spent at TnT.  A guy named Mario hand waxed and cleaned my car.   Excellent job.  This guy took pride in his work.   In sum, Rambo and Co.  earned my business and I will now recommend TnT to friends, family and colleagues."
4,"OK, The last time I went in there were a couple of big differences:
- The store hours have shifted much earlier than before, some nights closing as early as 5 PM (although this is to accommodate opening early for breakfast now)
- All the regular staff behind the counter are gone...the replacements are friendly and efficient enough, but so far it's just not the same.
- Taco Tuesday is still a deal, but the prices of each taco if you buy 3 or more have spiked from $.99 to $1.29.

Having said all this, the tacos were fantastic, as were the chips/salsa. I coincidentally happened to run into one of the old staff at another business a few days ago, and she advised me that this McDowell location is under new ownership and that the owners are changing things to make it more like another location that they own in Ahwatukee. As long as the food stays tasty I will continue to come back, but I just hope that they don't move the closing time any earlier during the week!"
4,"i picked up a baja fish burrito from here the other day during the lunch rush and the line moved quickly as did my order through the line. while i was waiting i managed to snatch up a dq free blizzard coupon from their coupon wall which i have added to my jewish food stamp book.

i took my burrito to go as well as a couple of salsas and a to-go bag of chips (complimentary). got home and wolfed that bad boy down. short and fat little thing, but totally filling. the fish was good and they use cabage in their burritos which i love. 

fresh, tasty, and filling. i'll be back. especially cuz they dropped a couple of coupons in my bag. incentives like that to come back are always good. and they have 1.99 margaritas. yum."
4,"First time trying poutine, got the traditional. It was good! Service was fast but not that friendly."
4,"This place offers decent food at a great price. Every Tuesday is ""Taco Tuesday"" - $2.00 tacos. The portions are good and the staff is friendly. I usually order their tacos with corn tortillas. Their salsa bar is fresh and clean. The atmosphere is funky and the restaurant was clean. The manager told me they do offer catering and they have a separate menu for that."
4,"I absolutely love this place. Sandwiches are fresh and delicious! Would give 5-Stars, but the parking blows, it's CASH ONLY (there's an ATM on location) and it can be pretty busy at times, so there's often some wait time.

Will continue to visit and would highly recommend."
4,"Who loves some Wacky Wings? I do over here!! 

This isn't my first time here as I have been here multiple times with family and friends.  Since today, I came here just to celebrate one of my cousin's birthday, I believe it's time to drop a review! 

Starting with the service, I got to agree with previous reviews about the horrible service they provide to the guests.  Most of the waiters are pretty much never present when needed and when they appear, they are pretty hesitant.    I haven't actually had a 'great' service from the 5-6 times which I have came before.  

However, although the service lacks, the food is amazing with bold and tasty flavours!  The long line ups each night shows how busy this place is. Every time I come here, I will always order the Honey Garlic Chicken Wings and will never get bored of it, even if I got another order!  The size of the wings are not small wings, so for what you're paying is pretty worth it in my opinion!"
4,"I think triangle hoagies are great for parties and tailgates.  I normally order one or two battleships and all the fixings.  They are huge, they are reasonably prices, they are prepared quickly, and they are delicious!  I definitely will be back for more soon!"
4,This new whining pig is great! The parking is the only complaint. It's defiantly in a location where parking can be a pain. But this place is bigger then the other Phoenix location but still offers all the things we love about the pig wig a great selection of craft beers on tap!
4,"Upon entering Lazy Daisy's Cafe, I was glad how extremely spacious it was and how it had plenty of seating available. Since this was one of the further cafes I had to trek to, I was glad my efforts were not wasted when I planned to study there. Their windows were big, allowing abundance of sunshine to come pouring through.

After ordering, I immediately realized how children-friendly the cafe was. At the very back of the cafe, they had baby stools available and a range of children books and toys. They even offered products geared towards children for their parents to buy! They successively tapped into a niche market when I noticed the frequency of customers that had brought their young children with them, something I rarely saw in past cafes I'd been to.

Originally, I was planning on trying their Pear Creme Tea because it was something I have never heard of before. But I realized I needed something strong so I could stay awake for my evening class. The dirty chai latte I ordered with a double shot espresso wasn't as sweet as other chai lattes I was used to but, it wasn't bitter where I had to get out of my way to add any sugar. I think it did an effective job on keeping me awake (adding on top of the regular coffee I had the morning of).

Deciding on the spot in which I was planning to create this blog, Tissa the barista, was very nice and helpful in replying to all off the questions I had regarding their menu. Her knowledge went far and beyond as I received way more information than I expected. Before she left her shift, she thanked for my visit and looked forward to my review of this cafe. It was very thoughtful of her and definitely added to my sweet experience at Lazy Daisy's Cafe."
4,"Hmm, this is weird. I've steered clear from this place on account of it's relatively poor reviews, but I finally tried it with a friend and I think that this is actually pretty good, especially given it's lower price point. As a former montrealer who has had good and bad poutine, I was pleasantly surprised with the Big Cheese. 

They have a ton of poutine options, with generic ones to adventurous ones. This is the kind of place I would love to have gone after a night of debauchery, but unfortunately I don't think this place is open late. I opted for the curry, with green peas and chicken, and it was phenomenal for $7. The peas were not over cooked and mushy, and the chicken was real - and the cheese curds were appropriately melty. Loved it! It wasn't gourmet, but there is a special spot in my heart for a cheap pile of poutine. I would definitely hit up the BIG CHEESE!"
4,"One of my oldest and dearest friends is in town visiting his family and called me at 2:30am asking if I wanted to meet up for a cup of coffee & conversation. I suggested this Waffle House. As always, the coffee was hot, delicious & fresh. We shared a breakfast wrap, eggs and waffles. Server was awesome and the food arrived quickly -- food was yuumilious. I can always count on Waffle House to be there for me when I'm in need of comfort foods and sharing times with good friends. Thanks, Waffle House!"
4,"I went to the Banh Mi Boys restaurant on Yonge St north of Eglinton. The restaurant is nicely decorated and there are plenty of seating. The staff was friendly, but it took a while to get my food.

I ordered the pork belly banh mi sandwich. It was very good and tasty. 

Would I go back? Yes, the pork belly banh mi sandwich was very good. I would like to tried the rest of the menu."
4,"I came here during my lunch break to check out the lunch buffet.  For $7.99 this place is a great deal.  It's very typical for what you expect from a chinese buffet, most everything I had was decent with nothing being particularly memorable.  A couple things I didn't like, but it's a buffet...you just leave it on the plate.  The food quality gets 3 stars.  The cheap price gives it another star.  If you're in the mood for a chinese buffet, you can't go wrong at this place."
4,"Bah mi boys offers incredibly flavorful tacos, poutine, bao, and bah mi sandwiches. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu except for the bah mi sandwiches. 



Must try #1: five spice pork belly bao! It's a flavor bomb. The bao is soft and warm, and the five spice pork belly is tender & juicy. 

Must try #2: kimchi fries. Their Kimchi fries are so flavorful and crispy ! 

I did find the tacos to be on the drier side compare to the baos. But their price points are reasonable. Most people are satisfy with two tacos / bao + a kimchi poutine to share"
4,"This place has the feel of a coffeehouse, but it's more of a restaurant than that. It's a great weekend brunch spot if you're looking for a place you can drop into quickly and easily without having to wait around for half the day. Delicious but no frills.

The breakfast sandwiches here are delicious, as mentioned by another reviewer. The biscuits are so tasty! Everything here is made with simple but organic and locally sourced ingredients. For instance, they have fresh Mennonite bacon. It makes for simple but delicious food. 

They also have delicious fresh-squeezed orange juice. Definitely a nice go-to."
4,"This place is as cute as a button - and the food is pretty good too! I had a couple of cookies and fresh-squeezed juice and it all tasted pretty good.

I'd highly recommend this place to families - there are toys for younger kids to play with and wi-fi for kids working on their homework (saw examples of both categories). The only iffy thing I noticed was that it got really, really hot in here, so I started to feel a bit faint. Maybe it's just the fluctuating temps outside though; it's hard to adjust to the perfect point in spring.

Bathrooms are very clean and roomy too - again, great for families."
4,"A great place to grab a drink and do some dancing after dinner.  I've been here a couple of times and always have a great time.  The hostesses and waitresses are really nice.  

It's not very spacious, but it's a great place to go with your friends...especially if you want to have some fun, but not go to a club."
4,"Great food, fast and fri service. I just wish the restaurant was bigger. It's always packed since it is so small. Food is made when ordered and they use real eggs not the powder stuff. Waitresses are very efficient and friendly"
4,"This is the first restaurant I have tried 100% based on a Yelp Elite's review and boy am I glad I did!  If you like chicken wings you have got to try this place out.  Super large and meaty wings with great drumstick ratio!

I have been to a number of these types of places both in Canada and the USA so knew to expect at least 30 flavour options... they have a ton more than that!  Flavours range from ""no heat"" to ""Inferno"" so there is something for everyone. And you can choose breaded or natural.

I briefly scanned the rest of the menu noting they have an amazing ""build your own salad"" section, burgers and tons of apps but we lucked out and arrived on an ""all you can eat"" (AYCE) night so it was all about the wings.

Some things to note about AYCE night - there are rules:

You get all you can eat of ONE flavour so best to go in a large group so everyone chooses something different.

You also get AYCE fries with your wings - most places dont refill the fries so that's a plus. However if you just want chicken you can opt-out of fries (i did to have more room for wings!).

You DO NOT get AYCE beverages. Normally there are free refills on fountain bevvies but not with the AYCE special - a bit counter-intuitive - bit a rules a rule. 

If its your first time, AYCE might not be the best choice given the single flavour option.  If you order off the regular menu they have tasting platters (multiple flavors allowed) and we will be going back to do this.

So thoughts on the food:

We had Ranch flavour and Honey-Garlic/Garlic Parm.  They were both in the mild category but I would have moved them to the ""no heat"" category. Im not a wimp when it comes to wings but find no two restaurants rate their sauce the same so we played it safe (this time).  Regardless of the heat factor they were tasty - full of flavour - well sauced and served piping hot!.  The first round were breaded, the second round wasn't. I personally prefer no breading but the sauce doesn't cling to the meat as well without it. Its really a personal choice in the end...

The french fries also have some form of coating on them because they are super crispy without being over cooked.  A bit of an onion tang to them - could be the coating or could be made in the same oil as their onion rings. Not sure but I enjoyed them all the same.

Decor is fun and festive - like a big tiki festival. Great for a crowd or football Sunday (lots of TV screens) but also works for couples with their small (for 2) booths.  We will be making this a regular haunt and suggest giving them a try!"
4,"3.5 stars would be my actual rating. I don't think I need to reiterate what others have said about the amazing food, organic ingredients, and many many children. We've been coming here a lot for the last month and I have a few very specific issues/complaints. 1: I don't understand why they continue to take a name for the order but then never call the name. I'll order a sandwich and a latte, they call out ""Latte"" from the end of the bar; then someone comes wandering around wondering who the sandwich is for. It's more bizarre than anything else. 2: This issue is a first for me: cleanliness. I wouldn't mention it if it wasn't consistent. Maybe every time I've been here, something has seemed less than clean. It's like their dishwasher doesn't do a good job. My cutlery on one occasion definitely had food residue on it. I've noticed that the jars for water at the front warrant close inspection before pouring your drink. And on one occasion, the staff member that brought our food out actually gave us two dirty napkins (you know, like you wiped your fingers on them but never unfolded or crumpled them up?) I'm not a crazy germophobe, it's not something I would normally notice, but it's happened enough times that I thought it was worth mentioning. I still really like the food here though."
4,Ambiance is pleasant. Been here twice and there has never been too many people. If your looking for a nice pre-game spot then this will definitely do.
4,"When I used to work in Phoenix this was my favorite mexican food place to eat.  They have delicious food for good prices.  I always got the grilled chicken platter.  Soooo delicious!
Their salsa is addicting as well.  I want the recipe!  If you are in downtown Phoenix I would definitely recommend you trying it out.  
Makes me wanna work closer so I can go there every day."
4,"I know it's the wrong part of Canada, but we wanted to get some poutine on our ski trip to Alberta and BC.  The Big Cheese certainly fit the bill, offering more varieties of poutine than one person could ever try.  We had the Notorious PIG, which was rich enough I think I could only justify eating it at the end of a big athletic trip."
4,Place was so clean and FANCY!!!  The staff was great and breakfast was way more then other embassy suites. There was no fan in the bathroom and the room was laid out kinda odd with multiple entrances. It was very nice though and like the bar in the beautiful lobby. Parking sucked bc of 3 other hotels in the area but great stay!!!
4,This was my first visit to this restaurant. I enjoy chinese buffet places. There was plenty of sushi for those who enjoy it. I enjoyed the Orange chicken and the Bacon wrapped Shrimp  was excellent. I t was cooked fresh and fantastic.
4,"Went to Caramel on Sunday night, which is Industry night there. The club is tiny, and is in the middle of the Bellagio casino. There was a DJ playing dance/top 40 music, and was very good. The place got packed. Around 11:30 some people left to go to The Bank, which is the mega club in Bellagio, but people kept rolling in, and it stayed crowed till 3:30 when we left.  The service was excellent, with very friendly, and I must say beautiful drink girls. Would definatly recommend."
4,"Specialty: Southern Italian
Location:  516 Eglinton Avenue West, Toronto, Ontario
Menu items: Caprese salad, Pepper with Arugula and Goat Cheese, Grilled Calamari, Shrimp Linguini, Fish of the Day and Sexy Duck Leg

What do all restaurants have in common on a Monday night? They are all closed! Except for 7 Numbers Restaurant, where Mama Rosa (aka Rosa Marinuzzi) uses the quiet, low-traffic day of the week (once a month) to teach foodies, cooks and food aficionados the Italian way of cooking. For $85 per person, Chef Rosa teaches you the way to Italian cooking with a hands-on lesson, a 3 course meal, all the wine you want and even a few lessons in Italian. Each class is unique and intimate with a limit of about twenty people per class thus giving everyone an opportunity to get their hands dirty.

With Rosa's effervescent personality and way of cooking, one is bound to have a great time while tasting, cooking and chopping alongside her. She is a force to be reckon with and her passion for cooking simple, yet delicious dishes shines through with her food. The ambiance is lively and the flowing glasses of wine definitely liven up any Monday night!

Starting with the salads, Chef Rosa is of the mind that simple and minimalistic is always better, and that generosity in the use of salt and olive oil is a must. From the Caprese salad, to the Grilled Calamari with fricassee, and the Pepper and Arugula Coat Cheese salad, Rosa teaches us how much fun one can have with a salad, and how much flavour one can get out of those leafy greens.

Rosa's pastas are four-dimensional in taste. They are addictive, comforting and extremely tasty. While making the Shrimp Linguini pasta I noticed that the chef uses her secret home-made sauce - Giardiniera - also called ""sotto aceti"", which means ""under vinegar"", a common term for pickled foods. The Italian version includes onions, celery, zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, olive oil, pimentos and hot peppers. The pickled vegetables are in white wine vinegar. Bringing all the flavours together in the pasta dish, from the meat, to the tomato and even the garlic. A must have when you visit the Mama.

In tune with the pasta, 7 Numbers also applies the traditional tomato sauce, with the Giardiniera of course, to the fish of the day. The night's dish consisted of arctic char that was tossed in a fine layer of seasoned flour and then cooked in less than 4 minutes in the infamous tomato sauce. The end result? A buttery fish that absorbed all the flavours, exploding with a punch in one's mouth. Who would've thought fish could even do that? Simply brilliant.

As the night went on and we got to spend more time with Rosa, we discovered that she has a sultry side. She believes that food should be sexy, and well, fun. So she created the Sexy Duck Leg, a tasty piece of leg (duck) cooked in white wine and baked golden with rosemary branches. A juicy fall-of-the-bone decadence.

A big thanks for the Mama herself and her staff for making Mondays the new Fridays with their smile, love for cooking and great food.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."
4,"This small lounge is a great place to chill and grab drinks if you aren't in the mood for a club.  It's definitely got a sexy vibe with the warm lighting and soft colors.  There are comfy seats and the cocktails are really yummy.  I would recommend it for a girls night out or couples.  And once when I was there, they played Ditty by Paperboy.  Loved it!"
4,"100+ flavours. That's enough for review.

I chose the hottest one and had to sign a waiver form.

Waiters are very friendly and the atmosphere is great"
4,"@WACKYWINGS #YELPGTA #CHICKENWINGS #AYCEWINGS

Surprised that I haven't reviewed this place. I've been here a few times already. The interiors, although a tad tacky with the lit up palm tree and pseudo ""hunter"" furnishing, is actually quite nice. I took the Dad and he was pretty impressed. It may have been the 10+ tv screens at the bar. I was always pretty impressed with the personal TV in the dining booths. Whether I watch sports or not, it's a nice/fun to have thing. That said, this place is perfect for the big game. And always packed during one! 

I've always liked the wings here - even though Wild Wing is my current favourite. Wacky Wings has a great Honey Garlic and Buttermilk (possibly my favourite flavour). Dad tried the Spicy Garlic and his review was ""very good."" The price is reasonable too, comparable to the other Wings places. 

Now, Wacky Wings is the only place that does AYCE Wings. Other than Hooters. But this girl ain't that trashy. The catch with AYCE here? You only get to order one flavour. How many of the same saucy wings can a girl eat? About 10. 

So, that brings me to my famous Ankie Tip: Take friends. Go in groups of 6-10 people. That way you get to share.

Sadly, for me, I only do mild. And everyone I know like medium or spicy. So that sharing thing isn't happening. 

Lastly, Margarita (Wackyrita, as they call it) rating: 6/5.
SO GOOD. 

I want to go back soon!"
4,"So many people have told me how amazing the hoagies are here and I can't believe it took me this long to finally give it a try! 

Triangle is not a fancy establishment but I totally appreciate that. Their specialty is hoagies and they have a number of sizes and meats. They're famous for the battleship but since we were only feeding two people, I got the torpedo and the hubby got the destroyer size of the cheese steak. The sandwiches were loaded with meat and the oil and vinegar dressing added such a nice flavor. I can definitely see why the hoagies here are famous and literally everyone I know knows about this diamond in the rough. 

Next time you're looking to feed a crowd, skip the sandwich ring and get a battleship or even super battleship."
4,Great pizza for a reasonable price. The staff was very nice as well. You can't beat 4.75 for pizza and unlimited drinks.
4,Great place. lots of room - lots of seating - daily specials. They have fantastic shredded beef tacos. Good stop for a good lunch. Close to downtown Phoenix. Staff are friendly but only staff is behind the counter and in the kitchen. This is a pick it up at the window kind of place.
4,"If it wasn't for the UYE last night I probably would have never stepped foot into Wacky Wings.

Wacky Wings is a huge wings place! Majority of the joint is dedicated to the dining area but they also have an area with many pool tables and even an area with games where you can win tickets. It's kind of like a Dave and Buster's but it's more of a sausage fest lol. There are tons of huge TV's displayed throughout the joint and there were plenty of wing eaters on a Wednesday night.

Wednesday's is their AYCE wings night where you can fill up on as many wings as you like for only $15.99. However, you can only choose one flavour out of their other 100 flavours. It's best to go in a group so that you can try different flavours and share with each other. I had the chance to try the following flavours: honey garlic, spicy garlic parmesan, habanero thai, spicy thai, and buttermilk dill. I enjoyed all of the flavours except the buttermilk dill...not a fan of dairy flavours on chicken.

I gotta say that from all the wing places I've been to this is the best place for wings. The wings weren't small in size and the flavouring were great!"
4,Can't come here without having the lounge fries. Great for watching games because they have tvs everywhere and now they even have them in booths. Great happy hour specials if you sit at the bar. Overall a great place to go to if you like beer and sports.
4,"Chico's is within easy biking distance from my house, so we end up going here when we're starving and not wanting to drive any place. 

I always load up on the california veggie burrito and my roommate loves the taco salad. We usually end up sharing as there is always way too much food! 

One complaint - can't we get some ACTUALLY spicy salsa?"
4,I went here on Saturday's night so it was pretty pack with group of family and friends. However you only have to wait for 15-20 mins. The food is excellent comparing to its price which is very reasonable. I love the atmosphere the most! Warm and family little cozy place :-) I will definitely going back for sure!!
4,"I loved the Vibe of this restaurant. The Chalk Board Menu and service - amazing. The Wine, not great. The food was delicious - it really was - I'm not the biggest fan of Italian restaurants only because meat and cheese and pasta together, tend to work :) I did get fish at this visit. Like I said, VIBE - excellent. I would recommend."
4,"Yummy! So I love a good Italian hoagie and this place delivers. I arrived around 11:45 and had to wait about 20 minutes before I got to the front of the line to order. Totally worth it though. All of the fixings available and the women who work there are very friendly and efficient.

They also have a small bar, which could either be cool for a chill night or really creepy depending on who is there with you. But whatever! Hoagies!"
4,"Love their Breakfast Bacon egg cheese Burritos, they are thicker then a snicker.
The ladies up front are always cheery and ask how you are doing. 

Fresh salsa bar with all the fixings.  I've not had lunch or dinner there. I suspect it's about the same quality, GOOD!

BAD:  
While their breakfast burrito is off the chain. DO NOT get their Carne Asada Burrito from the lunch / dinner menu.  Only thing edible in it is the Pico!  I've lived in Korea and have ate dog meat. The meat in their burrito reminded me of dog meat. First the meat cut was crap, hard over cooked garbage. Most of the meat was grissel and fat, huge hunks of fat.  I was so disgusted I didnt even let the hobo that went from table to table begging for money. He hit up every table in the restaurant. ""Got two dollars?"" Not only did he ask every table, he systematically asked every person personally at each table. Management didn't even blink an eye, they allowed this smelly hobo to harrass everyone in the place. But I digress, when he asked me for money, I told him to fuck off and I felt like his punishment should be to eat this shit stuffed burrito. But he knew I meant business and quickly hobbled off.

I would rather go back to Korea and eat dog meat again, then to go back to this place. 

This review doesn't mean a thing because this place is in the heart of business district, and working people will grab a bite to eat without checking reviews.
But I feel better knowing I will never go back there again, and hopefully will prevent people from being disappointed and harrassed by smelly bums during their lunch break. Fuck this place, they cater to hobos and serve over cooked rat meat."
4,"I have been a customer of the Triangle for decades. If you're a Yelper who craves trendy chic establishments, you need to look in Shadyside for places that just opened 6 months ago (and will be closed in 6 more) and skip the Triangle. It's practically frozen in time from 1970 other than the flat screen TVs. Oh, and they don't let hardcore drinkers lay their head down on the bar for a quick nap any more either.

Having grown up in the same area, as a kid I just assumed every neighborhood had a place like this where you could get a massive hoagie freshly made and done right every time on fresh bread at a great price. Alas, it is not so. It turns out the Triangle is a one-of-a-kind with respect to the wonderful, awe-inspiring Battleship.

I don't know why anyone buys a sandwich ring from a supermarket when for half the cost you can have a better quality sandwich that's even bigger.

Even my wife, who is such a non-foodie she never cares where we go to eat or what we eat, is jazzed if I offer to grab a Battleship before I head home from work. And that trip adds 15 miles to my commute home so it's not a visit of convenience. 

If you love a great hoagie, you have to try these. I hope they never change. I'm not eating there for atmosphere."
4,"Came get after a futsal tournament at nearby laroche college , Saturday night prime time and they handled a party of 22 with a minimal wait. The staff was spectacular , and the food was fantastic . Huge party with burgers , salads pasta and kids meals everybody raved about the taste and the portions were spot on for this hungry crew .  Kudos to NPL.  A true  gem  on the north hills ."
4,"Small place good for groups 1-3 people. Friendly staff, great beer selection and atmosphere."
4,"Very tasty breakfast sandwich and cappuccino, but at $12 for the small portion with only two bits of melon as a side, I won't be coming here often, which is unfortunate because the vibe and ingredients are great. Will give **** anyway only because it's such an improvement to the area when compared to the Coffee Time and other dingy breakfast joint across the street... but wish they had some affordable options on the menu. Over $3 is just too much to pay for an Americano!"
4,"Huge, huge ""battleship"" sandwich w Italian meats + bologna, exotic malt liquors, craftsmanship, and a barred window entrance hiding it's charm. Great experience."
4,"Everytime i have gone here it has been perfect.  Drinks are strong, people were cordial and the atmosphere is vegas like.  

In a night that consisted of two bars, Jet nightclub, a Hilton spotting (Paris and Nicky), a Jesus Ferguson spotting and late night fatburger on the strip...Caramel is my fondest memory of the night.  Albeit my only memory of the night.  (everything else was captured in pictures or told to me later)"
4,"Really cool atmosphere with a lot of energy. The menu is written on the walls with chalkboard paint it looks like. They have ENDLESS amounts of beer on tap and bottles and wine. This is a beer and wine bar only so Keep that in mind-- no cocktailS. We shared a panini-- goat cheese, fig and prociutto. It was small but came with chips and a pickle for $6. Fair enough. They have a few small plates like this but no real food menu. Wouldn't come back again, but would recommend it to someone looking for just drinks, not food. They also had Trivia games and simple board games at the bar which was fun! Walking distance to talking Stick so great location downtown!"
4,"Lazy Daisy offers big fluffy biscuit breakfast sandwiches, locally raised meats and cheeses, and solid cup of coffee. They do have a cozy atmosphere and a small play area with a train table in the back. They have gluten free options for both mains and dessert that are not a compromise. Even non gluten free diners live their gf brownies!   Their salads are kind of limited, which seems odd given the range of ingredients on their menu choices. 

Where they fall a bit short is on cleanliness. The floors, tables, walls, and entire inside has a film of accumulated dirt and grease on it. 

We love it but we don't take fancy people there."
4,"I'm a big fan of the Whining Pig in Gilbert and I like having this option downtown.  The all day happy hour (until 8p) is great and, as you'd expect, the selection is top notch.  Parking here can be a bit of fiasco if there's a Dback's game so you're probably better off Ubering.  You can have more beer that way anyway.  

My issues are the layout is a bit odd and you can't see the draft list completely from anywhere at the bar.  Also, the music is far too loud.  We had 4 people at the bar and you had to get up and walk over to anyone who wasn't right next to you to be heard."
4,"This hotel was great with some minor flaws. The free drinks are great!! What?! Yes two free drinks, manager's special everyday from 5:30 to 7:30pm. 

The room is amazing, we stayed on the second floor so our view wasn't all that amazing but the room was so win/win. 

There's a restaurant/bar across the street called the locker room and it's worth the walk over especially if you just touched down and don't want to go anywhere right away. Get the garlic parm wings! I promise you won't regret it!! 

The flaws: so apparently every weekend families bring their kids up here and nothing is wrong with that however, these kids we're everywhere unattended and in everything. They were playing ding dong ditch at the doors (ding dong ditch is where you knock or ring the doorbell and run). Yes, they are kids doing what kids do best but this is a hotel not their home. 

Trying to workout in the gym and they kids were in there on the treadmill barefoot at that. Then mimicking the person trying to lift weights. 

The kids where every where and you would've thought it was some event that came into town for that many kids running through the hotel. I personally thought it was unsafe cause eventually they wasn't in their parents eyesight, I think most of the parents were in the room whole the kids roam the hotel. Today, we have crazy people so letting them run around the hotel and having other people pretty much watch them isn't a good idea cause for one they didn't come to babysit. 

Room service doesn't really replenish towels like that. We were missing wash clothes every time they came to clean the room. 
 
Other than that I still had a pleasant stay and still recommend!!"
4,"4 plus rating!
I have been twice so far this week. Some folks may want a few more choices on entries, but I found it nicely balanced. You may not find your favorite cut of meet, but you will  find quality.
Food and service were excellent on both my visits. I enjoyed each of my selections.
I have always thought Mac & Cheese should be better until now, the truffle macaroni and cheese really impressed me. A simple side that was way beyond any I have experienced."
4,"Great place!  We visited it during Summerlicious and there were a couple of vegetarian items on the menu which was great.  My pasta was delicious and my boyfriend's panfried eggplant was amazing as well.  We were quite full and took our desserts home for later but they were amazing too.  Filling, a variety of items.  Seemed like a fair price for the other items as well.  It was a bit packed but that would be because of Summerlicious."
4,This was a great venue prior to seeing the Barry Manilow concert last night.  The service was attentive and timely.  Three of us had the halibut and it was excellent as was the steak ordered by the fourth in our party.  Just a note....the delicious gnocchi is not substantial in the halibut dish so I suggest ordering a side dish as well. The creamy garlic potatoes were wonderful as was the creme brulee with berries.  We would definitely go back!
4,A plethera of food many many fresh hot plates too choose from .  not the typical chinesse restraunt you are greeted and taken care by a very very cheery staff that make you feel at home. The plates are bussed as soon as your done a bountyful array of tasty food awaites the decore is fresh. The booths are very comfortable.
4,"I had a breakfast burrito from here a while back and didn't really care for it, so I was hesitant to give them another shot. But at Food Truck Friday last week, I decided to mix it up from my normal Short Leash and try Jamburritos again. I'm glad I did.

I had the Steak K-Sadilla. I can't believe this thing is only $7. It's huge! I hadn't eaten breakfast and was starving. Not only did it fill me up, but it kept me full until dinner. It was super flavorful and the side of cajun sour cream was the perfect accompaniment. The only thing I didn't like is it was a little too messy. Although I appreciate the healthy serving size, I almost wish they put just a little less in the K-Sadilla so I could actually pick it up and eat it, instead of having to use a fork.

The only thing that is keeping me from giving Jamburritos 5 stars is the wait time. I know FTF gets busy, but the cashier quoted me 11-13 minutes, and it ended up being almost 20. I feel like one of the cool things about food trucks is it is quick. If I have to wait as long as I would at a restaurant, it kind of takes away from the experience."
4,"I was hungry for wings and wanted a good atmosphere to hang out with friends. I was impressed by the restuarant's setup, especially the bar section where me and my friends sat in. Good selection of beer options and the menu provided a great variety of wing flavours to try. The restaurant also doubles as a pool hall. Highly recommended."
4,"This is a cute little Italian restaurant in North York. But unlike most Italian restaurants in North York this place does not have pizza, they have couple pastas and some mains.

It is a short menu with not too many choices, but enough for you to think about what you want before you order.

We caught the lasagna, key lime pie, and the lamb shank. Our server highly recommended the lasagna and it did not disappoint us. The lamb shank was extremely tender and very tasty, okay with very simple ingredients- peas and lamb. The key lime pie was also very delicious."
4,"Stayed here to be close to the airport.

Clean and quite with a very good bed. 

The evening reception was just ok. Beer was cold with cheese, crackers and mini corn dogs.

The crew working the cook to order food was outstanding. 

I will stay here again."
4,"Was in the area and came across this little quaint cafe. Came at around 9:30am on a Sunday and it was already a full house! Luckily we were able to snag a seat by the wall. This cafe is family oriented and kid-friendly (in the back corner there's a play place).

How it works is that you order at the front and then grab a seat. Water is self serve and if you order coffee/drinks, you have to go pick it up the front. Food will be delivered to your table. Service was excellent- quick and friendly. 

The food we got:
- son of a rise (breakfast sandwich) this was so good, the bread they used was like the Popeyes biscuit, but more sweet. Bacon was also flavourful and delicious. 
- chilli (cashier said it was a seasonal item, we thought it was okay...) 
- green acre salad. The dressing was amazing, made the salad more light and refreshing.
- large fresh brew (free with a check in on Yelp!!!) 
- large orange juice (freshhhhh!) 

Bill came up to around $35, but it was worth it cause everything tasted fresh, healthy and delicious! Would recommended if you're in the area (the neighbourhood is also very colourful and cool)."
4,"Great Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches! My kalbi beef was delicious and spicy.
The kimchi fries was great as well and so filling!
Fries are enough for a meal with a good portion of pulled pork in it."
4,"FINALLY! A Chinese place that doesn't suck in Henderson, and they offer Thai food too! With a house full of hungry people wanting Chinese food and not wanting another lame experience I turned to Yelp! (of course) but the reviews for Little Dumpling left me unsure. But I took a chance and ordered. Sometimes you swing and miss, but once in a while you can knock one out of the park and Little Dumpling was a home run with everyone. In depth details....here we go. Straight from the Eat24 online order receipt which made ordering a breeze! 

22. Chicken Lo Mein  - My 2 year old loved it. So much so that when we took his plate away thinking he was done he asked me to bring it back. That's ultra rare. 
 
35. Sweet and Sour Chicken  - Premium chicken, great flavor, no skimpy food here. 
 
79. Vegetable Egg Foo Young  - When this gets compared to our gold standard Chinese place we used to love in Denver, and is ranked even better than that...what else can I say about it? They loved it! 
 
92 Thai Tea   - The nice lady at the counter almost forgot this until I asked her to double check the order. I'm sure glad she did...it was pretty dang good if I do say so. 
 
42. Kung Pao Chicken  - Good, but not great. Why? It needed a bit more spice. Every dish seen here was medium spiced...but Kung Pao needs to be hot. Fiery hot. This one...was just good. Still loved it enough that I'll order it again. 
 
38. General Tso's Chicken  - My wife puts me to shame when it comes to being a critic and when she says it doesn't suck and she smiles from ear to ear...yeah, this one made my house happy let me tell ya. 
 
8. Pot Sticker  - OMG. These ain't the crappy potstickers other places try and stick you with. These are premium meat hand made masterpieces with a little kick of spice that slapped my tongue around. 
 
3. Crab Rangoon - Holy crap, they put the crab into the crab rangoons and you can taste it. This ain't the cream cheese wontons that other places call crab rangoon. This is the good stuff. 
 
9. Chicken Teriyaki on a Stick -  Good, enjoyable, will order again, but not my personal favorite. 

If you've read this far know this. They are hidden in behind Starbucks and tucked in behind Walgreens. If you can't find it go to Walgreens and use their driveup pharmacy lanes. When you are at the window for Walgreens your headlights would shine right into Little Dumpling. 

Will I go back? Heck yes. I dropped almost $70 on Chinese food here and this is the first time I've finished eating with everyone and nobody said it sucked. That's ultra rare as I seem to live with a lot of critics. And when they compare it to our all time favorite places...enough said. For a first impression Little Dumpling made one heck of a good impression. Add on Service with a Smile, and they boxed everything up and it was easy to carry it all out...oh and one last thing. Their spicy Chinese mustard will sneak up on you and kick your ass. Sorry for the profanity but you've been warned. 

4 Stars...don't want to jinx them with a 5, I'll save that last star for a review of their Thai offerings. If they nail the Thai food...that 5th Star will be posted."
4,Great food! Great atmosphere!  Place was totally buzzin!  It's quite tight and busy so be sure to make a reso. We just shared a ton of plates (family style) and it was delicious!
4,"OK, when I've had a little too much fun ... wink, wink. I know the only thing that will prevent me from having a hangover is the same thing that will cure a hangover: Cheap, greasy food.

And nobody does it better that Chico's. Come on, five tacos for $5?

The food is great, the service is friendly and fast and the price is right.

Let's grab a six pack, six shots of Cuervo and then head to Chico's so we will be ready to do it again tomorrow. What do you say?"
4,"Their Sweet 'n Spicy Thai & Garlic Parmesan sauce and the cajun fries are the only reason why I come here. Their other sauces are pretty basic. Some of the dry seasonings are okay, but the taste never seems to be consistent so I stick to my one flavour.

They have all you can eat wings on Wednesday nights but you have to order the same flavour every time and the wings take so long to come to your table that you're full by the time they do. The service is alright, never horrible but also never great."
4,I live around the corner from the Lazy Daisy & finally stopped in. The breakfast sandwiches are amazing & the coffee is perfect. I'm glad we finally have a decent cafe in the area.
4,"Great homemade pasta, so chewy!
Price is really good, decent portion and love the decor/atmosphere. The menu changes every few days. Service is excellent."
4,"Visited them last week for the first time. 
I had a Grilled Chicken Banh Mi and the wife had a Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mi, and we both loved our sandwiches. The veggies were very fresh and crisp. The chicken was very flavorful, so were their dressings. 
The location is very convenient. Prices are very reasonable. Portions size is good. 
Great taste. Amazing value for money."
4,"Had porky pig routine it's good.
If you don't like salty stuff might not enjoy it as much
Parking is hard to find since it's at 17th ave
The serving look small but it's enough eat for the regular size
They put lots of meat in it too which is good."
4,"There were not many options for a picky 4 year old at Food Truck Friday this week, but Jamburritos delivered.  They had a Cheese Crisp and Hushpuppies combo for kids ($5), so I decided to order my lunch there, too.

I ordered the buffalo chicken and waffles special ($8).  The chicken was delicious and I mean DELICIOUS.  I can't say much about the waffle because... well, I could not eat it.  Unfortunately it had bacon on it.  It was disappointing because the waffle looked perfect and had a nice dusting of powdered sugar on it.  Anyone else would probably appreciate the bacon, but I don't eat pork.  

Five stars for an operation with great employees and great food.

Minus one star because the menu did not specify bacon was on the dish I ordered and because a cheese crisp should never be $5 (even though it was pretty big).

Lesson learned - I will ask next time about the ingredients.  Yes, I would eat here again!"
4,Good food. Nice service except for the older lady keeps screaming and yelling at sweet employee. She is rude. She's probably the owner. If she is not she should be fired or have a formal complaint with the labor commission. Other than that everything else is very good.
4,"Great place for lunch. Excellent subs on amazing bread. Fresh, fast and healthy! 

Better than any chain sub shop. 

Had the 6 inch torpedo. The battleship is huge!!!!!!! 

They have an ATM inside and only take cash."
4,"What can I say - I have been here only twice, and have had an incredibly good time - and incredibly good luck- on both visits. 

For the first, we were actually lucky enough to be staying IN the Bellagio (do not even ask me how that happened, but it was divine!). We headed down to this tiny bar to check it out, and loved how cozy and plush it was inside. Eventually, an entire bachelor party came in from South Africa and us girls were surrounded by men with accents buying us round after round of drinks. Hooray for Vegas! 

This second time, I was with a bachelorette party (count = 14 girls). We got in, wrestled up the busy bar and got drinks. While we were standing around gabbing, a guy walked by and dropped his phone, leaving a piece on the ground. Our bride picked it up, handed it to him - and he bought all of us a round of shots! Good fortune. We ended up leaving soon after because we wanted to dance (they were playing some excellent 80s music in here, but there just wasn't enough room to shake it) - but who knows what other fun we could have had at Caramel? 

Just FYI: this is the kind of place were every single table around the edge is ""reserved"" - read: pay $200 for a bottle of booze, and it's yours. There's only one community table in the middle that you can stand/sit on tall stools at, and one giant round leather cushion-y thing to sit on for us non-rich folks. So, get there early if you want to sit, and/or be prepared to move on after standing with your drink for a bit. :) 

The drink prices are pretty steep - I paid $23 pre-tip for a glass of wine and a vodka/tonic - but there's no cover to get in, so that's a big plus."
4,"Discovered this place thanks to the Indie Coffee Passport. Good spot all in all. 

My friend who is a Coffee Nazi -- there, I said it. He just takes his coffee seriously but he enjoyed their Chai Latte. To be honest, so did I. Also I am aware that a coffee purist would snub us for mixing coffee with Chai but sometimes man, you just gotta go with the flow and try new things.  

This place is well lit, and spacious. Lots of white on the walls give the locale an airy feeling. Another thing we were pleasantly surprised was their fairly large food menu. Most of which are made in the premises... not bad. Especially when most other places have some dried cookies and the odd sandwiches  

We normally go to different and sometimes multiple cafes from weekend to weekend this one stood out due the aforementioned qualities. We also had a very good customer service experience although my friend was overcharged for his sandwich, although once it was brought up, he was given a credit. 

Personally I would not come out of my way to come here. Unless a few of us decided to come out, guess the place is just too far away if you are not a local. 

Oh, and on ludicrous note, they cafe is very cow-themed! Check the uploaded photo of their tip jar. I find it so adorably silly!"
4,"Yummy who doesn't love pizza?!?
This local was perfect right by my husbands work that night.
We both wanted something fast and amazing
We ordered the meat lovers which was amazing and taste!!!
I love a good pizza pie!
I would totally love to try other types of pizza and other things on the menu at some point
But it was pretty tasty"
4,"Oh god, how have I gone this long without Banh Mi Boys?!

Got the Pork Belly Bao Buns and the Kimchi fries, both of which were delish! The steamed bao buns are stuffed with a thick slice of pork belly, cucumber, pickled veggies and hoison sauce. The Kimchi fries are a plethora of kimchi, mayo, green onions and pulled pork. 

Gonna try the braised beef next time seeing as they were sold out tonight."
4,Location close to my job always a go to for lunch. Husband and I had the basic some pizza and wings nothing too exciting calm location not a lot of people which was good because the wait was short . The bathrooms could use some more TLC. Staff was nice and courteous. Would definitely go back
4,"It's pre Saint Patrick's day and everyone in the building is eating corned beef and cabbage. I think corned beef tastes like Alpo smells and cabbage gives me bubble guts so I opt out for Cajun.  I stroll up Central Avenue soft breeze in my face sun kissed all the way and I pass a couple friends returning from where I'm heading, Food Truck Friday, oh yeah!

The Jamburrito truck had the longest line of the fleet which only made my cravings for Cajun much-more stronger. I was torn between the chicken jambalaya bowl and the fried catfish jamburritto. The guy ahead of me in line was raving about the catfish and that was all the indirect intervention I needed to make my decision. The fried catfish jamburrito is a girthy handful and loaded with chunks of freshly fried catfish, jambalaya rice, Cajun tartar, black bean salsa, shredded jack cheese and shredded lettuce.  I call it Cajun Gold!  I added on an order of hushpuppies because I'm cool like that."
4,"Good food and fast service!

We've ordered from here several times. I have called and walked in to place my orders.  Actually walking in moved things along more quickly! The lady at the counter was very nice.  She was helpful and friendly.  

The dining area itself is always clean.  There is plenty of seating so no worries there.  The menu is quite extensive with varieties of Chinese as well as Thai options.  They offer delivery if you are within the 6 mile radius.

The food items that I've ordered have been very tasty.  The General Tso's Chicken is spicy and delicious.  The crab rangoons are always nicely filled.  There is always plenty to share with their generous portions.

I wouldn't hesitate coming back here for more when I have that Chinese food craving!"
4,"Good waffles, I guess they should have since that's what their name is....lol
Asked for crispy bacon but not as the way I like it."
4,"Party of 13. We were seated and served right away. Water & cocktails right away. Gruyere cheese puff to start - very tasty but would have liked with main course. 
Apps - pork belly- delicious, seafood tower - very good with three sauces - only tried red with lots of horseradish just the way I like it!  Shrimp, lobster, crab legs& oysters. Spicy shrimp lightly breaded with tasty spicy sauce.  Wagu (?) tartar very good.  French onion soup quite good especially the cheese. 
7oz petite filet -a little cold but good with herb butter and roasted garlic - only one clove?  Spinach sauté with cheese and some pasta shells. Didn't need the pasta. Was fresh and well seasoned.  
Service pretty good throughout meal. With such a large group the were some delays. Too full for desert. But choices sounded good. Excellent wines.  Know it was very expensive - but a ""working dinner with reps"".  I would go back.

Oh I liked the decor - especially the 20th century art reproductions."
4,I love wacky wings we have a tendency to only come here on Wednesday due to their all you can eat special. I was here just this past Wednesday and had a great time as per usual. We easily found parking (although it wasn't necessarily close but this allowed us to burn off some calories haha ) we were promptly seated and had a great server named Adam. He was really friendly checked on us frequently and always made sure our drinks and wings were topped up. Over the years wacky wings has really evolved for the better. Originally you had to buy a drink to get the all you can eat combo and we're only able to eat one flavour. Now they allow you to switch your flavour throughout the night. This provides you with a great opportunity to taste everything wacky wings has to offer. While we were here on Wednesday my party had requested that one of the many tvs played the TFC game. Our server Adam was great as he talked to both of his managers and made it happen. We were thrilled we were able to eat our food with some great entertainment. The price is crazy cheap too! You start with 1 lb of wings and fries and every refill of wings after is 1/2 pound for a mere $21. What's great is if your not eating all you can eat the rest of the table is still allowed to do so unlike some other wing joints in the GTA. The conveniently located wings joint is a must try if you haven't done so already !!!!
4,"Coffee is great. Service is typical of any coffee shop - mediocre. Nobody ever says ""how are you?"" these days. Though it is set up like a restaurant, you order your food at the counter, pickup your coffee and they deliver the rest. The menu consists largely of buttermilk biscuits (too sweet for me) layered with different items. The veggie one was reasonable but not particularly tasty. Quite greasy. 
Worthy for a visit if you are a local and want a quick bite to eat. The place is cute and comfy."
4,"Had dinner with friends after the NAB show at the Las Vegas convention center. It was very good, The service was really good as well. I had the spicy shrimp for an appetizer which was great and I had the shrimp scampi for dinner which I loved my friends had the salmon and they said it was really good. Definitely would go back. Love the bread or should I say rolls? Lol Had so much fun..well it is Vegas"
4,"First time coming here, great experience. Came here with my fiancé to play some pool and have a couple beers. The waitress was very helpful and told us it would be wiser to choose the personal pitcher instead of a regular pitcher as it is cheaper in the end. My fiancé and I decided to order the wing player for the $24.99. 

I like spice so I was a bit disappointed that the habanero sauce wasn't spicy and the amount of sauce they had put on the wings did not cover the entirety of the wings. Ate about half of the platter when we came across one really undercooked wing, as you could still see pink and a little blood. The waiter took the wings back and came back with a full order of the wing platter (even though we had already ate half of it); then apologized for the undercooked wing. 

All in all, it was a good experience with good customer service. Definitely will be back again :)"
4,"YESSSS!!! YESSS!!!!

I am so happy to know about this place. It is basically the perfect date spot for the Hubster and me: wings, beer, sports on big screens, music (lots of 90s for some reason), pool tables and friendly staff. What's not to love!?

Big thanks to Tim for putting a UYE together, so we could all get all you can eat wings and share them amongst each other.

The rule for AYCE wings is: Wednesday only, $15.99. You get 15 to start with fries and after that, you get wings in batches of 5 with or without fries (which continue to be free). You have to stick with the original flavour you ordered, but if you're with friends, you can trade. If you can't finish your first batch, you can take the rest home. After that, there's no take-homes. 

First off, the wings are pretty huge for AYCE. They're also perfectly cooked and tasty, though I thought the seasonings were on the salty side. I got the spicy thai dry, which were really good. I also got the Megan Fox Hot sauce on the side, which was the second hottest they had, and was like a spicy Frank's Red Hot, but saltier. So... not that hot. I'll have to try the devil's inferno next time. I also tried the habanero Thai, which was very good, and the honey garlic, which was also very good. 

I LOVE the fries.

I will be back, and in greater numbers, too!"
4,"Cajun and Mexican fusion?!  I got a Blackened Catfish bowl.  There really wasn't anything ""Mexican"" about that bowl, except that they added some shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream to the top.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it.  The bowl came with a generous helping of catfish, beans, and cajun rice with andouille sausage.

The fish was truly blackened and had a little bit of a kick to it.  It was enjoyable and the fish was nicely cooked although some of the outer edges of the filet were a little dry.

I liked this a lot, but next time I'd ask for no sour cream.

p.s. my friend ordered the hush puppies, I would say skip those."
4,"Good, dependable, bar/traditional american food. A staple in the North Hills for years. Great staff and attentive management."
4,"Part of my new foodie escapades, my friends and I were contemplating which Italian restaurant to try out. I suggested few locations, not including 7 Numbers, however my friend told me that it is a great place, and it is definitely worth it, particularly the family share meal. I took his word for it and we all went.

Finding the restaurant is not a problem, and as for parking goes, one can park on the side streets behind the restaurant. You either have street parking or paid parking. When we entered the restaurant, it was busy - normal for 7:45PM and we were immediately greeted and seated down. The ambiance is very rustic, hip and the lighting was semi dim.  The noise level was average, and this place is definitely for a date, as I think one cannot hear another. 

That being said, we decided to go for the family share menu, which consists of 3 dishes from the antipasti, all three pastas from the primi, and one main from the secondi. The price for this is $34 per person, not including gratuities of course. 

We told the server that I am vegetarian, and he assured me that there is no need to worry, as most of the dishes are vegetarian. To start we had the calamari, of course I didn't touch this, the Pepperoni (no not meat - Roasted red peppers with arugula and goat cheese) and the Caprese. It did not take long for this to come, and my taste buds sure had a memorable feeling. I guess you really can't mess up the above, either way, it was tasty. 

Onto the Primi which consisted lasagne, orechiette and the linguine. The lasagne, I did not have, as it was made with ground veal. However the other two pasta dishes were perfect. The texture, flavours and overall taste were fantastic. I have never had pasta like this before in my life, and I can definitely vouch for it. 

Last but not least, the Secondi. Being a vegetarian, my choices were limited as it is, and that being said, there was only one option to choose from. This was the palmugiane.(Pan-fried eggplant baked in tomato sauce). It looked like the traditional eggplant parmigiana, but it was not. The portion size was perfect and the sauce was great. However, it had a huge aftertaste of egg. I could definitely taste it, and it was on the high side. You know the taste when cookies, pasta have a lot of egg in it? Well this was like that. Would I order this again? Definitely not. 

Now you wonder why I docked a star? Well, one primarily being the fact that their secondi menu has only 1 vegetarian item, and the other being the palmugiane having a lot of egg in it, 1 star was docked off. If someone who is reading this does not like the aftertaste of egg in their mouth, or rather noticing the huge taste, this dish is definitely not for you. Heck, even the pasta you couldn't taste the egg flavour to it. 

Overall, I'd definitely visit this place with my friends again and highly recommend it, regardless whether you are vegetarian or not. 

Foodies, definitely check out this place!"
4,"We visited the Scottsdale Food Truck Festival this weekend 4 days after arriving back from our ""home"" city of New Orleans. We saw, or better yet, smelled this truck right away making us miss the spices we love so much. Ran right over and ordered the Mardis Gras combo platter with chicken Jambalaya, red beans and rice, fried catfish and hush puppies. We had to wait a few minutes for a fresh batch of fish which resulted in us getting an amazingly tender and moist fillet that tasted as fresh as you can get in AZ. The spices in the Jambalaya were in point, variety of hot sauces readily available and the service was very friendly. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"
4,"After being introduced to this more family friend version of hooters a couple years back I had to drop by again to start my holiday gluttony-fest.  Between my bro, my cousin and myself we opted for the 80oz tower of Steam Whistle.  Didn't know if it was just our tolerance/ability to consumption large volumes of alc but the 80oz disappeared sooner than we thought.  The beer had good flavor and went well with the wings.  We had the cajun wings which is my fav and also tried the thai chili and regular hot sauce flavor.  Enjored the vibe and the wings of the place so much that I had to stop by again before I went back to SoCal.  

Upon our return we had a different experience when we were rudely ignored for the first 15min. of being seated.  Apparently,  the waitress in-charge of our table was a noob but that shouldn't be an excuse.  Luckily, Melissa, who was responsible for tables at the opposite end of the restaurant took us under her wing and made up for the neglectfulness.  Melissa saved this place from getting a negative rating from.  To Wacky Wings manager: Promote Melissa!"
4,"I always have a great time at Caramel. Gorgeous place, easy to spend time with friends over drinks here and really enjoy yourself. Very sexy wait staff."
4,Had the mega meat pizza... It was pretty good. Usually take my kids here as it has a play area.
4,"This place opened today, and must have had great word of mouth.  When I visited at 3:30, they were very busy, and I was told that they'd been so all day.  Here's the blurb from their Facebook page; 
 
***********
Lazy Daisy's cafe serves up locally sourced, naturally raised, hand-made and farm fresh food. Friendly staff serve up a fantastic array of sandwiches, bagels, homemade soups, chili, quiche & salads. We also have an array of homemade signature jams! Our coffee is micro roasted locally in small batches and is sourced via DIRECT or FAIR TRADE. A great place to meet up with friends and family!
***********

From my observations, they put their money where their mouth is.  They actually map out all the sources of their foods...which farms, suppliers etc.  They get their coffee beans from Te Aro, and their jams are made in their kitchen!  They receive bagels from St. Urbain fresh each day.

I ordered a cortado, through which I walked Dawn (one of the owners, and infinitely patient on this first busy day), and it was delicious."
4,"I've been to the banh mi boys by spadina and was super excited to try this location out as well (Yonge/eglington). Everything tasted fresh and tasty. I ordered the steam bun with panko crusted tofu (it was very flavourful) as well as the jicama&papaya slaw, I loved the spicy dressing (but if your not into spice, alone would've tasted good too). I can't wait to try the Kalbi beef and grilled chicken next..."
4,"Half decent waffle house. Walked and and I was greeted right away, grabbed a seat at the bar and also had prompt service. Ordered the all star special with a pecan waffle no toast. I must say this was one of the better all stars I have had. Bacon was cooked just right for me and the eggs were nice and fluffy also got hash browns with jalapeños and cheese and they were cooked perfectly. Coffee was filled on the regular and I ate every bit of my meal. ONLY call out is that I hate when you sit at the bar and you can see a dirty floor in front of the stove... this is common at these joints. I would come again!"
4,"The Waffle House totally exceeded my expectations. I thought it'd be just another crappy Denny /IHOP like spinoff, but the food here was actually really good. I'd even go far enough to say it was the best waffle I've ever had. Plus, it's dirt cheap. The decor of this restaurant is classic late night dinner."
4,"Lunch there was fantastic. Very clean, food good, service was wonderful. The beef and onion, and hot and spicy soup were my favorites.  Great price for a buffet. YUMMY!!!"
4,This place is delicious! I had the Banh Mi Grilled Chicken and my husband had the Banh Mi Duck Confit and they were so good. Very filling at such a great price. We will definitely be back.
4,"good for lunch, delivery  take out.  varied menu (thai, chines, and dumplings)"
4,"This place does hoagies right. They pack plenty of meat in the sandwiches and use plenty of fresh vegetables. I ordered the pastrami destroyer and was amazed by how much I got. I'm not usually a sandwich person but was told that this was a must try in Pittsburgh. It didn't disappoint at all because I inhaled it like it was nothing.

Too bad this place is kinda out of the way or I would be eating here much more often."
4,Your average Chinese buffet. Every meat on the buffet was high in sugar. But they had a very good vegetable selection for my vegan wife. Basically if your craving a Chinese buffet this one is about as good as any.
4,"I went to an event a couple weekends back where this truck was working, but it wasn't as great as when I've previously had their food. Still good, but not as good. Their hush puppies are AMAZING. I love New Orleans food so this is a nice way to bring a taste of New Orleans to Phoenix. Jambalaya with chicken was pretty good. The sausage was probably the best part. Not too bad overall though!"
4,"I love Waffle House even when I'm not drunk and it's been many years since I was in college. Is it fancy? Hardly. Is the food good? Always. My standard fare is a regular waffle and hashbrowns that are smothered, covered, peppered with an over easy egg on top.  This location was super fast, the food was cooked well, and the waitstaff was on top of things. I just realized I left without looking for and taking over a TouchTunes, which is also a tradition I try to do when I go."
4,"I had never been to a Waffle House. Most have been in less than great places and screamed stay away. This one is clean and neat (mostly) and everybody said ""good morning"" or ""welcome"". 
Food was better than expected and served quickly. One complaint is the waffle was not that hot and cooled off. Coffee was nice and hot tho. 
Like they said in the movies ""I will be back"""
4,"I've been to this location three times and it's always been the same girl operating the cash register.  She's really patient and polite.  The cooks seem polite although I've had very little interaction with them.  The food is consistently good and tasty fast food.  I've tried their sandwiches (kalbi ribs twice and pork), as well kimchee poutine and papaya salad.  The kalbi beef is decent quality and not full of fat.  I've been to their College/Yonge location a couple of times a few years back too."
4,Just moved to this side of town and am always looking for good Chinese food. I drove past the sign and decided to check it out. I didn't know it was mostly a take out place but once I was there decided to give it a try anyhow. I was surprised to see how  reasonable to prices were - great lunch specials. I ordered the Mongolian beef for myself and the Teriyaki chicken bowl for my husband. The food took about 15 minutes so i was confidant everything was cooked to order. Everything was delicious!! I would have given it 5 stars but when i pulled up outside at 11:15am (supposed to open at 11am)  the doors to the place were still locked and lights off... I was about to pull away when the owners showed up and welcomed me in. I am glad  they caught me otherwise I would have missed out!!
4,"Really good food and nice staff. Cool interior design with an English countryside vibe. Only thing is that you order at the counter, so you have to reserve yourself a seat before. I made the mistake not to snag a table/reserve it by putting my bag down, and someone took my table after I'd paid for my food! This isn't as much of a problem if it's not busy.

Try to go during non-rush hours, and reserve yourself a table with your bag before you order at the counter!"
4,"I went to Lazy Daisy with my work colleagues for lunch because they offered a wide selection of vegan options (one of our coworkers is vegan). 

Coxwell and Gerrard is the start of Little India and smack dab in the middle of ""uhhh, uhhh, did I make a wrong turn en route to the place I actually want to go?"" It's not a pretty part of the city and odd to find a place so cute and well stocked at Lazy Daisy.

The menu available at lunch ranged from soup and salad through sandwiches and items that seemed like they were straight out of ""mom's kitchen."" The decor is natural if a touch tight and broken into two areas: one for people that are clearly going to stay a while and another for those just grabbing a cup of joe (or his fancier friends joe o lait or joeacinno). 

The staff was CRAZY FRIENDLY! I was really touched about how they took time to explain everything they had on their menu that I didn't understand and also ensure our vegan member of the party was aware of all their vegan friendly options. 

For the four of us, the total came to about $54 including tip and we left full and satisfied. It was a great lunch and excellent value. 

I'm not sure I'd want to head here into the evening because while the art on the wall by local artisans lend to the urban-hip feel, the cash for gold type places across the street don't have the same je ne c'est quoi.

TO SUM IT UP: Good food and friendly staff all in a neighbourhood that inspires to you lock your doors at stop lights."
4,"I've been checking out the different food trucks at Phoenix Public Market's Food Truck Fridays. 

Note: Be ready for a wait at all of the trucks. But on a beautiful spring afternoon, it's not a bad thing. 

Today I tried Jamburritos for the first time. They had an interesting and wide selection of items, from fried catfish to creole chicken quesadillas. I chose the chicken K-Tacos. Three spicy chicken street tacos with cabbage and black bean salsa. Wow. Great flavor. Enough spice to clean out my sinuses without fear of burning my taste buds. 

The guy taking orders was cheerful and pleasant. I also enjoyed the variety of beverages available. I chose a Tamarind soda. Yum. I'm looking forward to trying more items on the menu before Food Truck Friday ends when the heat rises."
4,"It was my first time to try the cajun/mexican fusion food truck. Today, they were parked outside of our office building in Tempe. I got the Chicken Jamburrito. I thought it was excellent. It was a fair price, a lot of food and they portioned the ingredients right. There is nothing worse than a burrito that has too much of one ingredient or not enough of another.. I will defintely try it out again and recommend to everyone."
4,"Delicious breakfast burritos if you get the opportunity to catch them during breakfast time. Lots of food for the money, as far as food trucks go. Try the hush puppies and Cajun tartar sauce!"
4,"Okay. After dinning in and then ordering carry out I quickly realize that this place is all about the experience. Grab 6-7 of your closets loved ones, friends, or family. Order a couple bottles of wine and just relax. Enjoy the food slowly and the time with everyone. Get the check, smile, and order a couple more rounds of drinks for everyone because this place is decently priced. 

I never really understood the importance of ambiance correlating with the taste of the food. I loved eating in here. The service was fantastic, the cooks were  checking in on us periodically. Being from Detroit, I'm always happy to hear they have Motown jamming in the background too. It's got a great laid back family vibe. 

The food was good, but the meatballs were everyones' favorite choice by far.  Ingredients tasted fresh which makes sense since their menu changes often. That night though we couldn't stop talking about this place.

I decided recently to get the same food to go. BIG mistake. Do not order to go here. You will be disappointed. You have to eat the food fresh, especially the meatballs. The food becomes a bit greasy as it sits and chills. 

Go there, relax, and sedate yourself in the experience with your loved ones."
4,"My girlfriend took me to this little spot when I wanted to go to China a Go Go.  She told me I needed to try the lunch special here.  Well, like most things, she was right.  This place is the bomb.  Cheap lunches a tons of food!  Although it is your standard Americanized lunch fare, the food tasted better and the plate filled me up.  If you're in the area, check this place out.  You won't be disappointing.  

Note: They did have more traditional Thai and Chinese items on the menu which I will definitely try at a later date."
4,"The excellent service and the none pretencious atmosphere of this restaurant is what sold me on this place!  The food is good.  It's authentic, traditional and made with love. The prices are also very very reasonable for Toronto.  It's definately worth checking out!"
4,Tracked this truck down at the Phx Arts Festival this winter. The hubs & I shared the ginormous catfish Jamburrito. & I still couldn't finish my 1/2. It's seriously ginormous. The hush puppies were delish too. My hubs is a glutton for punishment out of his love for it's flavor & orderted the burrito again at Food Truck Friday & couldn't demolish it alone & he's not a pansy. You really get a lot of good food. Go for it!
4,"Awesome Tacos and great salsa bar... Fast, inexpensive, delicious, and right downtown. A perfect lunch hangout when downtown."
4,"Huge portions and hearty, tasty Cajun/Mexican fusion food. In addition to Cajun style burritos, they offer nachos, quesadillas, and bowls. 

I opted for a blackened catfish jamburrito ($8) and shared some veggie nachos ($8). The burrito was enormous, packed with spicy catfish, jambalaya rice, tartar sauce, and lettuce. It was so big I could only finish half of it for lunch. The nachos were equally tasty, filled with a heaping portion of creole marinated cabbage, beans, cheese, and sour cream, just to name a few of the ingredients. 

The order came out fairly quickly. In addition to your order, they offer you salsa, and give you a lollipop as an after meal treat. Overall a good place to get lunch!"
4,"Lots of options for the picky eater or special dieter. Sports bar can get pretty loud. 
Usually, good with friendly service."
4,"This place is great.  Most of the food on the menu is decent, but the Arroz Con Pollo is amazing!  The salsa bar is clean and the regular salsa is perfect.  The staff is friendly and the prices are low - around $6 per plate (large portions).  Cheap beer & margarita - $1.99 most days.  This is an order-at-the-counter-and-seat-yourself kind of place, but the seating area is nice and the service is fast."
4,"My room was super big for one person! Must have been a suite. 

Here's the scoop:
+ Friendly front desk staff
+ Super huge corner suite (separate living room area with small kitchenette and dishwasher!)
+ Good smellin' bathroom soaps
+ Super comfy bed
+Plentiful parking 
+ Beautiful 
+Close to major freeway
+Tasty breakfast (free!) Not that cheap continental stuff either. A full on omelet area, a couple cereal choices, sausage, eggs, juice coffee, grits (forreal haha)

Overall a good choice!"
4,"Nice lounge but it really can get packed at times. The whole setting of the lounge is beautiful. I went there to celebrate my girls 21st and if your tired of the club scene this is the place to go. 

The drinks are a little on the pricey side but it's Vegas! But the drinks are made well enough to keep you coming back for more. 

All in all cool spot if your looking to kick back and enjoy some drinks with no cover charge."
4,"The Bellagio's hotel lounge does not disappoint.  It is on the small side but yet there is still a lot of room to move around.  The bartenders were quick and the drinks were strong and really, what more can you ask for?  We were in on a Saturday night and it was fairly empty, you could have easily pulled up a couch spot if you wanted to.  The music was pretty standard rap and was rather loud."
4,"I had a very, very lovely evening here last night - the memory of the flavours makes my eyes roll back in my head!

I was brought here as a surprise for our second anniversary because Sweetheart knows I'm a huge Italian food fan, and he wanted to bring me to an authentic place.  At most Italian restaurants, I just order pasta, because the meat doesn't really interest me that much, I love my carbs, and especially because usually the pasta is more than enough to fill me up - especially if I want any appetizers or desserts.

But here at 7 Numbers, they do it the right way - the portions are smaller because they're designed to be eaten through, and the prices reflect that (very reasonable prices!).  So you're supposed to have an antipasti (appetizer), a primi (pasta course), and secondi (meat course) with contorni (side vegetables, usually in the form of veggies).  

I was eyeing the fixed price menu but I had a picky eater with me, so we decided to pick everything out ourselves.  We got the calamari, a large lasagna portion, the rapini linguini, the sexy duck leg, the grilled pork chop, and we got a slice of the flourless chocolate cake to go.

The calamari was delicious!!!  It was very generously seasoned, cooked just right, and came on a bed of assorted lettuce.  We squeezed the lemon slice it came with over it but I kind of wish we didn't because the coating on the calamari was the kind that wilts as soon as it hits liquid.  But it was very, very good and the lemon went very well with it.

The pastas were really something to write home about!  They were quite salty to me, which means Sweetheart found them perfect, and they were cooked a little longer than I liked, but the flavours were just wonderful.  The rapini linguini was beautifully garlicky and olive oily, and the tomatoes in it were magically not acidic.  The bitterness of the rapini cut through the richness very well.  The lasagna was very, very hearty and rich.  At first bite I kind of thought the sauce was too acidic but once you have it with the meat sauce and the cheese inside, it's perfect.  The tartness of the sauce goes perfectly with the meat sauce, which must have been cooked for hours!  I need to re-emphasize how rich and almost heavy the pastas are - the portions are smaller, which is perfect, but if anyone's squeamish about seeing a puddle of oil at the bottom of their plate, this pasta is not for them!  

The meats were good but not as impressive as the pastas.  The sexy duck leg was encrusted with rosemary, which made it taste very herbal, but it was very good.  Kind of small though, and quite salty - but good.  The grilled pork chop was delightfully thick and succulent - as juicy as a grilled pork chop could be!  But the braised onion/pepper garnish it came with DELICIOUS.  It was super savoury, kind of like they were lifted out of a super flavourful stew, and they melted in my mouth.  Delicious.  The grilled asparagus was just right - they tasted like high quality oily oil, they were crunchy, they had the delicious grilled flavour - very nice and basic.

We saved the flourless chocolate cake for home because we didn't want to skip it but were too full to have it right away.  It was dense and chocolatey and sweet without being too sweet.  Very good.

Our server was also quite pleasant and patient with us despite our questions and indecisiveness!  I'd love to come back again and I hope to join the cooking class one day! :)"
4,"I agree that Chico's isn't exactly high end; however, if you are craving quick, simple Mexican flare that isn't from a scary drive-thru and won't break the bank then this place is it.  

I'm surprised only one person mentioned the Achiote Chicken Salad.  I CRAVE this salad and try to get it at least once every few weeks (it's $5.99 on Thursday).  My friend who introduced me to this place moved to San Diego and when she visits, this is where we go and what we get.  It's made with crisp, fresh, bright green romaine lettuce (no iceberg!), black beans, a small scoop of their spanish rice and the tastiest grilled, shaved, spicy chicken breast (no scary bits).  It's topped with diced tomatoes and 1/2 sliced avocado.  The best part is their chile dressing.  I like to use 1/2 of that and 2 sides of their pico de gallo on top.  Scoop it all up with some chips...DELICIOUS. 

On a whim, we once ordered the bean burrito.  I'm Mexican; from New Mexico (read I take my beans seriously).  This is hands-down one of the best reasons to spend $5 for a bean burrito.  Order it as is.  You won't be sorry.  

My fiance has had some decent experiences with their oher menu items, chimichangas, beef tacos, etc.  Pretty standard fare. 

Stick with the salad and bean burrito, you won't be sorry.  

To boot, they serve Mexican Coke in a bottle."
4,"Good poutine. They have vegan options (but they overcharge for it). It's almost worth buying your own Daiya and adding it yourself. Daiya doesn't cost that much.

Edit: the vegan prices are fixed. I am bumping up the stars"
4,"Great service, friendly staff. Hash browns were tasty and kids loved the waffles. 

Diner styled atmosphere. Safe area. 

Waitress gave us a free waffle which was nice. Coffee was good. 

Very satisfied for what it is."
4,"Definately, my favorite lounge in Vegas. The crowd ranges from old, young, hip, and square but everyone seems to have a good time. I found it to be good to take a date or go single. Music is pretty good, and the DJ isn't against taking requests. Waitresses are all pretty good looking, friendly, and on the mark. They also have a nice selection of signature martinis flanked by my absolute favorite Cucumber Martini which is way more delicious then it sounds. If you have an hour to kill and don't feel like paying 20 bucks to get into one of Vegas' crazy nightclubs have a drink here."
4,"Seven Numbers has a great atmosphere, cozy, warm and candlelit. We were seated within reasonable time, about 20 min around dinner time on a Saturday night. Veal lasagne was absolutely excellent. Probably the best tomato sauce in any dish I have ever had. The dessert, a chocolate/caramel tart was just good, underwhelming after the excellent lasagne. Definitely would have been better served warm too. Coffee was also good-no cream however. Will be back soon!"
4,"Great blue collar, Pittsburgh atmosphere...cozy & warm. The wife and I both had salads that were fresh and flavorful. I had the buffalo chix salad and she had the strawberry chix salad. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Great place for lunch!"
4,"I have been going to the Lounge for years with my family and it is always a place we take out of area visitors to.

Like stated before, it's a 'Cheers' type place, but almost leans towards a TGI Friday's type place, but with a friendlier staff.

The service has always been quick and prompt and the staff is friendly and treats you respectably. Any requests are normally handled without and issue. Quite often the owner, Mark, will stop by your table to either ask how things are going or even deliver your food. Its definitely a quality I like to see in a restaurant when the owner is so involved in his investment and is there to ensure that everyone is enjoying themselves.

As for the food, I doubt theres much, if anything that is not good to order. I have tried a range of their food from the Lounge fries, cheese steaks, burgers, fish sandwiches, and wraps, and have never been disappointed. Now I'm not a huge salad fan because I love sinking my teeth into some type of meat, my mother and sister always enjoy them and rarely order anything else.

There beer specials are also quite good and for a first timer, I'd suggest getting some Lounge Fries (Cheese and Bacon with Ranch dressing) along with a beer and the Giant Fish sandwich. *drool*"
4,"Really enjoyed my meal here this past week.  I had heard good things and the experience did not disappoint.  The inside is kind of setup like a dive bar, but there are plenty of seats away from the actual bar area.  

For an appetizer we had the barbecue chicken ranch dip.  I am a huge fan of buffalo chicken dip so I figured I'd give this a try.  It was delicious.  The bbq sauce had a great tangy taste.  The chips were not the best and I think flatbread or pita would go better with the dip, but I still really enjoyed it.

For my meal I had the A1 burger, which I ordered medium rare.  It came out closer to medium, but was still juicy.  It was an above average burger, but did not live up to the ""best in the burgh"" claim on their website and menu.  The meat blends just didn't seem to be a great combination, too lean a ratio possibly.  Like I said though it was juicy and had some good flavor.  The fries were your standard bar fries, they would have been just ok, but the quality ranch dressing they had made them a good side.  My wife had a chicken quesadilla which was delicious.

I definitely want to return to try some of the other things on their menu.  Great first trip though."
4,"Got a black bean brownie and  a carrot cake today. They were absolutely amazing! 

Love the interior decor of the cafe, especially the photos on the wall."
4,Great hotel. When u first walk in you know the hotel is above average.  Complimentary happy hour. Enough said. Rooms are very nice very comfortable. Nice flat screen TVs   The staff is very friendly and helpful. And there is a steakhouse on the first floor. This is a great place to stay.
4,"my dad always raved about the battleships, and often we would make the drive just to get them. Very fresh ingredients, and simply delicious."
4,"Tonight was my second visit to Barro's, but my first at this location. This staff was helpful and friendly. I tried the thin crust pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage. The sausage seemed to be the fresh variety and had a nice, slightly spicy flavor. I enjoyed all the toppings and would definitely return to get a thin crust pizza. I tried the hand tossed pizza on my initial visit and would definitely recommend the thin. It's the same dough, but the thin doesn't overwhelm the flavor profile like the thicker hand tossed does."
4,"After dancing our sexy booties off at Cleopatra's Barge in Ceasar's my man-friend and I strutted our drunk asses around the Palace and into the Bellagio in search of a night cap. We accidently stumbled upon the Caramel Lounge. It was 3 in the morning and the lounge was very dimly lit with dark corners for dark deeds, poshly decorated, and an after hour mix playing in the background. All in all the perfect ambiance for enhancing a post-party, Sin City experience.

The crowd was minimal and my only complaint was the DJ (a girl with a laptop and Itunes playlist) who became a little finger happy with the fast forward button. Would've been nice if she had just set the damn thing on after-party shuffle and left it! Drinks were of normal Vegas fare."
4,"I don't go to Pittsburgh that often, but when I do there is always a stop at the NPL.  This place has an extensive menu (including lounge fries), access to every game through one of it's plethora of TVs, a decent sized bar, and a wheel of prizes that you get to spin on your birthday.  What more can you ask for?  The downside is the occasionally long wait.  not many other options in the area and you can tell."
4,"Mmm. That pulled pork.

The food was so good. For takeout, I'd put them in my top 5. My sandwich was hot and fairly neat in the takeout container, everything that was supposed to be crisp was, and I was not disappointed."
4,"Went here for drinks after having dinner at Fix with my girlfriends for my bachelorette party. It was part of the bachelorette package my girlfriends got and boy, was I impressed. 

Upon entering, you get the feeling of it being a half club/half lounge hangout. There are seats along the edge of the lounge. We were seated quickly by our hostess for the night and was quickly given our bottled service of champagne, grey goose, fruit mixers, strawberries and chocolate. Our glasses were never empty; they were always filled by our wonderful waitress and busboy whom, were very nice! 

The music was crackin'! Loved it. It really got you all geared up to go to the Bank Club and get your groove on."
4,"I know, I am giving a chain breakfast place a 4. But you know, it was good. Imagine a sit down place that might as well be fast food. The kitchen setup is roughly the same with a well oiled machine of an assembly line working. The menu looks a bit like Denny's but with less choices. The prices are a bit more than you would expect to spend at a place like this, but the food amount is worth it. 

The waitresses go to the tables, take the order, go back behind the counter and call out the order. And it has to be done a certain way too. There is a lead and three other people cooking, each with their specific job. The lead is handling the bread and the waffle irons. The others deal with the potatoes, eggs, and meats. The basic meal is eggs, potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast. You can substitute grits for the potatoes. We ordered ""1 scrambled, grits, bacon over cooked, wheat and 1 scrambled, potatoes scattered, bacon, sourdough."" And proceeded to watch the production continue. It was fun to see the whole thing and how quickly our food came out. No written orders were kept in front of the cooks, it was all by memory. There were a few people learning different rolls and funny to see them picking up all the nuances of the waffle house machine. 

The food was good. A bit greasy, but lots of food and fast. Its good if you just want to get some average breakfast food and get on your way to something else."
4,"Its safe to say that Im a regular here. I love everything about Wackys - food, entertainment, service everything is always on par. Highly recommend the Honey Garlic Gar Par wings, similar to the Sweet Escape from Wild Wings, and the campfire sticks tastes like delicious hot off the grill Churros."
4,Went for the first time today and it won't be the last time. Food was amazing and the service was on point. We will be goin back there again.
4,"Local restaurant I always visit when I am in town. Solid pub food that is reasonably priced and usually good service that is friendly and sincere. 

My go to are wings or the Italian Hoagie."
4,"""Hearty Italian"" are the two words that spring to mind when I think of 7 Numbers. The servings are generous, the food flavorsome and the presentation simple yet refined. My party of 4 tried the family sharing option whereby you each get to choose your own main dish but are also served with salads and calamari to start, then pasta before being laden with the mains plus sides, by which point you will be hard pressed to finish all the food on account of being so full up. 

The salads were an impressive start to the meal in that being so seemingly simple they still manage to be unique and tasty in their own way (we had spinach with mushroom sprinkled with soft cheese, rocket with red pepper sprinkled with soft cheese, and tomato with mozzarella in a vinagarette dressing). The calamari was also tender and enough for 2 pieces each. Of the pasta dishes the lasagne was by far the stand-out being wonderfully layered, enriched in a delicious tomato sauce and achieving an almost melt-in-the-mouth texture. Unfortunately the smaller pasta shells and brocollini I thought were a bit on the tough side. 

Then with the mains the cauliflower mash is a sizeable portion propping up its two lamb chops, the lamb shank is a mighty sight, and the hunter chicken came as two chunks of chicken surrounded by gravy and various vegetable pieces. Sadly one piece of the chicken was too salty to enjoy. The grilled zucchini was a delightful side to have alongside the meats whilst the accompanying salad I felt had been doused in too much vinegar. 

For a dessert, the nutella tiramisu fills a surprisingly big container - similar to the size of a small plate and certainly something a single person might find a challenge to finish eating, especially after the unsurmountable amounts of food we'd already had, nevertheless if you are up to the task, this dessert is indeed well made and worth a try.

All in all 7 numbers may be a little rough-around-the-edges and go a bit overboard with some of its flavoring but it can offer a wholesome good-value meal, perfect for a cosy night out with friends or loved ones."
4,"Nice staff, clean restaurant and freshly made sushi. The food isn't great quality, but when you can catch it right when it comes out from the kitchen it is fairly good."
4,"Went to Caramel for my friend's birthday celebration. We didn't feel like waiting for our boyfriends to get into The Bank nor did they want to pay the cover, so we decided to go to Caramel.

Not very crowded for a Saturday night after 11. No line or cover. My friends had a bunch of the 2 for 1 coupons, drinks still uber expensive, but what do you expect for a lounge on the strip, let alone at the Bellagio. Well drinks were about $12 and beers about $10. Not too bad, there were 5 of us and with 3 of the coupons, drinks came out to about $50 not including tip. It would've been probably almost $100 without it. (Not my cup o' tea!) 

I didn't care for the music, but my friends and I were pretty buss and dancing anyway. Not sure why we didn't sit down but we just hung out by the bar all night. 

I'm not one to hang out on the strip but once in a great while, I'll venture out there for good reason. Pretty chill/cool place overall, and if we had those coupon things again, I'd go again."
4,Best wings in the 'burgh!  Great bar food and decent prices.  Service is usually good too.
4,"I eat here under the same circumstances as when I would eat at Faustos--when I'm starving, low on cash, tipsy, or have many mouths to feed. Get the pot stickers. They're homemade and the dipping sauce is delicious. Another favorite of mine is the war wonton soup."
4,"Was so happy to see this business pop up in a neighborhood that has been a bit slow to gentrify. 

Checked this place out for the first time on a Sunday. Lazy Daisy's Cafe does a perfect job of balancing ""hip"" with ""family friendly"" with a cool interior (sleek seating, including a communal table at the front of the house, exposed brick) and a kid-friendly play area at the back of the space.

Service was friendly and the food menu, though mainly sandwiches and breakfast fare, was extensive. While true that their pricing may be slightly higher than other businesses in the area, they did not seem unreasonable considering the ingredients are sourced locally (including bread from local artisal bakeries). The breakfast sandwich I had and the breakfast burrito my husband had were both delicious. Te Aro coffee was a nice plus and prepared perfectly (I had an americano)."
4,"It is said that ""first impressions"" last and I must be a foodie to say that I was impressed. I had the spicy chicken sandwich with kimchi fries totally worth the money. The atmosphere is very pleasing, clean and presentable. The staff seems friendly and customer service is very important for me. No matter the quality of the food or reputation of the establishment customer service have to be better than everything else. I would highly recommend giving this location a try. I will be visiting again soon."
4,"Very tasty breakfast sandwich and cappuccino, but at $12 total and a small portion with only two bits of melon on the side, I won't be coming here often -- which is unfortunate because the vibe and ingredients are great and there is nowhere else in the area that does a sit down breakfast aside from the dingy joint across the street. Will give four stars anyway but I'm still disappointed by the high prices. This area should be affordable for young families, not straight into full tourist-price gentrification."
4,"third time coming around to this wonderful place 
disclaimer: wensdays are all you can eat wings(not boneless) 
upon arriving to the resturant, we were greeted with a swarm of people waiting for seats, we confirmed that we wanted to eat with the resturant and was told we were the 26th group in line. 20 minutes later we had our table (no complaints) 
the food was excellent as always, unfortuantly they decided to change one of the flavors on my favorite wings, which resulted in the wings not being hot enough. 
the place was packed and all of the waitress's were running around like mad because of the amount of people eating and drinking.
overall an excellent time"
4,"They offer a $25 pre-show dinner deal (for Danforth Music Hall) on their prix fixe dinner which is regularly $29. We had the arugula and goat cheese salad, giant calamari, insalata caprese,  giant veal meatballs, the raciola infornata (slices of veal rolled with baby spinach, hot peppers and Romano cheese) and two pasta dishes. The food was plenty for two. The atmosphere was classy but down-to-earth at the same time. The staff make you feel like you're at a fancy restaurant. The calamari and meatballs were the standout dishes for me."
4,"Go-to spot for wings and to catch the game. Atmosphere is country-sportsbar with lots of big screen tvs, booths with TVs and a large section for arcade games and pool. Wacky wings is fun for the whole family. Food is always good too...regular pub fare, lots of fried stuff but of course that's to be expected. Wackys loses a star for me solely because out of the 5-6 times I've been there service has been so-so and never consistent. I've had visits there where the service was quick and amazing and then other times when our table was forgotten for 15 mins after we sat down. Nevertheless, usually a fun time!"
4,"We order to go from here all the time. The burgers are really good to go and so are the fries. The one word of wisdom I have is, do not order lounge fries to go. They lose their magic and appeal."
4,"We went here once with our relatives while in Pittsburgh. Such a nice place with obvious history. The menu is enormous and everything we ordered was fantastic. Probably the best service we've ever had in PGH; fast, friendly and spot on the entire meal. What a great experience, and we will go again next time we're in town."
4,"Its a Waffle House.  We don't have one in California and I haven't had any in years.  My only experience with this place will be a one and done kind of story, so I can't speak to what other yelpers are speaking of with the service and cleanliness.  While our waitress did get our order wrong, we were pleased to be the only patrons in the establishment at 4pm on a Thursday.  Ignorance is bliss and I will take that along with the new cellulite cells forming on my thighs."
4,"Caramel is a great little place. It's managed by the Light Group in Vegas. Definitely decorative. If there's special events going on, good luck in grabbing a seat. I actually had a student working there who kept offering me a free bottle on certain nights. They also serve appetizers that are pretty tasty. Overall it's cozy, sociable, and great ambiance. However sometimes they play music a little too loud. I dunno but if I were in a lounge to chill, why would I want to bring sexy back at a 1000 Watts?"
4,"This place is HOT and the place to be to enjoy good beer, wings and watch sports on big screen TV.  Definitely great to bring friends and family.  Wednesday is all you can eat wings but they're pretty slow on rolling out the wings after you order.  Their sampler platters are not in big portions so skip on those.  Go straight for wings by the pound and fries on the side to maximize your money count.  Their different flavors on wings are on point.  Check this place out"
4,Pulling up to the building is very unimpressive to say the least and same goes for the inside but I have to say that the classic Italian sub we got was good. Tons of meat but not a big variety and could use more cheese. But the flavor is good and it was HUGE! Real nice guys working there
4,"A nice place to grab a drink with music. Good vibe. No cover, no crazy lines, no wall to wall crowds. A good place to start a night or wrap up a busy one."
4,"Busy Saturday morning, but staff waiting at door to quickly seat guests. Waitress didn't know my table was hers, but apologized and gave me coffee on the house. Food was great overall and appealing."
4,"you would enjoy dining experience in Lazy Daisy's Cafe if you get bored with the Chains set menus.  ""The Sun of Rise"" - buttermilk biscuit + melted cheddar cheese + avocado + BLT.  evilly delicious"
4,"I went to Banh Mi Boys with a group of friends on Friday night to grab a quick bite.

The restaurant is a small, hole in the wall place with few seats and simple decor.  Banh Mi Boys looks more like a grab and go take out place and less like a sit down dinner.

Although the place is small and sparsely decorated, they have friendly staff and serve delicious food!

I was very hungry so I ordered the Pork Banh Mi, a Chicken Bao, Sweet Potato Fries and a pop.  It turned out to be a lot of food!  I really liked the Pork Banh Mi (a large vietnamese style sandwich with pork, carrots, mayonaise and various other toppings) and sweet potato fries.  I ordered my food mildly spicy and the restaurant provides choice for not spicy, mild, medium and hot.  I am not a big spicy food eater, so the mild spicy was just the right amount for me.

Some other items my friends ordered include (in no particular order) Kimchi fries, Tofu fries, vegetable bao and fish bao.  All the food looked good and received generally favorable feedback.

Overall, I enjoyed the food and would come back for more, and possibly go for takeout.  

3.8 / 5.0"
4,"NPL is a tucked-in local dive bar with a great vibe that only locals and fans know about.  Typical divey atmosphere and locals with their -not-from-round-here guests.  It's what places like Applebee's wish they were.  As for the food - the burgers are SO GOOD!  Honestly, I don't know what kind of cows they get, but these burgers are not to be trifled with.  I've eaten here twice and both times the beef was *perfect*.  Nine bucks and your snarfing down a gold-standard burger and loving life.  Yum!"
4,Pretty decent place if you want to grab a snack.  We ordered a grilled chicken Banh Mi and a 5 Flavor Pork Belly Bao.  The Banh Mi was a tad on the salty side but the Bao was really good.  Decent price for the amount of food you get.  Would definitely come here again.
4,"The Battleship is an excellent value and feeds quite a few! 
My tip is best to call ahead with your order especially on Steeler Sunday's.
If I had a wish list for the triangle, I'd add a place order here line and a pay here line."
4,The food is great and plenty. The service is fast and friendly. Dinner for two should come in around $20 - $30 max. Deliver or pick up.
4,This is a good place to hang out on weekend. Lots of pool tables. I saw blue jays game here and was fun. Food as well is good. Bacon broccoli cheddar bites appetizer are just amazing! Chicken wings are good with ranch flavour is the favourite. Just i thought the server was not that good in terms of understanding our order. Made few mistakes before getting it right. Otherwise this place is good to hang around on weekends.
4,"Visited this place as part of the Food Truck Friday experience at the Phoenix market.

I got the house special: Fried Catfish PoBoy with the Creole Cabbage/Cole Slaw with hush puppies. It was fried goodness and definitely filling. I didn't eat all of the bread, but I ate all of the fish and pups. This plate is served with two sauces that really pulled everything together.

I wish I would have found this place sooner. So good. Just note be prepared to wait because they are making it to order so your food is fresh with you in mind."
4,Pretty good upmarket coffee house where lots of moms and kids hang out and they have breakfast too. Decent prices.
4,"I  went to food truck Friday and was faced with a number of options and ended up choosing Jumburrito based solely on their deep fried oyster poh boy.   The wait seemed to be on the long side so I asked how long and was told 7 to 11 minutes which proved to be about right.

For the price tag of 12 bucks I thought the serving size was small especially for the truck repping  Nola food.

The sandwich came on a grilled hot dog bun to give you all an idea of the size of the sandwich.

Grilled hot dog bun with plenty of butter, delicious fried oysters topped with cole slaw.

The sandwich was delicious and I was satisfied but would've liked to see the traditional toppings such add lettuce and tomatoes.  Other than the size and the price I enjoyed the sandwich."
4,"Love this restaurant, especially this location! 
We go back for their baos pretty often. Favourite is the fried chicken bao, but the tofu and beef are some other great options. It's a great snack for a very reasonable price. The banh mi are tasty and filling. Bonus: the employees who work at this location are always friendly. 

Will keep coming back!"
4,"High B+ to the chef! My worst complaint is that the portions were so HUGE! The flavors were good and spice heat just about perfect. One member of our group complained about too much ""Italian Seasoning"" taste, but the rest of us yelled him down - can't please everyone. Should have tried these guys months ago!"
4,"I know I said I wouldn't come here again because of what happened last time, lol.. but I did! Actually I came here twice in the past before without reviewing and No Sign of that rude waitress what so ever!! I'm assuming she got fired, I wouldn't doubt it. Anyway, enough about her! The waitress I had today was a bit somewhat slow at first but picked right up, she was very attentive and Fast! Food came out perfectly and on time! I got the honey medium wings with Gar Par is what they call it, lol, it was good!! I also had a Spanish coffee and the Pink pina colada looking drink and the fried cinnamon sugar looking stick that tasted like funnel cake! I enjoyed it, my friend didn't care for them but I did and I recommend them. The waitress recommend the banana cheese cake but I Love funnel cake and only have it like once every other year and she said if you like funnel cake, you will love these so I went for them.. now I fully recommend this restaurant, I like it."
4,"A easily located Chinese buffet near the 101 and West McDowell. I actually frequent this restaurant, so reviewing comes off of real time visits. The facility is always very clean, I've been in before food was served and saw the facility being well cleaned. The food is always fresh and never appears or tastes as not. Along with the buffet items there is sushi and stir fry bar avail at 0 extra cost. The fruit and desert is always fresh and never ""funky"". The reason I will not give 5 stars is due to the attitude of a couple of attendants. They are often angry and make things a bit ""weird"". The second is that unless you take the time to actually print the 15% discount coupon, they are gonna flat refuse to accept it. In a digital age, seems a bit antiquated to have to physically print. Price for two with drinks for lunch is $22. Dinner for two adults and two children on Sat was under $50."
4,"One of the best Italian subs you can get!  

After many years of having the TB&G on my list of must go to places, was able to stop by and get some take out.  Fun to watch the staff of about 4 making the sandwiches. Just get in line and order when it is your turn.  The 26 inch Italian was so tasty with lots of meat and the sweetness of the Italian dressing.   The place was jumping with people in line and all the tables and bar full of people eating one of the great sandwiches."
4,We stop over for a Pulled Pork Taco and look for something else to eat... I had the Kim chee Fries and Beef Bao and shared some snacks with a friend. The prices are reasonable and the food/drinks were really good. Good customer service and good place to go!!! Must try!!!
4,"Nice cozy atmosphere,  with the fun of a loud Italian kitchen bustling open to the dining room. Food was very good for the most part, the pasta dishes were a bit bland, but nothing some of their hot chili oil can't fix. Great place to go for sharing, good portions, reasonable prices."
4,"If I had rated this after my first visit, it would have been a five. And if I were rating only the service and the meat (most important thing in a steakhouse, after all), it would still be a five.

Our first trip was the week it opened. They had transformed the gone-but-not-lamented Bistro Burger by partitioning off most of it (soon to be an Italian joint), and creating a very intimate, relaxing space.  Service was a little reminscent of the Keystone Cops, as a team of them scrambled over one another to wait on everyone, but at least they were erring on the side of overkill. In their enthusiasm, someone forgot to put in the order for my friend's rack of lamb, so they brought her out a complimentary assortment of cold seafood to tide her over while we started eating. They won my loyalty right there. 

As for the food that did arrive: thumbs up to the Edge salad, French onion soup, and I guess to the foie gras, which came on brioche French toast with chopped apples and maple reduction. A nice preparation, but it helps if you like foie gras, which I have decided I don't. (No fault of theirs). The crab cakes are actually made of detectable amounts of lump crab, and come with a tangy,remoulade with just the right amount of citrus.

The chicken and lamb were also both very good, but the star here is the steak. (What kind of a Communist orders chicken anway)? The cheapest beef here is prime grade. A couple of us got the American Wagyu rib cap (divine) and, since we wanted a bite, forced my poor brother-in-law to order the Japanese Wagyu at almost $90 for a small steak and nothin' else - not even a sprig of parsley. 

Normally, I would be having a heart attack just typing that bit of info, but instead, that memory makes me smile. It was literally like buttah - just melted in your mouth. I tried to encourage Babygirl to get one when we returned together, but she loves her filet, so she ordered from the lowly left column (prime grade - $65 for a 12 oz portion), and announced that not only was a knife unnecessary, she barely needed a fork. I know a spoon or a popsicle stick would have served just fine for my 48 hour buffalo short ribs: two hefty chunks of perfectly tender meat on a bed of whipped potatoes with delicious gravy and roasted vegetables (we'll get back to those in a minute).

Most beloved side dishes included the wasabi mashed potatoes (they come in a trio of flavors, you'll just have to man up and eat 'em all), asparagus with burrata and balsamic, cauliflower gratin, baked in I-don't-know-what sauce but it was creamy and cheesy and delicious, and the mushrooms, cooked in wine and topped with what must have been goat cheese because it was too good to have been anything else. 

Dessert, you ask? Well, let me enlighten you. Due to the faux pas with the lamb, our table was delivered an assortment of complimentary desserts, so I happen to have a wealth of information. Creme brulee' was well received, as were the trio of parfaits (I remember chocolate and red velvet. Maybe lemon?). Who cares? The real butt kickers were the cheesecake pops. They come in order of six, two of each flavor, all wonderful. The best is the peanut butter kind- it will put hearts in your cheeks like you've never had. Hint: it's the kind with the sprinkles on the outside, so if you have to share, make sure you hog those. Practice your innocent look.

Service seemed a lot more organized on our return trip; and, the hostess is a sweetheart, the bartender and the manager (maitre d' maybe?) seemed to be in a contest to out charm each other. They both won. All the waiters were pleasant and service was fine. 

So why the missing star? Well, I wish I could give them 4 1/2, and maybe I should have rounded up, BUT, the lobster bisque was disappointing - very thin and watery and not very flavorful. The ""roasted"" vegetables were cut into very small chunks, but didn't show evidence of having gone anywhere near an oven. They were not ""al dente"", they were practically raw.
And nobody liked the tiramisu. 

Now that we know what land mines to avoid, our next trip should be great. But there shouldn't be any land mines."
4,"For years people have been coming to my restaurant telling me how good the subs are here.  Never having any reason to go to Swissvale though, it took me this long to make it.  Overall the sub was very good.  I'd say I've had similarly good subs at a few other places, but the price was right ($16, but could feed 2 big guys or 3 normal people), and they have smaller options as well.  I would have given the place 5 stars, but the place is run poorly.  There were about 10 people in front of me, and I had to wait in line about 30 minutes.  It should not take 30 minutes to make food for 10 people, although they were getting call in orders as well.  I can blow through a line of 20 people in 10 minutes with myself and my employee.  Whoever designed that place was a nut job.  The 3 employees were working hard, and fast, but they have to go over to the cold bar, then over to the grill, then over to the fridge, etc.  Then at the end when they take the money, the register should be right there, but it's against the back wall.  So again, they have to walk over to the register, then walk back to give you your change.  If i ever had a chance to go back, I'd call ahead so I could skip the line.  Definitely worth the trip if you're around Swissvale though."
4,"Great food, service and value!  Large portions.  Honey Walnut Shrimp was the best ever!!!"
4,"Tried this with a group of friends and I was pleasantly surprised.  We had the breakfast burritos, steak/eggs/potatoes, and they very good.  This joint may not look like much but the food is tasty."
4,"Swanky and cool.  Though not pretentious, as the staff here is so warm and welcoming.  

If you are looking for more than just a bar but less than a club, this is the place.  Also, they serve appetizers and light dishes from FIX until 9 pm.  Since they serve food from 5 to 9, there is no smoking during these hours (newish Vegas law).  

Look, ma, I wrote something useful!"
4,They're casual as hell in here and just as friendly.    Isn't that what Waffle House is all about?
4,"Today, I went with a huge group for brunch & I really liked the vibe of this place. There was action everywhere! Kids playing in the corner in a small play area, extended families having breakfast, people sitting in chairs having coffee and reading the paper. It had a steady flow of people the entire time that we were there. 

They have everything listed on the board and you order it and pay for it at the cash. Once it's ready, they bring it to you. There are gluten free options which is still pretty rare in Toronto. They had all sorts of breakfast sandwiches, I had the avocado and cheese on a biscuit. It was filling and delicious. 

My friends who go there on a regular basis due to the kid friendly atmosphere, say that Sunday is super busy and that they has to come early. It was busy and loud with all of the action. If you are hungover, this is not the place for you BUT if you have friends with kids and they want to join you for brunch, this is the place. 

**Always check in on Yelp before ordering! They have a free coffee with your check in. I was sipping on my yummy latte when I checked in and totally missed out. :D ***"
4,"For a quick bite before the movies we came here for their kimchi fries, five spice pork belly bao and grilled pork banh mi. The bao was perfectly fluffy and the pickled carrots/radishes provided a nice sweet and sour pairing to the fatty pork. The Kimchi fries were super flavourful and could have been eaten as a meal on its own. This location was far less hectic than the ones downtown.  There were lots of open seating and the staff was very friendly."
4,"When ever we feel like eating Chinese food, we enjoy eating at this location, we get great services, and the food is tasty."
4,"I went here yesterday for a special event open to the public. It was an art show, I didn't know the artist, but I was invited by a couple of friends. It was really bright when I first entered, but after the show was over it went to a very dim room, similar to that of Downtown Cocktail Room. Plenty of nice couches and one long table in the center, lit up red to reflect the color on to any drink sitting on the table. There is a decent size bar with nice almost ottoman like bar stools. They have a pricey drink menu, specialty drinks at $16.00's and bottles at hundreds of dollars. Also there are some food items such as lobster tacos for $21.00 and a bottle of Evian water a whopping $8.00. I ordered two specialty drinks and so did my friend. We both had the Passion Fruit Mojito, which is a classic mojito with passion fruit which gives it a unique taste. Then I had a Cucumber Essence which contains cucumber of course, and I can't remember the other ingredients, but there were two slices of cucumber in the glass. Then my friend had a Carameltini, which was green and I thought that was my cucumber drink, but no it wasn't. The dj was playing some great pop songs and overall it was a nice, chill environment. I recommend bringing a lot of money with you if you plan to visit, even a budweiser is $9.00. Well worth at least one stop."
4,"I went to this delightful little place with a girl friend, and yummy! I had the Scottish something poutine, she had the nacho-something poutine.

I would definitely given this poutine a perfect score except for one thing: They DO overcook their fries. Toppings are delicious, and I have eaten poutine in both Quebec and Montreal, and this place is pretty authentic. The service was great, atmosphere was quirky, and casual, perfect to eat a load of fries.

Please don't overcook your fries! You have a really good thing going there...Keep it up.

K"
4,"I'd always been curious about this place and finally went last night.

Atmosphere was fantastic; cozy & comforting, eclectic but not overly so furniture and decor. Workable for a romantic date, or a more casual dinner-with-friends, with dripping candles in wine bottles, sitting on crate paper and burlap tablecloths.

Nightly menu full of I-can't-possibly-decide options up on chalkboards. Everything is very simply prepared and presented on a collection of mismatched dinnerware. Looks, feels, tastes, pretty much is, delicious homemade food.

Table bread was surprisingly lackluster, but whatever
Calamari was great
Osso Bucco was good but a little overdone
Lamb shank was very good
Homemade butter tart I will be dreaming about for days

Next time will definitely have to try some pasta dishes."
4,"Came to this location after not eating at any of their locations for a while.

Personally I find the bao's ($3.50-$4.50) are okay but prefer the banh mi sandwiches ($5.50-$7) as they are much more filling and a better value. 
The pulled pork is okay, but their Five Spice Pork Belly is my jam. Legit tasty pork with just the right amount of crispy edging and great flavours.

Despite the size of the line when I was there, I'll say they got through the orders pretty quickly when I stopped in here randomly.  Yet another time when I ordered through the Ritual app it took excessively longer so who know what's up. The place does get busy since there aren't a lot of other good lunch takeout options north of Eglinton.
I'll likely continue to make this an occasional option when in the area."
4,"So I went into Waffle House to get my sweet tea fix- since I live in Arizona good sweet tea like thy make in the south is hard to come by... If you are looking for genuine southern nitty gritty greasy good ol' fashion food-search no longer! Sure the place inside my smell and May not look the cleanest but hey then again all the BEST PLACES have something wrong with them haha 
The PRICE IS JUST RIGHT! 
The service is without a doubt southern hospitality! 
Vicky Woods was so kind enough to give me a FREE WAFFLE coupon for ONE FREE WAFFLE next time comes back"
4,"I'm thoroughly pleased with my first visit! I've been waiting several months for them to open, and now they finally have! Huzzah!

I stopped in today for some take-away. I asked the gal working the counter which one she thought I should try for my first time. She rec'd three, and I went with Notorious P.I.G. Pulled pork, double-smoked bacon, and Italian sausage. Ok, so...yum! She, by the way, was chatting and friendly and wonderful.

The fries were perfectly cooked (namely, well, but a little bit gravy-logged, which I like), the cheese was a little meltier than I would have liked, but blame that on it being take-away and there's not much to do about the encased poutine in the ten minutes it took to get back to the office.

All of the Porky goodness was great. There was a hint of a-little-too-strong vinegar that probably comes from the pulled pork, but wasn't so strong as to adversely affect the overall flavour.

I'll be more than pleased to head back to Big Cheese and sample some of their many, many other poutines! Most likely to be most often at somewhere around 2:00 am. (Forgot to ask how late they're planning to be open. I'd think they'd do late night. I'd HOPE they'd do late night!)"
4,"It took a store to open around the corner to finally try this place.

Food, service, value, ambience: 4.5/5

Repeat: Yes"
4,"Great pizza! Not sure how much of a ""chain"" this place is but I've never heard of it outside of Arizona. This is typically our go-to pizza place. We don't ever order Domino's or Pizza Hut since you can get better quality food here for the same price or less. 

A large pepperoni is usually $11-12.

Their wings are pretty good but theyre heavy with the sauce. Its usually overwhelming and I actually stay away from them now. But they're very large in size which could be a plus for those looking for more for their money. 

Service is great, we order ahead and pick up or even get delivery. The wait time is almost always 45 minutes to an hour."
4,"4 stars for cleanliness and decent food. I wouldn't call it authentic Chinese food, but for the price, it's well worth a visit. You dine on plastic utensils, but at least you don't have to worry about baked on food on your utensils or lipstick stains on your tea cup. The place is always clean, organized and the owner (and her daughter) are usually very nice and friendly.

Lunch plates are served daily (even the weekends) for less than $6 and it comes with soup, egg rolls and entree with rice. You can't beat that!"
4,"I was lucky enough to score a big plate of jambalaya from the Sun City Festival event on Saturday, Nov 12.  The flavors were fabulous and it had just to right amount of kick!  Can't say how delightfully surprising it was to find all the sausage and big hunks of chicken... Quality + quantity= AWESOME!!!!  Run now and find that elusive Jamburrito truck!!!"
4,"Great subs take out place near Yonge and Eglinton. The steam buns and veggies taste average but the meats are very well cooked, such as the five spice pork belly."
4,Fried chicken bao & their banh mi sandwiches are great. Can get a long lineup at lunch but that's to be expected considering the location.
4,"This was one of the first Mexican food places I tried when I first moved to AZ ten years ago.  Back then I knew nothing, now I see that I was lucky to have been taken somewhere that would really get me interested in trying more Mexican restaurants.

Well after about 8 years I went back last night and had it again and I was impressed.  The beans were a little bland but that is about the only complaint I have.  The salsas were fresh and delicious as was the tortilla on my fish burrito. I could have just eaten a couple of the tortillas with the salsa.   My boyfriend got three hard shell beef tacos and it was only $3.49 and it came with chips. So not only was it tasty, it was cheap.  It is close to the freeway so even though I don't live very close I will be going back soon."
4,"What's up with not being able to smoke until 9? Other than that, I liked the place. Well-made drinks, excellent service."
4,"A great place to hang out, play pool, it watch the fight/game. Mind you, on UFC or Game night it's pretty rammed. They have a huge amount of flavors, and they are all pretty good. But if you don't feel like wings, the rest of the menu is quite good too. Also their team pitchers are reason alone to party here."
4,"Decided to give this place a try after reading about it here. 
I went in for take out, but I would totally go back for a sit down. I love the games area and televisions and good mix of music. It was exciting without feeling hectic.
I had Dr. Pepper BBQ wings and fries, and they were really good. Not as strong of a Dr Pepper taste as I was expecting, but still a good flavor. The fries were soggy but that's probably expected when they're take out. 
I thought the cost was a little high ($13.99 for 1lb & fries) but with that said, I did really enjoy my meal. I sampled the lemon pepper boneless wing and it was good enough to make me want to try them next time!
It's too bad this place is kinda tucked away, hopefully it will stick around."
4,"Branched out to the salad world here at Waffle House. Had my second salad there last night and these things are pretty good if your hell bent on staying healthy and Waffle House is your only option. The chicken walnut apple salad was last night's choice and on top of salad mix was a full grilled chicken breast chopped up and walnuts, some apples I believe, dried cranberry and red peppers also. The one salad dressing they include is never enough, so ask for two, but at $7, this salad is a surprise winner and bargain at the House."
4,"Great Italian home cooking.  This place is very packed, and you can only book if you have a party of 6! So we turned up at 6:30 pm!  There was still no table available that is really worth it.  We were seated in a very tiny table, but then what can we say! If it is popular, may be it is worth a try.  The menu changes constantly, it will be up at 5 pm every day.  Apart from the menu, there is a 'Family Menu' of $29, which has a bit of everything, it is a bit like a tasting menu!   The price is very good here.  So as the wine, but of course it is not fine dinning.  I had sardines, duck leg and salad.  The sardine is fresh and with two sauce, one is spicy and one is tomatoes. The 'Sexy Duck Leg' is slightly salty for my taste but it is very tasty. The salad's dressing is just right amount of the vinegar.  My companion had  SPINACHI (Baby spinach salad with Gorgonzola, Strawberries, Walnuts and a Balsamic reduction), a ORECHIETTE as Primi, and the Lamb Shank, it was tasty.  We had the house wine, and it was ok too.  The whole meal comes to under $70, which was very good in Toronto.  I would go back again.  We decided not to have dessert, because it was not made in-house like other food.

Was this Review ??"
4,"My very first poutine in Canada. Awesome.
My friend and I shared the one with steak and cheese. Adding $3 for a larger portion was a nice deal. Very full and satisfied though I expect a bit more steak. If we weren't here at Calgary as a day trip, we are so gonna ry more flavours."
4,"I've been coming here for years, always in the middle of the night because it's across the street from my data center, and I always leave here full and happy. The servers are always friendly and the foods cooked quickly and to order. It's not the best breakfast in town, but it's probably better than you can make at home... and with none of the cleanup work. Waffle House seems to get a bad rep, be it for the food, cleanliness, or servers... but there's nothing bad to write home about here. Give them a try... I'll bet you'll leave happy too!"
4,Great family owned Chinese restaurant at a very affordable price. Highly recommended.
4,"So I was majoring lamenting about what to do in Vegas as it was just me and my boyfriend, and I have really only been to Vegas in big groups for drunken debauchery.  This loungey bar was a great place, though, for my boyfriend and I to get a casual drink with nice music, a good looking crowd, enough room to sit down, and a noise level that still allowed us to talk.  Really casual door policy, they weren't even paying attention as we walked in, and I never got carded.  It was such a relief coming from Hollywood where you have to beg your way into a place when you come with a guy.

DO NOT under any circumstances order water.  My boyfriend did thinking they would give him tap water (silly boy).  The tiny weeny bottled water cost six dollars!  WTF?  My grey goose and tonic cost twelve dollars.  Really ridiculous."
4,"We got the sandwich that has fried chicken and pork in it, was super delicious, probably the best Vietnamese sandwich I ever had. 

The kimchi fries is okay, the fries in it looked blackened and unfresh. It didn't taste that good to me. 

But the sandwiches they have, 100% I recommend!"
4,"LOVED IT! Good music, good (but expensive) drinks. Good place to start the night. Hip looking lounge with some good tunes. What more can you ask for?"
4,"Family style authentic Italian restaurant. I really enjoy 7 numbers having been here a few times now. I personally think it's a great menu for sharing so come with a small group. 

Service and atmosphere were all good. The restaurant is pretty small and has a bit of a rustic type of feeling to it.

Veal meatballs - 5/5 this is my favourite thing on the menu. Super tasty, eat this with the special hot pepper sauce they have. I think it's perfect.

Lamb shank - 3.5/5 a little bland at my most recent visit but still a good dish

Calamari - 4/5 pretty small portion but fresh

Pasta 4/5 I don't recall which of the 3 choices they have we got but you got could taste the fresh ingredients being used"
4,"I absolutely love this restaurant. The service is great and the food is delicious. And because the menu changes every day, you're in for a surprise every time. The portions are the perfect size. This is the go-to restaurant in my neighbourhood when I don't feel like cooking."
4,"My neighbour's Nonna used to spoil us for lunches.  Freshly sauteed rapini with thinly sliced garlic, hearty thick hunter's ragu on top of freshly made linguine... these were my lunches for nearly 3 years and though they were home style and simple, they were decadent and made with love.  As I grew up, I often missed those type of simple Italian meals but lovingly prepared.  Great thing is that I don't have to miss those meals anymore... I can find them here at 7 Numbers!

The spot is a small cozy but loud and warm Osteria type of eating establishment.  Meals are simple but very well executed.  The owners are part of wonderful warm Italian family and you really feel the love when you walk in.  Warm big smiles and loud voices are everywhere.  It's a fun and joyful atmosphere.

I had the antipasti of grilled shrimp to start.  Wow, it was great.  They were perfectly seared and still tender.  No rubbery or mushiness here.  The flavour was wonderful because it was well seasoned and it came with a spicy roasted red pepper sauce.

For my main, I had the duck leg and it was so succulent.  It was nicely seasoned with rosemary and they had the right balance so it didn't overpower the duck flavour.  I also had grilled rapini and zucchini.  This sent me back to my childhood days of my neighbour's Nonna cooking.  Oh it was wonderful.... nicely cooked so it still had some crunch but they took the bitterness out with some citrus (I think).  The prices are so affordable... nothing over $20 and that included the mains!

Overall, it was a great meal.  The service was fast and effortless.  It was clear from looking at the servers that they had some repeat customers.  Those individuals had a lot more personable attention but I didn't feel left out being a first time customer.  Lots of love to go around.  It can get packed quite quickly so try to arrive before 7 pm when it's packed full of people."
4,"I've had 3 things from here after discovering the food trucks on Fridays during my lunch. Li have tried the hush puppies with cajun tartar (always amazing), the catfish bowl, and my favorite, the m fried cajun catfish sandwich w tomatoes, lettuce, cajun tartar, and I forget what else , served on Texas toast. The food is always good and usually the wait isn't too bad. It's about 10$ for whatever I usually get...sandwich and add-on small hush puppies...but it will keep you full for a long time."
4,"Another place I've been going with my family for years. Triangle Bar has huge (26"") battleship subs for very cheap! 

Our favorite is the italian, which is perfectly balanced with salami, ham, cheeses, vegetables, and spices. My father loves the roast beef subs too.

I love that it hasn't changed a bit in the two decades I have been going there. Kind of dirty, barred, on the corner of the street... but excellent food! On game nights you will see a stream of people picking up their subs.

Now you know why."
4,Loved how big this location is compared to the one in Bethany Home. Staff was nice and plenty of games to play. Be careful with the beer selection I got brave and picked a sour beer and it was disgusting. The bat tender was nice and didnt charge me for it. No complains here..
4,"Been here another two times. Regardless of the lineups or the time of day, service is always friendly and helpful. Food is fantastic, especially for the price.

Can't go wrong with anything: To date have tried
5 Spice Pork Bun
Tacos: Pulled Pork, Beef
Bao: Fried Chicken 

Everything is good to very good."
4,"We got really drunk here and my friends were doing booty drops off their bar.  My friend got one of the security to booty drop with her... HAHA...Even though one of the security told us that dancing was prohibited in here, but he started to dance with us?  We got a lot of props for drinking so much Jamie... I guess not many people like Jamie like we do.  What a night to remember, if only we could remember most of it... haha."
4,"Chico's is delicious and in a convenient location! It's by no means gourmet. But hey, if you're in the area and looking for some decent food at a reasonable price, Chico's is the place.

I come here every Tuesday during my class breaks at ASU's downtown campus. I recommend the chicken taco salad :) The shell is crispy and light, filled with creamy refried beans, grilled chicken (sometimes a little too blackened for my taste), lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. They also have a wide variety of fresh salsas at their salsa bar!"
4,"Had a late lunch for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday since he LOVES wings. Ordered 100 wings amongst 4 people, took a bunch home since we couldn't finish. The waitress we had was awesome. She was quick to order our drinks and food when we were ready. She was great at connecting with her customers and didn't make it seem hard or awkward at all. Overall, food was fresh, affordable, came out fairly quick. Because of her amazing customer service she got a great tip and a phone number too lol. First experience was definitely a 5/5 stars. 

Went for the second time, this time for dinner since I had just gotten off work the day after black Friday. Was busy but the wait time was short. We got seated in less than 5 minutes, ordered our drinks and food. This service we had was pretty good, understood the words that we ordered but not actually getting it right. We aren't picky customers so we didn't care that much. We enjoyed our meal even if it was very busy. Busy or not, servers were quick and so were the food. But because of the misunderstanding of our orders, the second visit was a 3.5/5 starts. 

Overall, this is definitely my place for wings! Love it here!!"
4,"Let's get this out of the way... As mentioned above, this is a take out joint primarily.  If you reviewed on the ambiance or waiting service, its the equivalence of rating a hot dog stand for its lack of decor or comfy upscale seating.  If you are this type of reviewer, please step away from your computer.  Understanding this is mainly a takeout/delivery place is common sense.  There are almost no tables, no sign to either wait to be seated or to seat yourself, and no reception area whatsoever.  There is a waiting bench right by the cashier and you can clearly see tons of takeout bags and boxes being prepped on the counter.

As far as takeout and delivery service goes, they are excellent.  They always get the order right, including special instructions, and now you can order from them online.  Everything is well wrapped or contained neatly and perfect for carryout.  Soups are in sturdy plastic containers and they do not scrimp on size, or give less because they do not have a large enough container.  Large orders are placed in sturdy boxes.  Everything is  prepped well for the travel and upkeep of the food, and even reheat.  They don't go cheap in this area, even their napkins are nice and thick good napkins.

Little Dumpling also excels in terms of price and value.  They tend to be cheaper then your regular Thai places like Siri or Pin Kaow, and as cheap or cheaper than a Panda Express.  Yet you get a lot more not just with volume but where it counts.  When I order a meat dish, there is tons of meat, not filled with oversized chunks of onion or a disproportionate amount of baby corn or bamboo shoot and other filler.  When i order a shrimp soup from other Thai places Im usually hoarding the shrimp, saving it because there are only 5.  At Little Dumpling I am never for more meat or key ingredients like mushrooms.  The portions are also huge.  A takeout order of Pad See Ewe can easily feed 4 (if you are also ordering something else family style) and have leftovers.

For a divey takeout place like this, I might give it 5 stars  given everything I've stated so far. (context, I judge according to what it is supposed to be).  What keeps this place from being stellar is that the food is hit or miss.  Almost all the typical chinese lunch specials like Orange Chicken are good, especially the ones centered around meat (like the former) but other standouts are Lemon Chicken, Orange Beef and Beef with Broccoli.  The beef is usually good, not the poor quality small grey chewy scraps you find at other chinese places.  The beef is usually cooked well, really good sized pieces and good quality.  Im not talking about a Morton's cut, Im speaking comparatively.  The broccoli is usually cooked just right as well with just enough crisp but not crunchy, soggy or greasy.

All the meat centered Chinese dishes are great as mentioned.  Surprisingly, the best dishes are some of the Thai ones.  The Pad See Ewe is great, just the right ratio of noodles to egg to beef and veggies.  They also make it a little spicy if wanted, without losing its flavor to the heat.  My favorite dish here is the Tom Yum Kung soup.  It's swampier than I've had from Thai restaurants, but every ingredient comes bursting through.  You can really taste the lemongrass, tomato, and spices all meld together beautifully in their soup.  I've tried many other thai places, and no Tom Yum Kung comes even close to comparing.  Almost all have only 5 shrimp, and microscopic ones at that, cheap small mushrooms, with an overpowering sour taste and little of other flavors coming through.

Some of the dishes can sometimes be just as greasy as Panda Express.  Ironically their fried dumplings are nothing special, but fine.  And steer clear of their Japanese dishes, like Teriyaki bowl - I don't know why you would order that from places like this anyways, and if you are that person, you probably don't listen to reviews and tips anyways"
4,"Basically you choose from steamed bun, sandwich bread, or tacos.  You then get beef,pork or chicken in them.  They always put pickled vegetables in them and some of them have kimchee.  
I got the steamed bao with the five spiced pork.  It was really good.  I liked the picked vegetables and the pork is a round piece of meat and really tasty.  It was really cheap($3.75).  
We also got the beef with taco($4).  It's not like the Mexican burrito wraps.  It's much thinner and tasted much better.  The beef was tasty and they put kimchee on all their tacos so if you don't like kimchee, make sure you tell them not to include them.  Even their mild was quite spicy.  Overall, the food was good and cheap.  We were not that hungry so after 1 of each we were full.  This place is cheaper than McDonalds or even the hot dog stand outside and the food is really good.  This is a nice introduction to Korean food for most people in this area.  Not sure if they can survive paying the rent in this area at their prices."
4,"Honestly this place is around where I work, so its kind of the last minute ""oh crap, who's supposed to buy lunch?"" type of days, this place is it!  Little Dumpling is pretty much it (hey, it sure as heck beats the typical fast food, burger type of joints)

They have great lunch specials, take out, delivery...Various items on the menu..thai and chinese mostly.

Their Thai Tea isnt bad, its good on a summer day! Dont get me wrong starbucks is around the corner, but I'd rather pay $2 for a big cup of tea vs $2 for a grande (and I love starbucks!). Its nice to know that good chinese place is around the corner from work"
4,"I will say this, i  haven't had a bad experience here in the many times I have attended and I will give you a tip...if you are going on a Friday and think you will sit at the bar, be forewarned,  you probably won't. The place is full of regulars who arrive an hour early , at least, just to get a seat at the bar and they know each other so they are watching and waiting for seats to open. It is a great crew,  a family really,  and fun if you can be so lucky to be a guest with a regular. Go anyway, but be ready to wait regardless,  it's busy and delicious!"
4,Good solid place for comfort food.   Garlic rolls are amazing. I had the Reuben.  Good flavor but only on the good side of average.   My wife had a cheese burger and said it was very good. Family friendly atmosphere in the restaurant and a fun atmosphere at the bar.
4,"If you can look past the novelty of this place, it's good.  Definitely, the right size and good music.  

After you've been to the mega clubs, a place like Caramel is refreshing.  It's small and chill."
4,"I finally tried this place, and tasted the pork belly bao, fried chicken bao, kalbi beef taco and pulled pork taco. Loved everything except the chicken. It was really crispy and tasty, but the texture of the meat really reminded me of frozen chicken fingers, like you'd get in a box at the grocery store. If you're like me and really put off by that texture, I'd pass on this one. Everything else was amazing. Will definitely go back to try the kimchi fries."
4,"This place is one of those hidden gems in the city. Giant sandwiches with competitive prices. I had a cheesesteak sandwich, which is one of my favorites. They are cash only, which I respect but be ready as it cost me 2.50 plus 3.00 bank fee to get money out. The place itself is very bare bones blue collar, which is perfect for a neighborhood sandwich shop. They also sell 40s there. I look forward to coming back to try and take down the battleship sandwich."
4,"This place is different than any other Italian restaurant I've eaten at in the city. You walk in and the place is tiny, dimly lit with only candle light. It was packed when we were there on a Sunday night, but not uncomfortable at all. 

The main chef is this nice Italian lady, who is very sweet and friendly.

Now as for the food, the menu changes daily, and is written on a giant chalk board at the back of the restaurant. This proves that the ingredients are very fresh (which is probably why the food is so tasty!) but be careful not to become to attached to certain dishes, as the next day they may be gone.

The pasta dishes were great, as well as the calamari and meatballs (which were a little salty, but still good.) The steak was absolutely incredible, very large, and was $15 if you could believe!
I went with 6 people and we ordered a bunch of dishes for all of us to share, which worked out quite well.

I'm not too big on desserts anywhere, but we ordered everything off the dessert menu, and everything was great. 

This is a traditional Italian restaurant, and the menu isn't huge, but as I said everything we ordered tasted great, and I really liked the atmosphere. Wold recommend to anyone who likes authentic Italian."
4,"When I procrastinate on scheduling my next gel mani at my regular nail salon, I end up needing to find a place ASAP when I can't get in with my nail girl. 

When my nails were looking horrid and I had peeled off some of the gel (eek, so bad!), MD Nail Spa was a great spot to get in for a quick appointment to take care of them! 

It's a cute and clean salon with sweet staff that offers not just loads of gel color selections, but loads of regular polish colors too choose from on their walls of polish. The gel manicure turned out nice, but the cuticle trimming was not done well. I still had dry and hard areas of cuticle that should have been trimmed.

I opted for the next level of pedicure ($35) versus the standard $25 classic pedicure. The $35 pedi includes hot stone, hot towel and massage. 

Oh. Em. Gee. So worth the extra $10 if Vinny does your pedi! He gave the best ever pedi massage! Great pressure and it was forever long, must have been at least a 15-minute massage! 

And the nicest feature MD Nail Spa has is their late hours. I love how they're open until 11pm six days of the week!"
4,"Vegetarians: For me, it was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable lo mein and the Ma Po To Fu. Both were pretty good. It wasn't the best thing I ever ate, but I would definitely get the Veggie Lo Mein again. 

Meat-Eaters: My boyfriend got the orange chicken and the teryaki chicken. He liked the teryaki chicken. He said it was the BEST orange chicken he's ever eaten. He loves spicy food and he said the chicken tasted orange-y AND spicy. 

Our meals were served quickly, with smiles, AND with free fried wontons and (vegetarian :D ) egg rolls, with very yummy sweet and sour sauce!

The food is inexpensive. We ordered 4 entrées and it came to around $30. They serve food on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils, which I don't mind. You can either dine in, take out, or have delivery.

It is a small family-owned hole in the wall place. Turn into the Starbucks parking lot and it will be at the very end.

Overall, I am quite satisfied."
4,"I have stayed at many Embassy Suites in the past, so I was expecting the same quality from the one in Charlotte. 

After been stuck in traffic, I was so glad that my companion already checked into the room. When I walked into the lobby, I noticed that it was extremely beautiful and there was foliage everywhere. I felt like I was in a peaceful rain forest. I adore the glass elevators because it was nice to see the nice atrium as I was going to the sixth floor. 

I was welcomed with a spacious area with a table for work, sofa/bed, tv, refrigerator, and coffeemaker. The bathroom was spacious and clean, but the bedroom was everything. The bed was so comfortable (thankfully) because I spent a lot of time resting. 

The morning buffet was simply ok. No real complaints because it was free. My companion ordered an omelette, but the center was cold. Yuck! At least there were other items to choose from. 

The hotel is far out, so if you aren't driving, the options are limited for food and entertainment.

I wasn't pleased about the fact that there wasn't free wi-fi. I was pissed because I had so much work to do. 

Because of the proximity from the rest of Charlotte, I am not sure if I would stay here again."
4,I love me some Waffle House. This location was very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. It took a while to get my order. The food was great though. Can't wait to try more of the menu.
4,This place is legit fancy! They have decent prices and they are open late during the week. I felt super relaxed here and that's always a plus. They have different pedi options and I opted for the $35 pedi which included hot stone massage and hot towels along with dead skin removal. I would definitely come here again for a pedi. They opened just a few months ago so they do have happy hour specials. The interior is really cute and the overall vibe is nice. They also do stamp cards!
4,"The food is very good, but can be a bit expensive compared to some other places for certain dishes. Their drinks are also pretty pricey and I had a special mixed drink that they had... It was awful. But my friend got a different mixed drink that was blue(some drink that was a seasonal special) and it was ok. The atmosphere is very nice, I love the patio... Even when it's cold because of the fire. They also have a birthday wheel, so that is a fun bonus for a celebration! I would suggest the NPL!"
4,"I've been around Quebec and eastern Ontario so i've had my fair share of poutine! I found the poutine here to be great, but not outstanding.

Fries: Very tasty. The potatoes used have a good flavour and the cut is great. Solid

Gravy: Pretty solid too. I had the peppercorn gravy and it had a nice flavor. I also tried the Scottish curry and that was great.

Curds: Not that great. They were pretty melted and too soft. They didn't have that fresh ""squish"" to them, although you don't always get that for every single curd. But usually when I get great poutine (say at La Banquise in Montreal), the curds are much more solid. 

Service: Exceptionally friendly. They let me try the gravies before I decided and even re-filled my water! You can tell that the employees take pride in what they do and are just friendly in general.

For poutine i'd say this is a solid bet, but if you've been to, say, rural Quebec and had poutine there, then don't expect this to beat it out. But if you're used to most of the poutine you get on the prairies (shitty fries and shredded mozza cheese) then you will probably have your mind blown here."
4,"I've been here a few times and my most recent visit here was to bring my out of town family for a taste of Canadian fare. I had the beef donair Poutine and was very satisfied with my choice. 

Starting with the fries, they were the home cut style fry, which is probably one of the best cuts for a Poutine. They were crisp and still had substance on the inside. The seasoned beef and onions were delicious and had a hint of the sweet sauce flavour that a donair ought to have. All around a delicious helping where the small size is good for two. 

I will definitely have to come back here to try more of the flavour combinations. Definitely a great late night after bar snack as well!"
4,Love this place.... Food is fresh. Restaurant is clean and the wait staff (Mary) is great. Love love love the crab legs and the various dishes available.  Good bang for the buck.
4,3.5/5! Cute homely resto with very affordable family style meal :) the pasta is fresh and the meatballs are very well seasoned. My favourite was definitely the calamari
4,"After ordering from another restaurant a week ago that was completely void of flavor, I decided to try LD. I was pleasantly suprised. I had the food delivered and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The food was good, sauces were on the side so the Lemon Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork were not soggy and the Wonton Soup was huge and good.

I'll definately order again!"
4,"A relatively new discovery, mmmmmmmmmmm! I thought it was like a Rubio's or something...it just never stood out to me. Neither did the Starbucks. No idea it was there for months and months even though I knew there was an Einstein's (Which I've never been to). Anyway, I went for the second time yesterday and got the Huevos Mexicanos burrito...best 1:30pm on a Saturday breakfast burrito I've had! It was about $4? They are $1.99 on weekday mornings. It was so messy and dripping with every salsa known to man that is offered at the salsa bar. It didn't taste like greasy chemicals à la any-berto's. The place is clean and cheap. The veggie burrito is really good too and everything comes with chips. The murals stretched on the walls make you feel like you're on vacation. And if I ever went on vacation, 
I would miss Chico's! 
Mi amor! 
Try it! 
Por favor!"
4,"I don't eat Chinese/Thai food the way it is traditionally prepared, I get steamed meat and vegetables with no added flavoring. A fairly simple dish but it is surprising how many restaurants cannot get it right. Well, this place did. The meat to veg ratio was more then fair. It was fresh and hot. I did get it paired with brown rice which was a little soggy but still very edible. I also like that this place packs the food to go in traditional Chinese/Thai food paper containers and NOT that irritating styrofoam!  Staff is friendly and orders are completed rather quickly. Inside the restaurant was clean but you cannot see any part of the kitchen from the order counter so I can't speak for the kitchen or its employees working back there."
4,The service at this Barros is great. We have always gotten our food real fast and it is always fresh. The Barros special pizza is the best. The wings are always great. They have TVs going to keep you entertained. I also like how they have a separate kids area so there are not tons of rugrats running around. They also have awesome lunch specials where you can get pizza by the slice and a drink for super cheap.
4,"This place was pretty tasty, especially because my chorizo breakfast burrito was only $3.99. 

This place isn't the most fancy, but it was clean and the food seemed to be made with good quality ingredients."
4,"My endless quest for righteous food truck grubble has collided headfirst with my search for great Cajun food! I first sampled some of Jamburritos offerings at the 2010 Great Cajun Cook-Off and Food Fest and was thrilled to find out that they would soon launch their food truck in the Phoenix Metro Area.

A mission was hatched to track down this mysterious Mexican-Cajun fusion food truck for a Friday lunch treat. I tried to plan ahead and noted their posted location on their website as a Ford dealership on Camelback. I talked this outing up quite a bit amongst my co-workers to prepare them for our Friday lunch field trip. However, when I checked their website on the day of our food truck picnic, they had changed locations to the Phoenix Public Market food court (on Central Ave & Pierce St). This was actually great news... since it was within walking distance from work!

I ordered the signature Jamburrito (jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla, burrito-style), but with Cajun-spiced beefsteak instead of chicken (which is traditionally included in jambalaya). The portions were fairly enormous and filling. I found my jamburrito to be a bit oily and salty, but it was still damn good! They offered a selection of Louisiana hot sauces to zip up your dish... but it is plenty spicy without it. I am a bit of a hot sauce freak, so I borrowed one of their condiment bottles for our table and added it dropwise to nearly every bite.

My co-workers were pleased with my lunchtime suggestion. We topped off this indulgence with another... a Crème Brûlée from the Torched Goodness truck--but that is for another review. I'm looking forward to more Food Truck Fridays at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market, and I hope that Jamburritos continues to be part of this exciting new Phoenix food trend!"
4,"Super nice folks at check in & at the restaurant. Updated hotel & rooms. Close to Starbucks, downtown & restaurants...

We booked the premium room which came LOADED with snacks and candy for the kiddos. 

I would mark 3 stars if everything else wasn't so great due to the noise. Walls seemed SUPER thin. We could hear everything outside and in the halls. We were on vacation with kids so we are pretty understanding - it was a bit more than we could handle tho."
4,"Like a time warp back to the college days: with coeds crawling over booths, late night boozing til morning, recuperating with Waffle House and one arm around a friend at a 70s style booth.

Slunk over to Waffle House with Faster Pussycat after their Club Red show. Waitresses were friendly enough, a little bit of that coarse ""what can I do ya for"" attitude that we all know and love. Food came out fast, and hot, too! Not a single complaint from anyone.

There's absolutely nothing better than the memories you'll make at 3am with close friends at a Waffle House filled to the gills with happy-go-lucky drunks."
4,"Good place to grab a coffee with the kids who love the train table.

Had a carrot soup that was great, chili only so-so. All baked goods to date have been really yummy. Expensive compared to Coffee Time and New Town, but really, what the heck is there to compare?

Kudos to the owner for stealing my idea! (I kept fantasizing about opening something here because the hood has changed so much). Glad she's done it so well...hope this will be the start of ""Leslieville north"" (now if the Beaches could only open a few NON wing and nacho type restaurants...)"
4,Neighborhood bar/restaurant with plenty of comfortable seating.  The servers are good and so is the food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Try the fish sandwich (it's gigantic!).  Moderately priced.  You can't go wrong here.
4,This was our first time staying here and were very pleased. The staff was really friendly and our room was spacious and very clean. The AM complimentary breakfast was also very good and once again a super friendly staff.
4,"Jamburritos was kind enough to come to our apartment complex and serve our residents. 
 As a vegetarian I was thrilled to try their veggie bowl and I was Not disappointed! I could smell the truck before I saw it- it was making my mouth water! 
The bowl was $8 and when I picked it up I thought it was a little small but when I started eating it I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food. :)
 They even gave me a little spicy sauce on the side and I poured it all over my bowl. Perfectly spicy, but not too hot as to overpower the flavor of the cabbage, beans and rice. 
I am so glad I tried it! Wish id gotten the hush puppies for $2 more! Hopefully they come back and ill have a second chance! 
Yay!"
4,"Saw Clint Holmes and Earl Turner show....so vibrant....then dinner here...best French Onion soup in town....Wagu steak was 
Perfection...coupled with Prisoner wine...yum"
4,"The lunch specials are great here! I had the ""Pineapple Chicken"" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The ""Egg Drop Soup"" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free ""Egg Rolls"" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. 

I was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some ""Fried Wontons"" with our food that I didn't order. I have no idea what was in them, but they were greasy and good! Everybody enjoyed them so it was a nice and unexpected bonus!

They deliver and lunch specials are from 11am - 4 pm."
4,"Located inside of Bellagio so of course this is not a jeans and t-shirt place.  It is classy and small.  They do need to do more things to bring more of a crowd in, besides their usual herding of the women with free drinks at night, hoping to draw the men in.  

Usually, when you do go and have a drink there or two, they will give you a free entrance bracelet to the nightclub The Bank.

All in all, it is a great cozy place to go to, when you want to meet your friends for a drink and chat, before you head out to a loud, noisy bar/club and won't be able to hear what anyone has to say."
4,"cajun breakfast burrito! perfect combo of spicy andouille, eggs, cheese.... and other things that i can't think of.... and yummy salsa. SO GOOD. the perfect companion on a brisk saturday morning at the downtown farmer's market."
4,"Ok guys. I ate at the 7 numbers again, just yesterday. What an amazing place... we were 4 people and we ate and ate... and the bill was 130$ for all (including 3 course.. and drinks). most of the plates are about 10$, they arent too big but very tasty. the hospitality is amazing. i would give them 5 stars.. but we needed to stand in line, although we had a reservation. 

on thing to remember: those guys has 2 restaurats. one on the Danforth and one on Eglinton/Avenue (very near to their first location which was closed few years ago). enjoy"
4,"Had a great time here.  Very low-key, intimate and great R&B 90s hits.  Some would argue there was no dance floor, but we danced some salsa and no one seemed to mind.  Drinks are average Vegas prices.  

Here, jack and coke.  In retrospect, I would have a Balvanie neat."
4,"I'm giving this place 4 stars because the waitress was super nice, and the waffles are awesome!

The place is kinda shady, doesn't accept bills over $20  after 2pm..lol...

atmosphere is nice, and food come out fast! 

My friend had the BLT, and he said it was good.  I had the blueberry waffle and it was fantastic!"
4,"Let's just say, if Jamburritos had a creepy song that played loudly from their truck and cruised around residential areas on the regular, I'd be running barefoot down the street with my mom's change purse in hand. 

Honestly, who would even mourn the demise of the ice cream truck with the evolution of the Creolexican truck? 

P.S. If you had the nerve to say, ""me""... Well, I couldn't even hear you over the pleasant crunching of my Jamburritos hushpuppies anyway."
4,"Some of the best pizza in town! Great crust and great marinara sauce. The wings are very average. Good wing sauces, but under baked for wings."
4,"This appears to be the largest of the Whining Pig locations but still pretty tight, and a bit lighter than the one on Indian School, which is nice. Same set up with table games available, great beer selection, and a happy hour that runs until 8:00! Limited food available, mainly assorted grilled cheese sandwiches. It can get crowded and it is VERY loud. At times it is hard to get the bartenders attention and can take some waiting to check out. I like the Whining Pig, but it was so loud this outing that we could hardly hear across our table, so we ended up leaving after one beer.  Definitely will continue to frequent the various locations, but do wish the venue was a bit more spacious."
4,We've eaten here on many occasions and have always had a good meal.  The variety is good and the food is fresh.  We eat primarily around lunch and there is always a good crowd and turnover of food in the buffet.  The wait staff is also very friendly and attentive.  We've eaten at many chinese buffets in the area and this is one of the nicer and consistent ones.
4,"We went here a few wks ago and decided to try the Thai this time around.  my bf ordered the Beef Spicy Pad Thai and he liked it - finished it off. I went with the Pad See Ewe (beef) .. delicious. spicy and good. Yes I had leftovers even with my bf and mom picking from my plate. It was great. It was exactly what I wanted. but mostly more noodles than meat. 
My mom ordered the Kung Pao Triple. Shrimp, chicken, beeF, it sounded good but when it came it didnt look as appealing as it sounded on the menu. My mom enjoyed it. If we had thought about it we should have went with one of the FAMILY DINNERS... they have 3 options.. NXT TIME WE KNOW! our total was almost $40 for the 3 of us... and this is a mom and pop type place.. doesnt feel like a chain eventhough there are 2 in town. I think the family dinners sound like a better bargain considering it so easy to rack up a bigger bill than if you just ordere dthe Family dinner option and it has many things to try. 
I like this place, I'll admit is my go-to chinese/thai place in Henderson."
4,"Didn't know what to expect coming here, but gotta say I left very full and very happy. 

We ordered to share:
- Calamari (delicious! loved it)
- Grilled shrimp with spicy pea purée (meh, would pass on this next time)
- Burrata (delicious as well and good to share)

For my main, I ordered the fish of the day, which was a well-cooked, simple yet very tasty sea bass. My fellow diners ordered the meatballs (heavenly! really they are great and taste like meatballs I've never had before), the veal lasagna (he said it was great) and lamb chops (also good feedback).

We ordered the flourless chocolate cake for dessert which was nice.

Overall, very simple preparations but clearly the way it's cooked really makes each dish shine. Would come back again for sure! 

Also major points for the service - our waiter was very friendly and fun."
4,"This place is massive. It has an arcade and about 15 pool tables. TV's everywhere. A bar area and dining area. It has huge screens and plenty of parking in the front. There are over 100 flavors of wings and they are a pretty decent size and extremely tasty. I had their 5oz Sirloin Burger with Swiss Cheese and it was absolutely delicious. They serve hot dogs, poutine, wings, and salads etc. 

All you can eat wing nights every Wednesday for $16.99 is a pretty good deal if you are super hungry and craving a wing buffet.  The service here is medicore at best. Do not come here expecting great service....come here for the food and the pool tables. Great place to watch sports in Mississauga area."
4,"Very nice place, we were there at closing time, and instead of rushing us out, the barrista was very nice.
We ordered 2 iced mocha coffees, they were really good, I would have ordered another because it was so hot out, but they were closing up.
Nice looking place too."
4,"I can't speak on the oil changes but the reviews seem scary....what I can comment on is the car wash, I've personally had my car done 3 time for the $15 dollar wash and it looks good, it's what a $15 wash is suppose to be. My mother came to town about 2 weeks ago and drove from Utah so her car was nicely bugged up and her vehicle is also the dog hauler (3 dogs). I find the CRV to be disgusting most of the time......granted after a brief negotiation she paid $400 for a total once over. OK I choked when she agreed to this, they kept the car most of the day and I have to tell you is was amazing, looked like it did when she took if off the lot. I honestly think $400 was 2 expensive but they did do a really great job and it should be noted."
4,"The food is really good here. It's faster to go in and order the food than get delivery, however it is nice that they have delivery. I try to plan ahead if I do delivery and order it before I know I'll be hungry. I always order the Orange Chicken, Lemon Chicken or their Sweet and Sour. You can't really go wrong with the food here."
4,"I was skeptical about having dinner here and spending the money with all the other restaurants on the strip. Not going to lie this was not our first choice but with everyone trying the hotel for the first time and to book a party of 13 @the last minute was not available.

Food was good! I ordered the lemon and herb chicken dish. It was good. The sauce it came with was very good. It was a dark sauce. My dish came in plated nice with mini onions, vegetables and chicken placed over creamy mashed potatoes with their sauce.
Good side dish.  One of the bigger ones. 
I would go there again for that dish.

I heard the spicy shrimp appetizer was good and there cheese cake pops were good.

We did have the private room which held 13 of us. The room had a long table and the wall was clear glass holding hundreds of wine bottles. 

For the petite steak with garlic mash potatoes and lemon and herb chicken and a beer and specialty drink our total was about $130.

Cocktails were about $16 & beers $6-10
Wine by the glass and by the bottle. If you want more than two glasses price was by the bottle.

Side dishes included items such as a lobster risotto, truffle mac and cheese. Wedge salads, shrimp. 

Mojitos were made well and they made drinks such as Moscow mule. Look it up.
I would go back. Surprised me. 

Fyi they close early at 10pm. Downfall.
They should also advertise in more higher end ads."
4,"When you walk into this restaurant, you are immediately greeted by the kitchen area.  You can see everything they're doing, and it's completely open to the restaurant.  I'm a fan of this style as it always shows that the kitchen has nothing to hide!  

One thing that I found lacking was the service - we were ""led"" to our table soon after arriving, but it really wasn't completely clear where we were supposed to sit.  He grabbed something off the table, then walked away, leaving us unsure whether we should sit there or follow him.  We chose to sat, and it seemed to be the right choice.  We were given iPad menus which was surprising, and especially surprising when we realized that they didn't contain the actual food menu.  Only the drinks were on the iPad, and the food was written on chalkboards on the walls.  Both are great ways to present a menu, but I really don't think they complement each other when used in conjunction.  One or the other I think, or chalkboard and a paper drinks menu.  

We made our selections though: a beer, a glass of red wine, an order of calamari, veal lasagna, and lamb shank.  The red wine was served in a small tumbler, which again was a surprise.  I admit that it took away from the effect for me.  I order a glass of red to enhance the dining experience, and to have it served in a glass I'd drink orange juice out of felt strange.  

The food though - was fantastic.  The calamari wasn't battered, it had a lovely light flavour to it, and it was cooked to perfection.  I loved it.  My lamb was also delicious, again the flavours were amazing.  My partner's lasagna was very tasty, although the veal and the sauce made it very rich.  

You could easily spend a lot here on different courses, but you could just as easily enjoy a very reasonably priced entrée and a side - both of our meals were plenty for us.  I definitely think this restaurant is more of a $$ or $$$ rather than $$$$.  

All in all, although the service could improve as could some of the smaller details that contribute to the experience, the food is bang on.  I'm very excited that the sister restaurant is close to my new apartment!  I'm sure to become a regular if it's as good as this one."
4,"Good food, Great service, awesome full bar, always have a great time at this place, the little bit of a wait on the weekend is worth it,, one server name Eric does a fantastic job, we recommend you sit in his section, we've always had a good meal good drinks fantastic time here,, I recommend this place to everyone."
4,"The problem with Vegas is that you go to bed and wake up so late you have breakfast at noon, lunch at 5 pm and dinner at 10. This means that when 5:30 rolled around and Nick and I were playing Black Jack at the Bellagio, my stomach said it was time to eat. (Yes, we do a lot of gambling in Vegas. That's what we're there for.) After looking at all the options near us we went with Caramel for one reason and one reason only. Their menu said ""fried mac and cheese.""

Being the mac and cheese connoisseur that I am I had to try it. Now, all of the fried mac I've had before comes in these little triangles. Well, here they make it in a large, thick stick-like thing. And they serve it with some sort of cheesey sauce that may or may not be illegal in other states.

Beyond this heavenly eating experience we also had some damn good Kobe sliders, fries and a Caesar salad. To top it all off I had a drink called Strawberry Shortcake that was the dangerous variety where they taste so good you drink 4 and find yourself unable to see clearly unless you close one eye.

Since this is technically a club they only serve food from 5 until 9, but I believe Fix in the Bellagio has all of these things on their menu, as that is the actual restaurant. They also have a strictly enforced dress code starting at 9. They almost didn't let Coach in at 5 because he was wearing flip-flops, even though he had a collared shirt."
4,"We went on a Saturday night and the place was pretty full. They had everything you would expect to see at a Chinese buffet. I only had the sushi, but it was really good. The crab legs were just ok; definitely not fresh, but not terrible. I did notice a couple of empty trays, but I also noticed that the servers were bringing out new trays all the time.  Service is quick and polite. Desserts were awesome. It was a little loud, but not obnoxious. I will be going back :)"
4,"I've been to wacky wings probably close to 25 times over the past few years. Which is why I never reviewed them previously because every visit is different.

This is the ""go to"" place in Mississauga. It's been described to me as much from multiple friends.
This place was once a Woody Woodchucks so some of the wood decor remains the same. There is a small arcade for the kids and pool tables for the adults.

There's big screens, little screens, beer, sports and the place is huge.
The menu is constantly changing with bigger and better options.

I've had excellent service, mediocre service, and servers that completely ignore us.
The latter hasn't happened in a while.

I like the food here, as I said there's always lot's to choose from. However I hate it when they discontinue items I really enjoy from the menu.

Overall this place is pretty decent, it's great place to catch up with friends, enjoy some wings and have a nice night out."
4,"We went there for an early dinner on Sunday with kids. The service was great. The lasagna was exceptional. One of my sons had meatballs, delicious! As desert we had flourless chocolate cake. It was very rich and satisfying. We loved it. Food is very family friendly."
4,"So I received a coupon while walking around the strip somewhere and hey after sorting all the call girl porn do me for 25 bucks base ball card stack I said ""hey lets go to the caramel lounge, and I have a coupon"". Place was very nice, music was good which was very surprising. kudos to Nicole (who later mailed a thank you card for stopping by the lounge) for wearing those heels all night! Her service was great, the drinks were good and of course a loud bride walked in every now and then...but overall I would defiantly go back!   

TIP: Hey I know there is always someone passing out some kind of card (s) in the hotels or strip, you never know it could be! maybe a possible  buy one get one free drink! or continue to be cheap and play the nickel machines for 2 hours and wait for an old peg bundy casino chick to give you a watered down drink!"
4,Honestly I love going to this buffet especially during lunch. They have this coconut cream shrimp that i love and jalapeno chicken. My go-to's! Service is usually good with exception of one lady who always seems to have a sour look on her face. Lol but other than that really like this place.
4,"Lazy Daisy's serves up Te Aro Coffee as well as delicious sandwiches and baked goods in the Gerrard/Coxwelll area.  I love the space, which has high ceilings and lots of tables.  It's definitely a family-oriented space with a play area in the back for young kids!

I had a cappuccino and salted caramel brownie.  Both were really good, but can't say excellent.  I wish the cappuccino foam was frothier and hence the drink smooth.  The caramel was lost in the brownie, but I did love the salt!  

I've had their sandwiches before as well and they were very tasty from what I recall!  A great place to hang-out, grab a bite and chill-out."
4,"Writing this as a vegetarian:

Place is nice and has a good selection of veggie items on the menu. Been here a few times. If you like hot sauce, it's nice they let you put pay a little extra and try a few.

Their veggie burger is good,and their apps are good too. The people I went with who ate their chicken liked it as well."
4,"Let me just say... I love food trucks! Coming from SF, it is food truck galore there.

So I wanted to try something different here. Someone recommended jamburritos. Ironically enough, I did NOT get the burrito because I've seen my share of korean burritos, indian burritso, etc so I wanted to try something else and plus sometimes the tortilla is just eh and I just like the filling inside a burrito better. :)



So I got the jambalaya chicken bowl. My initial bite - ehh it's kinda salty. I ate some more and I love the spices to it. I love the kick of spiciness and the sauce that comes with it has tomato flavor and spiciness to it. Overall, it was good. LOTS of meat, I am glad there was a good proportion of rice and meat.The cheese was piled on top of it and I am not sure if it would have matter if there was cheese or not for me because I think the rice, chicken and sausage with the seasoning and sauce is good enough for me!  I love cajun food and this is good cajun food! 

I would probably go back and try their catfish since it seems so popular.

Also, the guy at the truck is incredibly friendly and nice. He does try to upsell though."
4,Quick friendly service. Very good food. Great soups.
4,"We came here for our last summerlicious dinner and it definitely did not disappoint. Great value for the price and the food and service were fantastic. The restaurant itself has a nice cozy feel and you can see Rosa cooking away in the front. They had a beer on their menu which I've never seen anywhere else called Sweetwater and if you like a nice light beer to have with an appetizer, this is a good pick. 
Three of us ordered off the summerlicious menu and the other 2 couldn't help themselves and ordered off the regular menu. The prosciutto salad looked amazing! The meat was lean, and the salad was extremely tasty. Another person had the grilled shrimp with spicy pea puree, and that was also tasty. I had the veal meatball filled with cheese. It was a giant meatball that was so so good. For the mains, one person had the best osso bucco that she's ever had, another had a lamb shank which was also delicious. Two others had lasagna which didn't disappoint and I had the Orechiette which was so flavourful and delicious. We all had the same dessert which was the apple crumble cheesecake. I had to share mine because I was stuffed. All around delicious.
I'm looking forward to holding my wedding rehearsal dinner here. I know they won't disappoint!"
4,"Delicious food, go for the breakfast! If you ask for the hash browns extra crispy they are CRISPY!!!"
4,"Yes, you should visit this restaurant. I used to eat in this restaurant when It was based on Eglinton/Avenue. The food was great back then. Now, when they moved to the Danforth (few years ago), they are still making an amazing food. very very casual dining. very reasonable prices. go for it., you will like the food and the casual service."
4,"Honestly, we came here before seeing the reviews. When I pulled up the reviews I was pretty worried. We purchased the synthetic oil change and got the premium car wash. Though I can't tell how the oil change is the car wash was fine. Nothing spectacular, we had to ask them to put the antenna back on, hand prints on the doors, but it was good enough.  The cashier was very nice.

Update: the oil was leaking in the morning. We called and took it back and they fixed it right away. Since it was almost closing they said to come back and get a free car wash."
4,"5 Stars for the grilled pork banh mi! - These are not your grandfather's Banh Mi sandwiches, there's no pate nor mayo, just caramelized grilled pork deliciousness, with sweet pickled veggies and your preferred level of heat. Perfect!

3 stars for the kimchi fries, - I love kimchi, I love fries, the combination, with all the sauce and everything, is just too busy for me.

2 stars for the porkbelly bao - the meat was not as nicely caramelized as one would hope, and the bao is too doughy and bland, and personally just doesnt do it for me. Stick to the sandwiches on their outstanding panini/baguette style rolls.

I found this location to be just a half-step behind the Yonge & Gerrard location, but still great, the wait isn't anywhere near as bad, plus there is street parking here, so its a winner overall.

I've tried all of their sandwiches, most are great, but with balanced flavours, yummy carmelized meat, and overall deliciousness, for me, their #1 grilled pork banh mi is always a winner, plus it's also the cheapest sandwich on their menu!

Go for it, you'll like it!"
4,Food was nice and fresh. They could benefit by adding some non-pork meat options to their menu. They offer great coffee and expresso items. Freshly squeezed orange juice is a very good option as well. Very kid/ family friendly.
4,"I have certain places I hit all the time while in Vegas, and this usually isn't one of them, but we were entertaining my father's step children while they were in town for business and they didn't want to venture to one of my usual spots. I'm flexible. I'm a compromising person, so I opted for Caramel. They attempted to charge us cover while walking through the petite door in the front, and I told them who I knew, all of a sudden the red rope opened, my father was surprised I pulled it off (don't doubt, of course I did, remember I OWN LAS VEGAS), and we walked in.

Saddling up the bar for some martini's the place was bumpin' already. My drink came quick, strong, and comped (of course bitches) and so did the rest of my crew. I took a peek at the person's tab next to me though who actually needed to pay and it was, with no surprise, not inexpensive. 

They threw some dirty bangin' hip hop that night, and even though the bar/lounge/club is really quite small, people were gettin' DOWN. On the tables, on the chairs, it was packed, and they were workin' it. The guy I was dating at the time was latin and he was a dancer. He and I were acting like the world was ending in the middle of the floor and breakin' it down like rockstars. It was fun. The guests we had weren't used to going out in Vegas and kinda just did the white boy rock out in the center of the floor, but whatever, it didn't look like they were with us anyway so I wasn't trippin' too hard.

On the right night, Caramel will give you a smaller club atmosphere, pour some mean drinks, and bring in some great dancers. In the Bellagio, which is beautiful, the location is central if you are staying at different hotels on the strip. 

I'll hit that place up every once and a while, but to be honest it's hard for me to pull myself away from my waterfall, and my beloved pole that I work so well at Tryst."
4,"This was my first waffle house I dined at outside the south where the place belongs. I need southern accents and trailer trash working in waffle house's, not phoenix college boys and girls. In that respect, it was a downner and also nobody conversed with me at the counter about anything and I was the only person at the counter. Usually there is some give and take in the deep south about some subject. Anyway, the food was still the same. I usually never vary from a Pecan waffle and a small order of hash brown covered and smothered with an orange juice. The waffle area was a holy mess of batter (a good thing) and the cook was an older lady who didn't have much personality, but the waffle and browns hit the spot. Kinda pricey these days at $9.07 for that meal.
   Perhaps the lone excitement occurred during my favorite part of the WH experience - the order call out. Waitress yells for bacon on the grill for a sandwich and after cook throws it on grill, she says, Oh, that should have been sausage, which led to a fairly short conversation about how that was a big mistake and where does sausage come from on the pig dialogue. Comical, but not enough attitude in the air."
4,I ordered the pulled pork bao bun and the kimchi fries. The bao bun was a little pricey for its portion but it tasted great.
4,"Cute little vietnamese sandwich place on St Denis. I've been coming here once in awhile since the opening and have never been disappointed. 

Along with different variety of sandwiches, they also have sushis, vietnamese street food and finger food. I really like the option of the brown baguette and the choice of 7 or 10 inches baguettes. Made to order, you can also customize your baguette for a little surcharge. The portions are really big and generous! I usually share a 10-inches sandwich with my hubby. There is usually a little line up but the service is fast and efficient. The prices are very reasonable and i believe they also hand out fidelity card for the sandwiches! Give it a try."
4,"Really tasty Malaysian food. Curry with rotis are amazing and tasty. Belachan shrimp green beans are my favorite too.  

They serve red bean and jello ice so that's a bonus when waiting for the food. 

They also serve pho and very delightful fried rice. 

Service is super fast and efficient. Even when packed, the tables are constantly turning because of the quick service.    

Parking is ample too.  The restaurants in this little plaza are built in an old hockey arena so ceilings in the main foyer are tall. 

On the flip side:  they can do a better job washing the vegetables. Found some grit, hopefully this is a one off as they are normally not gritty. 

Nevertheless I recommend this place based on the service, parking and the quality of food."
4,"Hey Hey, it's the SAMMIES!

Super Yummy here number 1!

The samiches are good, two sizes too, 7 and 10 inches. Well made with decent french bread, rather cheap as well, under 3 for 7 and 3.50 at 10.

The smoothies here were really good too, used a little more mango powder than other places, but that isn't a bad thing. It was a tasty treat for everyone =)"
4,"I've been here many times and like it a lot. They closed for a week recently to get some interior decoration. They can serve BBQ now. I'm going to try it next time.

Sundubu is one of my favorite dishes which I order most of the time. I like bibimbap because of the spicy sause. Green pepper probably has better bibimbap. There are two noodle soups we like, 38 and 41 or 43(the spicy one). 
The seafood pancakes are good too. 

One of my friends like fried rice a lot, but it's a little bit oily for me.

I ordered stir-fried vegetables once and didn't enjoy them at all."
4,Great sushi and pretty good hibachi. I have been here several times. It's a nice hole in the wall restaurant.
4,"Definite recommend. 

But I never would have known of the bad service people speak of in their reviews because the waitress handling our table was attentive and polite as well. 

Food was excellent that night (everything neatly prepared and tasted fresh), very nice modern dining environement, great location for before/after movie dining."
4,Ok so this was my first time trying a colon cleanse treatment so I was a little weirded out. Although once she explained everything and I got started it was a lot easier than I had pictured. It took about 45 minutes and privacy was definitely a priority even though she took the time to explain everything very thoroughly. All in all I was really impressed and I felt great after.
4,"Positive:
Excellent food
Fast service (not a lot of rush, promptly seated and order was brought out quickly)
Great decor and ambience 

Negative
Hostess doesn't speak / understand English very well, result being in lack of communication which can be bad - a few slips ups but negligible"
4,"Their soup is fantastic! I ordered the spicy soft tofu soup, as usual, and it turned out to be really good. They say they use beef soup as base and I do think that's why it makes a huge difference. Their rice is also tasty as well. Impressed by the details."
4,"Was blown away by service - which isn't a small feat when you were just picking up food! 
Deep dish, NY style pizza just loaded with cheese.
Pizza is delicious, ingredients are fresh and it really is heads and shoulders above your every day delivery.

The only downside for me, and it was a complete personal taste thing, is that I don't like that much cheese on my pizza and prefer slightly thinner crust. 

Yes, expecting your total outrage at the above comment!! :P"
4,"Really liked this place. Friendly service, quick delivery of the food and good prices. 

Really enjoyed the standard Gyro I got. Meat was good, tzatziki was very nice. Daughter got the gyro plate and the accompanying Greek salad was good too - just needed a few more kalamata olives. Daughter's boyfriend got the smoked gyro - the meat was smoked and coated with bbq sauce - he really liked it. 

Only negative was the hummus - rather bland. Just needed a little something."
4,"I have been here twice and love it! I have had the Gyro, Shwarma, Salad and Fries.  All of which were super delicious.  This place is kind of hidden and I have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  Now that I have tried it, I will be back.  Great service too!  

Dont forget to try the ice tea, its got a kick to it,  a chai like flavor.  Super refreshing."
4,"This is a chain that I'm pretty sure is new to the Pittsburgh area.  Mercifully this was built right behind the Denny's.  If you go to Denny's instead of ""The Original"" for breakfast, you're a moron.

Portions are definitely big. You might be just fine with a short stack.

Who doesn't love chocolate chip pancakes? If you get sick of them, try the chocolate chip waffle!

The ""Dutch Baby"" intrigued us for a while.  We finally tried it and were underwhelmed.  The Apple Pancakes are awesome though."
4,"Service is always efficient, although it does get busy at times. The food and drinks.... well, it's Starbucks, so it's no different than any other location. 

I deducted one star for this reason: there's only one electrical outlet for the entire seating area. This is less than ideal if you're looking for a place to study or need to plug in a laptop."
4,"Having driven by this place on numerous occasions for the past 5-6 years, finally decided to stop and try the food. I have tasted Afghan food at other places and I have always liked the kebab and rice, so I knew this would be good, I wasn't wrong!

We arrived around 715pm which was perfect because we missed the crowd that followed us. It is Ramadan and fasts were being broken.

Decor (3/5)

The place is nice. It tries to be fancy with the chandeliers but it doesn't work. Some great pictures and images on the wall depicting Afghan life and culture. We sat in a booth, and my seat was slightly tilted foward which is very annoying.

Service (4/5)

Here you place your order first, sit down, and they will call your number. The staff were friendly and accommodating.

Food (4/5)

Just as expected the food was delicious. They give you so much that you will have to pack a parcel for home. We ordered the sultani kebab and the Kandahar Kebab. Both were good, the little orange spicy sauce was yum.

The place was soon busy and got packed.

Great place to bring the family for some good Afghan food."
4,"Que ce soit pour leurs délicieux bubbles tea/smooties, leurs ''Bánh mì'' , leurs petits snacks (viennoiseries, tapioca, ...), on adore Vua et aussi leurs prix très abordables. On y retourne lorsqu'on est dans le Quartier Latin !"
4,"I'm a frequent customer here and I have to say, the food/service is always a hit or miss. Some days, the sashimi is well prepared with great cuts (ex. Salmon belly), while other days the fish looks like the leftover end pieces or is tough and chewy (ex. Bad cuts of tuna). Tempura items are sometimes cold and chewy, and sometimes hot and crispy. Again, very inconsistent. Otherwise, the rest of the food items are generally pretty decent.

Service is generally sub-par. One time, we arrived around 5 on a weekday hoping to get in an early dinner, but was told there would be an hour wait (for the near-empty restaurant) because the tables were reserved - even though no one was there or waiting for tables! My advice - make reservations if you want to eat there (even if it's a weekday, or the start of dinner service). 

Some of the wait staff are polite and at tentative, while others are oblivious and rude    (ex. Having to flag them down every time for a tea refill or to take orders, not saying thank you after you've paid AND tipped).

Weekday Mon-Thurs prices are cheaper than weekends. Overall they have the potential to be pretty good for an AYCE place - if you're lucky enough to go on a good day."
4,"Positive change in the overall customer service at this location. I stopped coming in for a while and decide to give it another try. They have gone through some staff changes for the better. Lately I've been coming in, in the am. It does tend to get busy, however, it comes and goes in spurts. They do a great job at keeping the line moving at a good pace. If you don't want to wait for great coffee, you can always hit the gas station! Good things come to those who wait!! 

I'm still waiting for more comfortable seating lol!"
4,"Really love the decor and atmosphere :) money well spent.

Service was fast and friendly; food was good. Will be coming back to try the other options on the menu"
4,"If you have a lot of hungry mouthes to feed this is your place.  Huge portions with excellent flavors. The banana foster french toast is a winner.   If you like eggs benedict i highly recommend them.  The omlettes are quite large and look like an upside down pie pan.  The three times i have been there i have not been disappointed, but like most breakfast joints if you dont like your homefries raw ask for them to be well done."
4,"My mom and I came here for lunch.  I swear I've had the same food at metro square at the curry spot, they both looked, smelled and tasted alike.  Anyways I ordered the curry lamb and my mom ordered the oxtail noodle soup.  They were both full of flavour.  The service was great too, they got the food out quick on a packed lunchtime.  I'd go back here for sure and recommend it to anyone."
4,"IMHO, one of the best AYCE sushi establishment in the GTA!

The fish has always been really fresh (never had frozen sushi, like I've had at Yangs and other places), a good (average) selection of rolls, sashimi and grilled food but best of all, they serve soft shell crab by the plate!  That's right people, by the plate, no limits, all you can eat deep fried softshell crab goodness :)

Prices have come down since Wasabi opened up next door, so it's now your average AYCE price of about $22 on weekend nights. 

They're usually pretty busy, so I recommend reservations."
4,"I went here for lunch today. I ordered a gyro and chicken kebab platter. It came with rice and greek salad. The rice had good flavor and the meat was cooked perfectly. The gyro was slightly crispy and the chicken was just right, not dry or overcooked. The baklava was good too. I enjoyed the meal a lot. This was my first visit and there are many other things on the menu I'd like to try. I recommend this fast casual Greek restaurant."
4,"So I was thinking that I needed to go work here maybe make the place a little more lively and then at 5am I got a baristas named Emily, OmGosh she had it covered at that time of The morning she was jolly and enthusiastic.  Now I know for at least that time of The morning when she works ppl are awake.  Thanks Emily!!!"
4,"I went here for lunch with a friend yesterday and I loved it. I have always had a good meal here. As soon as I got in, the waiter greeted and seated me. While I was waiting for my friend, the waiter asked to get me a drink right away.

Their lunch special was a combo for $9.95 of assorted fish sushi and California maki. It was tasty and also came with miso soup and salad!

Towards the end of my visit the service declined slightly because the lunch rush was starting to pick up. They did constantly refill my tea though.

Can't wait to come back here again!"
4,"Came here with some friends and thoroughly enjoyed it! The portions were huge, the rice was tasty, the meat was juicy. I find that this place is much better value than Bamiyan kabobs. Looking forward to coming again."
4,"Let me tell you a story. A story about a new Mom of a two week old baby who needs to make her exhausted self look appropriate for the baptism. It's a shot in the dark to think that she can sneak away for a couple hours, but her fairy godmother is hard at work to make it happen. So comes the day when she can step out to get her hair done for the baptism, but it must be close enough that she doesn't waste her time on the drive. Well she lives happily ever after because Primp & Blow has a store right by her hood! Feeling like she is on vacation, the new Mom spends two blissful hours getting her hair washed and blown out so that while the rest of her body feels and looks tired and very much post-baby, her hair is silky, curled and flowing thanks to the fairies at Primp & Blow. 

A moral to the story, if you have a friend who just had a baby the very best gift you can give them is the gift of time. Insist on coming over to hold the baby while they nap, shower or maybe even get a blow out at Primp & Blow!"
4,"The food here is very similar in style to Bamiyan. It even has a similar style of ordering food and they call out your number when it is ready. You can choose to sit in or take out. There is a lot of space to sit inside. We grabbed our food to go. 

We ordered one of the chicken breast dinner and the veggie kabab dinner. They both came with A LOT of rice, salad, naan, as well as a creamy fill sauce and hot sauce. The chicken was in a sauce that was absolutely delicious. It reminded me a bit of piri piri sauce. Very flavourful. The rice is very similar to bamiyan as well. Brown long grain basmati. The salad was a nice way to balance all the carbs and protein. I used the creamy doll sauce on both the salad as a dressing and on the food. It was DELICIOUS. I would go there just for the sauce. The hot sauce was also really tasty. It had so much flavour and it was actually spicy, unlike Bamiyan's hot sauce (which is not even what I would consider mild anymore). I was impressed. The naan was also good but nothing special. 

The veggie kabab was nice. It held together very well. It reminded me of a veggie patty. There were quite a few spices in it and it is a great option for any vegetarians out there. I personally wouldn't order it again, but only because there is one spice in there that I cannot stand, but it is present in quite a few Indian dishes as well. I forget the name. 

Overall the portions were massive for the price and quality of the food was very good. I couldn't even finish it all the 2nd day. I did feel like they give too much rice. It was a little disproportionate. We did wait quite a while for the food, but I didn't mind, as long as the food was being prepared fresh. I would definitely go back, maybe order one dinner with rice and the other without and just split the amount between two people. I highly recommend the chicken breast dinner for those who enjoy a lot of flavour."
4,"The issue was resolved. The response is way off as far what I was expecting would be done. I never expected anyone to pay the deductible or anything along those lines. The issue was the things that were broken only after I got the car back, and I didn't have time to wait for them to fix it that same day. When I did have time, the service tech that helped me and told me it would be taken care of, didn't work there anymore and hadn't noted the account, and when contacted of course he didn't remember. It had been awhile. With family health issue and work, it was a few months at least. Nonetheless it was a headache at that time. But in the end the issue was resolved and the shop made the repairs that were caused and promised by them in the first place, and for that I am thankful."
4,Food is super super delicious but pretty pricey especially since it's located in a college town. However portions are really reasonable and their menu has tons of choices
4,"I had wanted to stop and eat here for awhile. I was so happy we finally made it there. The gentleman working was very nice and he explained that they always have cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza, a veggie pizza, and a special of the day pizza. We bought a piece of sausage and a piece of BBQ Chicken pizza. We thought we would start with those and then try another piece or two . . .until we saw how enormous their pizzas are!!!!  I have never seen pizzas that huge!!! . Each piece of pizza was $5. Plain cheese is $4. Whole plain cheese pizzas are $30 and others are $35. The pizzas are so big that you could feed two to three families from one pizza. The sausage is not your typical sausage. It is sliced and the size of pepperoni and not crumbles. I wish that they weren't sliced so thin. It was very good. The BBQ Chicken was our favorite of the two. The BBQ sauce was finger licking good. The chicken was real. It was in nice size chunks. I wish the pizzas had a little bit more cheese on them but the pizza is very good. The pizzas are very thin crust until you get to the edge where it's more like a typical hand tossed crust.  Even though the crust is thinner it stands up to the toppings. 
Take a group of friends and go try it. Enjoy all of the artwork o the walls!!"
4,"As a Jersey girl, I've grown up being spoiled by NJ and NY classic pizza. Throughout my time in college in Pittsburgh, I've encountered my share of pizza restaurants that attempt to replicate this classic east coast taste but fall short. However, that is not the case with Benny's! The pizza is awesome, with slices that are the perfect thickness and have the optimal tomato sauce to cheese ratio. Additionally, the slices and pies are huge, with one slice as big as a person's head! Definitely filling.

Also convenient is that Benny's is open late on the weekends, which is helpful if you want a bite to eat after a night out with friends in South Side."
4,"I have been a bit sad ever since my beloved Dasonii closed its doors in nearby Robinson.  I'm finding that there are not a lot of Korean food options.  So, it requires a little more planning if I want something a little different from Chinese or Thai.

I made the drive into Oakland to try out Korea Garden.  I really had a craving for Galbi (beef shortribs) and there isn't a lunch option - just the dinner size.  At $26, it better be good.  And it was.  Plus, it was served with 5 amazing side dishes (Banchan) and I enjoyed them except for the one seaweed one.  The texture wasn't for me but it was still tasty.  The rest I pretty much finished off with the very tender beef shortribs and white rice.

My wife went with the much cheaper Bulgogi lunch box.  It came with a huge bowl of miso soup, fried rice, one fried dumpling and a heaping helping of Kimchi.  

The total post tax and pre-tip for lunch was $40.  

We came during a pretty busy lunch service and service was very friendly and attentive.  We lucked out on finding a parking space right across the street from the restaurant.  And apparently, there is a parking lot behind the restaurant - you just need to ask for a parking pass when you leave.

All in all, worth the drive and we were both very happy with our lunch choices.  I'll definitely be back to this place."
4,"Twice in one week. Spivak!!! And a cold Canadian draft with the wife and her veggie with feta

Hit by a cheese tsunami and superb service. Highly recommend Pinos. Yes, hard to see from road but Ajax's hidden gem.

Having Pinos pesto pizza and Spivak special. Tell you more after we eat."
4,"Okay so if you want great pizza on south side go here. Not a disappointment. Slices are huge! It's BYOB. Low key spot and great pizza. Service was great too, very nice. Also a good place when you leave the bars at 2am and want a slice to take home."
4,"30 choix de sandwichs.. 7"" 3.25$ et le 10"" 3.75$ +tx... Que dire de plus c'est bon!! Ils ont des sushis préfait...mais pas super...cependant ils ne sont pas chet ey ça depanne!"
4,One of the friendliest Starbucks in the valley! This is my go to location around work and they're always relatively fast given the amount of people in line. On Fridays they staff the drive thru which extra baristas which is brilliant! Who doesn't want Starbucks on Fridays.
4,"This shooting range is located up NW. Pretty descent size outdoor shooting range. They definitely have alot of shooting lanes and really good safety practices. The shooting range experts where on site to assist with any difficulties and share knowledge. 
Would definitely like to come back here to test out new toys."
4,"I've been a few times now and the food is always really good. The service is very nice, but a little slow. I believe our waitress took advantage of the fact that we were younger, chill customers and chose to ignore us during a very busy time because of it. We waited 30+ minutes before she came back to our table for our check. But she was a very kind women, and I understand the struggle of a rush on a Saturday morning, so I won't hold it against her. I'll go again."
4,"I ordered the rare beef pho and roti with goat.  The pho was nice, lots of variety of beef (beef, tripe, beef ball).  The soup was not overly salty.  The roti with goat is something I don't see too often in other vietnamese restaurants and every table seemed to order it.  The roti was a bit greasy but the portions were generous.  The goat itself was easy to chew on and the curry sauce was thick but nice.  The service was great and food came quickly (less than 10mins?).  I'd come back if I'm feeling for something different from typical Vietnamese restaurants."
4,"Stumbled upon this place after going for a hike at Rouge Park. This place was on our way home, and the 4 star rating and photos on Yelp helped us make the decision in coming here. 

The only other Afghan restaurant I've tried is Bamiyan Kabob. This place was pretty similar. Upon arrival you're greeted with 2 huge fountains and pretty lighting fixtures. My son loved them. The restaurant is huge and decorated nicely. Lots of spacing. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and it got really busy after we ordered. Lots of families!

The ordering is also similar to Bamiyan, where you place your order at the cashier and then they'll announce when your order is ready over a microphone.

The wait was a bit long, but the food made up for it. Our chicken combo came with salad, rice, and naan with hot sauce and a white yogurt-like sauce. Rice was great, naan was warm, salad came with cucumbers and sliced tomato, and the chicken kabob was delicious. The chicken kofta was also good, but kabob stood out more. 

Will definitely return to try out other items on the menu!"
4,"Hole in a wall restaurant in a old building complex. I would never have went in if it wasn't from a recommendation tbh. It kind of gives me the asia street food vibe where you seat yourselves and the server's service depends on their mood. 

BUT come here for the food, its so tasty that I keep going back. The goat curry and roti is so good, no lie. The portion is pretty big and even 2ppl can't finish it. I've tried their pho and it was ok but the ROTI, you just have to try the crispy flakey goodness."
4,"Very yummy NY style pizza for a great price! A slice of cheese was $4 and pepperoni was $5, which you can't beat on the south side! Full of flavor and you won't walk away hungry... They also have a good selection of pops to choose from, even some I have never seen before! The ranch was not very good but amazing pizza!"
4,"This place is awesome! I am so thrilled we have a Poki restaurant nearby! My friend and I came here after reading the reviews and thought to give it a try. Totally worth it! I got the regular bow (ahi & yellowtail) with the mixed greens. You can choose whatever you want! Great variety of toppings, sauces, and mix-in yummies. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Being a first timer they guided us through the process and made recommendations. It was reasonably priced too! Everything looked fresh and the Poki was delicious. It left me craving for more and a definite return in the near future. Great job guys!!"
4,"My chicken gyro had a little bit too much of a smoky flavor, but the lamb gyro I tried was excellent - the pita itself is heaven - they make them here (hence ""Pitaland""!) And I must say the Rosemary Fries with Lemon Aioli dipping sauce are a welcome treat! I will definitely be back!!! Next time I plan on trying the Lamb Burger!"
4,"We've always been fans of Pita Land as a great Mediterranean grocery and the best joint in Pittsburgh to get freshly made pitas of all varieties and hummus.  When we heard they were putting in a cafe, I knew it would be good.

Gyros, baked flat breads, pizzas, burgers, and all kinds of Mediterranean fare do not disappoint.  Much to our own demise (wayyy too much to eat), we ordered a meat flat bread (thinking it would be small), a Gyro Doner (larger than normal), and a Lamb Burger.

The Lamb Burger, hands down, is one of the best burgers I've actually had in Pittsburgh.  Super juicy.  Cooked to order.  Feta cheese, pickled onions, etc.  I highly recommend.

Do yourself a favor and get a piece of baklava from the counter on your way out as well!"
4,"This place has an interesting mix of a 'real restaurant' environment and McDonald-style self-service, with the plastic trays and everything. The food portions are big, and the meats are well-marinaded - I'd describe it as an above-average food court fare."
4,I come here for their roti and curry. So good! I can never finish it though. So I hate their 25cent charge on containers.
4,"Yes, I like this place.
Again I had a Korean-Chinese style spicy seafood noodle which is my favorite.
It was very good.

As always I used Samsung pay when I paid.
It went nicely and smoothly like videos below.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpPapvJNpWo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czcb5dXjlZA

This time one of my friends also want to try Apple pay.
But there was something strange happened the credit card machine of the restaurant said transaction cancelled but IPhone displayed transaction paid.
So, there was some talk between the person of the restaurant and my friend and my friend wanted to try again.
But the person of the restaurant refuse to accept Apply pay.
And he paid by cash in the end."
4,"I get the chicken kababs and the veggie soy kebab - which in itself is an amazing idea for vegetarians. The food is fresh, flavourful and spicy. The chicken is good quality white meat. The sauce that comes with your order is delicious and spicy. It's too good. 

This pricing is a little expensive, but the food IS good. But it could use a dollar less on all the main dishes.

I haven't eaten dine in here, but went to get take out. The restaurant looks new, with nice waterfall pillars and lighting and etc. totally a step up from the old restaurants here. 

I just don't like the wait for the take out. Perhaps I should call in next time to place an order so I can come, collect and pay."
4,"Went to Benny Fierro's on a quest to find the best pizza in South Side while I'm here for the summer. I knew the pizzas here were big, but seeing them in person still had me in awe. However, for me, when it comes to pizza, size matters not.

I started off with a cheese slice to get a taste of the bare necessities. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it. The cheese was nice and gooey, and the sauce had some good flavor. The only problem was that it could've used much more sauce. After finishing that slice, I was struggling to decide whether I wanted another since it was so filling. I figured I had to try something else, so I went with the pesto chicken pizza (which I think is a summer special). I was expecting some integration of pesto into the sauce, but it was simply a cheese slice topped with pesto chicken. The chicken was tasty and well cooked and was a nice addition to the pizza, but it would've been nice to have a bit more pesto.

Overall, the pizza was delicious and a contender for best pizza in South Side. The service was friendly, the prices were a bit high ($4-$5 a slice) but considering the size of each slice it's not that bad. I'd definitely go back to try some other options."
4,"If you live in Brookline, look no further, this is your one stop shop for Mediterranean/Middle Eastern quisine. You can eat in or take home some groceries. Iv had their falafel gyro and regular gyro. The falafel one was very good with a healthy dose of both falafel and fresh veggies. The regular gyro fell short of my expectations however, the lamb being mushy and slightly gritty. I plan on trying more items on their menu and possibly grab some groceries, but if you just want a good ol gyro, Sams Sun Sandwich in Carrick or Original Gyro on 88 are better options"
4,"A poke place near my house? Yippee! Have been impatiently waiting for Poki Point to open ever since I saw their sign as I leave the gym next door every morning! Alas, the day has come! Took my lovely daughter with me and we eagerly placed our order. A small bowl with brown rice for me and a large bowl with brown rice for her. I topped mine off with salmon and tuna in a combo of their house sauce and citrus yuzu. A scoop of spicy crab, onions, cilantro, micro greens, fried onion bits, a dash of seaweed flakes and a dollop of avocado for a $1 more. Every bite was delicious and the fish was so tender like butter! I will definitely be back again and again!"
4,"First time at an all you can eat sushi buffet.  The servers might have changed because they weren't that bad.  Maybe I'm used to crap service? lol.  Anyhow the food was better than I thought an AYCE sushi buffet would be - I was expecting grocery store sushi quality but it was much better than that.

There is a time limit of 1.5 hours and they let you know when it's ""last call"" so you don't get left hungry.  Also, no spoilage fees like I've seen in some places in Montreal (which deterred me from going) not sure if that's common in Toronto."
4,"I left a few reviews for lunch menu's in this area because my coworkers and I like to try new and local comestibles once in a while.

First thing, they need to change the font on their menu. We could barely read it! 
One of us ordered two Kibbee Footballs and didn't know that they only got one in one order. That was the only bother with this order.
We had their Falafel sandwich, Baba Ghannouj, Beef Shawarma sandwich, Stuffed grape-leaves, Muhammara; everything was delicious. 

They also had Baklava to sample at the register and all I can say is that I've ever taste Baklava this fresh!

Not to mention the store itself; I haven't seen it in years and they have since fixed it up and added a Café. What a pleasing ambience!"
4,"Friendly, attentive service, and decent quality fish (for Charlotte - not exactly the ideal supply source for sushi grade fish). Good presentation, adequate portion sizes."
4,"Kost is such a special place. Makes you feel like you've left Toronto to be on a resort in a sunny place! We recommend going during brunch on a nice day because it's a beautiful and bright view of downtown Toronto. 
The food was good. The staff were very kind. They take your jacket for you right when you arrive and are very friendly."
4,"OK, the building is small and the parking limited and my order wasn't made right the first time but gladly redone  and so by being Starbucks and the service friendly they get the four stars.  Wish they would reposition their tables and add some more to allow for more people to sit down."
4,"When my Pyrenees tore a dew claw, they were able to treat her right away as a walk in! Very clean facility and patient rooms. Very nice staff and Dr. I would recommend them for your pet care :-) 

I would give them 5 if I could have seen their procedures room."
4,"Excellent flavour and great value for money. 

We are big and of the Sardari kabob meal ( chicken) and the House special - Kandahar kabob (meat and comes with grilled vegetables)

Ordering takeout can be a challenge as it's busy for them and they never came seem to hear despite yelling into the phone - but the meal is worth it."
4,"Sweet Jesus, Pizza Pino is ahhhmazing!

My review is for a take-out order, so this is more about the food- not so much the service. 

First off, I ordered on a Friday night for a party of 4 and they were pretty prompt in getting our order ready. The price was also very good for what you get.

So, we unboxed the pizza at a friend's house and this was my first Pizza Pino experience. Everyone was hyping about it and they compared the pizza to a lasagna. I was beyond excited when I heard this. I got my first slice and there were just toppings coming out of the piece of pizza. I had a veggie slice so there were green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes... and a massive bed of cheese. I bit into it and it was just great. One this that I didn't like were the tomatoes. They were just a bit too ""crunchy"" for a piece of pizza. I thought the tomatoes would've cooked through a bit more than I thought. Other than that, it was just really good pizza.

I couldn't eat more than 2 slices because it was just that packed. I'd really give this place a try if you're in the mood for a ""deep dish"".... the dish is pretty deep on this one!"
4,"Love the bahn mi and love the prices!  Also, the people who work there are nice and it is clean! The only thing I could ask for is more room for customers but I love it here, so I can easily look past that."
4,"I had an issue with the accounting of my blowouts, but I was glad that the owner wanted to solve it and indeed took care of my problem.  I am happy we were able to resolve the issue, because I have always had great blowouts with Adriana, Bryce and Briana, who have been there forever and I can just sit down and they know exactly what to do."
4,Yum! Tasty sushi with lots of options and quick service.
4,"My wife and I came here for lunch on 10/11/14 as we just moved and are trying to find a local sushi area since our regular ones are an extra 15 minutes away now. We went around 2pm which they had a sushi lunch special going on for half off sushi until 3pm so if course we had to partake. It was pretty slow in the restaurant, always maybe 2 to 3 tables being served. 

We got the normal sushi you would find everywhere: Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Temp, Philly Roll, Yellow Tail, and Crunchy Cali. They were all fresh and very delicious and extremely cheap at the half off price of $2-$3 per roll. 

The service was great and never missed a brat, but didn't over crowd us at the same time. This is definitely going to be or local spot from now on, glad we found this gem tucked away."
4,"I really like this place! Plenty of room, very organized. And is willing to help you out. Price is very acceptable @ $7.00 a day. They have ear plugs, targets and beverages to purchase at a reasonable price. If it's your first time there is a 10 min video they want you to watch. It's diffidently a great place to go, just have to watch out for dumb A$$ like myself. I tend to have a major brain freeze. But the workers there are nice enough to let me know what I did wrong in a polite way. Give me time! I promise I won't shoot anyone! I'll get better."
4,"First time I've experienced a blend of Greek and Korean influences, and I'm a fan.  It was very good.  So yeah, not everything was traditional or ""authentic"" Greek, but it was all very good and the variety was fun.  Service was fast and friendly."
4,"Had their pizza a couple of times and the toppings are ridiculous. 
Little bit higher than other places"
4,"Wanted a gyro but immediately became concerned when I saw a Korean bbq menu too. Surprise it was really tasty. Person behind the counter was super sweet and nice, they had Sunday specials score! Will upgrade my stars once I try Korean food"
4,"I haven't had a korean food for such a long time since my last visit at Sushi Kim, which I swear never to go back again.

Like the previous reviewer mentioned - this place is ""waaay"" understaffed and hopefully the owners will recognize this issue and at least have one extra employee during peak hours before it's too late.

The prices for the bbq seemed a bit high especially for the amount served but the rest at least for me seemed reasonable.

So far, I've been here twice and both times the food has been great but the service as usual a little slower - not because they were unattentive or bad , it's just that there were only two people working upfront as a server, buss er and a host.

If you're looking to get a quick bite - then this may not be the ideal place to get one. Just saying..."
4,"Went for an early dinner and luckily the place was empty.  It's setup like a Subway or Chipotle's where you can either ask for signature bowl or choose ingredients.

Most days I'm vegan so this was a rare cheat-day.

We were very overwhelmed with the options so we opted to get signature bowls.  I got the Volcano and my wife got The Point bowl.  Our daughter got a very simple bowl with rice and shrimp.

This was our very first time having poke anywhere.  We really liked it!  It was less expensive than sushi and we left full.

The place was clean, service fast and the staff was friendly.  Only reason I didn't rate it 5-Star was that the ambiance could be better. 

We are looking forward to trying out other poke places in the Gilbert area but this place has set the bar very high."
4,"In my mind, still dominates as the best AYCE sushi in Mississauga.

Always packed, so I hear really bad things about their service and 'kicking you out' after the 2-hour time limit.

Still, the only AYCE place that you can just order the soft shell crab. SAY WHAT? Paradise. Also love that they have a great variety in rolls and sushi."
4,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!
The sauce is so good. Absolutely yummy. 
You think a New York slice is big? Those slices ain't got nothing on the size of a Virginia slice.
Honestly it's true that a piece is as big as one's head...or in my case the size of my arse (which is plentiful)!
Slices about $5 each which is the way we usually go, 
However, we've on occasion bought an entire pie which by the way is 28 inches. No joke, it's enormous.
You'd think pies this big wouldn't be Cooke properly and may be raw/doughy. Not the case. Cooked to perfection.
Worried about leftover? You'll have them for days. 
So glad Pittsburgh is one of a handful of cities that's home to this smaller pizza shop chain.
 Pepperoni pizza here is my favorite."
4,"The food is good. Although the menu is a little bit overpriced, lunch bento offers an economy choice. I love soondubu and spicy pork bulgogi here."
4,"Went to Osaka for my birthday this year and I have been twice before I wasn't impressed but my family told me to go try it again so I took a leap and I'm glad I did. It was really good I started with the yakigyoza (fried dumplings) delish. Then I ordered the dinner combination hibachi steak and chicken which comes with fried rice, salad, mixed vegetables, sweet carrots, miso soup, and shrimp sauce on a huge plate everything was cooked perfect and tasted great. My friends got sushi, I didn't so I won't comment on it other than to say they enjoyed it and it was pretty. My drink glass did go empty for quite some time and I did have to ask for a refill as did my friends. I would only give service 2.5 stars, across the board it was a delightful evening."
4,I've been here twice and it's really one of the best ranges out there. I love shooting outdoors and overall I'd say this is the place to be for that. Plus if you're hungry you can always grab something to eat there. Targets aren't too badly priced either and the range officers keep it orderly. Definitely recommend!
4,"Why is this not a franchise? If this were a franchise, it would mean I could get these sandwiches everywhere. And if I could get these sandwiches everywhere, I would be soooooooo happy. 

Despite the neverending line (it's essentially a continuous flow of people from open 'til close), there's rarely a sense of rush and the service is always exceptional. Pair this with some tremendously tasty banh mi sandwiches, and it's got all the makings of one of my favourite ""to-go"" spots. In fact, it's so good that even if I'm not hungry, I'll pick up a couple of sandwiches from here whenever I'm in the neighbourhood, just so that I can have them for later."
4,"First time experience for me.  I went in very nervous but Tiffany was wonderful.  I will definitely try it again.

Michele B."
4,"This place seems to have the best Banh Mi in Ville-Marie and is on par with the average (not exceptional) places you'd find in California.  The bread is fresh and toasted when you order, the vegetables look like they've actually been chopped on the same day, and the coriander has more leaves than stems.  All that and bubble tea too, or basil seed drink, aloe drink, or other interesting libations if you prefer."
4,Quality and taste is excellent. Will Definitely be returning. Thai Tea is the weak point though. They charge $2 for a small little bottle. Wish they made it fresh.
4,"The pancakes were good. When I went to this one, the meal had some issues but the second time I went to a different location and the service was exemplary as well as the food. This is a nice establishment, I wish that there were more in the city."
4,First time in this place and we will defiantly order again! The food tasted fresh and the protein were big! I gave it 4 out of 5 due to the fact their Greek fries are just the regular fries topped with cheese with no other seasoning.
4,"I went to this place with a Groupon and I was pleasantly surprised, the waiter was helpful and courteous. The food portions were pretty good and to food tasted fresh. We had the steak and shrimp and the tempura appetizer. The prices very reasonable too."
4,"Our bunny, Jukie, woke up with a case of the snuffles. It's a bacterial infection that causes respiratory problems, and can develop into a mess of health problems. Dr. Starks was very informative, and gave us lots of information. He gave us a couple of options for treatment. I never felt pressured. The staff was friendly, and the wait time was short. The cost of meds was reasonable, and hopefully Jukie will be all better soon."
4,Love this range! If I'm not going to the desert I'm coming here for sure. They are all about the safety and fun of shooting. They also sell targets and safety gear if you need it.
4,"My favorite Korean place in Pittsburgh, the food is delicious, decent service for a Korean place (i.e. Korean restuarant are not known for their services). My favorite dish are korean pancakes and tofu and seafood stew."
4,"They have nice variety of sandwiches which are quite cheap starting at 2.95$

They also have bubble tea, and ice coffee, and pre-made meals including sushi. If you buy a pre-made meal you get a free spring roll!!!

I work close by and sometimes when i don't bring my lunch, this is a good option for cheap lunch.

They also have vegetarian sandwich and spring rolls for those who don't eat meat. We don't have a lot of vietnamese sandwich places in mtl, but this place is fun and has tons of choices... I like it a lot and I go often :)

The place is small but it looks clean and presentable, and cheap too, it's cool."
4,Good prices. Taste fresh. They need more space to eat inside.
4,"I wasn't crazy about the corned beef hash. But I do recommend the coconut pancakes, which come with an awesome tropical glaze. I got a taste of Darren's Crabcakes Benedict and they were scrumptious. The service was great, our server was adorable and talkative, and overall, they serve good breakfasts here. 

Just be careful. Their lot can be impossible to get into. try to go on a weekday morning if you can. We tried coming here a few times before and could not find a spot."
4,I really like this place.  I always order like 6+ sandwiches and take it home to eat for the week haha bc I'm a pig and I also like it for my lunch for the week when I'm too lazy to do groceries.  I believe you can a discount when you order more.  I'll will be going back soon :)  It is also very healthy and better than Subway.  You get more for your money too!
4,"Beautiful spot to visit for a meal. I went for breakfast on a weekday and it was empty. The food and service were good. The view is beautiful. The interior decor is beautifully done, very coastal vibes. We had the coconut pancakes (highly recommend), avacado toast, and baked eggs."
4,"Ever since moving to Toronto 16 years ago, and more recently Whitby 12 years ago finding good pizza has been a challenge. Tired of all the franchise brands poor excuse for pizza. We stumbled across this place while searching Yelp. A couple photos of their pizza looked great, and got me excited. So we made the drive to South Ajax to give them a try. While it wasn't the Cornwall pizza I grew up with. It was it's own.. great sauce, fresh toppings and it was very good overall. My daughter had a XS cheese pizza for like $5.31 (so cheap), and my wife and I split a Med (half Pino Special, half Meat Lovers). I was very pleasantly surprised. Very generous on the toppings, including cheese. We will most certainly be back, and want to try other menu items. They had a large number of specialty pizzas.  Want to try their meat sauce base next time. Their location is not really something you will stumble across, so Yelp was a big help to draw us there. The restaurant while clean, is basic and somewhat dated. They were fairly busy for sit down service, but very busy for pick up / take out service. Looking forward to our next visit already."
4,"The stews and noodle soups here remain excellent, as always. They had a new special menu, and so I tried the yukgaejang (shredded beef stew) from it. It was excellent--very meaty, full of flavor, with nice and soft glass noodles. The stew was hot and spicy, and it feels great to eat this on a warm day (counterintuitive, but it's a very Asian thing to do). We also got their seafood noodle stew (jjambbong), which is more of a Korean-Chinese dish, but equally rich and spicy with a more hand-pulled type of noodle. Definitely recommended!"
4,"definately the best korean place in pittsburgh i know of...although that's not saying much. drinks are damn expensive and the food is ok for the price, but there's not really any other option out here."
4,"Prices are pretty average for a Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA area. Their pho noodle soup is really good. If you are looking to eat pho in the Markham/Richmond Hill area, I recommend this place. All the dishes I have tried here are generally pretty good - Lemon Grass Chicken, Curry Chicken with Roti, Spring Rolls etc. The food comes really quick if you go right before the dinner rush so around 5-6 pm. Everything about this place is awesome except for one thing - their washrooms are not clean and not maintained well."
4,"If you've spent any amount of time in the Adams Morgan district of Washington, D.C. (or anywhere in VA, really) then this is not a new concept. Enter the jumbo slice o' pizza! This place conjured up memories of drunken stupors w/ friends in search of anything edible after the bars closed down, then waking up the next a.m. only to find pizza sauce splatter on the crotch of your favorite pair of khakis. I digress. BF's pizza, be it slices or whole pies, are thin but simply colossal. While not my favorite pizza in da 'burgh, it's a true-blue go-to for late night eats. Order. Wait. Eat. Repeat. Oh yeah, it's also of the few places you can get Cheerwine in a glass bottle."
4,"Great food and service every time we have eaten here! It's usually empty or pretty close to it, but don't let that deter you, it just means less wait! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is just because the weekend hours are a little inconvenient, it seems to be closed anytime we try to go to dinner here on a Saturday or Sunday."
4,"When I first saw the size of a slice of pizza at Benny Fiero's, I assumed it was just a gimmick and the pizza wouldn't be very good. Boy was I wrong! The pizza is thin until you get to the end of your slice and that's when you start to get full. Eating more than 1.5-2 slides would be impressive. 

I ordered delivery from BF's once and the pizza box was so large that I had to angle it to get it to fit through my front door! For $30-35 you can feed 4-6 people which isn't too bad and it's fun to eat such an enormous slice. I did the math - one slice at BF is like 3 slices of XL pizza elsewhere, but keep in mind it is effectively thin crust pizza."
4,"Well, this is a weird review to write.  Up until this weekend, I had never even used a shotgun and now here I am the first to review the Ben Avery Shooting Range.  Who knew? My husband recently acquired not one, but two guns - a shotgun and a pistol - much to my dismay.  But, they were here to stay, so I decided to be proactive and learn how to use them.  

The shooting range is on the way to Pleasant, right off the Carefree Highway.  I had passed by the place a hundred times on my way to the lake but had never stopped. There are 2 parts to the range, the target practice and the clay target area, a minute up the road.  We first stopped at the target practice area where $5 will cover your daily shooter fee.  This area is the more popular of the two and is VERY loud. Earplugs are necessary and noise canceling headphones couldn't hurt. We didn't end up staying at this area because we had come for clay shooting and I can't say I was disappointed to get out of there. 

$25 will get you a round of 100 sporting clays.  Each platform has two sporting clay machines that either shoot them high, low or doubles.  At first I was apprehensive, but by the end I was loading the gun and actually enjoying myself.  I ended up shooting 2 out of 10 sporting clays and I have to say I was pretty proud of myself at 20% for my first time. 

Sunblock, earplugs and water are necessary - lots of water, it is in the middle of the desert and the sun is a killer.  The staff is friendly and helpful; one employee even stopped by our area and offered us water. 

I can't say this is a new hobby of mine, but I'll be back every now and then to freshen up and practice."
4,"Kost is located on the 44th floor of the Bisha Hotel. The beautiful views of the CN tower and the city make the restaurant worth it alone! 

My friend and I made reservations to dine here for Sunday brunch. There was coat check available which we happily used. Service was attentive and the waiters never rushed us through our meal.

We both shared an avocado toast and an eggs Benedict with green chorizo. I also ordered a Jasmine Sloane tea. Both food items were delicious. The green chorizo, pico de gallo, and toasted bolillo bun definitely gave the dish a unique twist to the traditional eggs benny. The bread on the avocado toast could have been slightly toasted a bit more but it was not difficult to cut which was great. 

Overall, good meal and gorgeous city views. Excited to come back during the summer when the weather is warmer with the patio open!"
4,Having only ordered take out then this review is just for the food.  Big fan of the teriyaki steak/chicken.  Wife has tried the sushi and wasn't thrilled but said it wasn't bad.  Not much to choose in the area so just glad there is one close by to drive to.  Interior is a little bland and never seems busy so we'll probably stick to take out.
4,"The staff and vets at Lone Mountain are awesome.  The front desk staff have always been nice and friendly.  They took really good care of my bf's dog when he was sick, we had to eventually put him down but nonetheless, they were very compassionate.  We don't typically care which vet we see BC they are all nice."
4,"This is really good NY style pizza.  Thin crispy crust.  Go get a slice, it will take up 2 plates!"
4,"Yummy pancakes.. friendly staff.. great service. 
Go for it if you love pancakes. We went there on a Saturday morning place was busy but we got seats after 10 minutes of wait."
4,Good pizza  bit slow pick up service... good old pizza made almost Montreal style never had a bad pizza from there been around forever delivery service is reliable decent sized menu. Staff were friendly enough very busy kitchen no time to really chat with customers
4,"Eric C was right this place is indeed superior to Bamiyan.

Nice Afghan kebab spot at Markham and Finch.

Most definitely worth a try if in the area or craving kebab in the East end.

Tried the bar kebab and the meat itself and the spiced sauce tasted great together.

Try this place out you won't be disappointed."
4,"The food here is really good!! But I think there could be more meat in the dishes for the price they are. There was only one server and he was busy, but he was nice and was attentive the whole time. Overall, I would recommend this place to others stopping by!"
4,"I've been to Primp & Blow (North Scottsdale) probably over a dozen times now and am standing firm at about a 3.5 star rating.  I love getting a blow out and they are right next to my house and so convenient.  My hair always looks great after wich is all I can ask for.  If it weren't for occasional attitudes I've gotten here and there I'd probably be giving a 5 star review.  
I had an issue 2 times ago where I had a deal chicken I had bought just 2 days before (and clearly not used yet) but since she wasn't finding it on her end (even with my voucher and clearly no appointments since I had bought it).  The front desk girl was very rude and insisted she hold a credit card to charge if they didn't 'find' my deal chicken on their end with the only answer for me who had paid for the deal chicken being to check my Credit Card statement and if they charged me then call & take it up with Deal Chicken.  Sorry, but in my opinion that's something they should have been doing as I clearly had paid for the deal chicken and never used it.  So that's where I dock them some stars is the customer service area.
Last time I went I got a complimentary blow out with a new stylist in training so you absolutely can't beat that.  5 star on that experience! 

It's honestly a different experience every time I go, but I will continue to keep going as the end result is great hair (and sometimes great makeup) which is what I am going for!"
4,"I was recently in Scottsdale on business and needed someone to blow dry my hair and put in my clip on extensions. A friend suggested Primp & Blow.  The salon is gorgeous, and a great idea that they also offer makeup services... why aren't other blow dry bars offering that! I decided to get hair and make up done and it was perfect. Movie star glamorous. I went back the next day for a repeat performance. Very hospitable, experienced staff.  Highly recommend."
4,"Went out this morning for some sporting clays. I don't have much experience with other sporting clay facilities, but this one has, probably, everything that I would want. The counter attendant was great and pointed out that if we just buy 100 clays on a single card that we would save money over buying 50 a piece on two separate cards. Each station is fairly challenging. Solid mix of throws and it seems like no two stations are alike. They have 3 courses that cater to skill levels from beginner to mastery. We were on the rattlesnake/intermediate level course today. It is a clean, well-run facility and it helps when shooters properly dispose of their hulls. Had a great time."
4,"I absolutely love this place. My go to joint for a special night of pizza. I have definitely made a trip out to Ajax just to get my hands on their calzones and to introduce others to this joint. The place doesn't look very posh from the outside so a city folk may be hesitant to walk in. The location is a bit odd but since I was introduced to it by a local, I've been introducing it to plenty of other people who don't even live in the area. I suggest giving their pizzas and calzones a try. But don't eat with your eyes! Their portions are BIG! I typically cannot finish off a personal calzone and if I do, I'm out cold afterwards."
4,"Sadly it looks like there're only 3 Korean restaurants in PGH. :'( I'm debating about giving it 3 or 4 stars. The taste seems to be better than Green Pepper. But the portion is kinda small. Smaller than before at least. It seems the price is getting more expensive. 

I just really miss the Korean restaurants in SF now. (Tears)"
4,"A poke place near my house? Yippee! Have been impatiently waiting for Poki Point to open ever since I saw their sign as I leave the gym next door every morning! Alas, the day has come! Took my lovely daughter with me and we eagerly placed our order. A small bowl with brown rice for me and a large bowl with brown rice for her. I topped mine off with salmon and tuna in a combo of their house sauce and citrus yuzu. A scoop of spicy crab, onions, cilantro, micro greens, fried onion bits, a dash of seaweed flakes and a dollop of avocado for a $1 more. Every bite was delicious and the fish was so tender like butter! I will definitely be back again and again!


Can't get enough of this place! The staff is very friendly and of all the poke places we have been to in the valley, Poki Point gives you the biggest portions of fish! Love, love, love this place!"
4,"Best afghan food in the city by far, better than Bamiyan. 

Food:
If you're coming here for the first time try the ""Sardari Kabob"", It's a chicken breast and kofta kabob combination, you can have the best off both worlds on one plate and its marinated to perfection! Get extra garlic and hot sauce because that's one of the reasons I come here!

Avoid the KK fish though, looks delicious but its super dry!

Atmosphere:
Very cute! However it is cafeteria like style, you order your food at the front... when the food's ready they call you to pick it up. There are no servers!

Service:
Can be improved, cashiers aren't really that friendly."
4,"I come here for supplies when making tabbouli. And of course I stock up on pitas. They're absolutely amazing and made in-house so you know you're not only getting freshness but authenticity as well.
They carry a lot of fresh, made in-house items like hummus, baba ganoush, desserts and more.
I love that it's also a cafe where you can pop in for brekkie or lunch or shop and eat in one trip."
4,"Food was excellent here! Would definitely return.
We just happened to catch them on a bad day when the electronic system was not running very well...difficulty with payments and ordering leading to a 35 minute wait. But it was totally worth the wait with succulent meat that was well cooked.
I highly recommend the Chapli kebab. Great for something with a little bit of spice."
4,I purchased the Amazon Local blow out and make up application deal. Brie did a fabulous job giving me a retro cute look that lasted until the next day. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the eye makeup but it was fun. Brie also recommended a great mango drink and their great blowout and makeup special. The blonde was not as nice and really made me feel like she didn't want me there. It was also cool to see how they do the bead hair extensions for volume.
4,"This is a really cool Middle Eastern market with a counter top dining area.  You order at the register and either take it to go or sit around the perimeter of their kitchen area on stools.  They have a nice menu of classic pita sandwiches, salads and your favorite sides.  I tried the lamb burger.  It was terrific.  It had feta, arugula, pickled onions and a garlic mayo on ciabatta.  I'm missing something here but you get the idea.  I ordered in medium and it was perfectly pink throughout.  

They had live music on Saturday.  I enjoyed the music while I ate then strolled the market and sampled some olives, perused the hummus and baba ganoush selection and was tempted by the dessert case.  They have oils, bins of pulses and frozen imported delicacies and cheeses from far off lands.  They make their own pita and you can see the production line behind glass as you shop.  This place is totally worth checking out and I'll be back soon."
4,"So Prince sushi didn't used to be an AYCE and a couple years ago decided to jump on the bandwagon, this is obvious by their location which is at the AMC Theatres plaza and is small in size with about 15 smaller tables. There is almost always a wait and reservations are a must when I go. 

With all that said their sushi is really top grade, they have all the staples and a few more additional special rolls.

Upset about their shrimp tempura orders, has to come with 2 veggies per 2 shrimp tempura. I don't think that is fair at all, only sushi place to do this, as far as I know. That's like saying if you want 2 pieces of salmon sashimi, you have to eat 2 pieces of tomako (egg sushi) X_X

It is probably a deterrent for people not to mass order shrimp tempuras, but some people who don't eat raw fish (allergies/personal preferences ie some of my friends) like shrimp tempura and don't like fried vegetables?!?!? What are they suppose to do? 

Except for that fact this is a yummy, smaller, nice and clean restaurant. The staff is a little bit low though, a few times where I had to stand up to flag someone down."
4,"4 stars for breakfast, 3 stars for dinner! Avocado toast was SO amazing! Loved so much that I went back a second day. I'd get there around 7AM and would be the only one there. Great views of the CN Tower!

Dinner was loud and service was slow. Halibut was dry and not very flavorful."
4,"O.k., so this little Benny Fierro's has been in my neighborhood on the south side for quite some time and I have heard few things about their pizza.  My only experience was seeing gigantic pizza boxes laying out on garbage day that said Benny Fierro's on them.  ""Home of the Virginia Slice?""  Ummm...what does Virginia have to do with pizza?  So, I strolled in and ordered one slice of ham and pineapple Hawaiian style.  It was 5 dollars and I was expecting a rather big piece, so I did not order two. 
  2nd and third visits - I went back to this place for the specialty slice and liked it on the second try.  As a matter of fact I have changed my entire attitude since then.  I am not sure why I didn't exactly like the first time, but I have really liked their pizza since then.  It is one of my favorite places to buy pizza by the slice.  It is a good balance of ingredients and it is not overly greasey, which is a pet peave of mine.  The entire pie is sooo huge I don't think I would ever need that much pizza, but they are great to stop in for a quick bite.  Plus they have really interesting soda's and teas I can't find anywhere else."
4,"3.5 stars!

This was a great sushi place to try in Mississauga. My friend and I came here for dinner on a Monday evening.  I believe it is under the same ownership as Spoon & Fork, which I also love.  Prince has a simple AYCE menu and includes strictly Japanese dishes. 

Highlights: Udon noodle soup (noodles were tasty and chewy), fresh fish, great spicy maki and handrolls, and delicious green tea and mango ice cream!

Disappointments: Edamame, peanut satay sauce and udon soup were a little on the saltier side than what I'm used to at Japanese restaurants.

Service was great. They were very attentive, asked how we were doing, and constantly refilled our tea.

Atmosphere was somewhat modern, quiet and intimate.  It's not a large space, so I can see it getting really busy on weekends.

Prices were typical of any AYCE place: Mon-Thurs dinner: $20.99, and I believe weekend price was a couple bucks more.

I would definitely return to this restaurant again."
4,"WHAT TO TRY?!

I would come here early on a summer night and enjoy the view from the rooftop here. This place is known more so for its view of the city and the fact that you're on the rooftop. The doors open and the rooftop terrace space suddenly becomes bigger with the rooftop pool that ppl can swim in. I came right before it got too busy so we avoided lines downstairs and we got seated. 

It's generally packed in here on the winter days because the restaurant suddenly accommodates less people and a lot of ppl still want to come here for a drink or a bite. 

We came here for desserts. Unfortunately their freezer wasn't working so none of the desserts had ice cream accompanying the dessert and you can't order scoops of ice cream or sorbets. :(

I have to say despite no ice cream, the desserts we ordered tasted great. We had the chocolate molten lava cake and the tres leche cake. In comparison to the lava cake I had at Lee's, it's comparable! I actually liked the crunch I get from the edge of the cake. It would have been amazing if there was ice cream accompanying this cake, but I enjoyed it. The tres leche cake wasn't too sweet even though it had dulce de leche in here and the cake was very moist. Both desserts were delicious. 

At 9:30pm, this place was still very busy. Sometimes you want to spot some local celebrities too. I was fortunate to spot the hotels owner Charles Khabouth just walking around checking how the crowd is at the restaurant. This place was busy alright! Busy to the point there wasn't much room to stand or sit at the bar either! 

Overall, I'll come back here again to give their dinner menu a try!

LAST TIP?!

Make reservations. I can't emphasize enough about how busy this place gets and sometimes booking online is difficult. I suggest booking by calling or come one evening to make your reservation. Come check this restaurant out during the summer time when they open their full terrace and their pool and admire CN tower as your backdrop!! Also order their ice cream or sorbets because it's not your typical flavors you can try elsewhere."
4,"It's true what they say about Prince, the fish quality is excellent but the service (on most occasions) is below par. If you live in the west-end of the GTA Prince Sushi is a definite competitor, especially compared to the joints in Brampton. Decor is great, music is always piano or instrumental which is a plus. A reservation is a must, yes even on a Monday night.

I've been going to Prince for years, brought numerous parties and it's been consistent: good food, bad service. 

The one thing that gets me most about this place is the serving quantities. With the order sheets given to you, YOU choose how much of each item you want. It's ironic when you order a large quantity of salmon sashimi for two but still get a small order. No matter how many times I've been there, they don't take into account of regular customers and their needs. Every time I order 20-30 pieces of salmon, I really do mean I want 20-30 pieces but I'll end up with 10-15. I've even circled around the number of orders that I want but I never end up with it. I know this is partly due to the fact that they want to save on sashimi and fill you up with other menu items, but come on. 

Prince is known for their poor customer service. I've had a server spill hot tea on my friend and didn't really apologize (just shocked and awed). I've asked if it was possible to make a yam tempura roll seeing since they have all the ingredients but I was quickly denied with no explanation and then walked away. The servers that have been there longer aren't the nicest, but the newer ones are. 

I don't go there as often, but it's always my fall back place to go. 
Food 5/5 Service 3/5 - 4/5 overall"
4,"Awesome.  The sushi (especially the salmon) was good, tasted fresh, the lunch boxes come with a *ton* of food, and we were offered a couple of interesting specials on the house - tempura jalapeño and salmon skin rolls.  The boxes we ordered came with a hibachi item, and I got a delicious teriyaki steak, my mom got an equally tasty hibachi scallop.  Service was ""just okay"", our waitress seemed like kind of a noob. In a nutshell, to echo others, this is very good sushi at nasty sushi prices. Love it."
4,"Was there with 7 people on a Sunday afternoon. Made reservation for lunch although when I got there there wasn't too many people and there are plenty of tables so really didn't need a resrvation.  Inside is redesigned and very nice e and modern. Even the parking lot is new.

We ordered a cold platter app which comes with 4 cold apps and bread. Also got a huge mixed platter of meats to share as well as a pide  and extra skewers of grille meat. Followed by kenefe and tea. 

Gotta say thay that overall the food was great. The meats were grilled perfectly were juice and tender. The fresh bread is very nice. The cold humus babaganoush potato salad and eggplant was very nice and plentiful for us to share. The fires and rice on the side are good as well. Overall this place serves pretty decent middle eastern food compared to other spots. My favourite dish is the kinafe. It's much better than other places I've had it. 

This place is a good place to host people or come for an occasion but definitely not one for daily Turkish eating. There are cheaper Turkish options out there with similar food. But again for the quality of food and ambience and service the pretty penny is worth it."
4,"As a person who lived in Korea for three years I will definitely vouch for the authenticity. The portions are substantial. The only major difference from Korea is how much meat they pack into the dishes. I was very impressed with how meaty the dumplings (mandu) were. 

I have had Korean food in DC, St Louis and Oakland and by far Korea Garden has the boldest, truest spices. The kimchi is actually spicy and the spicy pork put a fire in my belly (in a good way). 

My wife ate kimchi stew and was also very happy. 

The server was very friendly and made sure my cup was always full. 

Cons: keeping Korea Garden out of the five star rank is the slightly high price range, lack of parking  and the servers lack of English. So speak Korean if you have any special requests.  If you order ""as is"" they understand the numbers and you really can't go wrong. 

I would give a 4.5 if possible. Delicious. If you want real Korean food in Pittsburgh, this is a must try."
4,"I'm craving their roti + malaysian curry right now.  The rest of the stuff, like their pho is average but what stands out is their thai / malay food. I really liek their skewers, and their curry.  It's small so if you go during a weekend, it might be hard to get a spot.  And their decor isn't exactly pleasant but if you're looking for some yummy coconut based curries, you should give this a try."
4,"This is a good one. Drive through is on it always, despite the fact that it's always slammed. It can be a little slow inside, but I've never had them make a drink incorrectly!"
4,"I have to say hair wise a five! Been to a few different dry bars. I always look for the groupons. By far best blow out I've had. And bonus to me, lasts more than one night.
Now service is a three. (Hence total rating four stars). The people were there, friendly, not as much. And no beverage offered. Not even water...some offer champagne. 
Overall I'd love another groupon. $35 seems much for a blow dry but I like the treat.
How do I contact or message you?"
4,"It's one of the best japanese restaurants. The food is fresh and I found the staff friendly. I only been there dinner twice, the price a little bit more expensive compared to other all you can eat restaurants for dinner  but I still think it's worth it. I especially liked the soft shell crab and the dragon rolls, the other stuff are good as well. The place isn't small but it isn't very big either so expect to line up durring normal dinner hrs, and the inside looks nice. You can't get the soft shell crab on the lunch menu, if you could I'd go there for lunch because it would be cheaper."
4,"Wasn't too crowded (it was a Friday morning ). Clean. Safe..alot of ""safety guards""  I liked the safety video at beginning to ensure everyone knows the rules."
4,"I have had Pizza Pino three times so far, and it's really amazing. One time, I ordered a Large and shared it with one other friend, we finally ended up finishing it within a week! (Meat Lover).

There are a LOT of cheese on there, so if you're a cheese lover, this is definitely your kind of pizza! I used to add extra cheese on my pizza everywhere else, but the regular Pino's cheese was a good amount for me already.

I would definitely recommend this for big groups, smaller groups (for two people etc.) maybe a small/medium would do.

Highly recommend."
4,"Very good ayce sushi.  This place has always seemed more about quality then quantity. Small and cozy with very limited seating which equals better service and food. I don't need a iPad to order thank you very much, I'll take human interaction. The sushi is on par with most non ayce places which is a good thing."
4,"Great pizza. Love the mounds of cheese piled on top. Had the Meat Lovers and Pino Special. Loved them both.
Have also tried the calzones. I was feeling adventurous and got The Monster. The thing was  ridiculously big! Only got through about a quarter of it. It was good...not great. 
Lastly, I also tried the wings. Now these, I was pleasantly surprised with! When I got the wings and noticed they weren't breaded, I didn't expect much. To my surprise, they were awesome! Nice size and very yummy. They tasted like actual chicken!
Pizza Pinos really is a hidden gem."
4,"Decent Korean food... granted, there aren't many good places in Pittsburgh for Korean food compared to NY, but this will do.  I only come here to get the Bulgogi lunch box special (around $8 plus tax and tip), which is not a bad deal.  It comes with salad, ONE (!) dumpling, rice, kimchi, and a miso soup.  Sometimes, they serve you hot tea for free (if they don't, you should just ask for it and they'll give it to you).  They don't really give you that many side dishes though, which is surprising and disappointing...

The service is not bad, it's usually a cute Korean girl running around to serve everyone.  The restaurant isn't that big, but it's not that small either (like Oiishi).  Parking can be hard to find since Korea Garden is tucked away in the slums of University of Pittsburgh off campus housing, as we affectionately call it, so it'll call for street parking.  I think there is a parking lot, but I haven't seen it yet.

Personally, I think Oiishi Bento has better Korean food :p but Korea Garden is not bad, especially for Pittsburgh."
4,"Great atmosphere and beautiful restaurant. Very reasonably priced. Pancakes were phenomenal, sourdough toast was great, but the eggs were a bit much ..... Not sure why one needs to eat 4 or 6 egg omelette ! But they were tasty too I suppose. Junior plates for the little ones is plenty! Quick polite professional service. We came from out of town and I wish there was a classy breakfast joint by us! A definite must for everyone."
4,"I went to the new P&B location at Scottsdale Waterfront to have my makeup done for Halloween (I was a flapper, and heavy eyeliner and red lipstick are foreign to me). Although there seemed to be some initial confusion about my appointment, it was short-lived and ended up being no big deal. 

Abby (spelling?), one of the stylists/makeup artists did my makeup. I just told her what my costume was, that I usually don't wear much makeup, and that I was open to her creative styling! You know how getting your makeup done can be hit-or-miss? Well, not only was Abby very friendly, but she did a great job! On top of that, I only paid $15 for the service, courtesy of a deal through AZ Spa Girls.

I felt so glamorous once I got all dressed up and hit the ""Speak Easy"" party with my other flapper gal pals. My makeup job and red lips lasted all night. Thanks again to Abby at P&B for helping make this Halloween spook-tacular!"
4,"Huge DC-style slices that take two plates to hold. One slice is all you need. Much better than any of the other slice places in the South Side. The sauce actually has flavor, and the cheese is a higher quality than the other shops the line E Carson Street.

They have pizza and nothing else. Cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and two pizzas of the month. No wings, no salads, no gyros, no pasta, unlike all of the other generic pizza places around the city that are completely undistinguishable from one another.

Not the best pizza in the world, but a good slice in a city where they are hard to come by."
4,"I consistently liked this banh mi joint since its opening a few years ago. Located in the heart of Latin Quarter, near UQAM, it's a perfect lunch spot for university students on a budget. The Vietnamese subs are decently priced at around $5 for a 7"", and they come with many options of fillings, both Asian and some more Western (ie BLT). I always order the Saigon one (Vietnamese sausage, pâté and cured meat) and I add the spicy peppers. Conveniently wrapped in a clean parchment paper bag, it keeps the bread crispy and warm--practical when hopping back to the campus! I don't understand why some ratings are low: if you're up for milder Vietnamese street food, this is the place to go since the seasoning is less strong than most other banh mi places. The soy sauce is dosed reasonably, there is no excess of fish sauce and the sour, pickled vegetables are kept to a minimum while the mayo is spread diligently. Vietnamese food has the terrible characteristic of being too salty, but this sandwich keeps it decent, since you can ask for a reduction of soy sauce in your sandwich."
4,"Great shooting range. Similar to other county ranges I have been to. Very structured and safe. The only thing that bothered me there, and I understand that the range officials are just doing their job, is that sometimes it's really annoying how they micro mamage everything and look you almost over the shoulder. Even when we were taping the target, one of them came over criticizing and taping it for us. Too much. But I like shooting. So I will be back."
4,"The food was good, wish I had some more feta on the Greek fries. I did enjoy the falafel and the chicken. The service took awhile for take-out but it was still an overall good experience."
4,Massive serving size (always packing some take home). Good quality food. My family patrons this place often... for the price you can't go wrong.
4,They have awesome hummus and pita bread! They just put a new cafe in not too long ago with a large menu.
4,"Non ce n'est pas la grande gastronomie en terme de cuisine asiatique, mais si vous voulez manger sur le pouce des plats exotiques ou vous rafraichir avec des Bubble Tea, c'est LA place! 
Le service est rapide et pas cher, et ça change des sandwichs basiques à manger en 3min sans véritable saveur.
Très bien placé, sur St-Denis, à proximité du métro Berri-Uquam!"
4,"Been coming to Lemon Grass for about 5 years: good food, kitchen works quickly, generous entree portions (I seldom order side dishes) and I know I can expect decent service every time I come here.  

Vietnamese pho is on target but their Laksa is not Singapore style. The Hainanese Chicken Rice is closer but still not quite the same if you are searching for the authentic Singapore version. That said, the spring onion-ginger mix that comes with the dish is sooo fragrant. Goes perfectly with the chicken but I can eat it with absolutely anything. Hmm... I think I can even eat it straight!"
4,My favorite sushi buffet restaurant in Mississauga! Love the fresh sashimi and coconut shrimp. They also have raw beef and spider rolls. Service is fast. The restaurant is quite small so make sure you make dinner reservations.
4,"Lots of food.  Good quality.  Much better than the other chain options for breakfast.

Could use some sound dampening."
4,"Great decor, and even better food. We ordered the mixed meat pide, grilled chicken and the steak. Would recommend to anyone curious to try Turkish cuisine."
4,"LOVE this location. Rarely have any issues with my drinks, when I do they are happy to remake it. The staff is really great and friendly especially the evening shift! My wait is usually not lengthy. 

I would however like more comfy seating. I would love it even more if it was a bit bigger. It tends to always have a lot of patrons enjoying some amazing Starbucks!"
4,"Good range for zeroing or just for paper target practice. Beware if you go on Saturday or Sunday, there is usually a wait to get a lane and it is 45 minutes of down time for ever 15 of shooting. This is because during ceasefire they have to clear every weapon on the line and then everyone has to set up and take down targets, usually takes 35 to 45 minutes. Youll get about three rounds of shooting in in three hours on these days."
4,I would recommend this place to any one they were very good with my dog I like how they took them out to bathroom before I pick them up
4,"I'll admit, I usually come here after a fun time at Jimmy D's or Carson's, but this place has consistently kept me coming back (even in my not so level headed state of mind, oops)!!

With ginormous slices of cheesy goodness, it's a hard stop to resist.

Also, it might be a good idea to wear a dress or stretchy pants that day. You're welcome."
4,shot at ben avery today.  i have to say it was great during a week day morning not much going on. seemed nice without heavy crowds. i like the prices on entry and targets. i will be back very pleased. i definitely  see the pro's compared to indoor ranges. loved the outdoors today. great time.
4,"Four-and-a-half. ****'

What a glorious pie. I only tried two varieties of pizza here and have not explored other menu options. But wow do I wish I had this in college on those nights where a bunch of us were seized with a case of drunken-haze munchies. This would have definitely hit the spot.

I had two slice of their small delivered to a friend's house. I enjoyed it so much it warranted an order of their namesake special in the medium the very next day. The crust is on the thin side, but is sturdy and does not fold. It has a nice texture with a good balance of give and a bit of crunch, able to support the toppings. Sauce is well immersed into the pie, without squirting or bleeding out on a bite and without the offending tartness of sauces on pizzas of lesser joints. But the CHEESE. If you don't like cheese, don't bother coming here. I suspect---but I could be wrong--- that there are two layers of cheese: one thin one to anneal the toppings to the pie and another thicker wave that is in direct exposure to the oven heat (leading to spots of caramelized cheese at the topmost layer). The result? A wonderful pie layered in both texture and flavour leading to a more dimensional mouthfeel. Really my only gripe with this pizza is the pepperoni--- I'm a sucker for curled in crispy pepperoni and that can only happen if the pepperoni is at the very top layer. Otherwise, Pizza Pino comes highly recommended."
4,"Great pancakess - light and fluffy, not too filling. Hubby had strawberry french toast, also delicious. Visiting from Georgia...highly recommend. Found thisnplace and came due to Yelp reviewers positive comments. Great choice!"
4,Bring your appetite as portions are a fair size as well as your patience.  I had dinner here on the weekend and it was very busy.  Customers were placing their take out/dine in orders over the counter and the lineup moved slowly.  Two thumbs up for the chicken kebab as it had a good flavour served with plenty of rice.
4,"huge portions for a plate for $11.30, and they take credit card without additional charge as well. The portions for dining in, I perceived it to be bigger than ordering take out. 

Note:
-small salad portions (From other places, its a big salad portion and small rice, but this place is the other way around).
-Long wait for food, but it's understandable seeing that it looks like they doing everything by the order and fresh.
-doesn't give enough sauce."
4,"A force of 7 of us descended on this place for my friend`s birthday celebration day: lunch, primp and blow and fondue later that evening!!
We were all lined up and greeted with mango mimosas, yum!! Considering our size group, they were wonderful with us and had us all done in less that two hours.My stylist Bri did exactly what I wanted: wash, shampoo and blow out with a hint of a retro wave. Loved it!! Would I come back again, definitely!! Great place for  blow out, style, make up bar,etc!"
4,"Great little pizza joint in the South Side. Small menu, easy ordering. Pizza slices are New York style, thin and crunchy crust. Slices are huge 12"" slices. Mine had pepperoni and sausage. You either have to fold it in half or hold it with both hands, and that's pretty much not enough. Great pizza, traditional taste, pepperoni and sausage were tasty, good sauce. Dependable everytime we go, excellent pizza!!!!"
4,"We have grabbed a slice here several times.  They definitely get the prize for the biggest slice in town.  The pizza is very good and they always have a few speciality slices to choose from.  My only gripe is consistency.  Most of the time the pizza is hot, fresh and good.  Sometimes, like this visit, it seemed like it was old pizza that was ""jazzed up"" a bit.  Mine was a spinach and ricotta slice, which was pretty tasty.  The cheese slice that was given to my kids seemed to have been sitting a while, so they just threw on some new cheese on the top and put it in the oven.  Maybe it was just because it was for the kids?!"
4,"This place is a little hole in the wall with pretty great food. I went for the first time and got a traditional gyro and my boyfriend got a chicken skewer pita, all of which was very good. I also got a Baklava that was delicious. Nothing was out of this world, which is why I can't give five stars, but I would definitely go back!"
4,"I decided to try a pizza place that I have heard, time and time again, is the best in Durham Region.  I have had amazing pizza in Little Italy in downtown Toronto and this is not that. However, if you compare the quality of this pizza to the chains available in Durham this place wins hands down. The regular crust is halfway between regular and deep dish. I am a crust and dough lover so it really appealed to me. The flavor of the dough was also great and not overpowered by the rest of the pizza. It was crisp around the edges and bottom and had a great soft chew throughout the rest.  The cheese could be a bit better quality but you can't argue with the amount that they put on. The toppings were also used in good amounts. I had the personal size XS which was under $10 with 3 toppings.  I ate the whole thing and I was STUFFED. The decor is very dated but I personally think that only adds to experience. Add 10 Bikers or 10 Brooklyn accented Italians and you would think that money is being laundered in the back room behind the drapes. Definitely going back here. Not the best pizza I have ever had BUT definitely the best pizza in Durham."
4,"Chocolate chip pancakes were amazing! No need for syrup.

Bacon pancakes are as expected, a wonderful achievement of the modern culinary movement.

For everyone complaining about the parking lot, grow a set. It's a hard right turn, get over it.

Service was excellent. Management watched over like a hawk, and greeted all patrons."
4,"I forgot how good The Original Pancake House is. Their breakfast is so delicious! My favorite is the strawberry pancakes which comes with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and house made strawberry syrup. Their omelettes are very good as well. Their portions are huge and prices are good. 
Definitely worth eating @ Pancake House."
4,"I would give this place a 4.5.  The only drawback is that it can get crowded since it's one of the few Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh.  This restaurant isn't known for it's decor, but the food is great!  

FOOD:  We always get the ja-jang myun which is very flavorful.  We also got the hot braised chicken, which is fried (not too greasy) and spicy enough to taste the flavor of the chicken.  We also got the seafood fried rice, which I like better than the Chinese version.  Overall, the food is great and the price is reasonable.

TIP:  Parking is hard to find, so good luck in finding street parking!"
4,"As far as Korean food goes, it is authentic. However in Pittsburgh, don't imagine that the Korean restaurants are on par w/ places in other urban centers. It's sort of the place I go to when I'm desperate to eat Korean food. 

Korea Garden is actually pretty decently priced for Korean food. 

There is a upstairs room if you come with a large group. And they are very accommodating.

Parking can be a challenge though."
4,"My husband and I stopped for lunch here the other day.  We both are big sushi eaters and so we can be a little snobby when it comes to sushi.  Osaka is a nice little restaurant tucked into probably the wrong strip of stores--it should relocate to an area with better stores or more traffic.  Either way, really nice young guy sat us and was our waiter, very polite and brought us a crab tempura-like appetizer for free to try.  We ordered about six rolls and some sashimi and steamed dumplings. They have really unique rolls I must admit!  I've not had sushi with all the different little sauces they top the rolls with.  Fresh and well made, not too big, not too small.  We sat outside which was nice and quite.  I think we will add this spot to our sushi rotation."
4,"This place is a must for my friends and I every time we gather. The service is nice and the food is just awesome. We almost always get the seafood hotpot, bulgogi, and seafood pancake. They are very.generous about the side dishes.

If you're lucky, you'll find a parking in front of the restaurant. Otherwise, it'll a pain. I really like the home-like atmosphere, feels warm and inclusive."
4,"This restaurant is located inside an enclosed mall and the stores/ restaurants here close early. So do not be surprised if you find this mall a bit deserted on weeknights.  

I came here after my friend gave us the recommendation.  I had the pho special large.  The soup broth is flavourful and noodles were good.  The pho here isn't bad and I consider it to be one of the better ones in Markham.  

If you ever have a craving for pho.  Check this place out!"
4,"We've been regular customers of LMAH almost the entire time we've had our Catahoula Leopard dog, Chelsie. I admit, we didn't do such a great job of socializing her, so she gets over-excited and anxious at the vet's office. While I'm not saying, ""Hey, if you have a nervous, poorly socialized dog, feel free to unleash your demon at this vet's office"", I am thankful that the staff is so understanding, patient, tolerant and caring of *our* personal demon.

Dr. Amy Munchausen (yah, that's her real name!) is a wonderfully caring vet and will definitely try to obtain the correct diagnosis for an ailment. Chelsie had a brief period where she had protein in her urine. Although we never found out exactly why Chelsie had proteuria, Dr. Munchausen didn't immediately prescribe a bunch of drugs or treat Chelsie like a medical experiment. Yes, the urinalysis every few weeks was a little pricey, but it was worth it to see the problem cleared up on its own."
4,"Really enjoyed this place. My sister kept talking about it so we decided to give it a go. Their portions are big so be prepared to pack some up or share with someone. We got chicken kebabs combo, quail combo and a wrap. The meats are super juicy, tender and well marinated. The rice is moist and fluffy. The naan isn't your typical naan, it's a little harder, smaller and thicker but nonetheless really good. I am absolutely in love with their hot sauce and garlic sauce. If I can get a pail of each and eat it with everything, I would.

Service is self-serve (food court) and a little slow but I think it's because they make all their meats fresh to order so we didn't mind waiting longer even though I was starved. I would definitely come back!"
4,"Kandahar kabab and Chicken breast kabab are my favorites. Very busy on the weekend nights, be prepared to wait for 45-60 minutes after ordering."
4,"I came here for dinner after my boyfriend's last exam to (mini) celebrate and really enjoyed the food here. 

I made a reservation, so luckily I was able to be seated asap. Of course the view was nice, but I didn't get one of the booths near the window. Besides the view, the decor was pretty minimal, boho chic which went great with the romantic environment.

The service could have been better, but maybe it was really busy??
The servers was really nice throughout our meal but were not quite that attentive. 

We started off with the Kost Sangria ($18) & the stella cider ($12)
Honestly, get the cider, skip the expensive af cocktails. Like my 20 dollar sangria was pretty good, but at like 20 bucks... nope

Food wise, they killed it, i loved everything.
The fried calamari ($15) came first and oh my godddddddd, it was the lightest batter I have ever had. Crispy, light and NOT greasy. highly highly recommend this. 

Charcoal grilled octopus ($19) was also done very well. I can't quite tell what the sauce was, but it was a great pair with the octopus. It was also cooked to a good tenderness level and was  not chewy and gummy like. Probably my least fave dish, but still a good dish.

Roasted Lamb Cutlets ($45) this was bit pricey.. but lamb ain't cheap so, i let it slide. If you can look aside the 50 bucks you're tossing, this dish was very well thought out. The pickled eggplant and yogurt puree really brought this dish over the top. The tangy pickled eggplant and vinegar was balanced by the yogurt puree. These flavours added a kick to the lamb and made this dish really memorable. 

Overall, I would come here again.. maybe for brunch. A little on the loud side though, but a good place to hang with your girlfriends or a date."
4,Great location with a drive-thru. I never have to wait too long for a drink when I walk on or use the drive-thru. The beverages are made the way I order them and I have never had any issues.
4,"We finally tried this place after wanting to for a long time! We were not disappointed. Friendly staff. It's not in the best location as it is out of the way, but the pizza is delicious! I love a pizza with the perfect ratio of cheese, dough and toppings and they definitely had that. We had their Spivak special with pepperoni, bacon, sausage and pineapple. Their small size looked like a medium-sized pizza!
While you wait for your pizza, you can have a beer on draught or any other alcoholic beverage since they are licensed to serve alcohol."
4,"It's so pretty in here! It has a laid back beach vibe. Staff are nice, food is tasty and different. I had the K?st breakfast and my husband had the Green Chorizo and Egg Bowl. Came here for a birthday brunch and they gave us a complementary salted caramel ice cream dessert. Yum . Will try to come back again on a weekend for brunch."
4,"Food: Great variety and very tasty. Love all their little side dishes (soft shell crab, beef tataki, butter mushroom...YUM!!!)
Service: Not the worst but, definitely could improve a bit. Few time we've walked in and had to wait few quite a bit before they even say hi to you when the restaurant wasn't even busy. One time we asked to sit on the booth and they said no and would rather save it for a bigger party which was fine and understandable, until another couple walk in after us and got it right away... 
Prince Sushi is one of my favourite sushi place in the GTA, food is always good!"
4,"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and a few of his friends and I have to say I was very happy with the food and the service. The staff was friendly and wasn't overbearing. I would say they had a good handle of our table and seem to come to clear dishes and provided more tea at a good pace. 

This was an all you can eat sushi place and the menu I would say was a good size. The sashmi was very good, very fresh. All the other items we ordered were good too. 

I would come back next time I was in the area."
4,"Always prompt service, hot coffee, and great food, I just wish they served pumpkin pancakes year round! Although the super-pulpy orange juice isn't my favorite."
4,Second time coming here. Fresh fresh seafood and chicken. The bowls are delicious and you can choose the toppings you want-- which are many. My son loves the house special sauce- I prefer good old teriyaki. My favorite is the fresh ginger toppings.  Staff is helpful and friendly!
4,Great pizza!! I order the Meat Lovers and the Pino special.... I recommend the Pino special.   Pizzas were cooked nicely and had the right amount of toppings.   The Pizzas were very filling.   I'm off to try the monster panz....will write a review about it
4,"Spicy soup ,Shrimp fried rice and Teriyaki were so good. Good service.
The price was pretty high."
4,"If I lived in NYC and had this pizza, I wouldn't return, BUT Pittsburgh's pizza selection is really wildly low.  I will visit BF's again because we are in Pittsburgh.   I have only been once and here is my review.  The crust was correct for a NYC pizza and that is about impossible to find around here.  Most Pittsburgh pizzas are undercooked and even if you get a pizza cooked enough the crust is super chewy.  Benny's pizza is not super chewy, it is like what you would get in NYC with a nice crunch and a tender center.  The sauce was a little light on flavor.  It could use a little more cheese.  I will return, but like I said, if this was in NYC, I wouldn't.  This is the closest place to a NY slice in Pittsburgh.  Interestingly, they only have whole pizzas that are huge for $30 or more.  I don't mind that too much, but wish they had one other size.  I am happy they ONLY serve pizza and have limited selection of toppings.  That is what you want because the quality can be high and ingredients fresh. NO wings and other stupid things, thank goodness!"
4,Went shooting at Ben Avery for the first time a couple weeks ago and it wasn't bad at all! The staff was friendly and the lanes were pretty spacious so we had wiggle room. It was pretty packed so we had to wait about 30 mins to get on. But you're only paying $7 for an ALL DAY pass vs $15 for an hour at the indoor places. Obviously in the summer time I may make a different decision but all around I think this will be my go to range moving forward.
4,"We have been using the Archery range been out three times now, not been overly crowded the times we have gone. It is a ways out of town so make sure you go prepared, take any tools you might need for field fixes the drive time to run back home then out again is about an hour for me, also advise taking some water, they have drinking fountains around but its so much easier to keep an ice chest handy. We did on last trick see a couple of the wild burros from Lake Pleasant running around, over all we enjoy the place."
4,"I'm not much of the yelp reviewing type -- but, I feel the need to throw some love to Primp and Blow as the reviews on here are ... rough! I was just at Primp and Blow on Monday, Oct. 3rd for a blow-out for a charity event I was going to that night. I had a blow-out, scalp massage and make-up. My 4-stars is only because there wasn't anyone at reception when I walked in and the stylist didn't offer assistance until I asked for help. When the hostess came out, she was very friendly, super accommodating and immediately offered me a bevy of different refreshments. My stylist, Sarah, did a great blow-out, asked what look I wanted and consulted on the look for my make-up. She did a really great job on my 'Primping' - she seemed intuitive of my likes/dislikes on make-up and talked through choices while working on me. I tell you what ... after a long day at work, nothing more efficient and relaxing than having someone do your hair and make-up for an important night out. All I had to do was slip into my dress when I got home. My yelp profile picture is hair and make-up by Sarah at Primp and Blow."
4,Great for pigging out on sushi 11am to 3pm with their half price sushi special.  We order so many rolls we cant even count them because its so cheap.  Not that non Japanese people cant roll me some nice sushi but I like to see actual Japanese people preparing my food at a sushi place and this place has it.  Very spacious and nice staff.  You can seriously go to town on a ton of sushi and not pay more than $20 if you go during the half price time.
4,Love this pizza shop.  The pies have so much cheese on them and they have a bunch of ingredients on hand to customize.  I wish the price was a little less tho
4,"I haven't fired a gun in probably 20 years. So when Jen suggested we get a group together to head to a shooting range, I was all on it. Jen and Travis have an array of guns. The .22 Luger was my favorite, and the one with the most accuracy."
4,"Came here after seeing this place featured on a Toronto blog on Instagram (the usual) and thought the views and food looked amazing. It was rainy and slightly foggy upon our arrival but the bright atmosphere and palm trees inside the restaurant made it feel like it was a warm, sunny day. 
Knocked off one star because the service, as some other reviews state, was AWFUL. It took forever to order and took a while for the food to come out.
I get hangry, and definitely was hangry while waiting for my food.
Luckily the food was good- i got the Mojo de Ajo Tofu, and never knew tofu could taste that good. It was topped with mushrooms, onions, and chermoula - it was seasoned perfectly. 
My sister got the branzino, and although i'm not the biggest fan of branzino, i found it quite enjoyable. 
We also got shishito peppers and fries as sides and while nothing to write home about, they were still enjoyable. 
K?st itself is located inside Bisha Hotel which is hella swanky and very modern.
In conclusion, food is good, nothing new or exciting, but basic fare with a great view. 
If you need some new Instagram pics, this is probably your best bet in Toronto."
4,"I'm a regular visitor to Pittsburgh and everytime I come, my husband and I try our best to hunt for good Korean food (hard to find in Pittsburgh). We went here for the first time on a recent Sunday for lunch, and it was bustling with Korean people slurping their soups and noodles, splitting big plates of bossam (steamed pork belly)... mmmm.... I love going into Korean restaurants where the special menu items are written in Korean and hanging on the wall.

We ended up ordered jajangmyun and tangsooyuk -- the Korean riff on Chinese black bean noodles and sweet and sour meat (in this case, beef.) It really hit the spot. 

Korean food options are limited in Pittsburgh, but Korea Garden is a place I'd go again and again."
4,Yet another solid sushi joint in the Charlotte area. It is technically in Matthews but it is basically in Mint Hill.I went here on a rainy week day when New Zealand Cafe had a long wait. The service was great. The shrimp tempura appetizer was good as was the spring rolls. My ginger dressing on  my ginger salad tasted kind of funny and wasn't good. I got the 16 piece sashimi with sushi platter. I was disappointed you only got 4 types of sashimi and would have liked to see more variety. The fish was great quality. My friend enjoyed his spider roll and california roll. I would say third best in the area after New Zealand Cafe and Room 112.
4,"Kost is a light and airy restaurant located on the 44th floor of Toronto's new Bisha Hotel. 

My friends and I intended to go for brunch, but KOST only offers brunch on weekends, not even on holidays. I definitely found that surprising and a bit disappointing. We ordered off the lunch menu instead, and despite my initial disappointment, I was happy with my grilled ahi tuna steak sandwich. The fish was fresh, and the sandwich was overflowing with fillings. The sandwich filled me up for the entire day. I'd recommend getting the sandwiches from the lunch menu for the greatest bang for your buck.

I'll definitely be back to check out the brunch menu as well as the rooftop patio experience! 

PS: make reservations before you go as the restaurant fills up quickly! KOST is on OpenTable so it's a super easy process!"
4,A friend originally introduced me to this place for the pho which was quite good - tried the rare beef (good) and the spicy satay (excellent). I've been back lots and times and discovered the curry was amazing; I usually go for the curry brisket. Order it with the crepe (or flatbread - I forgot what it was on the menu) as it's much better than just the rice.
4,"When I want good quality sushi and don't want an AYCE sushi then I usually go to Prince Sushi. For AYCE I like Heart Sushi, because of the tablet system.
I like the cozy ambience and the way it's neatly and well furnished, making it look slightly upscale but yet casual. I've been here several times and seems to be one of the few restaurants that get filled up in that area of Courtney park, while several other surrounding restaurants get literally no customers all day.

Service is always good whereby the water is constantly being refilled. I really enjoy the sushi as they don't fall apart and are a good size. Although recently due to my experience at Hiro Sushi, my standards for sushi has gone a tad higher. But nevertheless, the quality of food is good and this is my to-go-sushi place. 
I've also got the Udon noodle bowl once, which was a good large size with a subtle and pleasant flavor.

So, if you're looking for good quality sushi without breaking the bank then this place is definitely worth a shot."
4,"My friend has been going to this location for a few months and trying (unsuccessfully) to get me to go. I thought on it. I thought on it and finally I gave in last month. I figured I sometimes like to play the healthy game and I should go and get this done. I was a little curious. 

When I first arrived I decided to get a detox foot bath. I was instantly asked if I would like water or some tea. I opted for the tea. Bad idea! The tea was fabulous and I bet all of you will love it. My friend does. She enjoys it. However, my hands started to shake from it and I could feel my anxiety rise. So if you are already nervous, perhaps your first time stick to the water. 

The detox foot bath was interesting. My feet started to itch from the impulses in the water, but not too bad to be annoying. The water got DISGUSTING. Which it is supposed to! They do tell you the water would change colors regardless and you should read the flyer in the room. They lowered the lights and only checked in once. It was really relaxing and as I was stressing about my next step, well... it was a good start. 

My lovely technician entered and I was soon on my way to the colonic. It was just a comedy of errors from there. They let you maintain your modesty by inserting the device. However, being (1) nervous (2) unfamiliar and (3) a girl of some substance (aka fat). I couldn't get it in. So this stranger had to help with angling and we were now best friends. I mean this is normally something I leave to AFTER someone has bought me dinner and for that kind of thing? Jewelry. 

Now the procedure started. At first it was just a strange feeling of water going where water shouldn't be. Then I started sweating and getting intense pains. I started to rethink every moment in my life that had led me to this point. I felt like my poor insides were being ripped open. Then I did that whole 'push' thing. Let's just say.... modesty is over. I refused to do it while she was in the room, so I think she sensed my panic and horror and left. I was given a warm compress for my abdomen. 

Then I noticed the tube. I was a little sad I didn't watch what came out from the beginning. My poor insides felt like every bad hentai movie I had heard of. It was painful and horrible. So you are thinking why the review number? Just wait for it. It will be legendary. She comes back in and puts in some probotics right when I was like please Lord let this stop. See? I found a lot of religion in that first session. I prayed I wouldn't die. I prayed it wouldn't kill me. You know all the prayers. When relief came and it was over. I stood up and handled the rest of the business.

I was a little light headed when I got up (which also could have been from the earlier tea). Then I went to pay and ... wait for it... got more sessions. Yes. I was curious why I said yes too.

My SECOND session (I know this is a long review) was completely different. I just drank water, I turned down the tea. That left me less shaky feeling (again, this is JUST me I think. My friend loves it). I figured out how to insert and it was far less traumatic. I knew what to expect and the pain wasn't even close to bad. In fact, I felt like I could fall asleep during the process. It was a night and day difference. I made jokes more this time and used the massager which was amazing. So all in all, it's a must do. I feel better. My mind feels less hazy and I really do feel detoxified. Each time I get one done it's like I feel a little more clean and a little more comfort. I would completely recommend this place."
4,"I've had a lot of banh mi in my lifetime.  And banh mi really varies with preference and what 'region' of Vietnamese food you're most familiar with.  I was a bit skeptical given the lukewarm reviews and the McRestaurant feel of this place (it's like a Subway if Subway did banh mi) - also, it's by all the bars on St.-Denis so they aren't exactly serving a picky audience -- but decided to give it a go.

Welp - I liked it.  It ticked the major boxes for me: 'chewy' baguette with a rich mouthfeel.  What was very unusual for me was that they used garlic butter in their house special, which really adds to the flavour.  I could see some people finding the garlic intrusive though.

Definitely not the best I've had -- but probably one of the better banh mi spots I've go to in North America."
4,"Quite tasty Korean food.  My Korean friends like this place, which is how I discovered it.  I would go with a group of at least 3 - 4 people so you can order several dishes and share.  It will cost around $15/person this way."
4,"Note: OPH's parking lot is perilously hard to get into, particularly on weekends. I advise you to go there late in the morning or early in the afternoon during the week. We tried to visit at least twice before only to leave in frustration because we could not find a parking spot.

With that word of guidance, I can candidly say that The Original Pancake House was worth the effort. Kay and I each had an unplanned day off last week, and we knew this would likely be our best chance to go. Arriving at around 11AM, we were at first dismayed to find the lot full yet again after traveling that winding, mountainous, nearly endless road to what comes off as a shining castle in the sky, but before we could even think of turning back, a silver-haired gent in an equally cinereal luxury car began to pull out. With glee, we took that vacated space, entered the restaurant, and were seated with no wait whatsoever.  

Kay and I were welcomed by a greying, urbane, sociable, modish, and towering fellow I'll refer to as The Brunchman. He was elated that we finally made it and seemed to be precognitive; we felt he knew us despite never having met him. 

""You've come to us at last,"" he declared as he gracefully skirred towards an empty and clean table with Kay and I in pursuit.

Just as we sat down, our young, lanky, bespectacled server appeared before us seemingly instantaneously. Her name was (I think?) Nicole, and she is not only an aspiring model but also previously hailed from Kay's general area. In Nicole, we both made a new friend, discussing concerts, food, and life with her as we indulged on delecacies from OPH's expansive bill of fare.

When I saw that the strawberries came with fresh whipped cream, I knew what my first course would be considering my obsession with said dairy product. The strawberries themselves were ripe and pure. In a separate bowl came an alabaster cloud of felicity, and through the cloud were the strawberries dredged, making for simple, natural pleasures of the palate.

A Crabcake Eggs Benedict came next, and with that, my lone complaint. Hollandaise Sauce is a tricky thing to master. I've tried to make it myself with somewhat mixed results. In this case, it simply tasted like warmed over, unseasoned egg yolks. However, the eggs were poached expertly, the duo of crabcakes were crammed with genuine crustacean meat, the buttery English muffins were plush, and the pink remoulade, the dish's saving grace, was such a wedding of tangy and creamy that the bland Hollandaise sauce was easily overpowered and forgotten.

Psst. Brunchman. My mom will sell you her Hollandaise recipe. 

Kay had the Coconut Pancakes, which were as crispy as they were fluffy and came with exquisitely airy whipped butter as well as an edibly esoteric ""hot tropical syrup"" that evoked sheer Paradise with its fruity sugariness. Also eaten by Kay was an order of Corned Beef Hash. I found the large, chunky, auroral potatoes to be flawless and the plentiful corned beef to be as keenly kosher and arcanely flavorful as any I've ever had, but Kay didn't like it as much as I did, sadly enough. Thankfully, her pancakes made her happy.

Enter: The Dutch Baby. My mother had spoken of it in whispers when telling me of her experience with the North Hills OPH. Since it takes 20 minutes to prepare, it is recommended that one order it with the rest of brunch. 

Minutes before it was placed in front of me, The Brunchman dramatically gave me a consultation. 

With his eyes ablaze and his long arms oscillating as if he was about to cast a spell, he said ""Take the butter, spread it...AROUND the interior of the...errr...baby. Then squeeze some lemon onto it and dust it with the powdered sugar."" After his lecture, he kissed his fingers and floated away, asking rhetorically with a beam across his lips, ""You'll be back tomorrow morning, no?"" 

When it was ready for service, I followed The Brunchman's instructions closely. The Dutch Baby is not a pancake; it is a bowl of doughy love, made lardy by the butter, lightly sweet by the powdered sugar, and acidic by the lemon. However, something was amiss. Syrup! I drizzled some onto the puff, and Nicole leaped forward to stop me only to be held back gently by the grinning Brunchman. He pressed a finger to her lips, shook his head, and looked my way only to nod in approval. 

""I was hoping you'd do that,"" The Brunchman said. ""I forgot to mention the syrup. You did well, young man."" 

The syrup would be what took this pudding-like dish, also known as a Bismarck, into Shangri-la. 

As I finished, The Brunchman provided a history lesson, and Nicole spoke with us some more, this time about her cosmetology goals and former places of employment. Kay and I were so taken by the OPH's hospitality, we almost forgot that we weren't at someone's home and had other plans for the day. Although our hunger had been abated, we felt compelled to stay...and return..."
4,"We've passed by Pasha multiple times but the construction outside may be hindering people from actually going here. Once you enter, it definitely feels upscale - plush red booths, beautiful decor with tile work and lanterns and a warm welcome. 

We ordered: 
Manti 
Sucuk pide 
Mix platter 
Lamb seesh plate 

We got the pide first - sucuk was delicious and I think they used fresh cheese with was oh-so-good. Next, manti was on the smaller portion size but the quality was really good and consistent. Dare I say, Turkish Manti is better then Afghan Mantu? 

Next, we received both the mix platter and lamb seesh. Mix platter was MASSSIVE! Easily could feed three people, juicy chunk of beef, lamb and chicken, served with pickled radish and rice. 

The taste was amazing, slightly on the medium well side but personal preference, I like it medium or medium rare. 

Service was top notch, my water was always filled and they were courteous and friendly. I would say, this is one of the best places to eat in Thorncliffe Park. It is definitely on the pricey side, our bill came to $100 with tax and tip. I think it'd be great for a special dinner or a birthday dinner with friends, it can easily fit close to 80-100 people. Lots of space and I hope it does well - this particular place in this strip mall has a tendency to not to well (Burger King, some Carribean place, another Turkish place have been in this exact location before Pasha opens). 

Highly recommend!"
4,I've been coming here for a long time. I am just amazed by the size of the portion of food they give you like it is big enough to feed at least 3 people I usually get the Kandahar kabob they also have other delicacies such as Mintoo which is like a dumpling definetly worth the price
4,"I have been shooting here for over 5 years, This is the cheapest range to shoot at in the state!  You can go out to 200 yards at the main range for $7 all day.  They have a lot of lanes so there is always interested people to talk to and cool guns to talk about.  I give 4 stars because they are a little to strict on safety, I know ""you can never be to safe around guns"" but the range officers here don't even let you put a spotting scope to your eye-you have to keep your safety glasses on your eyes!  How can I see a hole in a paper target at 200 yards without being able to use the spotting scope?
The bow and arrow range is great as well."
4,"I'm seriously starting to love Vietnamese food. I've been craving a decent ""Bahn mi"" sandwich now for some now. I've bookmarked this place thanks to reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a shot yesterday.

I was NOT disappointed! I went with the BBQ Pulled Pork and the Grilled Chicken. Both were good but the Pulled Pork was out of this world! And for what... $3 each? SAY WHAT?!?

They have nice variety of sandwiches (at least 30!) as well as have bubble tea, iced coffee, and pre-made meals including sushi. 

If you buy a pre-made meal you get a free spring roll!!!

SAY WHAT?!?

The service is OK but ordering from a lady who can't understand English or French and needed repeated instructions was a bit of a put-off. So I made sure the Bahn mi was done according to my taste. The woman in front of me was irate since she screwed up her order. So beware of that.

I'm definitely going to come back here.

How can I say no to a $3 delicious sandwich?"
4,"Shredded chicken sandwich had great flavor, but the bread to meat/veggies ratio was way off (and they completely left out chilis!).   Next time I'm getting a 10"" and am Titanic-ing the contents to give me a meaty 5"" banh mi."
4,"Finally found a good Turkish restaurant in Toronto! The service was good and the food was delicious. I went with the family and together we ordered a number of items: spinach gets pide (perfect dough), mixed grill (great meats), and iskender kebab (yum!). For dessert, I would definitely recommend the kunefe over the baklava.

My only complaint is the exterior of the restaurant, it needs some renovation and doesn't reflect at all the great food inside!"
4,"A bit pricey, but  was really impressed with the quality (especially for a place in Oakland)."
4,The staff was very friendly and inviting. The French toast was delightful and my friend said that the bacon pancakes were awesome.
4,"Good food, good service. I found the portion of the Turkish ravioli small but the Iskander kabab was awesome. The meat melted in the mouth. A bit on the higher side in prices but worth it. Decor and ambiance was good."
4,"I've been seen by several gals at P&B, most recently for hair and makeup with Katie at the Waterfront location, and they've all been great. Katie helped me get camera-ready for a boudior photo session (at Le Boudoir Studio by Jodi Lynn) and I walked out looking and feeling fabulous! Katie really seems to have a talent for makeup b/c she had a vision for my ""look"", went to town, and really nailed it. It felt funny walking out at 11:30am so dolled up, but that's just b/c I don't wear much makeup on a daily basis. I appreciate the work she did and will definitely be requesting her for hair and makeup next time!

(Four start only b/c sometimes the online scheduler can be funny.)"
4,"Amazing pizza, very filling. A couple slices os heavy. Unique combinations. Can't wait to try again"
4,This facility is HUGE!  The Outdoor expo was a lot of fun and is truly great for families.  Its FREE too!
4,"When going with a large, you want good quality food, with reasonable quantity at a decent price. Well Kandahar Kabab checks out on all three levels. Went with a party of 12 people, and we only needed to get 6 full size plates. Got a mix between Sultani Kabab and Herati Kabao and the quality and quality of food was great. It's easily possible to split a plate between two people and be satisfied. Their rice is amazing and make sure you get the bread with the dipping sauce. The price is very reasonable especially when you can share a plate between two people. The waiting time for the food is a bit longer than usual especially when it is a little busy so be prepared for that. Also, the service could use some major improvements just with the attitude of the front staff."
4,"Felt like we travelled to a different part of the world. Great flavours, a bit pricey, but clear menu explanations helped. Solid kebab, intense turkish coffee, tea was tea. Bread was amazing."
4,"You wouldn't expect the outskirts of Charlotte to have an awesome sushi place but lo and behold, Osaka is the place. 

Unlike your typical Japanese cuisine, Osaka is your hole-in-a-wall type of restaurant, it isn't fancy and doesn't have much of an atmosphere, but who cares?! The sushi here is GREAT for the price you pay, PLUS Osaka probably has one of the fresher selections and quality sushi/sashimi in Charlotte. I don't care for much of the hibachi items at any Japanese restaurant so I never tried theirs but it just looks like your typical hibachi you order anywhere. I've had no problems with service, staff is friendly and attentive. One of the main reasons why I LOVE Osaka is because the staff will throw in appetizers and little dishes on the house for customers to try. The extra effort Osaka shows to their customers sets Osaka above many places I've been to (hell I can't even recall many times where I got added-value items on the house, even at nice ""5-star"" restaurants).

I'm super picky when it comes to eating sushi, so trust me when I say Osaka is among the best when it comes to sushi in Charlotte!!"
4,"I'm not afraid to say it but I prefer the food here compared to bamiyan kabob. The portion sizes are larger and the meats are juicier, and more tender. They are literally grilled to perfection! And their yogurt and hot sauces are to die for. You won't be disappointed with the food here that's for sure. Service might be another issue.

We ordered the chicken breast kabab ($8) and the signature Kandahar kabab ($15) which came with one stick of lamb and one stick of filet mignon. They were all delicious. I would definitely come back here to try the others! Everything on the plate was delicious, the rice was fragrant and flavourful and even the fresh salad provided nice contrast with all the components of the plate (smother more yogurt sauce over it!). The naan was nothing special though. The food is somewhat on the pricey side (the full meals), but is definitely worth it. 

It took 20 mins for our food to be called which was a tad too long for a place like this and many tables weren't cleaned up with trays and food. While you are expected to put your finished trays in the carts, I expect that the tables be cleaned so patrons can sit. Plus it's just unappetizing seeing plates full of bones, rice and half eaten naan. Luckily there were many tables and seats when we went late in the afternoon. I may be nitpicking here but the lady at the cash just didn't seem very friendly. But overall, I had a good enough experience with the food and the service didn't detract too much from the overall experience."
4,"I have received a number of colonics from Healing Waters and I've always had the best experiences. I would give them 5 stars for those, but recently I had a different employee and I was very disappointed by her unprofessionalism. I will  return, but I won't go on a Saturday when that person works. Here's what could've been better:
Acknowledged me in the waiting room at least once as you walked by several times, and let me know you're running a little behind. A hello and smile would have been nice. 
Listen as I explain how another employee makes accommodations for me for the tube insertion. 
If the bell signal doesn't work, and you don't check on me,   don't short change me on the amount of time due. 
This last visit was such a negative experience compared to the rest. Like I said- I do recommend it highly, just not on Saturdays."
4,"I stopped by to try this place since I love quite close. Bowls were pretty good, I didn't like that they put the ""toppings"" (sesame seeds,crispy onion) under the other types of toppings (seaweed salad, fruit, edamame). Was a little over priced compared to another Poke place I frequent."
4,"The food here is substantial, delicious and seems very authentic. Most of the other patrons were Korean, which is always a good sign. The wait staff was very attentive and refilled our hot tea often. The food came quickly. We had the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap and all the sizzling ingredients were quality and tasty. It was accompanied by a miso soup and five small bowls of assorted pickled and fresh veggies, which we were not expecting because the menu didn't mention them. They were delicious, too!

Now for the few negatives: The ambiance is lacking. The place is not decorated at all,  and the hot tea is served out of ugly plastic pitchers which grow cold too quickly. Parking is difficult because it is in a residential section of the university neighborhood. But these are the only negatives. I will be back because of the delicious food and the kind service."
4,"Cute little place to grab a quick bite to eat. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch the other weekend. It was his first time having banh mi and he ordered the grilled pork. I ordered the vegetarian option. My sandwich came with shredded sautéed carrots and strips of tofu in what seemed like it was cooked with curry paste. It was very enjoyable! We both also wanted bubble tea but the cashier at the time said they were out of bubbles so I ended up just getting an ice coffee slush. My boyfriend ordered a yogurt-based drink with passionfruit jelly. Although both were very good, the next customer who ordered bubble tea was able to get tapioca in their drink. I kind of wish the cashier would have given us the option to hold off a little longer and come out with our drinks. Overall, very good banh mi here."
4,"The Decor: Nothing special. No really, don't turn around, don't judge this book by its cover- go in and sit down and order. I'm usually the only caucasian in the place which tells me I'm in for something authentic. I do get stares from other patrons though!

The ambience: Old tables, uncomfortable chairs and a TV playing chinese soaps at lunch. If you're really brave take a peak into the kitchen which is visible from anywhere your sitting. The servers put up with me and they really do understand your order as long as you point at the numbered menu. Always smiling and welcoming. The tall, plastic, well worn, foggy green tea glasses are a nice touch.......

The food: Absolutely authentic and the best thai/vietnamese fusion anywhere. Their curried beef brisket is my absolute favourite thing on the planet- you must try it. Heat is inconsistent but most of the time my scalp is sweating!!
Their pad thai is awesome too- there's a lot of it. The vietnamese soup is served in a BUCKET. Way too much. If you finish it be careful turning corners because the sloshing is likely to throw your balance off. It shouldn't be humanly possible to eat that much soup. 
Great value. Cheap Cheap Cheap! Lunch for under $10 and you could get out of there in under 20 mins.

The funny thing is the speed at which your food comes out. I always tell people that the waitress will walk away and return with your meal in under 2 minutes. Always great, always quick. Love this place."
4,Excellent avian vet!  Offered a lot of services and learned a lot about bird care!  Also will kennel your bird for $11 a day!
4,"It is always a pleasure to eat here. Their stews are amazing! The flavor they impart into the broth is both complex and well balanced. I highly recommend both the Sun Du Bu and Den Jang Jji Geh. Soooo tasty! They also provide  4 different kimchi accompaniments - cabbage, seaweed, radish and bean spouts. 

Korea Garden's menu includes dishes from an assortment of Asian cuisines - Korean (obviously), Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese. Depending on your dish, the prices are reality cheap, especially if you are getting the Bento box for lunch. 

This place is fantastic for large groups of around 8-12 people. The food arrives together in a cloud of steam. It's impressive how hot all the dishes are when they arrive at the table for large groups. 

Korean Garden is a great little hideaway restaurant in Oakland. The food is authentic, consistently delicious and never disappoints."
4,"My first banh mi in Montreal! This was cheap ($3 CAD), filling, and perfect to take with me on the plane ride home. This tiny little Vietnamese sandwich shop serves readymade sandwiches, rice balls, and bento-type lunch boxes, in addition to the Subway-style assembly line where they will make a fresh banh mi sandwich of your choice. You can also get boba drinks and have a seat at one of their 3-4 small tables. Bathroom is upstairs in the Thai restaurant. I guess it's a shared space... Nice friendly staff, although some don't speak English, only Vietnamese and French!"
4,What another great experience from Chapman Mazda!  Thank you so much for understanding what I needed.  Thanks to Bill Lohmeyer and Paul Dodge for a job well done!
4,"Great attentive service, the mixed dip plate was fantastic. The kebab was good, but a little dry. The lamp meat could have used more fat, as traditionally done. The knaffe was fantastic, and the turkish tea is a great way to finish the meal.

The place is very clean, with nice decor. A good place for a family to come."
4,"This place doesn't seem like much, but if you want pizza that is hearty and eats like a meal this is the place. After eating this pizza i was stuffed, the toppings are generous.

This place is good for takeout, i personally would not want dine there as the place is kinda suspect. I felt like i was transported back to an old 80's bar.

But to each his own :)"
4,Great Shawarma plate!  Generous portions and moist chicken.  Reasonably priced and portion size is very satisfying!
4,"An awesome place to stop for lunch, dinner or even a quick grocery trip. After we moved to Brookline I stopped in to see what this place was all about. It smelled delicious and I could not  wait to come back for dinner. If you need any fresh produce or bread they have it all. We  finally went back for dinner this past week and I ordered the small size falafel wrap and my boyfriend got the dinner sized gyro (huge portions). The workers could not have been nicer and helped us with the menu items.  We also got hummus and pita (not on menu)-they gave us a full container of the roasted red pepper hummus with pita which was very delicious. My falafel wrap, even though the smaller order,  was huge and plenty for dinner.  Came filled with lots of fresh veggies including some pickled veggies. I asked for the tzatziki sauce which was yummy and I highly recommend.  Save room for dessert as they have many cookies and baklava. Forgot one of the best parts, the prices are very reasonable and they have a small seating area inside."
4,"The pizza bar in Pittsburgh is really freaking low. Seriously.

This place? Leaps and bounds over the rest of the places i have been to and it isn't even that good. The crust is crackery and mealy. 

Thin. New york style. Huge huge slices and pies. They have real sugar coke and if you don't take advantage of that, well, your loss.

They need a pizza happy hour from 4 to 6 with slices under 4 bux and this place would be golden. $5 for a slice? No pizza is that good. Because not even in Chicago or NYC is a pizza this large $35. Seriously over priced. Shave 5 bux off that.

This is where to get real pizza in pgh, for the moment.

Ps....one beer on tap is also needed."
4,"Very decent lunch spot, favorite thing to get here is the spicy gyro pita. I don't think I've seen spicy gyro at many places, and this one is pretty great. The Asian fare is ok, it's what you would expect- not great, but definitely not bad either. Pretty decent value for lunch."
4,"Three of us dined at Pasha on a cold winters evening.  The lentil soup served in a crock with lemon was scrumptious.  We shared zucchini pancakes, babaganoush and a donner kebab - all nicely prepared and flavorful.  The house made bread was delicious.  We had a lovely warm freshly prepared dessert of shredded phyllo pastry, cheese and honey topped with ground pistachio nuts. The service was very good. This restaurant, which serves authentic Turkish cuisine, is quite new to the area and we plan to return."
4,Everyone was really nice. My dogs seemed comfortable with the staff and surroundings. The bill was reasonable. The parking isn't great. My dog was taken in the back to be weighed and for shots. This wasn't what I was used to. Over all it was good. I will go back.
4,"We ordered the turkish tea (it was amazing), lahmacun, cigar rolls, eggplant and tomato sauce. For our mains we had several of the lamb courses.

It tasted very good, no complaints at all. The only complaint was the bathroom was super hot."
4,"Pizza is the size of three slices! Garlic, mushroom is the best toppings! They are fast, clean and polite. Recommended for late night eats."
4,I have been going to Chapman Mazda for 2 years now. I always feel like they are knowledgeable and always know that they will take care of my car. I haven't had any problems so far and am happy with their service. I would give them 5 stars except for the wait time is sometimes pretty long.
4,"I have stopped at this Starbucks several times when I've been in this area.  It's not too far from the 15 for a fairly quick off and back on.  

The outlet is a regular Starbucks box with the normal pastries and the normal interior.  

The staff today was quite competent.  We had leisurely drinks before going to a show at CSN Cheyenne Campus."
4,"Great views and good enough food - this place is going to be a busy spot and you're going to go see a looooot of Instagram pics geotagged here this summer.

Mains are priced fairly for the location and apps are a bit on the pricy side. Drinks here will add quickly. However, there are very few places in downtown where you'll get a similar ambiance.

I had an ahi tuna steak sandwich ($21) with the house salad. Portions were very fair and the house salad was actually tasty if you're looking to be opt for the healthy choice instead of fries.

The decor is very inviting and bright - Light wood, palm plants which is a big contrast to the dark and sleek lobby of the Bisha. 

I'll definitely be back on a sunny weekend for brunch but I reckon it's going to be hard to get a spot without making a reso."
4,"Came here with the both our kids (4 & 2) and the staff were super accommodating considering we were a walk in on Saturday night.
Food was tasty and ambience pleasant. If we're ever in the area again we'd stop in again!"
4,"Amazing food! All the skewers and mains are amazing! We usually get a double kebob meal to feed two people. For about $15 we get the Herati Kebob, which comes with a chicken skewer, a kofta kebob, a ton of rice, a naan, and salad. It also comes with a white sauce that is amazing and a red one if you wanna add a little spice to your meal.

Highly recommend this place if you want some great food at a cheap price."
4,"Drinks were good. Busy location, does have a drive thru and offers Mobil ordering. Stopped on my way from
Utah to California so can't really say much else about the place."
4,"Had my first banh mi sandwich here today. Blown away! Tried the grilled chicken, was only $5, will be trying the beef next.  Has indoor seating and a terrace :)"
4,"It's a super nice restaurant with great decor and ambience. We went on a Friday night and the place was somewhat packed but we were able to get seats right away. I liked the crowd- it was mostly families which is not surprising considering the area. Our server was really great and came by a few times to ask how the food was and if we needed anything else. We tried the pasha sautéed, iskender kebob and pepper steak and really enjoyed everything. Our food was flavourful and reasonably priced! Will definitely come back again to try some of other dishes."
4,"After having a nightmare of a time with my 8 month old kitty here, Ellen (the office manager) helped me out a lot and I greatly appreciate everything she's done for me and my kitten."
4,Every time I visit Scottsdale I book an appointment..these ladies really know how to please! Have been here many times and only once was a little disappointed but you can always request your favorites!  Their products are wonderful too!
4,"This is a great little spot. The price is similar to that of big chains, like Dominos and Pizza Hut but the quality of the ingredients and that thick crust homemade goodness can't be beat. The service was good, definitely not the greatest I've ever encountered but they get the job done. We ordered pizza, wings and drinks. Excellent pizza and passable wings. This place is a little bit off the beaten track and isn't somewhere I'd necessarily go out of my way to find again. 

Check it out if you're around. You won't regret it."
4,"This place was pretty good compared to some of the other poke places in the valley. We got there at 7 and there was a pretty long line but it went by pretty quick. The restaurant was clean and staff was nice. We got their large bowl and it was pretty filling and good quantity of food. I just wish the bowls were bigger to be able to mix everything together. I like the fresh toppings like cilantro, jalapeños, edemame. Their pineapples looked pretty old and brown but tasted ok. Definitely will be back again!"
4,"The ambient is calm, server's friendly and food above average ( slightly canadianized but even worth). Will go back again"
4,Definitely a fan of this place.  They have a wide range of options and they are all very tasty.  Also the staff is great.  The prices are very reasonable as well.  I will definitely be back!
4,"4 stars no doubt! 1 star deduction because this place needs to be better maintained.

This place is busy so be ready for the wait, wait to make the order, wait for the table, wait for the food....You basically have to go and find your own seats because there is no one to seat you. You order and wait for your number to be called but be ready to struggle through the crowd of men to reach your food. Crowds also makes it very confusing to understand whether they are waiting for their food or standing in line to order.

The place needs more attendants to clean the table during the busy hours. It's too much for one guy.

This is often compared to Bamiyan Kabob and personally I like them both but I personally feel like the meat at Kandahar Kabab is more tender plus they take cards whereas Bamyan primarily takes cash. Also like Bamyan, this place needs better management. I feel like all the people are just standing in crowds in front of the counter to get their food (whenever that is prepared)."
4,"I am seriously a fan of this restaurant - but now for different reasons.

The beef satay pho is delicious - SO much better than the special house pho.  It is tasty and the flavour is phenomenal.  Comparing the regular pho and satay pho side by side (disclosure: I didn't eat both phos - my mom ordered the regular pho) the regular pho tasted very, very, very, very, very bland. 
There were a lot of noodles along with a great portion of meat. A small filled me (and I can usually chow down a medium to large).  Great price for great portions.

I will obviously return as soon as the cold weather decides to return."
4,"I was asked to be part of a commercial shoot for the Food Network, so last minute I decided to make an apt here so I wouldn't have to deal with my own hair. 
They got me in right away and knew exactly what I wanted. They were very friendly, efficient, and professional. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone who is looking for a great blow out for any occasion."
4,"Treated like a king , food quality did not disappoint . I just wish they had better rolls , too much rice . Other than that though the quality was definitely there , could tell they don't cheap out in ingredients . Udon beef was so good ."
4,Not a big fan of Afghani food but i think there chapli kabob is the best. Rest of the stuff I have tried it once and it's alright.
4,"We've been meaning to check out this place for a long time now and are happy we finally made our way here.  We started with the house salad with ginger dressing. The dressing was definitely house made. It was tangy and citrusy and very good. We even received a complimentary radish roll...that was a nice surprise. 

We tried 4 different rolls and all of them were very good. The service was the best part. We pared ways with our previous go-to sushi bar because the service had take a decline, so this was a refreshing surprise. 

We'll be back for sure!"
4,I usually get the well done potato pancakes  with maple syrup and butter and a side of bacon.
4,"Finally a clean comfortable place to eat pizza on the South Side!

This is a cool trendy spot with descent pizza that is roomy and clean.

The pizza is HUGE !

IN THE BACK IS ALSO A SMALL ART GALLERY! Definitely a place to chill and get a bite to eat!

I will be back!

P.S. They do use yeast in their dough so you can expect to have gastric explosions all the way home!"
4,Good sized range and a fairly cheap price. Kinda wish I could get an annual membership here. Pace of shooting is a little bit slower due to it being a public shared range of large size (necessary). They also sell paper targets at a very reasonable price.
4,"Working out west in Etobicoke I decided after Friday Rockclimbing I'd meet up with a friend for some sushi.  She recommended Prince Sushi near Courtney Park and Hurontario.  Upon arrival, note-to-self, always make a reservation.  Due to the busy plaza, movie halls and restaurants, this place had a line up.  Luckily for us it was for a party of TWO. within 20mins we were seated, and ready to order.  Both of us opted for their AYCE sushi $24.99 Weekend price which isn't all too bad.  In terms of choices, they had a great selection, and the service was efficient, and courteous.  We ordered various things on the menu; sashimi salmon/butter fish/ green dragon roll, spicy salmon, edamame, soup, wrapped beef and green onion roll, etc... The quality is quite impressive as was their presentation skills.  In terms of ambiance, it definitely screams Japanese! and sushi lol.. and most of all, the place is clean!  Would I come back here, sure! why not, I had a great experience and now I have a go-to-sushi place in Mississauga :)"
4,"Went to this place for the first time last weekend. Went at about 11 a.m. and there was about a 20-minute wait..not too bad. The menu is overwhelmingly huge, but luckily we had already picked out what we wanted while we were waiting for our table.

I'm not a big fan of sweet type of food for breakfast (which is a shame, because they had some amazing-sounding options), so I got the kielbasa scrambler, and it was VERY good. Good portion, good price, and very tasty. 

Boyfriend got the Dutch baby. There is a little bit of an extra wait for that, but it's worth it. It was amazing! He ate every bite. Apparently, it's their classic dish. 

The place is decorated kind of fancy-like. But the customers around us seemed kind of...snooty or something. I don't know. It seemed like a very conservative kind of place, where you might go with the family after church. Which is fine, because it's all about the food, but this isn't somewhere I'd go and feel totally comfortable, personally."
4,"Benny is the biggest pizza in town.

I had a standard pepperoni and a pizza of the month. Both were great.

The crust was well cooked but still had a nice chew to it. The sauce and cheese portions were good.  The portions for the toppings were good

The pepperoni pizza was pretty dry on top and the plates after had minimal grease. No need to dab oil off these slices.

Benny Fierro is by far the best pizza in the south side. I'd rate Spak Brothers as my favorite in the city still."
4,"Best curry sauce in GTA.    95% of the time I would order curry beef rice or roti. 
It's has a lot of flavor besides just curry.   The menu say it's Malaysian curry.
If you like curry, you should try it.

Removed 1 star because few times I went at 8:30 PM, the chef has stop cooking even though the restaurant closes at 9 PM.   And a couple of times, the curry sauce wasn't up to their usually standard (ie. the sauce wasn't thick enough or it didn't have that Malaysian curry flavor)"
4,"I'm a fan, ayce comes to 28 dollars. good food mediocre service. Me and my gf come here pretty often for sushi fix. I like the chicken fried rice, green dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura and avacado salad! They recently changed up the menu."
4,The BEST PITA made on location ( you can watch it being made through the big picture windows... The new café seating is very inviting... and the gyro's are pretty tasty too!
4,"Petit restaurant sympa, dans lequel je retrouve les bons sandwichs vietnamiens! Ils y proposent beaucoup de variétés, avec différents ingrédients! Sympa! Super sympa!


 Places dispo a l'intérieur comme a l'extérieur, cependant, les places restent assez limitées!


 Ils font aussi des bubbles tea! Par contre ils ne savent pas les faire avec du lait de soja.. Et ils mettent bcp trop trop de glaçons dedans!!"
4,"A hidden gem! 

My husband and I went to this hidden wonder of a sushi joint today for lunch. 

It's right in the middle of an outdoor ""big box"" mall, wedged between a strip of franchise restaurant/eateries and a Cineplex movie theatre. You'd pass it easily if you weren't looking for it. 

Apparently, it's right near an ""All-you-can-eat"" Japanese place where you truly get bang for your buck, but we heard that people will frequent this place just because the food is so much better.  And for $9.95, there is an ""All Day Lunch"" special that has 6 pieces of California rolls and six pieces of sushi. And it's GOOD. 

We also a Tuna Sushi pizza with a spicy maki roll (combo) and the teriyaki beef, which was a ribeye steak. The whole lunch cost about $30.00. So worth it. 

The atmosphere was relaxed (a Monday lunchtime), with no crazy line ups. The place is clean with cool Japanese-inspired art on the ceilings and walls. The food and service were really good. Probably some of the best sushi I've had in a long time. 

We're going back, that's for sure."
4,"I am not a sushi expert by any means - much of my experience comes from Krab sushi found on many buffets in the area.  And then there are places with things on their sushi that I am not really sure that I would like to eat if I knew what was on the plate, so it is not often that we go out seeking sushi.

But Osaka is a bit different - while they do have a focus on sushi, and it seems most go for the sushi, they also have other dishes (mostly noodles and hibachi items that you would find at your standard Japanese steakhouse).  In fact, they are one of the few places around town that will serve up udon, and unlike the soy-saturated udon noodles at E in concord (which are tasty), these are glass-like noodles that are completely different but well worth the trip.

When it comes to sushi, you can order a number of items, and I will not pretend to know what is what.  I will say that if you start ordering, prepare to be bombarded.  Our first trip, we ordered a couple of rolls, some noodles and some rice and we ended up with plate after plate - almost too much to fit on the table.  It seems that the more you order, the more you get.  Not just what you order, but complimentary tasting dishes as well.

Staff here is friendly and efficient, so feel free to ask them about the dishes.  In fact, you might need to do go out of your way to do so - it seems that they are flying around so quickly they may forget you.  Your food will come out, but if you need anything else (like a drink refill or to add something on), it can be a challenge to get their attention.  Other than that, they are quite a strip mall find.  Well worth the trip, even if you are not in the area."
4,We visited on a Sunday evening. The place was busy. There was plenty of seating available. I had the vege platter. Nice to see the vegetarian option. But it had full coriander seeds and was under done. Not very pleasing to the palate. The vegan bread was sold out. The regular Afghan bread is a bit dry. The meat plates were tasty. It was a lot of food. Portions are very big. Best to order one full meal and single servings of meat if you go with a group.  Dough is a salt lassi. The mast- plain yogurt was good. I have eaten at fancy Afghan restaurants and was looking for a cilantro/ mint condiment. That was missing in this place.  Also the menu on the wall is very small and tough to read for older folks.
4,"Sushi was on point. Fresh and specials are to die for. Definitely one of my better sushi experiences in Charlotte/Matthews area. general manager/sushi chef was very generous.

one downside: our order from the kitchen(hibachi) could use a bit of work. steak was chopped small and sauce was a bit off."
4,"The quality of the sushi and other items are really good compared to other all you can eat sushi restaurants however the service isn't the most consistent. In the 4 times I've been I have only been asked if I wanted a refill once, all the other times I had to waive someone down. Other than that I do continue to come here since the food is good."
4,"My brother told me about this place. Seems the local tradesmen are ""big fans.""
Heard stories of the ""monster panzerotti.""

Decided I would try this place out. I've only ever has the ""monster panzerotti"" and I've only ever had take out. And I can say that everyone who's tried Pizza Pino with me has loved it.

I get bacon,mushroom, and sausage and it will easily feed three guys with a generous portion.

The panzo comes in at about $20 off memory, so more than your typical fast food joint. But I would say the quality is worth the price.

If your in the area check it out."
4,"I purchased the deal chicken coupon which included the deep cond, scalp massage, blow out and make up.  I'm not totally sure that they did a ""deep cond treatment"" but the rest was right on. Katie did my blow out and she did a fantastic job. I was heading out to Vegas that evening so she threw in a little curl for free and I really, really liked my hair.  Courtney did my make up.  She has a great personality and she made the whole experience super fun. The ambiance was perfect, I love the way this place is decorated. They offered me mimosas and pastries and everyone was super nice. 

In general I find reviews on Yelp dead on but in this case I was pleasantly surprised. I would go back again for sure. This would be a great place to bring a group of ladies for a fun day before you went out."
4,"Used to come here all the time when I had more friends living in Mississauga but they all moved down to Toronto so we don't go much anymore. Good AYCE sushi Variety and great ""cooked food"" selection. All the meat skewers/teriyaki comes with a delicious sauce and we always get the soft shell crab, not many sushi places have that. Always call beforehand to make reservations because it tends to get busy close to dinner hours."
4,One of the better sushi restaurants in Mississauga. Definitely come for the all you can eat dinners. I think they are $30 at most. No refills on drinks though!
4,"I have been there four times and have had a really good breakfast each time.  I love the coconut pancakes and their homemade whipped cream!!!  My kids love the Rainbow and Reese's pancakes.  I haven't tried the omelets yet, but they are huge and look great.  If you like breakfast, then you need to give this place a try.  Oh, the coffee is pretty good too."
4,"I got a soup that called mercimek .It was delicious.but bad things was delay. there was  just a waitress  that worked  and served for all people .second,it's  Turkish restaurant with Turkish menu but the waitress can't speak turkish."
4,"Definitely go here if you love pancakes! They have some great combinations, and the portions are enormous. I'm not huge on breakfast sweets but I still very much enjoyed my Swedish pancakes, and I thought it was cool to try something different besides your typical chocolate chip or blueberry hotcakes. We were in and out of there pretty quickly, but we did go late on a weekday morning so I'm not sure what the wait is like during peak hours. I really enjoyed their coffee as well, and the restaurant was cozy and I imagine would be perfect on a chilly winter morning for breakfast."
4,"This unassuming basement shop boasts an impressive selection of drinks, snacks, rice boxes, sushi, and desserts. There are a few small tables in the lower level shop, but if the cafe is full, there's seating outside and plentiful space upstairs.

I ordered a veggie sandwich, taro bubble tea, and coconut tapioca cup. The sandwich was listed as 7"" but looked a little on the small side. The tofu/carrot filling made for a satisfying vegetarian option. The bread was denser and less crisp than the french baguettes I've had at other banh mi shops.  On the other hand, the chewier bread made the small sandwich more filling. Taro bubble tea had great flavor but the cup was stuffed to brim with ice cubes.. reminiscent of Starbuck's volume-filler trick. 

Minor complaints aside, Vua is exactly the kinda joint I'd like to make a daily stop in. The selection is wide and the service is fast."
4,"Kudos to the Chefs and Staff!  Fish was fresh for all 6 items ordered.  If you like spicy, try the jalepeno roll.  We will be back again!!"
4,"The decor of the restaurant is colourful. A mix of modern and traditional design.

We placed our order within minutes of being seated, and received complimentary warm bread and seasoned olives while we waited for our food. 

Our ordered consisted of:
The lamb chops with fries ($24), and 
the doner pide ($16).
Good sized portions, 2 dishes can feed 3 people. Meats were seasoned very well and cooked to a perfect medium. Not under-cooked and not dry.
To finish the meal, I ordered a Turkish coffee.

If your palette is geared towards bold flavour & seasoned meats, this is the place for you!"
4,As authentic as Korean food can get. Great value and very nice and courteous staff. If you order two items from their BBQ menu you get to grill the items right at your table.
4,"It's a shooting range, not too much to say about it. We've been here two years in a row now for daughter's archery tournaments. There would be no other reason that I come here. 

I will say that if you're going to practice shooting anything, I would rather it be at a range than out in the desert or your backyard. Controlled environments- good!"
4,"This is one of those places that's a hidden secret in Matthews. Its right on the outskirts of Matthews right before you get to Mint Hill. This is an exceptional, authentic Japanese restaurant and the food is very good. The sushi is some of the best sushi in Charlotte and the service is always very good. Highly recommend this place for authentic Japanese food."
4,"The ingredients were fresh, great bbq pork, $1 for extra meat. A meal for under $6. Great cheap eat."
4,Great all you can eat find! Pretty extensive  menu for dinner with lots of non sushi items. Gets really busy since it is a smaller restaurant so make sure to make reservations. Great service and big portion sizes for the salmon sashimi. The rice is definitely different from other sushi places I've been but still pretty good. Rolls do come apart pretty easily. Would come back to this place if I'm in the area.
4,One of the better all you can eat sushi places in Mississauga.  Really busy so it's best to make a reservation.  We found that out the hard way.
4,"I do like coming here when I am in the area as this is one of the 'better' pho restaurants in the upper regions of Richmond Hill.  

The service is the usual, the Asian ladies come and clean your table, they set you up with tea, they take your order, and then they serve you.  They are quite efficient as they do want you out of the store ASAP.

I love the pho here just because it tastes right, the place seems clean, and they ask you if you want your bean sprouts boiled too (A+ for noticing how people are paranoid of sprout bacteria).  Noodles are the thin ones (yay) and the meat proportion is equivalent.

My boyfriend always gets the beef brisket curry.  There is a huge bowl filled with creamy curry and brisket and a side of rice - definitely worth the price.

The only downside I have with this place is although the ""open windows"" give the restaurant a roomier vibe, it also allows people in the centre to gawk at you while you're eating or stare at your food."
4,Very good authentic Turkish food.  The sigara borek appetizer and kuneffe dessert are amazing.  Just wish the prices were a tad bit lower so I could visit more often!
4,"Overall, great restaurant and the food is really tasty. I think it's a little bit too expensive for the location (South Oakland, student residental area), but if you are not a poor student you can spoil yourself from time to time with delicious Korean food. I really like it there now after they renovated."
4,Very reasonably priced and very tasty Mediterranean food. I can't wait to try other things on the menu. The food quality changed the next time we went. It was not as good as the first two times.
4,"Large slices, generous toppings...  you're typical New York style pizza.  When I'm in the mood for thin crust- this is our 'go to' spot.  Open early / open late, friendly staff..."
4,"OMG! Their sashimi is so good.  I'm not usually one to write reviews immediately but this place was so good, especially for an AYCE establishment.

Apps: miso soup, chicken wings, coconut shrimp, tempura, wings.  I thought the miso soup was good, wings looked crispy, but the coconut shrimp was over-battered and the tempura had no flavour. 3/5.

Maki rolls: Dragon roll, crispy roll, unagi roll, and tempura roll.  Meh.  They were avereage. 3/5

Sashimi: 5/5 - the salmon, mackerel, tuna, butterfish were so good and so fresh. Melt in your mouth and nice big pieces.

Meat:  5/5 Beef teriyaki (medium rare) and beef tataki (rare). The teriyaki was amazing. It was juicy and a tender piece of steak (better than the steak I had at Milestones a week ago).  Beef tataki was also delicious.  First time having it and so good I ordered a 2nd time.  

Overall for food: 4/5

Atmosphere: 3/5 - small and really loud.

So I guess this place deserves a 3.5/5 and I'll be nice and round up to 4. 

Best AYCE sushi joint I've been to in a while that has quality sashimi."
4,"Hearty food, quick, friendly service, reasonable prices. Solid breakfast joint."
4,"Is it the best pizza I've had in my life? No. Is it the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh? No. However, it is definitely the best pizza on East Carson right now and the closest thing to Pizza Sola which sadly closed a while back. They have your standard toppings, but also will have a specialty pie once a month. I typically just stick with what I know unless a special is really speaking to me, but everything that I've ever had here has been pretty solid.

I'm probably in the minority when I say that I've actually eaten here sober more times than drunk. As Benny's is open after the bars close, I can imagine that this is a great spot to get your drunk food fix.

If you're a New Yorker and used to dollar slices, you sadly won't find that here. The slices are about five bucks, but they are huge. The crust is usually just the right amount of crispy, and the sauce is really good! I will definitely return."
4,"I dont know how someone can get a vanilla latte wrong but they did, twice. It wasnt horrible but it just tasted like milk. In Arizona where i live, i order that every day. 
The great thing about this Starbucks is the friendly employees and its clean and the drive through line goes fast. Quick and to the point!"
4,"This Starbucks is perfectly located for me on the way to work via 15 South freeway. It's a drive thru one as well which is a huge plus for people on the go! I never had a problem with long lines like the other people who go in the morning (as I stop by everyday on the way to work around late afternoon lol, yeah I know lucky me right? :p)

The Barista's always get my ""custom"" order right and greet me with a big smile everyday. I had no issues with the service."
4,"Yummy but overpriced for a chain. I like the cherry pancakes. Their homemade whip cream is really good. I didn't like their ordinary link sausage, latte or corned beef hash. Stick to their specialty, the cakes!"
4,"Use to shoot metallic silhouette competition here for years. Is a long drive from FH, but was fun while it lasted. Our range master was cool, but very safety and regulation conscious (as it should be!)"
4,"This place was recently renovated, but it's still casual and small. Service was fast and courteous. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed their roti and curries that come in large bowls. We ordered:

Belachan Shrimp and Green Beans (soft, well cooked, tasty)
Spring Rolls (yum!)
Roti Canai (a little more oily than I like, but it's Roti!)
Curry Minced Chicken Roti (tasty, spicier than the other curry dish we ordered)
Malaysian Curry Beef Brisket (very tasty)
BBQ Chicken and Spring Roll Vermicelli (I'm not usually a vermicelli fan, but this was tasty mixed with the curry)

We came here on a Wednesday night with a group of 4 and there was no wait. We'll definitely come back."
4,"Fresh, delicious, and lots of choices!  Staff was friendly, place was clean.  Definitely will go back."
4,"This is the real thing.

I was told by a Korean friend that THIS was the most authentic Korean food in Pittsburgh. 

I'm sold.  We had the giant seafood pancake as an appetizer (it is enough for 4 folks, so it is worth it). I ordered the bento box bolgogi, which was a little smorgasbord of Korean foods and was excellent. My companions ordered stews, one of which was the tofu and seafood stew, also excellent.  The stews arrive at the table vigorously boiling in the bowl, which is a bit off putting, but better than it arriving cold...  It's well worth going to the Pitt ghetto of South Oakland for the experience of eating here.  They have a cooler full of beer. When we walked in the place was filled with Koreans and, which suggests that my friend was correct. Later Pitt students began to fill the place ( I was told to go early, which is good advice for Saturday night)."
4,"Pretty good sushi for the area. I enjoyed the maki dinner which was four rolls, salad and soup for around 14 bucks. Definitely the place to go for sushi if New Zealand Cafe is full."
4,"Not as pricey as I expected. Great service and great food. View at the patio worth the visit.

Had our birthday brunch here. Waitress was friendly and even offered help taking pictures. Also Gave us solid recommendations on cocktails.

Coconut Pancakes: I can eat this all day! Delicious and healthy (compare to bacon and other red meat as brunch). It was not overly sweet, and flavor was perfectly balanced with other fruits.

The other one was good too, but not as impressive as coconut pancakes. Definitely worth a try though.

P.S. we did not get any birthday treats as we notified it was a birthday brunch when we were making the reservation.

Am I coming back? Yes! Just probably not on birthday."
4,"Oakland's best kept secret! Don't be fooled by their exterior- tucked away in South Oakland, behind the simple storefront is the most authentic Korean food you will find in the city! It is a cute family run restaurant with delicious food and great service. 

They also have Korean BBQ! These dishes are prepared at your table on a gas grill that is actually built into the table itself. I ordered the beef short ribs which came with a few different side dishes (fresh and pickled vegetables) and rice. This cooking method makes for a very fun dining experience and is good for sharing with friends, family and loved ones."
4,"I love the beef tataki and beef teriyaki in this place, also their sushi is very fresh and tasty and I felt the service was fast and spot on. only complaint I have is they have very little fish (sashimi) to chose from, and they stuff their rolls with tons of rice which is understandable for being ayce.
Make a reservation for group larger than 4, otherwise you will wait."
4,"**Update 8/11/17**
So we went back and this time the fish looked a little more fresh.  I decided to go with the house sauce this time along with salmon and ahi.  Got most of the toppings but no avocado this time.  Topped it with spicy mayo.  They don't get a thumbs up for putting my bowl together but no big deal as I mix the whole thing anyway.  Maybe he was in a rush.  Anyway it was good and the serving seemed large.  I couldn't finish it so I saved it for the next day.  Still ono!!!

**Original**
Ah, good enough.  I have been to several around the valley and I from Hawaii so I have a pretty good experience with poke.

I would rank this third best I have tasted.  The other 2 are in Tempe.  Same as the others.  Rice or salad, 2 proteins, and toppings.  Extra for avocado.

I had the Salmon and Spicy Tuna with spicy mayo.  Not bad.  Portions could be bigger with the fish.  Nothing really spectacular.  One thing it has going is it is close to the house so I can calm my cravings when I need too.  My wife thought these guys were good so we probably be going back.

Prices are pretty much the same.  The other places give miso soup so that sucks they don't offer extras like that.  

To me, the one thing that these places are missing are the extra.  In Hawaii, we call it Pupus.  Having a beer and eating pupus is what these type of places need.  Offer garlic edamame, sashimi, poke by the pound, hamachi kama, and the rest of the local grinds that they call finger foods."
4,"Had the Chicken Hibachi and it was really good.  The flavor was just right and the portion was enough that I still had to take some home.  The side carrots were sweet and tasted like canned carrots (that was the only negative) the dish itself came with fresh vegetables too, so I was a little surprised with the side of carrots.  HOWEVER, we will come back"
4,"Food was great.  Portions were good.

Just came before 530 pm so wasn't that busy no lineup but lineup started after 6 pm.

Filet mignon was delicious and worth a second trip."
4,"I have been here three times so far and every time the food has been great and the service has been good. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's a family-run, authentic Korean restaurant where the experience is in the food--not in the decor. The price of the food is much closer to how much Korean cuisine costs in bigger cities with sizable Korean communities. Unlike Green Pepper in Squirrel Hill, it's not overpriced.

The first time I ordered the Mool Naeng Myeon, which were buckwheat noodles with beef and radishes plus Asian pear slices. It came with a cold salty broth to pour over it. Good ratio of meat to noodles but it was hard to finish as it was a large serving. I got the Bi Bim Bap the second time in a normal bowl, super delicious and full of crunchy veggies. Last night I ordered the Soon Du Bu which is a stew of silken tofu and shrimp, squid pieces, and mushroom. It was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten at a Korean place--the tofu melted in my mouth like butter, and the broth was savory and delicious. It came with a small bowl of rice. The egg was nice and runny, perfect for piercing over the rice.

The Banchan here is pretty standard--musaengchae (Korean radish), kimchi, and kongnamul (bean sprouts). The radish is my favorite! Everything is made in-house, too. It still cracks me up that they give you Wrigley's double mint gum with your check, but, hey, I guess you need it after eating here. I love this place and hope it sticks around for decades!"
4,"I ordered the chicken breast dinner with kabuli rice. Food was good overall . The chickn was tender and very flavorful. The sauces they provided to go with the meal was also wonderful. The service at this place could use a little work but overall since the meal was very good, i have to give this place 4 stars.  The place could use a better speaker system. I almost burst my ear drums when the mic went of in the washroom!"
4,"Love this place and the stylist that work here are all excellent however booking on the phone is very difficult as they have now hired someone with an accent I assume Russian and I can't understand her, we go back and forth and she asks me to repeat everything and I ask her to repeat also.  Maybe the management thinks she exotic but it's maddening having to muddle through a conversation that should be 15 seconds but turns into minutes.  Let's put Americans to work.  They missed out on my daughter and I today and last week I got frustrated and just hung up and did my own hair and 2 times the week before.  I will have to schedule my hair on the days that there is someone answering the phone that has a good understanding of English or book online.  Sheesh"
4,Went here for brunch and it was a good time. The food was delicious (the coffee was not). Recommendations off the brunch menu include he rancheros bowl and the pancakes for sure! Definitely pricey but I'd say it's worth it. Service is quite slow but the food is delicious and the view is definitely one that doesn't do justice in photos. I would visit again for sure.
4,"They make their own Pita breads here, and they make them delicious and cheap. This would be enough reason to go here, as it's hard to find tasty and fresh pitas (most of the time, the bags still have steam in them because they're so fresh) for a good price, and this is it.

On top of that, they have frozen raw gyros meat and home made tzatsiki sauce, so you can throw together a gyros sandwich. They have hummus and different kinds of olives by the pound, and a huge selection of turkish and arab foods. Some of their more interesting specialty items do get pricier, but mostly the cost is reasonable, and you can at least understand why a little box of food bought in sub-bulk from a random country in the Middle East is more expensive. 

Diverse, well stocked non-perishables and cheap, delicious pitas and prepared food accompaniments."
4,"Firstly, if you are coming here for the view and atmosphere you will not be disappointed. That being said, the food is actually good too. 

We had the calamari, flatbread, meatballs, branzino and a side of fries. By far my favourite was the meatballs, in a very delicious tomato sauce. The only thing is the portion size is pretty small. We also had to order dessert, highly recommend the tres leche cake over the chocolate cake. 

I was very satisfied after the meal, but my partner was still hungry. The menu is a bit pricy for the portion sizes. 

The service is also very good. Very attentive and polite. Overall, I recommend this restaurant."
4,"HELPFUL HELPFUL!

IN A PICKLE: Alright so I just got back from the airport with two large luggage's with me, and how they treated me was so telling of their business culture. They were so accommodating, found a spot I could put my boxes, even though I wasn't staying at the hotel. The usual Toronto posh restaurant would've totally judged my faux pas.

Atmosphere/Décor: Whomever designed the layout and accent pieces did an amazing job. Also can I say the hotess/senior staff looked very well put together as well? Touché. They were just super friendly as well and outgoing. As you dine you can sight see about 3-4 different amateur photoshoots by the outside patio. If you're not shy you can have one of your own after (which we did--have you seen that view?).

Food: The beers were reasonably priced I was surprised. My friends enjoyed their chardonnays and rose's as well. I had the tofu dinner, not expecting too much because the place seemed more ""aesthetics"" oriented. However, I was surprised how delicious it was, and decently portioned. I'm no tofu expert, but just coming back from Shanghai, I was impressed it was up to par to Chinese counterparts.

Waitstaff: He came around a lot which was abit annoying considering we were a big group trying to catch up as much as possible. Nonetheless, overall I guess he was just doing his job. Average tip.

Final: It was well received by me, I enjoyed my meal and the brief photoshoot we did afterwards. I know its popular for brunchs but a dinner at KOST is well worth it."
4,"I was very impressed with the food here. The pizzas are fantastic, and much bigger than their name suggests. Although I only ordered a ""small"" I still took a couple of slices home. Prices are fair for a restaurant, a little higher than typically found at a chain delivery store, but in my opinion are worth it.

The crust is a good balance between being not too thin, nor too thick or stodgy. The sauce and cheese is plenty, and toppings aren't stingily laid.

Staff were friendly, not too intrusive, but aware enough of when drinks needed topping up, and to bring take home boxes. I was also grateful that they put a rush on my autistic son's order, as he has a very hard time in restaurants waiting for his food to come out once ordered. The rest of our table's order took a bit of while, but was worth the wait. This was my first visit, but I will certainly be back."
4,"Like the name implies, this place serves up a few dishes from here and there across south-east Asia. Reminds me of eating through Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam. 

Tried a Vietnamese noodle (spicy beef rice noodle soup, Bun Bo Hue) and a curry with Roti -- both are very good. 

I deducted one star for not having Singaporean pepper crab or curry crab, or curry fish head soup. Not enough Thai dishes either."
4,Amazing kababs! The portion sizes are fantastic! Not a very big fan of the self service style which takes away from the restaurant experience. But the food makes up for it! Usually very busy during the weekends and evenings. Great for takeout.
4,"I visited Kandahar Kabab about 2 months ago and I was extremely impressed with their food. The place has been on my list for about 2 years now but for some reason I've was always been a little reluctant to go when push came to shove. Likely because this is the second Afgan restaurant I have been to and my first experience was not the best. Kandahar Kabab is quite large but can become very crowded during peak hours (recommend making a reservation if you go with larger crowds). You order food at the front and they call you once it is ready, after which you can take a seat. The food does not typically take too long to cook and the portions are very generous. They also provide you free naan while you wait. I ordered the lamb chops and chicken kebabs which also came with salad and rice. The food was very delicious and I would likely take my family the next time I go. The price is decent for the amount of food that you get but I would suggest that you go with an empty stomach as it will fill you up very fast. Also, don't get too full with the Naan."
4,"I stopped here for lunch in the middle of the work week where I found many other patrons doing the same. For that reason, it was a comfortable environment to be eating lunch alone and not be disturbed with lots of noise. The food and prices were really satisfying. I had a craving for chicken swarma and was really pleased with the simplicity of this establishments meal. It was exactly what I wanted and the man at the register was very friendly. It's kind of hidden in the corner but if your nearby I definitely reccomend!"
4,I ordered the bulgogi and was not disappointed.  The bulgogi was savory and delicious and the rice was perfect.  The service was also good and I will definitely be coming back.
4,Came in to buy either a Mazda or Hyundai.  Zac was so helpful he pulled both models that I liked side by side so I could do a comparison.  He was informative without being pushy.  I would highly recommend purchasing from him or any other salesman at this dealership!
4,"Customer service is terrible. The cashiers are rude but the food totally makes up for this and it's what makes me keep returning for more! Amazing food, great taste and good quality meat"
4,Portions here are HUGE! It's normally pretty crowded - and I get why because the quality and quantity of food is pretty great for the price you're paying. My favourites are the beef brisket with roti and the lemongrass chicken/pork on rice! Their pho is great as well!
4,The experience when walking in was great. It was fast and the staff was friendly. We were taken to the room pretty much right away. We waiting a few minutes for the Dr. She and a nurse came in introduced themselves asked the basic questions about our dog them took him for a walk. It was his first visit in a long time so he needed shots. While they had the dog they gave him his shots. I wasn't comfortable with that because we didn't see it happen. It was our first time there so that impression wasn't the best. The follow up text message the following day was nice. Overall I would give 4 stars.
4,"First chose this place because it was walking distance from the hotel, but found myself going every couple of weeks when I was in town.  Great price, and ""all you can eat"", selections from the menu, order different small dishes.  Food was great, small dishes so you could try lots of different things without totally stuffing yourself!  Great to go on your own or with a group.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Will miss this place when I no longer go back to Canada!"
4,"Les employés sont toujours souriant lors de notre arrivée. 
Plus de 30 variétés de sandwich (autant vietnamien que canadien). 
Essayez les boulettes de viande sur bâton à la caisse. Ils sont excellent!
Les sandwich ne sont pas cher et avec breuvage et accompagnement, le prix tourne autour de 7-8$ ce qui est parfait pour diner/souper. 
Aussi grand choix de sushi et je vois plein de gens juste commander les smoothies, apparement qu'ils sont bon!
Bonne découverte!
(ils acceptent Interac si l'achat est de plus de 5$)"
4,"From a pure aesthetic, fun-time perspective, Kost is strong - perhaps one of the best in the city, especially during a summer evening. 

Kost's business model is clear: they are optimizing for ""vibes"", or ambience. This draws in a certain clientele - those for whom food quality is a secondary concern. 

With that in mind, do take the average Yelp review in context. While Yelp reviewers are a fairly heterogeneous group, the median reviewer would likely think of food quality as their primary concern. 

The food quality here is ok, and I was disappointed by the menu. I was under the impression that Kost's menu was Baja-influenced - of which I only saw sparse representation.

If I were to judge every restaurant under the same context, Kost would likely be a 2-3 star restaurant. But more than anything, Kost provides a dining experience - not necessarily one that is constrained to the quality of its food. And for that, I give it 4 stars."
4,"After the whole day of playing badminton, a friend recommended this place as a go to spot for ayce. For the price of $25, it was worth it! The sashimi were fresh tasting, and there was lots of selections. We tried their yakitori shrimp (great size) and the shrimp was actually firm and not soggy like most places. Their bacon wrapped asparagus was yummy too. Their beef striploin or filet mignon like was cooked at medium. 

The spider roll was actually good quality and had meat in it compared to some that has just some legs. The preparation time to bring out the food was quite reasonable. Although they did forget some stuff here and there, but recovered quite fast. The place is quite busy as well, but they're attentive on the water refills and the order process. This place deserves another go next time i'm in the area of Mississauga and crave for ayce again."
4,"Man the pancake dishes they have here are incredible. For me personally though I prefer good Ole delicious pancakes without all the fancy stuff piled on top. I've worked hard on my figure and I plan on keeping it. Wait, I should eat all the gooey stuff on top then. 
The meats are tasty as is the coffee. Plenty of sides to add onto your meal such as grits, bacon, sausage or hash. 
The place is huge inside and pretty but it comes with a price. PH is expensive."
4,"I don't go out to this area often, but got a recommendation to eat here from the nearby Toyota dealership. I'm happy that I was referred to Osaka!

It's a small, local restaurant that draws a casual crowd. The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was friendly. I ordered a few sushi rolls and they were really good. My husband got the fried tofu and in his words, ""It was DELICIOUS!""

Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll make this one of our stops!"
4,The food was really good especially the eggplant salad and lahmacun (Turkish Pizza). The service wasn't really good.
4,"Vua Sandwiches is one of the best places in Montreal to grab a quick and cheap bite. This place is famous for its Bánh Mì sandwich, which costs around $3.50 on average.  Located close to the Berri metro station, it caters to the population of frugal UQAM (university) students in the area. 

The quality of the sandwiches are quite good despite the low price. The ingredients were pretty fresh, and they don't skimp out on ingredients. It's undoubtedly a great bargain for its price.

There are also other Asian snacks (such as pre-made sushi, etc.) and drinks in the store, although these tend to be much pricier than the sandwiches."
4,"This is a very good halal Afg restaurant, with a nice atmosphere and layout inside that includes many tables that can also accommodate a party of 30. Saw it with my own eyes. 

Their food is cooked to order. Everything is fresh. Freshly cooked kabob, chicken & bread/pita with salad and rice is what I get every time. Their hot sauce & white sauce is very good too. 

Would've gave this a 5 star if the older lady at the cash was nice & helpful."
4,"Amazing view with a classy vibe. This is where you want to go to get food and drinks with your girls (and take some instagram pictures if you're into that)! I can't wait to come back in the summer when the patio is open. 

As 2 people we had 3 sharing plates, and were full! We ordered the fried calamari (they add a nori sesame seasoning which is amazing), ahi tuna ceviche (only comes win 4 shells), and the avocado flatbread."
4,Not the best banh mi I've ever had but the sandwiches are delicious and have some complex flavours. I thoroughly enjoyed them!
4,"We had no idea this place had popped up. Uncertain as to what was on the menu for us today, we decided to check it out. 

The building still smells new, obviously, it is new. Hopefully the industrious smell will subside in time for all of the new businesses opening up. 

We walked in and up to the counter and were greeted by a very friendly man. We have had poke a number of times so we were familiar with the process. The noise level was good, the selections for proteins are good as well as toppings and sauces. It seemed as though the regular bowl was a bit small so I went with the large and devoured it all. I also went with the house sauce, I may have to try each sauce to really find my favorite. They're toppings were pretty standard compared to other spots as well.

We took ours to-go and admittedly I would like to go back in and try it there. I found that the fish was a bit below what my preferred temp for raw fish would be. This could have been attributed to the warm rice and the car ride home. I wanted it to be a bit colder, so I will have to eat there to really see if that helps. I also decided to try their Hawaiian canned juice and it was great. The staff might want to familiarize themselves a bit with flavors and products. One of the staff wasn't sure how to define some of the sauces and another staff didn't know that his ""favorite juice"" was passion fruit. I'm sure they'll get better with time and we have high hopes they keep knocking it out of the park.

So close to home? We will for sure be back."
4,"Tried a spicy noodle with seafood and it was beyond expectation! Very tasty. 
However, they really should improve their service quality."
4,"Seeing all Korean and hardly any American at this place, you know you are at the right place for authentic Korean food! Distant and pricey in comparison to Oishii; however, you get better environment and complimentary side dishes & soup. The veggies in Binimbop is quite traditional and authentic."
4,"I love this spot as a go-to breakfast spot. The Original Pancake house has a great menu for a price that is comparable to what I consider to be lower quality diners (Denny's and Eat n' Park). Why not go to the Original Pancake house if you have a choice between the two? 
There's plenty of setting in gigantic booths. I think the interior is furnished with Amish made fixtures. If they're not Amish, they still give you a quality feel. The booths are huge and eating in this place definitively won't leave you feeling desperate for your space to enjoy the time and meal there.
I've eaten there many times. I'm a huge fan of the weekday specials which are dirt cheap for such great combos! Most of the time I find myself there on a weekend though when the specials are not offered. It's then I really have to start choosing what I'm gonna satisfy myself with that morning. Pancakes are a no brainer, but all you get is pancakes unless you pay for a side of something else. That's the advantage of the weekday specials; your choice of eggs, meat, and pancakes (regular or special) for a low price. I've had so many of the special pancakes I can't decide which is my favorite. I can't say I've ever been disappointed though. I did get a crazy stomach ache one day trying to finish a full stack. Beware! It's a lot of pancakes! The omelets are also great. Again, on the weekends you're limited to a 6 eggs omelet VS. the weekday when you can get a smaller size. 6 eggs is a huge omelet! My favorite here is clear though...the Greek omelet is amazing! Stuffed with lamb, spinach, and that delicious cucumber sauce. Wow, what a great meal!
One of my only complaints is about the orange juice. They only offer one kind. I think it's fresh squeezed on site. I'm all about fresh squeezed, but there must be something about the oranges they use or maybe I just don't like pulp, but it's never what I'm looking for. The coffee, however, is great and you won't have any trouble taking down several cups of that.
When you're ready to go remember you have to pay up front near the exit. Don't sit at the table with your card out waiting for the waitress to take it for you. She probably will say something (because all the staff has been friendly and accommodating in my experience), but you can save yourself some minutes just knowing ahead of time! We you do leave, you can look over the hill to the Denny's below and feel good about yourself that you made the better choice :-)."
4,"Durham regions best pizza.  Everything was right, the ambiance is what you expect a pizza place to be, the crust was perfect, the ingredients were fresh, the wait was not too bad and the service was friendly.  The four of us shared a pie, no rush, we chatted, and left satisfied.  This is a great place to meet with old friends and get reacquainted"
4,I absolutely love this place. They have a variety of items to choose from and you get to build your own bowl. Quiet place to chill and enjoy a nice lunch. Price is around the same you would pay at chipotle or five guys (nicer fast food dining so it's a little pricey). I've gone multiple times and have always had fast great service.
4,"It's always last minute for me and as I realized my groupon offer was expiring in two days I made my way to P&B and it's always a nice experience with the added bonus of such a good deal. I was promptly serviced despite arriving early, nice head massage and blown out with care and patience. Can't remember my stylist's name but he did take the extra time to using hot tools even when I said I didn't need any as it wasn't any special occasion. As my hair is Asian fine he said as a perfectionist he couldn't allow me to leave not perfectly satisfied! Thx again :)"
4,Love this place! I love gyros and they make a good one but I wish they put more meat on them.
4,"Prince Sushi Mississauga is a good choice for a quick lunch or take-out.  Pretty decent quality at a very reasonable price.  AYCE option for dinner after work too.

Food - They are pretty busy so the sashimi/sushi cycles through fairly quickly.  Pretty good variety of sushi, sashimi and maki items and portion sizes are good.  Combo lunches are a great deal with miso, salad and rice included.  Spicy Salmon hand rolls are one of the better choices.  Sashimi cuts can be a bit on the thick side sometimes but that's more personal preference for me.

Service - Very friendly and responsive.  The servers really work for their money... they are on the go the whole time during the lunch hour times to ensure everyone gets served quickly and attentively.  10% discount for pickup and order ahead over the phone and it is usually ready in 10 minutes.  Friday lunch seems to be the busiest day and can sometimes have short line-ups for tables.

Environment - Smaller and intimate with pretty basic table set-ups... no sectioned off booths like at Prince Steakhouse in Etobicoke.

For mid-level sushi this is my go to in Mississauga."
4,"Vua Sandwichs is a unique, unassuming Vietnamese restaurant on St. Denis.  They offer take-out style Vietnamese sandwiches, sushi, salads, side dishes and beverages.  The restaurant itself is clean, well let and has seating in both the cafeteria area and upstairs.

The Vietnamese and regular sandwiches start at 3$ each for a 7"", and 3.50$ for a 10"".  There are enough vegetarian options between the sushi, salads and sandwiches.  Most of the cooked, Chinese style food had fish or meat in it. 

Vua offers lots of discounts on bulk purchases such as buy 5 pieces of sushi, get 1 free and buy 3 sandwiches, get 1 free.  These are great options for catering and parties.   

There are lots of beverage options including aloe drinks, bubble tea, Vietnamese coffee, both hot and cold and smoothies.  If you're looking for cheap, quick and fresh food near Berri-UQAM, then this is a great choice."
4,"Yum...we stopped in for a snack yesterday and I was wishing it was for a full meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dolma with cucumbers and tomatoes on the side.  It was the perfect snack to hold me over until a big dinner later that night.  The staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, the menu had all the best greek dishes and the prices were reasonable too...so, what's not to like?"
4,"I had a very good experience with my groupon deal.  I made the reservation through the website, it was pretty easy and I showed up and the guy who did my hair was really nice, too bad I can't remember his name.  He was very friendly.  I am pretty easy going and I was not having any special event, just a mom's night out, but I got a lot of compliments from my blow out."
4,"Living in the suburban west-end (Mississauga), there are a ton on AYCE sushi places to choose. 
Usually we venture over to 168 Japan Buffet on Dundas to satisfy our cravings, especially since majority of what we eat at AYCE sushi consists of sashimi, so cheaper prices or lunch rates don't make much difference. 

The bf wanted to try a new place, and seeing as how Prince sushi was one of the few places that still serves Spider Rolls (Soft shell crab), he was immediately sold.

On Sundays, they only open for dinner service, starting at 5pm. When we got there a bit after 5, we were their first table for the evening. However, half way through our meal, the place was packed! They take reservations, so I definitely recommend calling ahead if you're planning to go in a large group.

The ambiance is very different, and you certainly don't feel like you're dining at your typical All-You-Can-Eat.

The service we received there was probably one of the better, if not best, in any AYCE sushi joints in Mississauga. The servers were quick and attentive, regardless of how busy it got.

We order an assortment of sashimi; Salmon, White Tuna, Butter Fish, Red Snapper. It was all fresh! Perfect cut, wasn't frozen (unlike Sashimi Island..), no fishy smell.

The avocado in our Salmon and Avocado maki roll was fresh, and wasn't browning, not too much rice, an OK amount of rice on the unagi sushi, and the Spider Rolls were huge.

The only downer - they don't have much of a selection for grilled foods and appetizers, compared to 168 sushi. Also, no red bean ice cream!

Overall, although their menu isn't as extensive as some other places, the quality of their food and service definitely wins you over. We would definitely go back, especially for their sashimi!

Service: 5/5
Quality: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Menu: 3.5/5"
4,"Good pitas and good people. They gave my son a fresh warm pita from the conveyor and gave us a tour. 

I had a falafel sandwich. The falafel was very good but, as someone stated previously, the falafel to veggie ratio is a bit off. Still tasty but not the best I ever had."
4,"My coworkers and I frequent Osaka for lunch. We typically call ahead to order. By the time we get to the location, our orders are ready. The hibachi menu is pretty cheap for lunch and the portion sizes are HUGE! I normally make 2 meals out of the $6 dish. Great deal, right?! I always get the Teriyaki Chicken with Mixed Vegetables. It comes with either fried or steamed rice. In case you were wondering, Teriyaki sauce is a little bit sweeter than Hibachi sauce. It depends on your preference, but I like the teriyaki sauce more.

Last time I went, the host informed me that they have a sushi special on Wednesdays (Dine-In only). I can't remember if he said Buy One Get One Free or Buy One Get One 50% Off. Either way, I'm tempted to come back to try the sushi (since the Hibachi dishes are pretty good)."
4,"I was pretty excited when my boyfriend and I found this place over on the east side because we typically drive to Ahwatukee to our usual poke place when we're craving. For being nearby, it's not too bad; however, I'd still make the drive to my fave poke spot. 

The fish was fresh, thank goodness, because having a bad experience with poke can really kill ya vibes. The salmon and spicy tuna were good, albeit being rather small portions. Avocado is chunky style (not a fan), but it was fresh. They also offer spicy crabmeat in addition to reg. crabmeat (get the spicy!). The Volcanic Bowl was solid. Lots of toppings, so consequently pretty  flavorful. Sauces were good; I recommend mixing the house with the spicy yuzu and adding spicy mayo drizzle on top. 

The reason why I wouldn't mind driving a little further for poke is not because of quality per se, but rather for the portion. While it was tasty, the portions for proteins and toppings were quite small compared to what I've received elsewhere! The serving for masago was so sad :( Additionally, I got the white rice and it was kind of hard--maybe just a bad batch.

Overall, it's a good spot for poke for the east side, but for a more decent serving size, try elsewhere."
4,"Everyone has their little neighborhood hot spots and THIS is mine.  I feel like a proud mother right now as I review this place because I live right down the street and we don't have much else to offer in this east charlotte/sorta matthews/mint hill area.  I'm proud to call Osaka my own.  

Osaka is our claim to fame.  

The atmosphere is not that great, the service is just okay and if you are ordering take-out it will be somewhat of a chaotic mess when you arrive.  They are clearly understaffed but I drove by yesterday and saw a ""We are hiring"" sign so that is a good thing!  Whenever I pick up my take-out the cashier sifts through a TON of receipts on the desk and somehow pulls out the right one.  It is actually quite impressive.

As far as the food...very fresh, consistent and great flavor.  They have excellent sushi.  I even love their vegetable roll for all the vegetarians out there....typically a veggie roll will have a cucumber and some carrot--bland and pukity.  But, Osaka takes it up a notch--they have asparagus, ginger relish, cucumber, carrot and you have the option to add cream cheese.  ***Insider's TIP: No matter what roll you get, they throw in a few free pieces when you order take-out!  They typically throw in something similar to a spider roll with eel sauce drizzled on top. 

I've also had their vegetable teriyaki over rice and that was also excellent.  The veggies were fresh--broccoli, onions, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, peppers.  They are not overly saturated in soy sauce but rather tossed lightly in their teriyaki sauce.  It comes with a side salad and a side of their ginger sauce.  The ginger sauce is awesome.

The location is inconvenient for so many people and it isn't like you are going to make a night out of hanging out in Mint Hill...but if you are in this area, it is worth the visit.  Heck, if you DON'T live in this area, it is worth a visit.  It is actually worth the drive!!  See you there!"
4,"Despite what I've heard about the sushi at Osaka, my first visit was fare from the kitchen, and I was pleasantly impressed.

They offer the expected hibachi entrees, as well as a nice selection of tempura dishes. I opted for the tempura chicken and vegetables - very crisp and tasty! The ginger dressing used on the salads is not the spicy, tangy dressing you normally find, which provided a nice change. The chefs were experimenting that night and brought us a sample of an appetizer not on the menu near the end of our meal: a jalapeno concoction that was quite good.  Another plus for me is that they include tofu as a protein option, and they actually cook it well.

The staff are very quick and incredibly friendly. I'll be visiting again pretty soon."
4,Reminded me of a good few places from back up north in New England. The size is where pizza should be at. Well worth the walk in the snow.
4,"I frequently visit this Starbucks maybe 3 times a week and have never stepped foot inside... kind of weird, but the drive thru is so efficient I just don't need to! Even when the lines are long it moves along fairly quickly so I never really have any problems. 

I did notice another yelper mention the smoke being and issue and that has to be my only issue here. While the outdoor seating is nicely focused towards traffic and decent sights, it does suck to have to roll up your windows to protect yourself and/or children from unhealthy smoke. For that I have to take 1 star. 

The drinks are always made consistently. I actually feel that if you order through the app it's cheaper... something I've learned with kids white chocolate peppermint mochas during winter! 

Happy lattes guys!"
4,: I want to Kandahar kabab what I nice rest. Super service nice food great to go whit family friends
4,"I love coming here for the lamb. For me, the lamb is always perfect and delis. 
The ambience is 4.5 
The food is great 4.5
my only complaint is the server we had, she was not helpful and slightly snobbish. She forgot our order couple of times, did not apologize for doing so. but overall the whole experience was great! I would go back over and over again."
4,"Ben Avery, a 1600+ acre shooting range in desert Arizona outside of Phoenix, appears to be one of the more popular destinations on a Sunday afternoon, and among the highest that do not involve any kind of alcohol or controlled chemical substances. For the susprisingly low price of $7/shooter (targets around $1 or less) and the cost of one's own ammo, weapon, ear and eye protection, and after watching a five minute safety video, one too can let out one's aggression and/or boredom with lethal force in a legal fashion.

Call me a city slicker (an ironic descripton since I am more often derided as a dweller of suburbia) but, despite firing off about ten chambers worth of a family-owned .38 Special, and since talking is almost impossible over the sounds of gunfire during the shooting rounds, by far the most interesting thing here was the people watching. Besides a general feeling of having stumbled upon a casting call for extras for Red Dawn:

- The goth woman accompanied by the long haired hippie toting what appeared to be an assualt shotgun that I would have expected illegal and whose choice of target was simply a wooden board with no sheet that didn't stand a chance
- The jolly older man with a .44 magnum who joked about using it as an anti road-rage deterrent from a moving vehicle
- The hardcore sniper shooting at a target 500 yards away who needed to use a scope to see the results of his firing
- Blonde, blue-eyed All-American children that couldn't have been over 10 firing pistols with a smile (and hopefully the gravity of the situation)
- The ultimate hipster toting his rifle in a guitar case
- The announcer who continuously reminded people over loudspeaker to stay away from the firearm tables during the ceasefire break which, after about the ten-thousandth time, must get old for them
- Walter Sobchak (... not really on this one, but I was holding out hope)

I'll admit I don't have much experience with these facilities, but for an outdoor range with many other ranges to cater to competitive shooting, especially in ideal outdoor weather, Ben Avery seemed like a good place to spend a few hours for those averse to physical exercise (recoil-induced wrist-stretching notwithstanding) and for some father-son bonding. I'd implore you to be safe - but the friendly NRA-approved range master will remind you of that at least five times during the course of a normal visit."
4,"Considering that I've been eating Banh Mi from Garden Grove, California - Vua Sandwiches appeals to me for a number of reasons. 

Service: The service here is pretty friendly. They gave us some good suggestions and could tell that we were from out of town. They speak both Vietnamese and French here. They gave us two complimentary Cafe Sua Da which were strong and tasty! Just like how a french pressed coffee should be.

Food: The sandwiches here are much more rich than the ones that I had in Orange County...mainly because they put a lot of mayonaise/butter sauce on the outside. They even offer to toast it for you. I had the Dac Biet (Special) and tried some of the Xa Xiu (BBQ pork) which were all really tasty. The pate is rich and is probably some of the best pate that I have had. 

They also offer some take out sushi and che along with french baked goods. You can buy some food to go (there is limited seating) or enjoy your sandwiches out in the park. We took our sandwiches back to our hotel. 

Bottom Line: Buy 5 sandwiches and get a free drink!"
4,"Love the Gyro.  A simple little place.

Did not like the humus..  no way even close to like.  Frys were done well and tasted great!

So far a place to hit on the way home or lunch.

Keep up the good work!"
4,All the traditional dishes are true to form and authentic. No mayonnaise or sour cream used in their dipping sauces/hummus.The chicken was flavorful and fresh.
4,"This pizza is great! And I'm really happy we have a place like this in south side now! But I like dipping my pizza in ranch and I was really disappointed in theirs. Its definitely just hidden valley squeezed into a container and sold for $.50 other than that the pizza is really good especially for the price I just wish they had their own ""bar-style"" ranch"
4,"In had the opportunity to eat here last December 2014 with some out of town co workers.  I am not a sushi lover so, you ask, why would I go here??  Well I was assured that although sushi was the speciality there were lots of other options.  And I was right.  The menu was full of many different dishes and at $21 per person all you can eat I left full and satisfied.  Serve was quick, friendly and efficient.  Everything was freshly made and tasted awesome."
4,"Le petit resto/fast food Vua a été mon endroit fétiche lorsque je terminais mes études à l'UQAM. De bon sandwhich style vietnamien appelé BanhMi ( mes préférés) ou des sandwhich classics ( style jambon fromage) avec petits pain baguettes y sont offerts à un prix plus que raisonnable ,  de 2 à 5 $ ! Il y a éagalements des petites collations comme les chips à la crevettes ( qu'une de mes amies décrit comme étant ""rafraichissante"" , ne me demandez pas pourquoi lol ) ou encore les sushis frais, les pots de fruits, du yaourt style ""vietnamien"", toutes sortes de boissons fruités comme du jus de mangue ou à l'aloe vera ( mon préféré) ! Aussi des biscuits, des boulettes de viandes, des rouleaux impériaux  et j'en passe ! 

Il y a un peu de tout mais sachez que ceci n'est pas vraiment un resto ou on s'assoit et commande. En fait on choisit nos snacks et boissons et ensuite on fait la ligne pour faire la commande de notre sandwhich et on termine à la caisse. Il y a quelques sièges pour s'assoir et des bancs à l'extérieur en été mais en général c'est plus un truc à prendre pour emporter et déguster ailleurs ! 

Comme il est situé juste à côté de l'Université du Québec à Montréal, communément appelé ''L'Université du Peuple'' et parce que les prix conviennet au budget de l'étudiant moyen,  ceux-ci  y sont naturellement très présent à n'importe quel moment de la journée et surtout aux alentours de midi ! 

En tout, Vua est un bon endroit à considérer si on veut juste un bon sandwich fait vite et bien pour continuer sa route !"
4,Kost is a unique experience. From the moment you walk into the Bisha hotel where the door man greets you as he opens the door to stepping into the resturant a contemporary modern space. The service is kind and friendly all you have to do is just ask! We initially got a table inside by the window but after asking the hostess she was able to give us a lounge table outside by the pool! The view is breath taking with a great view of the CN tower. So the million dollar question is this place just for the view? No the food is actually pretty good. Their calimari is a must try along with their smoked bone in beef ribs. The only bad is the washroom is on another floor and quite a far walk.
4,This is unfair because I came in Super hungry after all morning meetings. Everything tasted good even the onions. In fact I almost ate the wrapper my pita came into. The pita was awesome!
4,Although this place may not look like much it has a lot going for it. They have a combination of Greek and Asian food. Meatless options for anyone who doesn't eat meat like myself. There is something here for everyone and the flavors are on point. I won't lie we have passed by many times but decided to stop in last week and here I am back again. I recommend for a quick bite. It's not a fancy place but the food is what we come for!
4,"Sushi for two.  $54 or so....  Folks, this is a lot of food.  2 Salad, 2 soup, terryaki stir fry vegetable platter, tempura veg platter --- then a huge plate of assorted sushi and two rolls of your choice.  (check out my pic with my son)

The sushi is fresh, the cuts are extra large, the service is top notched - Need I say more!!!!!!"
4,"Let me start by saying that I loved the ambience. Interior is spacious colourful and not tacky. However they can certainly keep the music down. Also the entrance is so modest that you may miss it even if it is staring you in the face.

It was my first visit and I order the Adana Kabab and Turkish Tea. It was probably the best minced veal kabab i have had in years. Accompanied by a soft bread that covered the length of the kabab like a comforter. 
I will be returning to sample the other items on the menu.
I highly recommend this place.
4 star because they definitely need to up their service."
4,"Came here to celebrate my birthday with 4 of my friends on a Sunday for brunch. We didn't have a reservation and had drinks at the bar while waiting for an hour for a table. We got seated right in the corner with the best view of the CN tower! Service was great and we we're never forgotten. Had much selection on their menu, which my vegetarian friend was also grateful for. Everyone was satisfied with their meals and portion. One thing we didn't expect was for a mimosa to cost just as much as the food, both around $16. 

Overall, had 0 complaints, everything was amazing! Great for photos and is very aesthetically pleasing."
4,"Drove through to grab beverages prior to heading into the Cannery with family in from out of town. The line was a little lengthy, but they shuttled the caffeine craving patrons through rather quickly. The quick service and friendly drive thru attendant were better than  the average drive thru experience."
4,"Stopped by for lunch and got the lunch special, gyro with fries and a soda for $8.99. The gyro was really good, the fries were well cooked and hot, and my order only took a few minutes. The place was fairly crowded for Tuesday lunch and some were obviously regulars. If I lived locally, I'd probably be a regular too."
4,"Excellent food and service with a menu that is not overly complex. The place looks quite bland on the outside but is actually quite delightful on the inside! 

We had hummus and fresh made bread to start; then each ordered a dish: Okra Bamya (stewed Okra with tomatoes, is vegetarian but you can ask them to add chicken/beef if you like), Meatballs (beef based but shaped more like fingers/kofta), Beef Kabab beledie (shredded beef on a bed of bread cubes, smothered in tomato sauce w/ side of thick yoghurt). All entrees came with either rice or fries. Kunefeh desert was very good but the entrees was so enormous, we had one shared amongst 4 people! :)"
4,Loving Benny's. Good thin crust pizza. Prices aren't bad and pizza will last for days even if you have a healthy Pittsburgh appetite.
4,"This was my go-to place when I needed a good, cheap Vietnamese sandwich. Although the workers usually only speak French/Vietnamese, all the sandwiches are labeled by numbers on the big screen, so it's not too difficult to communicate. About $3, and I always get the little sesame dessert balls for about $1.50. All sushi and to-go items are 30% (maybe 20%, not sure) after 9pm. They sell individual pieces of sushi (shrimp, salmon, egg, etc.) for 99 cents which I think is great if you need a small fix.
Also, the milk tea + boba is kind of pricey here, but I'm also a California native where I can get it for $2. Here it's around $4ish dollars. 
Come here for a good banh mi in Montreal. I miss you, BBQ pork sandwich aka #7."
4,"Conveniently located on St Denis and Maisonneuve, this place is the place to go for inexpensive, fast, yet delicious food. I had a budget of $5 and consulted the MTL Blog for a cheap place to eat that wasn't your everyday sub, and this was the result.

I got the BBQ Pork Banh Mi, and it tasted fantastic. The carrots, radishes, and toasting of the bun were just right. Unlike your average sub sandwich, the banh mi's bun is light and airy but still crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So much flavor in the bang mi! The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was that the BBQ pork was hard to bite off and chew. I got a small (7-inch) for $3.95, which was perfect for my poor-college-student budget.

Also, the service was great considering how busy they were. They were friendly and quick even though they had to deal with our big group/first timers. In addition to banh mi, they had a variety of sushi and bubble tea to choose from, but I can't say much on those since I didn't order any."
4,"I went to the one on University, near McGill metro. I really like the decor, the options are varied. It's interesting how most of the hot entrees are in the self-serve refrigerated shelves with the sushi. There is a microwave in the shop where you can heat up your food if you're eating on the spot. 

The price-quantity ratio is what I found Vua does best. The sushi is also nice and soft, unlike the cardboardy dry texture and taste that a certain other sushi chain tends to offer from their ready-to-eat boxes.

But the flavors arent aaaamazing as far as asian cuisine comes. This is a great affordable and tasty meal on the go type of place, a healthier fast food option. Overall I like!"
4,"this has to be the best afghan food in scarborough/markham. they are pricey and are super busy , but if you catch them at a good time their food is great. ive eaten at other places but this place honestly serves way more food and it tastes way better. their white based mayo/ranch sauce is DELICIOUS. though i would say their food is pricey and they do need to expand their front desk to serve more people. considering the restaurant itself is pretty large, they should have more cashier stations. i get the boldak kebab which always tastes great !"
4,Going thru the drive thru is the best! Quick an easy for the over priced coffee we need to get that boost in the morning. White chocolate mocha is my favorite!
4,"After reading the reviews, this was the first place my husband and I came in Montreal. 

The banh mi were very solid. I had the beef and he had the pork. The prices are great. 

The bread was good, as was the sauce. I would have liked a tangier pickled carrot; the sandwich was a little too sweet and one dimensional. 

The pineapple bubble tea was good; very fruity."
4,"I want to give a ""shout out"" to Jesse McMahan, the General Manager at Chapman Mazda, 1234 W. Bell Road in Phoenix, AZ. Recently, we attended a run to his establishment with our club, the Old Pueblo Miata Club out of Tucson, AZ. For a nominal fee, one could enter their cherished chariot in the car show, and/or purchase raffle tickets for the grand prize. ALL proceeds from either of these choices went to the Japan Relief Fund. This event wasn't necessarily about selling cars, but rather the generating of funds to help out the folks in Japan beleaguered by the horrendous actions of a still very -active planet. It was the first of its kind for Chapman; a gathering of many Miata enthusiasts: (cue the ""Zoom-Zoom"" song here) for clubs, individuals and owners of these wonderful machines. My husband was holding the winning ticket for a COMPLETE set of 
Mazda tires. He almost fell over when his number was called, and asked the emcee to repeat it again, as he couldn't believe his good fortune. We were absolutely thrilled to win those beautiful tires. We've never won anything like that ever before. What really impressed us was the fact that Mr. Mc Mahan arranged to have the tires sent to us. His original estimate was: ""Within a week's time."" While this would have been great as it stood, Jesse called the following Monday morning to tell us there was a vehicle coming to Tucson from Chapman in Phoenix that very same day, and that they'd put the tires in that vehicle for the trip. All I had to do was to pick them up from the Jim Click Mazda at 6244 East 22nd Street here in Tucson. When I called, Tony, the manager at the Tucson location verified the tires had safely arrived and to come get them. Jesse McMahan's generous gesture was above and beyond. To tell you that impressed us both even more, is an understatement. 
When I come across a company and/or person that delivers outstanding service, and does indeed go 'above and beyond' like Chapman Mazda did, they make my day. Here is a company that I would be more than happy to do business with. On Jesse's business card, it reads: ""Not your Cookie Cutter Dealer."" And the top line of that card reads: ""If you're into cookie cutters, throw this away. If you're into the driver's alternative, contact Jesse McMahan. "" We will, Jesse. We will."
4,Had the Chicken Sharma plate with half salad half rice. Chicken and salad were great!!! Rice was whatever. Ordered a side of hummus which was plain and would not recommend. Guy at register was friendly oh and came out fast
4,"Yum yum yum! 

The strawberry waffle was magnificent! The waffle was.... Perfect. Can't believe how well it came out. Cream was a little too much, maybe get it on the side? 

The eggs Benedict was average, but at least it wasn't horrible. I didn't like the potatoes that came with it. Could be cooked a little longer and in smaller pieces. Looked like boulders on my plate. 

Don't underestimate the ""thick bacon"" which was AMAZING! I've never had thick bacon before, but I sure did love it. I got three eggs with it as well. Eggs was great as well, but I wish they didn't cook all three together on a small pan. It made the egg whites really thick. 

Fruit salad bowl small was alright. I don't like grapes.!8 should of asked what it consisted of. It's seasonal so be sure to always ask! 

ORANGE JUICE!! Freshly squeezed made me nostalgic to my mama's OJ. A+"
4,Love the waiting room & the reading material it was a bit tricky to find so I ended up arriving late. They did not give me a hard time so that was cool. Over all cool experience the customer service could be better that way you come happy and leave happy she seemed a bit bothered when I asked to use a yelp a discount I have with yelp
4,"Great place to grab Mediterranean food. They have a grill running just about all day which you can order off the menu right then & there, items that are freshly made-to-order however way you like it (just be sure to specify prefs when placing your order). This place also doubles as an essential supermarket that sells just about anything you'd look for. Would highly recommend the pita bread, gyros, falafel (very good), though honestly just about anything is pretty good & fair game. Prices are extremely reasonable & this place looks a whole lot better after the remodel. A pretty gem of a place in the Brookline neighborhood ... props to such an establishment."
4,Good food. Good decorated restaurant. Prices are pretty fair. The only thing I dint like was their souce and naan bread
4,The food here is absolutely amazing! The goat curry is my all time favorite. I would recommend to get takeout instead of eating in because it is a small restaurant and is a little worn down. I wouldn't recommend this  restaurant for someone who is looking for something fancy though.
4,"This is my go to place for viet in Richmond Hill
Must haves
1) House Special Beef Noodle Soup 
2) Curried Beef Brisket with Roti (portions on the smaller size but worth it)
3) House fried vermicelli noodle (I think #40 / #41) with chicken, shrimp, veggies
4) Spring Rolls

Tried almost all the viet restaurants within 15 minute drive from 16th & Bayview and this one is the best!"
4,"I got the usual Kabob but tried fish from my mother wish I has ordered that! Very busy location. But serves typical afghani food. I think Mentu were ok, I have had better!"
4,"I love this place. The hummus is great, the people are great. The lamb pies are absolutely incredible. This place will teach you anything you want to know about middle eastern food! A good friend of mine is Egyptian and moved here a few years ago and this place is the closest he said he's come to home. Have to respect that!"
4,"While visiting Phoenix during our Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, we figured what's a more American activity than shooting some guns? :)

My girlfriend (who's also my coworker) had recently attended a skeet shooting team building event so we thought we'd show off our skills to our boyfriends. The four of us arrived shortly after 10AM and they set us up with some waivers as we watched a safety video and took a short quiz. With our ear plugs, eye protection and shooting gear, we were ready to go. The guide gave us a quick demo on the clay releases, reinforced gun safety and then we were set to go on our own. We did manage to make it thru about 10 stations, but being that it gets quite hot in Phoenix as the day progresses, we didn't stay as long as we would have liked. (There was a whole other section of stations we could have tried out)

It worked out to be about $50 for us ($30 for 100 clays and $10 for gun rental + taxes) and honestly that's pretty good for a morning of entertainment."
4,"My go to Afghan place!! If you have any doubts about going, trust me you should go! It beats bamiyan by far in my opinion.

My favourite is the herati kebab with extra white sauce (make sure you ask for it, cause they're pretty stingy) The skewers are cooked to perfection and the sauces make the entire meal. The portions are also outrageous and can be shared between two people, unless you're like me and can devour the whole thing.

The only problem that I can think of is the service as it can take a while to get your food ready. There's been multiple times where I've called ahead to order and by the time I get there (around 20 minutes) it's still not done. But it's not that much of a problem as the food will be all worth the wait :)"
4,"I found this restaurant on Yelp and the photos convinced me to bring my family here. We were very pleased with the food and would go back again and watch out as the portions are very big!

We ordered:

-satay beef noodle soup: very savoury, lots of beef slices very tender and fresh, lots of peanuts. 

-beef curry with roti: a few potato cubes and the entire bowl was filled with lots of beef. Do watch out though as some of the thicker pieces of beef were not fully cooked where it was real pink and I could t eat it while being pregnant. Flavour was very authentic curry. 

-chicken and beef satay skewers: chicken very tender, beef cooked to medium so again I wasn't able to eat it while being pregnant but both were flavourful with hint of curry/satay. 

-pineapple fried rice: my husband loves to order this dish wherever he goes and he was very happy with it. There were bits of peanuts, shrimps, chicken and flavourful. 

Definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have Vietnamese food and has a big appetite as their portions are so huge."
4,"Gluten free options here! You feel welcome with a food allergy, not like a nuisance.  Delicious!!!"
4,"Last night was our first visit here despite always walking by.

I ordered a mushroom and garlic slice. My boyfriend ordered the daily special of jalapeno and bacon. 

My slice was delicious. Most pizza places around here always taste the same, but this slice was very flavorful... Not to mention insanely huge. Slices are about $4-6 depending on what you get.

I highly recommend. You have to experience their giant slices atleast once."
4,"Calling all LACTOSE INTOLERANT YELPERS - This is NOT the place for you.

If you love cheese then welcome to Pizza Pino's! 

I wish this place would do a reno.  It's a complete mess inside - you wouldn't want to stay and eat here.  It belongs on the show restaurant makeover, however don't be fooled - It doesn't reflect the quality of food.
On the website it looks better than what it really is.  They claim they are a sports bar - I beg to differ.   I came in here on a Wednesday night and it was DEAD.  A lot of people preorder and get takeout. 

I found this place hard to find too, it's tucked away near factory buildings and totally isolated. 

Back to the food: 

So I got the Pino's special which was pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms and I believe bacon? Can't recall now.

This place does their pizza the opposite way - the toppings are hidden under the brick of cheese they use.... seriously we are talking A LOT of cheese. Food is hot and a med size will feed 2 people with a few leftover slices for lunch the next day. 

Staff are friendly - a lot of their customers are regulars so they say hi and catch up on old convos - kinda of like a family unit in there.

If you ever have a pizza craving in Ajax - Head to Pino's!"
4,Found this gem through reviews on Yelp and I am so glad I did. This place offers great sandwiches that tastes authentic enough for us to visit this place twice while we were in the area. I got the grilled chicken since you can never go wrong with grilled chicken and I would definitely recommend it.
4,I have not been to the archery range at BA for years....its changed allot....very nice place....one suggestion it that they put up more signs....hard to find the right places to go for my son and I to shoot....one area was closed to only FITA shooters (again no sign saying that)
4,Very awesome place. Lamb burger was amazing. Schwarma was so-so. Look forward to trying more on the menu.
4,"I had a very helpful, polite, down to earth salesman help me. Tyrone was determined to help me get a great deal on a reliable car, since I live in Texas and my family lives here I drive back and forth to visit a lot. He really cared and helped without at all being that grotesque salesman who pushes everything. I truly appreciated his help and honesty, I'll definitely be sending people his way."
4,I got the vegetarian white pasta. It was $19 and not worth it at all. Very bland nothing special. I also had their rose wine and it was bitter and tasted cheap unlike the price. Other than that this place is stunning. So beautiful with a great view of the city. It was very loud at night but I would return for the gorgeous view and it is the reason for my high star rating
4,"A local pho shop with good flavors and filling portions for cost. There's nothing very unique about it, but also nothing offensive. The pho has a good bite and the soup base works well with the various oyster and hot sauces available for consumption. When you're here, try out the laksa or curry roti if you're looking for something different from pho."
4,"This place was great. It is pricey but the view is amazing. Our reservation was for 730- it wasn't too busy and we enjoyed a non chaotic atmosphere. Servers were knowledgeable and friendly. Around 930 it picked up and was a bit more crowded and loud (to be expected  given it was a sat night ). Atmosphere was great, good music, great decor.

Service was exemplary - the sommelier made great recommendations. We shared our meals tapas style - Tuna and beer tartar, chickpea salad, beef and swordfish skewer . By far the tuna and beer tartar were my favorite. Tuna tartare has some watermelon in it along with other ingredients which catches the mouth palate in a positive way. They adjusted our salad to take out the corn nuts for my friend (which was very kind of them ..) as she did not enjoy the combination or the crunch with the salad. I personally enjoyed the crunch.

All in all a lovely night in a great restaurant. I enjoyed the restaurant when it wasn't too busy ... so if you want a quiet evening make reso before 830 - not sure what the vibe is like on other days."
4,"Très bon vietnamien différent choix : japonais, vietnamiens et chinois sans perdre la qualité. J'ai pris un sandwich banh mi 4/5 bon sandwich, Maki été au saumon 3/5 (un peu lourd pour moi), banane tapioca en dessert 4/5 très bon un tt petit peu sucrée pour moi mais excellent.

Endroit a essayer et pas cher"
4,"First time here today. Coming from the east coast and used to indoor, high dollar places I really enjoyed it. Safety is number 1 here! I had no problems with the rules or the range masters. They were very friendly and offered great advice when I needed it. Trust me, anyone with a gun can shoot here and I bet they have seen it all. They have inexpensive targets for sale ( mine were .30cents) as well as ones up to $4....your not required to buy.
Expect to have a cease fire about every 20 minutes that lasts about 10 so folks can check/changle targets or distance.
They provide solid (concrete) shooting benchs under cover. I had no wait on a Sat. afternoon. I will definitly go back when my next build is done."
4,"Was craving some Korean food on a chilly autumn day and decided to come back here 
after having ""forgotten"" about it for a while. Food and atmosphere are good as ever, despite the prices for the Korean parts of the menu being a tad high. This time we got a soondubu (seafood tofu soup) and a bibimbap, which were pretty reasonable, and they came in generous portions. Both came with lots of ingredients and were very tasty, so these may be items that we'll order again.

We also noticed that some of the Japanese and Chinese menu items seemed pretty attractive, like the bento boxes or noodles. They're also more affordable and the portions are a good size, so come here rather than Oishii if you aren't rushed for time."
4,Couldn't carry it out had to get help just getting out of the door. Good pizza for a good price
4,"I never had a colon hydrotherapy done, and never really thought I would. However, I'd come back here. Tiffany made my visit very comfortable and informed me about how my diet affects my body. Your first visit always makes you nervous, but this place will definitely make you feel at ease!"
4,"So I've passed this place in Matthews many times but never actually got to try their food until his past weekend.  After running some Sunday errands, made our way over.  This place is a little tucked into the shopping center so you may not see the sign right away.  I still have fond memories of the drive through subway that used to be on the corner of the shopping center, but the Osaka shares the same building as Pizza Spigga which has been there forever as well.

Walk into a large restaurant space... sushi bar on the left and lots of tables on the right.  There's an outdoor seating area with a garden area (not just generic tables with umbrellas).  We were seated promptly (it was 5:30) but some tables were occupied.  One large group and a few scattered about.

Started with a godfather roll as an appetizer and my friend got a Miso soup.  The Godfather roll is indulgent:  tempura crab, cream cheese, alternating tuna and salmon on top, drizzled with aioli and a sauce.  The chicken hibachi (single) was awesome.  I'm used to just having carrots, but they give you zucchini and onions as well which is an added bonus in my book.  You could ask for extra sauce, but I'm a one saucer hibachi-goer... start dipping and then halfway through I pour the rest of the sauce on my remaining hibachi.

Overall, service was friendly and the food was even friendlier to the stomach.  If you leave hungry from this place, there might be something wrong (ask your doctor if you have a possible tapeworm)."
4,"This small shop on St. Denis has some awesome Vietnamese Bahn Mi. You can pick your ingredients from a board with offerings like BBQ pork, shredded pork meat, avocado and chicken. The bread, for a deli, are great and not too crusty. Costs are low and the bubble tea is fresh. Try the mango bbtea!"
4,"This place serves authentic Turkish food. Its got a nice atmosphere, with more formal setting compared to most Turkish restaurants in town. Lots of parking spaces is also a plus. The staff is super nice and polite. The only reason I did not rank them as 5 star is that the food portion is on the small side. I will go back to try more items from their menu."
4,"I've only gone once, but my technician was fantastic.  She made me feel very comfortable and at ease - which isn't the easiest thing to do while you're pushing crap out of your butt through a tube.  She also talked to me about my diet in general and possible deficiencies I might have based on what she was seeing in the tube and what I told her I consumed on a regular basis.

All in all it was a very pleasant visit.  The decor was nice, the rooms were clean, and the staff was informed, polite, and professional.

A+"
4,"My friends and family enjoy TOPH very much.   

They offer many options on pancakes (my guests ordered the buttermilk and chocolate variety).    

I am a sucker for their omelettes.   You can go large (6 egg!) if you want.   I kept it small - the size of a chipotle burrito with some home fries.

 Great Service / Great food / Good Price."
4,"If you want good basic asian comfort food, then Green Lemon Grass is the place for you.  My friend took me here years ago and their roti canai was so memorable, I kept reminding her that we should go back for more.  I rarely go to this part of town (Leslie & 16th) plus this little complex of eateries is hidden so you won't know this place exists unless you work in the area.

We were able to get a table for 2 quickly on a Friday night. 
I got:
Beef Pho
Hot soup was perfect after a week of Arctic temps.  The small was more than enough for me, broth was just right, not too salty. Good ratio of beef, noodles and broth.
We shared:
Roti Canai
MmmmM! just as I remembered... fresh roti and flavourful curry sauce.
My friend got:
Hainanese chicken
She wasn't too thrilled with her dish, thought it would've been better.  I wouldn't know since I haven't had that dish before. Luckily, the roti canai saved the day.

Service was very fast and our water and tea was refilled without asking.
I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I do look forward to my next meal there (hopefully not in another few years) so I'll bump it up to 4 stars."
4,"To all gluten free people..... 
There is GLUTEN IN THEIR SAUSAGE PATTIES But not the turkey sausage links.  They make PATTIES themselves and add flour to it so it doesn't burn when cooked. 

Their Maple syrup is considered to be gluten contaminated. But they say their flavored syrups are gf And they have a no sugar syrup they can give u. It has some chemicals in it that we normally avoid (like carmel and sorbate and artificial flavors etc.) so we bring our own syrup. 

We came the first time and we told the waitress that my young boys have issues with gluten. 
She told us nothing we ordered had gluten (eggs, sausage, gf pancakes, syrup butter) and we had issues. Ugh. Second time the different waitress was educated enough to inform us. 

Aside from that the food is amazing and the food portion is huge. Avoid on Sunday's after church bc this place is Jam packed with a relatively small parking lot (sadly due to Scott township laws about not excavating hills)"
4,"I had the pleasure of stopping by this as part of a wine tasting event and was thoroughly impressed. The location is amazing, phenomenal views, good service and good food. I had the trout salad and it was done absolutely perfectly. I rarely order fish when dining out because they never make it as well as I do, but this was an exception. It was delicious, tender and tasty. It is pricey and there wine prices are high, so beware."
4,"The food was real good. Nice selection of fish. Very fresh,small place. After all my adding my bowl was about 15$. Would go again."
4,Went to this place to see just how big the pizzas are after hearing about it. Its true they are HUGE. They're $30 and topping I think was 5? They only make one size so I hope you're hungry. The pizza was good but nothing special. Just a giant classic cardboard pizza.
4,"This place should be called the best place on earth to eat delicious pancakes that will make your stomach crave more and more. I enjoyed just about everything here. It has a very simple elegance to the interior. Not over done and almost too plain but somehow it works. 

Interior: As I said above, its plain and simple; very easy on the eyes. 

Service: I enjoyed the frequent coffee refills. I had close to 3x more than my usual here and I was wired like Tweak from South Park. The food came out quick and the servers were friendly. 

Food: They serve a typical 'breakfast menu' but its exploding with options. They have a large variety of pancakes and breakfast meats to choose from. They seem to be great with pancakes and breakfast meats, however the eggs I saw seemed to have sat in the air too long and turned a grey color. The pancakes are like a dessert to me. They aren't fluffy but more dense and like a fluffy cake. Its very delicious. Each meal comes with 3 6in pancakes so you definitely get your moneys worth here. 

In the end you will leave here feeling like you ate 10 bowls of Wheaties and still be a champion. I plan to return on Sundays."
4,"Great place.
Quick, efficient, cheap and quite good. 

I've never had Vietnamese Bahn Mi so I don't have a reference point. I will say that their vegetarian sub with tofu, carrots and mushrooms was incredible. Flavourful, not too dry and grilled to the right temperature. 

The service was really quick and polite. 

If you're looking for a quick lunch - this is your place."
4,"At Kandahar Kabab, you place your order, seat yourself, and wait for them to call your number. The dishes are huge and can easily feed two people with heaps of rice, meat, and salad. The orange sauce is spicy and delicious. The restaurant is big and airy so there was lots of space to sit on a weekday evening. I wouldn't really come here for the ambience, but the food is great!"
4,"One word: WOW! And not just ""wow"", we're talking ""WOW!"" I wish I could just leave it at that but that probably won't do. Pizza Pino is a treasure that my friends and I came across while visiting another friend in Ajax. They serve pizza, pasta, salad, yummy fried goodness, all the good stuff. You can add a variety of toppings but they have set prices for set toppings, such as the meat lovers, or veggie pizza. Their pizza is similar to Chicago pizza for those who've tried, but thinner crust.

The thing I love about this place is how fresh their toppings are; the chicken chunks are huge and tender, unlike other franchise pizza joints that have meats as hard as wood. And for the cheese lovers, you don't even have to worry about getting extra cheese because the amount of cheese you get on your pizza is ridiculously thick. Pino definitely does not cheap out on their toppings. 

We ordered a large that on their website claimed to feed 3-4 people, but even with four hungry stomachs there were at least a quarter left of the pizza by the end of our feast. I'd say a large easily feeds 4-5! I ordered a medium on my own, and that alone was more than enough for my family of four for dinner!

It's pricey though, and that large pizza came up to $40, the medium $20. Granted, we customized our own pizza so it went by a different price. There was also a 45 minute wait on delivery, where it usually takes half the time (or so I'm told) so be prepared to wait for your food! Or call in ahead of time. But I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is a pizza lover. 

10/10 would come again!"
4,I love the location of it. Right off I15 and next to Craig Rd. The staff is great and service is pretty good. They don't burn my coffee like other Starbucks.
4,"Great place, Nice location, nice clean restaurant, good food and usually we have good service. Personally i enjoy this place during the week. On the weekends it can get a little crazy and loud beyond what is comfortable for chatting. Also their menu prices go up on the weekends. You pay more for the same food depending on the day lol. I have never seen another resturaunt do that."
4,"We have been there recently again.  I have to agree that their service was fast and courteous. 

I enjoyed their Pho the most, big portion for the 3 times we've visited.  

Their roti and curries are A-OK.  I found roti too gressy.  I guess I am comparing against Restoran Malaysia (my fav).  But curries were above average thai places- big portions."
4,Good place. Specially for large groups with children. Lots of choice on the menu. Their Swedish pancakes are great.
4,"Aaaaamazing. I want to go back, right now.

I ordered a BBQ pork banh mi, I wish they stuffed it with more pork but it was a GREAT sandwich. Even the food stored in the fridges looked delicious and fresh. 

The service is quick, the prices are affordable and reasonable, and they have some good deals too. On a nice day, take your food out to their little patio and soak up the sun. You will not be disappointed!"
4,The curry lamb was flavourful tender and true to the menu rating wasn't too spicy. It could have been more hot (as in heat) but I like my food piping hot.  The spicy beef noodle soup wasn't good at all. This is the first time I've ever seen my husband not eat his meal bc he didn't like it.  I think it was the anise but it just lacked flavour.   I'd give it resto 3.5 but since I can't do half stars IL give it a 4.  I liked my lamb and the service was attentive and fast plus we will come again to try the other dishes.
4,"Great little spot for when the Greek craving is knocking on your tum.

I followed the lead of my friend and went for the vegetarian platter which was just delightful! Two plates of delightful in fact! There were 4 dolmades (yum), two falafels resting very comfortably on a bed of tabbouleh (excellent), accompanied by pita bread, tahini, and excellent hummus. I enjoyed everything on the plate!

The prices are fair and the servings pretty generous IMO.

They did use styrofoam for dining in--I know this is a less expensive option but it puts many people off."
4,"This is a rather large outdoor range with a lot of shooting options.  Even when it is very busy, as it has been lately, it is very well run with good precision and strong safety control.  They provide standup target frames for rifle and pistol shooting which you can set to a wide variety of distances.  The staff is courteous and friendly while maintaining safety across the range."
4,"Great service, great food!

Went here once and had a great experience.  

Place is a little small, so be prepared to wait for a seat.  But once seated, service is quick! Its an AYCE and price is about $30 tax in.  Would definitely go here again:)"
4,"Alright first things first, I always go to Pho 88 near bamburgh circle just because its been close to me forever and this was probably the first time where I ventured out to somewhere else far and have to admit, totally worth it!

At first my friend told me it was like in a plaza, and it looked like crap from the outside looking in but got damn, they are good and fast.

Large House Special Pho was dope! Only bad thing is that they have no cold air/ventilation in the restaurant... but other than that for $8.95, can't miss out on this deal!

Next time if I do visit, I will probably try other dishes, but its good!"
4,"Great, knowledgeable vets and staff. I've never taken my snakes to the vet until a month ago. My snake had serious mouth rot and after treatment and $800 charged, she seems to be well now. Though every time I go for follow up they tell its the last ""treatment"" and add more medication.. the increasing bill is becoming a bit ridiculous, I never thought treatment for mouth rot could be this expensive. I just hope my snake is truly well now. Don't think i can soebf more money on shots, Ranging from $20-$85 per shot."
4,"The food is very good, I prefer the overall flavour over Bamiyan Kabab. They don't wait on you, you just wait for your order number to be called and go find a seat. Their white sauce that comes with the salad is yummy, I always get extra. Also I would not recommend the mango drinks, it just tastes like watered down mango syrup from a can."
4,"As long as they keep serving tofu, I'll keep coming back. lots of vegan friendly options."
4,"Love their teriyaki and gyoza, large variety of sushi. Friendly service but can be a little slow as they are always busy. Restaurant is a bit small and dark."
4,"Although Poki is not my favorite thing, I appreciate the popularity that it's gaining. This place is new and clean, and a bit slow because people don't know about it yet, so take advantage.  The bowl was masterfully assembled, and a beauty to look at. A light healthy meal, and although it's not cheap it's worth every penny."
4,"The first two times I wanted to have dinner at this restaurant I called and no one answered the phone ... no answering machine either. So I figured it was permanently closed. I called a third time and they were open! Not very far South East from where I Iive but it feels like it's in the middle of farmlands, well at night it does. Inside, surprise it a bona fide Japanese road house. Cool. It was a personal celebration and we went a little nuts ordering sashimi, nigiri and rolls : the dinner ran $150 for two but we took home enough to have a full lunch the next day. Plus the house offered us a number of complimentary samplings. 

Most of it was very good to excellent -with a couple of hiccups, like for example the yellow tail was still nearly frozen but overall it made for an excellent sushi house on the outskirts of Charlotte of all places. 

FYI no you can't get fresh fish in Charlotte nor in most other cities either. It HAS to be frozen first, but that doesn't make it bad. In Miami the charter sport fishing boats used top show up at local Japanese restaurants with fresh Wahoo, Mahi mahi and others, but they've over-fished the area to complete near complete extinction.
Welcome to the 21sts and enjoy it while you still can."
4,Great service and customer focus. Food is always fresh and sauces are homemade. Tons of side options and fresh toppings that go on your bowl.
4,You have to order in the counter and they'll give you a number. Be patient service is slow. Food is ok in affordable price. They don't have enough staff to clean the tables.
4,"Not a fancy place, the food is very good though. Try the kimchi pancake. I highly recommend it."
4,"I LOVE this pizza joint and eat here religiously. They load up the toppings and cheese, and its so thick you need a fork and a knife to cut into it. 

I have not rewarded them another star simply because the service is a hit and miss. One specific waitress here was very condescending when my family attended the place a year and a half ago."
4,"Do you like pancakes? Then this place is for you.   Went at 10:00 am on a Saturday morning and the place was packed but only had a short wait.

I had choco chip pancakes (short stack) with a side of bacon.  They go crazy with the whipped cream, which is a good thing.  Bacon was nice and crisp and the portion was generous.  Our server was very nice.

Table was clean and the place looks tidy overall.   Definitely a great place for breakfast.  

Decor is weird, though.  It doesn't look like a pancake house.  I am just wondering if the building was previously a German restaurant or steakhouse."
4,"I go through the drive thru at this location several times on occasion I would leave with a free drink due to long wait, coffee always tasted consistent.  I will be watching for long lines from now on, hoping to get another free coffee!"
4,"I really love this place...haha when I was pregnant I started craving afghan kebab...we went at 10pm and the place was popping! So many families and groups of people grabbing food, while we were in line, one couple told us this is the best place for kebabs and better than Bamiyan kebab and Naan and Kebab. The food was made to order, plentiful and tasty. The decor is pretty nice for a self seating/self service type establishment. 

I recommend the tandoori chicken and the beef kebab..yum!"
4,Minus one star for the service we received. Two teenagers seemed irritated that we had walked in. We were not greeted. Our bowls were good. But when your service isn't great we won't be going back.
4,"Situated on the 44th floor of the Bisha Hotel, the Kosk restaurant offers a spectacular view of the north side of the CN Tower. In fact there is a passerelle around the rooftop restaurant to over a 360 degree view of the downtown Toronto's core.

We ordered avocado with beef appetizers on a small sliced pizza bread and had a large (two shared portions) of their bisque tuna with a side order of fries.

It is best noted for it's breakfast, they are gradually being noticed for lunch and dinner. Great for group gatherings and special events. On our dinner, a couple got engaged in front of their family and friends on the restaurant's rooftop. 

The service was great. No need to ask  for water to be filled, they regurarily fill your glass up. Our  waiter was knowledge. In fact, he recommended we get the spaghetti limonaide popular with their clients  but we opted for a healthy mic. 

$$$ A reservation a must. Easy public parking $10-$15 more affordable than parking near the Scotia Bank Center."
4,Best Vietnamese sandwiches! No matter what I take its always delicious. Even the little sushi's and premade plates. Be sure to try the chicken balls at the cash. They are amazing! Unfortunately they kept bringing the prices up since they got popular and i dont go nearly as much as i used to.
4,"Benny Fierro's is an awesome experience! They have HUGE pizzas- you can order by the slice or go nuts and order a whole pizza! The whole pizza is great for parties- we have gotten it a couple times and it feeds so many people and amazes the crowd every time. The slices are great too- I love their traditional pizza or their unique flavors like the thai chicken. Overall, an awesome pizza place that any pizza lover should experience. Beware- it gets packed here on weekends."
4,"One of my favorite places to go if i want a banh mi! its super good and cheap, they offer a lot of choices, a selection of bbtea and boxed sushi"
4,"I want to start off by saying I ate this sober, so my review is completely objective. In a city filled with phenomenal pie, Benny's surprised me by holding its own. As other reviewers have stated, the slices are big. Like bigger-than-your-head big. The pizza had a nice cheese to sauce ratio (heavy on the cheese). The bottom crust was slightly thinner than I prefer, but the end crust was thick and doughy. I did find it a bit greasy, but for $5 a (gigantic) slice, what more could you ask for?

Compared to its competition, this is for sure the best pizza in South Side."
4,"My family & I often visit this restaurant. It's usually very busy in the evenings & around 'desi' dinner time. 
Although the restaurant is big, seating can be a nightmare! The few times I've visited in the day, we found seating easily. However, at night you may have to wait for a long time standing around, eyeing diners who are almost finished to 'conquer' their table after. Finding a table along with other families also 'hunting' is like a flock of birds scavenging - 1st to fly over & sit has won. Sometimes families that are almost done are nice enough to let you know ahead of time. There is no reservation system from what I've experienced, no hostess to seat you either. You walk in, order, find a table or vice versa if you're dining in. I wish they would have a reservation system or hostess at least, it'd make it less chaotic. This chaos really brings out how polite fellow diners can be or show their lack of manners i.e. glaring looks, body shuffles to move you out of path to a table, dirty tables. I don't advise going their for dinner during special Islamic holidays or Ramadan, it's war people! It can be very noisy, with large families, young children & sometimes crying babies. I've seen young kids running around, tripping & bumping their heads, crying when it's busy - the parents do nothing & the staff do not say anything. Parking can be a similar nightmare.

The cleanliness of customers versus the staff are different. The decor is nice compared to other Halal restaurants. The entrance & cash area have a nice glass water fall thing & some chandeliers. The benches & chairs are a leather look with marble like tables. The place is spacious - with the few staff that are at the front (usually 4-5), they do their best to clean the tables after customers have left their dirty trays or demolished an area with rice scattered everywhere & on the seats. When it's busy, tables don't get cleaned right away, so you might have to find a staff to clean it, once you've asked a member of your party to hold the table. Some customers, including myself, do take our empty plate & trays to the drop-off station.
The staff can be friendly sometimes & sometimes like zombies. There is Afghani music playing in the background. There is a separate Wudu/Prayer area.

To order food, line up at the cash & order off the menu. We usually order the chicken kofta kabobs with rice or the chapli kabobs. I preferred how they cut their salad when they first opened in Scarborough, I don't like the new style, it's cut very small & hard to fork. The salad is an average salad consisting of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers & onions. The meat is very flavourful & tender. Sometimes, on busy days, they run out of a specific meat by the end of the evening - so they'll say no chicken, etc. Their rice is long grain & non-sticky. Their sauces are a big hit, I love the hot sauce especially. They serve Afghani bread with a white sauce to start. I usually skip the bread as it fills you up already & I can't finish my main meal. Prices are usually in the $11 mark per main dish. I like their mango drinks & yogurt drinks. Once you pay, your receipt has the order number & they call your number once your food is ready. The portions are great, fills you up well."
4,"We had a very nice experience buying a car at Chapman Mazda. A test drive with no pressure. Stopped in again to view the car - no pressure. Asked for a phone quote as we narrowed our decision. Received quote in five minutes. And unlike the funny business of some auto dealers whose internet quotes were entirely misleading, the Chapman out the door quote later proved to be accurate to the nearest dollar. Treated very professionally by salesman Shawn, an Army veteran who did tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan (a fact we found out only after we has committed and were waiting to sign).

Only stuck with a couple of minor high margin dealer add ons we didn't really want, a $400 window tint and a $200 security etching, but well below the abusive levels of some other auto dealers. Simply said we didn't want the car alarm and paint protection. No squabbling and no ""it's already on the car"" arguments. A Mazda corporation extended warranty was also offered on signing, to which you can say yes or no, but at least it's a better option than conflicted dealer specific programs or non auto manufacturer programs sometimes offered elsewhere.

We can't comment on the merits of the service department. Noted the number of Yelpers upset by discontinuation of a ""lifetime"" $9.99 oil change when management changed. I'd be upset too. Hoping for the best.

We typically like to use buying programs or internet contacts to avoid the hassle of haggling. We undermined ourselves this time by indecision which brand/model to purchase, exposing us to some pretty abusive sales practices. While still an auto dealer, the culture at Chapman is not nearly as corrupt as we saw elsewhere."
4,"More a 4.5
This is an overall score.
We ordered in, did an xlarge pizza not knowing what we were getting ourselves into lol. Also 2 lbs of bbq wings. So the wings I wasnt a fan of. The bbq sauce was tasty but the wings were pretty dry as though they were cooked a few minutes too long. So thats where tge extra stars come off.
The pizza on the other hand.
Out of this world, best I've ever had hands down. The crust is perfectly cooked almost as though they have a wood oven. The toppings they do not skimp at all. We almost got extra cheese since most places you have to. Thank god we didnt because it was beautifully dressed. Red onions on the bottom, pepperoni, real bacon and the cheese . So much cheese I was in heaven. One slice is like 3 slices from other pizza joints. So filling and mouth watering. I am from missisauga but let me twll you I am so willing to travel for my new found love. 
Dont second guess just get it!!! *licks lips*"
4,"Originally, I wanted to celebrate my friend's birthday at Diwan, but that place closes at 6, and we wanted a later dinner. I chose this restaurant instead, since this one had good reviews, same area and was also Turkish.

Location: 3/5

It is a bit south of the Ontario Science Centre and inside a strip mall that is not the easiest to find in my opinion, since it is not on a major road.

Decor/Ambience: 4.5/5

I really like the decor and ambience here. It appeared to be fine dining without the hefty price tag. I like how it played Top 40 (Pop) Hits earlier in the evening and then it slowly transitioned to French/European music and finally Turkish/Mediterranean music later on in the night. They had a projector that features all of the MVs on to their main wall. We sat next to the window, so we were fortunate not to be distracted by the MVs too much to immerse in our own conversations.

It was less than half full when we were there. I think that was mostly due to the colder weather and the fact that there were no major celebrations happening this weekend.

Food quality: 4/5

I ordered a stove oven baked salmon, which came with a third of the plate covered in carrots carved as flowers served with salad on the side and bulgar (red wheat rice).  The fish was nicely seasoned, very moist and tender. It did not need the chilli sauce that came with it, because it was already so fresh-tasting and flavourful. The skin came off easier and there were only a few small bones. The tomatoes that topped the salmon also added bursts of flavours to the dish, too. It was well-done.

Would recommend this place for Turkish food.

My friends all had the same exact dish, the Iskenderun Kebab, which was a mix of sliced, smoked beef and veal with moist bread that has soaked in the rich flavours from the juiciness of the meat. They came with a choice of rice, bulgar, salad or lavaash, and they had some sort of yogurt on the side. Everyone of us chose bulgar as our side, since everything else since common. Lavaash was a type of flatbread as it turns out, which we did not need more of, since the starter came with them anyway.

We ordered fried calamari to be shared among the four of us and it was light and springy. Simple, with some lettuce and carrots on the side.

Turkish food here reminds me of Mediterranean food, as they also have kebabs and eggplant dips or hummus.

Service: 3.5/5

Besides location, I think the service here could have been a bit better. The waiter had an apparent accent, so we had to listen closely to what she was saying. It turned out mostly fine for us since my 3 friends ordered the exact same things, except for the birthday boy, who had also ordered tea that was to be served along with his food. The tea never came, so we asked for them to make sure not to charge us for it. In between courses, they could have remove our plates faster and changed our empty glass bottle of water more frequently, too. I like how they gave us all their own packaged wet towels to clean our hands with after the dinner. 

Value: 4/5

Thanks to Yelp, we all got 5% discount for me checking in and while I ate my entire meal, all of my friends had nearly half of their meal to take home! Wow! They had really given us such good portions of meat and one whole salmon filet for me. I guess I was just that hungry, but my friends got twice as much food than they could eat and can have the rest for tomorrow's lunch or dinner even! It was not expensive at all, so the value was there. I like how all the mains came with salad as one of two sides, so that made them a well balanced meal.

No complimentary dessert, soup, fruit or anything like that though that you would get at most East Asians restaurants though. Those are all for extra costs here, hence why I would at most give this place 4*, because it meets my standards, but nothing was exemplary."
4,Still hot but no wait times!  Highly recommend this range for scenic range. Bring ammo!
4,"THE atmosphere here is EVERYTHING. 

Kost is located on the 44th floor of the Bisha Hotel. I came here for brunch on a Sunday 1pm with a very last minute reservation. We got an awesome seat surrounded by windows, colourful artwork, and all around a bright & hip vibe. I loved how you can access the outside so you could go out to take pictures even with the colder weather! No swimming in the pool unless you're a hotel guest though.

I got the $16 eggs benedict with smoked trout & asked for a salad substitution instead of the English muffin. It was a pretty standard dish, nothing outstanding. My friend got the Kost burger and that looked massive and juicy! I also had my eye on the coconut pancakes which a nearby table got, it looked huge and smelled heavenly as well."
4,"Avocado smash is done well at this restaurant up-top the 44th floor.

The restaurant has a cool vibe and in the summer brunch on the patio is stunning!!"
4,"I've been here 3 times now.  The first 2 times were off of deals like Groupon & Living Social & the last time I just went & paid full price.

It's right next to my house & I have a baby so it's convenient & easy for me to go to and not be gone from home for very long.  If it didn't have the convenience factor I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here, however it is a good option if you live close.  I've always been offered water & the ipad magazines and my blowouts have been decent to good.  I would definitely do another blowout here, however probalby not makeup.  I've had makeup done twice now and wasn't a fan either time.  The last time was for a major holiday party & I where my eyeshadow looked pretty, they didn't put on any eyeliner & after a few people told me it didn't look like I have much makeup on I finally added eyeliner & eyeshaow.

The time my hair looked the best (this last time for the holiday party), I spent an extra $10 to add on the Hot Tools add-on which was well worth it because after the blowup they'll curl your hair with a curling iron and it did look great. I'd overall give it a 3-4 stars.  I will go back again if I have a wedding or somewhere to go as an excuse to get a blow out & hopefully one of these days they'll wow me with something amazing!"
4,"There aren't many Korean restaurants in Pittsburgh, but this is where most of the Koreans in Pittsburgh I know go to get Korean food. The food is a little bit pricy but less expensive than Green Pepper and more authentic than Oiishi Bento. Although I'm not Korean so I can't really say what's authentic or not, it's always full of Koreans and all my international Korean friends like it. My favorite is the seafood pancake and bibimpap. Love the scorched rice at the bottom.

I've been to the Karaoke rooms once. You can rent out a private room, but it gets pricey. They have a range of both Korean and American songs, mostly mainstream music."
4,"Awesome spot!  I ended up getting a mens scalp wash and massage. The girls were all very nice and had a really laid back and fun atmosphere.
 It was very inviting for me (even as a guy).    I'll defiantly send my wife here to get ready when we have somewhere to be so I don't have to wait at home for her to ""be ready"" hahaha."
4,"This place rocks ! I always feel so fresh & pretty when I walk out the door, like I'm ready for anything .  The shampoo and conditioner are luxurious and smell amazing 
The staff are very sweet and most of the time will ask if you'd like a beverage, a wash and go Blow is only $35 bucks add a hot tool like a curling iron and its $10 extra they usually tell you so you're not surprised 

The only bad experience I had was when I had my makeup done and it was not worth the $ my eye make up was not what I asked for way to dark for daytime and my eyelashes were coming loose 

So I'll stick to my blow outs and keep the makeup applications at the Mac store"
4,Great pizza so much cheese can't ask for any thing more. Got the meat lovers very filling great little hidden gem in Durham recommend next time you decide to order a pizza think of pizza pinos first you won't regret it.
4,"Came here for brunch so I'm only reviewing that. 

I made a reso for myself and bf a couple of weeks ago- it's a hot spot for brunch and Instagram hot girls so make a reso several weeks in advance to get the time you want. The view is pretty great though. 

We got here couple minutes late and they sat us outside no problem. We both ordered the ahi tuna sandwich at $22 a pop. Honestly, I thought it was worth $22. For reference, their benny is $16 and the ahi tuna sandwich came with two pieces of tuna that were lightly-seared and perfect. The slaw on top and the dressing was great too. Salad was over-dressed and the fries were a little cold. 

The service wasn't specular for what seems like such a high-end restaurant. We waited a while to get our water, for the ketchup that we asked for to come out, and for them to clear our table and bring us the bill. It wasn't terrible, but just not as smooth. 

I'd be curious to check out the dinner service but nothing on the menu really jumps out at me."
4,Great for a quick lunch. $4.00 including tax for a huge slice of plain is hard to beat. They are usually not super busy during the day. They have slices precooked waiting for you to get in and out. There is a parking lot right beside them so it's real convenient.
4,Great pizza! Fully loaded with cheese but not grease at all. Also the crust is very tasty. The atendente was sympathetic but I felt he could had checked on us during the meal. But overall we had a great meal!
4,"This is my go to place for Pho and Curry.  Whether it's a cold winter day or I'm sick as a dog with the flu, I can always count on this place making pho that will hit the spot.  

I usually order the Large Rare Beef Pho.  Broth is flavorful and light.  A good portion of meat and noodles in every bowl they make.  Comes with bean sprouts, basil and lime on the side.  They will usually ask if you want your bean sprouts raw or cooked.  Sometimes they may not have bean sprouts if you go early, before 12 pm since that's when they usually get their delivery.

Other things I recommend, Lemon Grass Chicken, Laksa, Beef Brisket Curry with Roti, Spring Rolls and Pineapple Fried Rice.

Service is relatively quick, not a big restaurant as maximum capacity is about 50 so I don't recommend groups of more than 4."
4,"Came in here for a quick lunch and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the end product. Not only was my Maki set (A) prepared quick, but the food definitely tasted fresh. Prices are not dirt cheap but certainly good for the end product. The interior deco is only meh but it's clean and got an open feel to it. 

Staff was friendly, although I didn't really interact with them too much since I was busy on my headphones and the place was pretty empty when I was there. 

Overall a much more solid experience than I expected (the other 2 times I've tried sushi out of Toronto didn't turn out that great) and definitely recommend it as part of a pre or post movie meal!"
4,"This was an awesome little find for us! We had just spent a few hours doing some shopping and we were starving! So we yelped and this place came up, we decided to try it out as it was close to where we were. We were seated right away as it was fairly early around 530pm.  We chose to not go with the all you can eat menu for $25/person as us 3 girls would never really eat that much. We ordered a few things to share...miso soup..salad...calamari...gyoza...dynamite roll...spicy salmon..and dragon roll.  The food came out really fast and hot! Everything was really good besides the miso soup...that was extrely salty. We tried to return it but were told that it came from a batch and all would taste the same. My only complaint is that we were still charged for the soup that we didn't drink...but we were not going to argue as our food was soo yummy.  We ended up paying about $45 all in which is half of all you can eat. 

Overall I would recommend this place, it definitely hit the spot for us."
4,We've been to Poki Point twice and have enjoyed it :) Nice addition to Gilbert - quick and the staff is friendly. The fish is fresh as well as the veggie choices. Would like to see the scoops of fish a little bigger for the cost - but over all we have enjoyed the food.
4,"I stopped by when i had business meeting at downtown Phoenix, i wanted to try some shawarma, I thought the place will be a little nicer but for the price you pay it reasonable, i will recommend it for togo order more than dine in. The Jalapeño hommos was little runny but very tasty.
I might try it again when i am close by."
4,"One of the top 5 pizza joints in Pittsburgh. Grab a giant, thin, crispy slice of NY style pizza for $4-$5, sit in the window and do some first rate people watching."
4,"Love love love the food, always amazing and surprising! The atmosphere isn't very inviting though, but this didn't matter though to stop me from coming back, but the one thing that has turned me off of coming back since happening is that once I called to place an order for my boyfriend to pick up and the person taking the order made me super uncomfortable with the way he told me that he knows who I am and knows my first and last name...I was SO uncomfortable and made this pretty clear, then he told me he could see it on the call display (this prompted me to call my service provider and have them change the name that shows when I call others). I haven't called or been back since."
4,"Tasty food, good service. Reliable place! Had 2 meals here. Seems the pancakes are top notch and was impressed by bacon and Canadian bacon. Coffee are huge"
4,"Cool little place with a great concept! It was a fun girlfriend experience! I don't benefit from this on a weekly basis, but woman like my friend who has long, thick hair love it!!! When you do the monthly deal it is well worth it! I personally would do it for special occasion only. Very chic atmosphere and they serve nice goodies too!"
4,"So I come here because I work nearby. But out of all the places, it is consistently good and fast. The owner is very nice and friendly. Always willing to deliver food to the table. He's great about take out too. It's got a variety of foods interestingly enough. He has asian rice bowls, gyros/ Mediterranean and burgers with French fries. So you can't get bored. Pretty decent appetizer menu of edamame, gyros, dolmas, falafels and Greek fries. It's a solid dependable choice especially for the price."
4,"Completely agree the staff is huffy and seemingly unhappy with their lives and life choices.  lol, that's their problem.

Decor and ambiance was decent, tables a little too cramped - I was literally bumping elbows with the awkward first date at the next table.  Surprisingly busy for a Monday evening, but that's a good sign no?

Anyways, the food was much better than I had expected.  Usually for edible AYCE sushi one must venture to the east end, but I would say this tops the declining Aji Sai (Bayview) and Sushi on 7 for my AYCE sushi needs. 

Sashimi was fresh and cut in generous pieces, rolls that advertised spicy actually were.  The important part was quality of fish, and they had it.

Overall a meal that exceeded my expectations.  Never would've thought Sauga could provide decent AYCE."
4,"If you're absolutely craving a pizza and you were having a bad day, then Pizza Pino is probably where you want to go. 

This is a nice family owned restaurant and I remember the first time that I went there I didn't think it was going to be very good. The actual setting is outdated but that is on the outside. When you actually order the service itself is good, though a bit slow at times, and the pizza is the star of the show. I generally go with the classic, such as a pepperoni mushroom bacon, but whatever you do do not ask for extra cheese! When you get your pizza you will understand why - They put on a lot of cheese and that is just how it is.

In terms of flavour it taste just like a typical fast food pizza, maybe a tad better. It's nothing gourmet which is not a bad thing - sometimes you just need a downright dirty pizza and if that's the case this is a great option for you. Just be prepared to throw that 'diet' out the window."
4,"Mmh! Delicious AYCE sushi in Mississauga. I know - what a paradox! This is where I would go if I wanted AYCE and didn't want to trek all the way to Scarborough to my favourite AYCE (Ten-Ichi!). 

Pros:
- delicious hot foods; and I mean delicious! For AYCE quality, it's really yummy! 
- presentation is great regardless of the fact that it's AYCE
- overall, food quality is quite good and well-made
- good decor: the environment, though small, is clean and nice

Cons:
- ditto all past reviews: service is BAD!! They rush you, they're rude, they're unfriendly... even for Chinese (yes, it's a Chinese-owned sushi place, surprise, surprise) service, this is bad
- ALWAYS PACKED - they don't take reservations for anything under 4 people (I believe) and it's hard to get seats unless you come early (even on weeknights)

Overall, if you can manage with poor service, the food and environment are a plus in my books, and I don't go out to eat in order to get great service; I go out to eat to eat great food and Prince Sushi fits in there quite snugly."
4,Very nice people. We been bringing our Kali Girl here since she was 10 weeks old. She was also spade here. We're here today for 2 year vaccinations and a nail trim.
4,"Food was great. I wanted to try this place before it became the next big Toronto rooftop lounge & restaurant. The rooftop terrace with pool is gorgeous and the view of Toronto is great. Ambiance is 10/10 and service is very attentive. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the portions are a bit too small for the price. Be prepared for a pretty high bill if you came hungry. I knew this going in so it was exactly what I expected. For 2 people, you'll definitely need to order 2-3 full-size dishes or 3-5 half-size dishes.  The truffle fries, quinoa salad and prawns were amazing, definitely recommend trying those."
4,I've ate pizza here a few time my favorite one I ordered was a spicy chicken pizza with banana peppers and chicken and a few other things on it. The cheese on the pizza was phenomenal I also love that the crust is thin. The slices are huge you can share a slice with your friend since they are so big and it is super cheap especially after a night out drinking it's definitely the place to go for some munchies. Not only do they have good pizza they have BYOB and nothing is better than that. The service is also amazing my favorite pizza chef is Nick M he's the best!
4,"Awesome gem in Brookline. If you like Lebanese food, this is a great market to swing by for fresh (still warm!) pitas, and maybe grab a spinach & feta pie to heat up later for an easy dinner.  The baba ganouj and hummus are fabulous. 

Pitaland stocks authentic ingredients at reasonable prices. I've also heard good things about using Pitaland for catering events such as grad parties, etc."
4,"Great go-to place for tasty pizza on the Southside, especially where pizza places tend to come and go. (Benny, Please don't go!)  I've lunched at Benny's a few weekdays. The service is pretty good, friendly and fast, even with a lunch crowd. The decor is fine, lots of wood, pretty standard and there is a reasonable amount of seating. I  believe they are open pretty late for the bar-hoppers appitites.

The super-sized pizza slices provide a nice portion size for only around $5/slice. Fun to eat and I don't think I'll get over the novelty of it. I would go more often, but I try not to eat too much processed flour."
4,"If I had to review a sushi place last year, the company would go out of business ( actually since I'm not elite, no one would listen to me). What I mean to say is I hated sushi. Then I came to this place. Wow.  Probably the freshest tasting sushi and I've been to a few places now. 
The service is great and very friendly. Sometimes if you order too much, they forget some of the stuff, but its all-you-can-eat so just order it again. And again. And again. Stuff some in your knapsack, then order again. I'm kidding, don't do that.
Definitely worth a check out!"
4,"Great service, but busy, busy, busy if you come here at peak times.  We are usually at this Starbucks on weekend mornings and it's not bad, but forget about it if you're here on a weekday morning on your way to work.  Even with the mobile app, I avoid this location because the parking lot is a nightmare.  Knowing this, do come here at any other time or if you're not in a rush to get your caffeine fix."
4,"This is our go to place for pho mainly because it's so close to where we live.
This place can get packed especially during the dinner rush and Sunday afternoons so try to go around these hours if you want to avoid crowds. That being said service is usually pretty prompt. 
Food is normally what you would expect of any pho place, I enjoy the vermicelli mainly because they always have good spring rolls, my wife likes the laksa noodles.
Portions are good enough to fill you up.
So if you're looking for someplace quick with decent vietnamese food this is the place to go"
4,"When I'm craving Afghani food, this is my place to go. I find the portions and price the same as the more popular Bamiyan Kabob, but the flavours and taste at Kandahar are far superior.

I always order the Kandahar Kofta Kabob platter that comes with filet mignon and ground beef skewered and grilled. The platter comes with salad, rice and naan.

This platter is more food than an average person can eat and I always bring home leftovers. There is so much fragrant rice on the platter that is spills over onto the tray. The salad is a bit plain but tastes great with the tangy white sauce. The hot sauce that they serve isn't too hot but tastes very good. The naan is crispy and tasty and doesn't taste like a brick like the ones at Bamiyan. The best part are the meats which always come out juicy, so flavourful and extremely tender."
4,"What a great place...chicken shawarma pita was  a little spicy and outstanding. Tzatziki was tasty. Side Greek salad delicious. Even the homemade ice tea was a treat. 

What are you waiting for....GO!"
4,"The decor was modern and clean as well as nicely spaced affording guess to enjoy their visit.  No cramp tables on top of tables.

They do offer your typical sushi menu items as well as all you can each sushi and cooked items.  In fact their all you can eat selections is pretty much what you can order from their regular menu.  This is way better than most all you can eat as the selections are limited.

Service was good, very nice staff that works together to serve your drinks and meal.  There were 8 of us in the party so there was enough room for us and other patrons without an issue as they got packed really fast.  Even though they were packed and had every table occupied they still were able to give is the attentive service.

The sushi was good, not extraordinary but good for a visitor with colleagues after work.  We all had all you can eat sushi as well as other cooked items.  The hand rolls were served quickly keeping the seaweed nice and crispy as it just wouldn't taste the same once it gets soggy.

This is a good place to visit especially if you are hungry for some sushi and there is plenty of parking.  Just come early to avoid the crowd as it does get busy.  Great for date night since movie theater is right across from the restaurant."
4,"Don't expect to be able to order anything else except pizza here.  Pizza by the slice that is.  As a newcomer, I asked if they have slices of pizza.  Thank goodness no one else was around to hear such a ridiculous question. Ridiculous, because they only had slices.

Another thing not to expect is meeting Benny Fierro.  Benny Fierro does not exist.  However, there is a Benny_____ and he learned the craft of making pizzas while working for nearly 2 decades in Brooklyn under the direction of Italian chefs.

Unknown circumstances led him out of the area and he settled in a small town situated on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, where he continued making his signature 28"" pizza pies. These signature pies are now served at various Benny's locations.  Each Benny's adds their own second name or description to their individual site to help ensure the anonymity of the real Benny.

There are 17 locations , the majority found in Virginia, several in North Carolina, and one lone location In Pittsburgh, Pa.

Plain slice was $4.00.  Quite reasonable for the size and quality.  
Cooler filled with soda and various other beverages.  No beer is sold but you can BYOB."
4,"Great food
Great warmth by the host/owner- Arzu
Good menu choices
Good pricing
Quick and courteous service
Overall a great experience"
4,"We adopted a bunny from N. Las Vegas Firefighters after they found it hanging out by their firehouse. I brought the bunny hear since they had late hours and I wanted to get him/her checked out before bringing him/her home to my little girl. I was able to secure an appointment that day and brought the bunny in right after work. This location sits across of Burger King on Cheyenne and Rainbow, behind a smog check place. It's pretty small. They checked us in and got as much details as possible. We were seen within 10 mins of check in. Dr. Eisenmann came in and was very friendly and thorough. She gave me the low down of bunny's and gave me some tips on how to care for it. She took some vitals, checked for a chip and diagnosed a healthy domesticated male bunny. She was careful with him and nurturing, like he was hers. She really is sweet with him and it made me feel good because I've heard some horror stories. The fees were not outrageous but so you know, any animal that is not a dog or cat is labeled ""EXOTIC""."
4,"I want sure what to think from the outside of this place, and when I stepped inside it didn't help me feel any better. 
I looked it up on Yelp, and decided I'd give it a shot. 

I was pleasantly surprised! It's a family owned restaurant, and the lady up front who took my order was very helpful, and helped me decide what to order. 
If you come in you will be surprised at the menu because it has BOTH Greek & Asian on the menu. 

I ordered a salad, and chicken pita. The salad alone was so good! It has a nice light vinegar dressing. It was tasty. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. I would go back if I was in the area."
4,"Thank you Bill Lohmeyer at Chapman Mazda for helping me get my new Mazda cx-5. Both online and in person, Bill was very helpful and informative. My husband and I both appreciated how easy the car buying process at Chapman was. Huy Dao in finance was also great to work with. Thanks Bill for helping me get my new CX-5 at a price that I was happy and comfortable with!"
4,"Great authentic Korean food that all my Korean friends swear by.  The menu is broken into 3 sections:Korean, Japanese, and Chinese cooked in Korean fashion. The Korean short ribs are my favorite, yum yum yum.
Place is pretty small and very popular so be prepared to wait. It is a bit more expensive than nearby asian places (we generally average $15-20/person w/o getting drinks) but definitely worth it"
4,"This is restaurant is undoubtedly understaffed. There were two employees at the front in charge of hosting, waiting, and busing all of the tables as well as managing phone orders. It was obvious they were stressed and continuously in a rush. Having one more employee working the front would make dining here flow significantly smoother. Based on the prices of the entrees, it seems management should be able to afford another server.

The prices for the Korean entrees are high. The menu items under Korean BBQ averaged about $30 per entree. In order to use the stoves at the table you need to order at least two of such entrees. Also, the BBQ portions are limited. In New York, I've seen Korean BBQ buffets for $30 per person, but never this much for just one portion of Bulgogi or Spare Ribs. The Korean non-BBQ dishes average over $20 per entree.

The Japanese and Korean-Chinese dishes were priced com the range of about $7 - $20 with different prices during lunch or dinner for certain items.

I opted for the Ban Jai (steak and shrimp). My only complaint was that the steak was well done; otherwise, the shrimp and mushrooms were good. The Nam Jai is a bento box which also came with fried dumplings, fried rice, crab sticks, kimchi, and cucumber & carrot salad. I thought all of the sides except the crabmeat were very good.

I think Korea Garden has some of the best Asian good on Oakland. I would certainly return for a different bento box!

Oh, and paper towels are located outside the restrooms."
4,One of the best sushi places in Mississauga.
4,"Its a nice place to shoot, well regulated n safe. Nice helpful staff. I only wish it has a section wit steel hanging plates to shoot like Angeles crest shooting range in cali. Almost the same type o rules n range layout. I love hearing fullauto shooting next to me. Arizona gotta love it!! Prices for admission is fair bout $7 bucks a person, n u bring ur own ammo n u can buy targets or ur own (paper targets). Good place for practicing skills in close or distance shooting. N if ur hungry there is also a hotdog stand by the entrance. Nice clean facility."
4,"Hands down the best pizza I've have had since moving to Ontario.

In western Canada thick crust pizza is the norm... I had been searching for a suitable replacement since moving....  Thrilled to say I found it!

Great crust, not greasy, tons of quality toppings and lots of cheese!!!

One recommendation... Order to go.   This place is nothing to look at and quite dated inside - the pizza totally impresses... The dining room doesn't.   This was the only thing stopping me from a solid five stars."
4,"Pros: food was great, portions were big, staff was very nice, coffee was hot and plentiful :-) I had the banana pancakes with bacon and eggs. My husband had the apple cinnamon pancakes with bacon and eggs. Both dishes were delicious. We didn't have to wait long for our food either. We both didn't care for the tropical syrup. 

Cons: parking.... this was a big one for me. The lot is really small. It is difficult to get in and out of the lot when the restaurant is busy. This might actually prevent me from returning often.  

Definitely a place to go but maybe only during less crowded hours."
4,"Although I wanted to have brunch here, we were recommended by a local to check it out for a drink. We weren't disappointed. The rooftop restaurant and bar is located inside the Bisha hotel and has amazing views. This is probably my second favorite place for rooftop views after the Thompson rooftop. The wait for drinks on a weekend night was a little longer than expected but I can see why. There's an outdoor pool with a good amount of seating outdoor. Definitely worth checking out."
4,"Here I am again, one of the hippest brunch spots in Toronto and need to admit it doesn't disappoints.
Their eggs bennies with salmon are really good but this time I went for the avocado toast with goat cheese spread and cherry tomatoes with a side of potatoes and it was impressively good!!!
Had to make a reservation 2 weeks in advance since it was thanksgiving Sunday and I knew it was gonna be packed.
Good place to come for a fancy brunch and nice views. 
But need to say that it's not the best brunch you will find in toronto"
4,"I had a great experience with Bill Lohmeyer. He was very transparent from the beginning, which I appreciated. Bill took the time to make sure we could work out a deal that fit my price range. Everyone was very professional and welcoming. I highly recommend seeing Bill!"
4,"I stopped in to Benny's for the first time for lunch and got a slice of the Buffalo Chicken pizza. The slice was MASSIVE. It's a little thicker than your typical NY slice, but it's one of the better options for pizza on East Carson. I live a block away from Benny's, so I will definitely be back!"
4,"Excellent beef pho, service was fast."
4,"One of the best all you can eat sushi in g.t.a!  Always fresh and always properly made, unlike other all you can eat restaurants.  They even have soft shell crab on the menu!"
4,"Holy ginormous slices of pizza, Batman!  Their slices are humongous and delicious!  One slice fit on 2 plates and was bigger than my trusty sidekick's head!  They're a thinner crispier crust which I enjoyed.  They're not cheap slices ($4 for plain and $5 for pepperoni) but considering they're so huge and each slice can probably feed you 3x I'd say it was worth it.  They also sell ranch or garlic butter dipping sauces (I think 50 cents for either)- we tried the garlic butter - it was ok - probably unnecessary.  Best part? BYOB! Yay!"
4,"The staff was pleasant. The service was fast and the food was hot and freshly made.

The place was neat and clean. 

It's kind of like formal dining. The prices aren't cheap."
4,"Kost is located inside the Bisha hotel. Parking is available nearby or on the street. 

We went there for lunch this past long weekend. We went there thinking they would have their brunch (as advertised on their social media) but were a bit disappointed to learn that it was only lunch. 

I ordered the tuna steak sandwich with a side of salad. It was a pretty good portion and the dressing on the sandwich was really good! My friend got the octopus and she loved it. The place was gorgeous - nice and open concept! 

Wish the weather had been less cloudy - the view is supposed to be gorgeous. Overall it's a bit pricey for lunch/dinner but brunch seems like a good option (under $20). 

Also a good spot to hang out with a couple of friends at the bar! It seems like a great spot to hang out in the evening/night time!"
4,"Pino's, a fan I am!

If you are looking for a deep dish style pizza loaded with ingredients and a ton of cheese ( I am not shi**ing you) they must use a pound of cheese on the pies they put out !
If you are looking for a real heart stopper, get the panzarotti!
(A large pizza loaded folded in half)
OMG its deep dish pizza heaven!!!!

If you havent had a deep dish you liked in the past, give this place a try....you'll be a fan."
4,"very friendly and caring staff.  plus once you're in their system, you get email updates and reminders.  better than my doctor."
4,"I only give this place 4 stars because my favorite doctor is no longer here. We've been clients for 15+ years. We usually drive to see her for the big stuff but for emergencies and routine nail trims we stay close to home. Staff is friendly, facilities are clean and it looks like they just remodeled again."
4,"The food here is amazing and comes in huge portions. I personally don't enjoy the pita and salad (especially the salad) that comes with the meal so I ask for extra rice as a replacement instead. One meal is good enough for two people. Definitely ask for extra sauce, tastes better with it. This place is kind of food court style where you order your food, get it and sit down and eat. There are no servers so you don't have to tip if you don't want to. All in all, great place for kabobs and rice! Definitely recommend - extremely affordable!"
4,"Greka pita is the kind of hole in the wall place that I love to eat at.  Don't come here if you are looking for fancy decor or gourmet recreations of Mediterranean food. Come here if you want good tasty healthy food for a decent price.  Gyro was perfection with lightly toasted pita, meat yummy, the sauce creamy, veggies fresh.  What more to ask for when you want a cheap, healthy lunch?"
4,"I came here for brunch on a Saturday. The ambience was amazing, the food was good and the service was out of this world! The servers were very polite and took care of us well. 

I ordered the Kost Burger which did not disappoint. The drinks are a little pricey but the view makes up for it."
4,"Good food , reasonable price ! 
Portions are big and Come with Side . 
I love the freshly baked Bread . 
We tried 3 different types of Kabab and All was delicious."
4,"One of my all time favourite restaurants in the city. Everyone that I've taken here loves it as well. The restaurant has a nice ambiance. Food is amazing and portion sizes are huge. Never had a bad meal here. 

We usually order the A La Turka for 2. Its big enough for 4. All the meats are made juicy and tender. Love the lavash the comes with it. The mixed appetizer is a must! Can't go wrong with any of the dips. The chicken pide was delicious as well. 

Best restaurant for Turkish food!"
4,"This new place has potential but not there yet. I tried ""manti' dish (meat dumplings in yogurt sauce). It was bad. The yogurt sauce was very very sour like it turned bad. It tasted like they reheated the dish with the sauce and all. Which is a big no no. 
Others got 'beyti' ( ground beef skewer wrapped in lavash bread) and lamb shish kabob. Lamb shish was very good. Beyti was also pretty good.  Desserts, we got keskul, sutlac and Kazandibi. They were all divine. Decor is nice and it's large and clean. Fast and friendly service. I would check it out again to see if their manti has improved."
4,"Pretty good quality sushi for AYCE. Lots of variety and food is pushed out of the kitchen/bar pretty quickly. However, I don't think that any of the staff would win any customer service trophies anytime soon. They are on the most part unfriendly, abrupt and will ask you directly if you plan on tipping them if they don't immediately see any extra cash on the table. Service aside though, I'm a fan of their food."
4,Great steak house. Cesar salad is made right in front of u to perfection. Steak is always cooked to perfection and service is amazing. Next time you go make sure to try a steak and sired scallops and ribs. You will be in heaven.
4,"They've experienced a massive improvement since they opened. Prices are still high but now actually worth it. They've changed my impression and I'd strongly consider this place when I want Chinese food and don't want to venture to the east end.

We ordered a healthy ""grains and veggies"" congee. It was loaded with ingredients and didn't taste like MSG. Sizzling pan beef and mushroom was very good and large portion. Steamed fish was cooked right! Sambal beef fried noodles was very delicious and tasted similar to Malaysian style. 

This is not another ""Congee"" place. It's a well decorated Chinese restaurant that serves many standard dishes, and some unique dishes, at decent quality. The place gets packed fast."
4,"Rooftop alert! Yes there's a cozy rooftop with a bar where you can order food, drinks, and the breeze. It's a chill place with an industrial feel. Walk to the counter to order, get your number, and find a table. Get the sauces! They are amazingly flavorful and really what makes the food shine. Roja and chimi-churri are great. Verde is good and spicy. 

I ordered the fresco bowl: rice quinoa mix topped with delicious pickled red onions, avocado, pulled chicken, black beans, queso fresco (simple white cheese crumbles) for about $9. In less than 10 minutes we were eating!

There was a Dos Equis pint special for $3 but I was charged full price at $5. You can tell the MOST about a biz by the way they handle issues. The workers apologized and offered a $5 gift card. I accepted this even but believe they would've refunded me the $2 if I asked. Smart on their part since I have to return to use it."
4,Exceeded my expectations. Rooms were well kept and clean.  Very spacious. Great if you have kids.
4,"I really like the vibe of their salon and the decor of it as well.  I want to buy artwork in there every time I go.  

I am sad they no longer carry the brand of dry shampoo spray I like so much, but they have a new product line that I haven't tried yet.

I called at the last minute and I was able to get in with James and he really did a wonderful job of listening to me and of executing my cut and style.  I appreciated how calm he was and I will definitely try to get in with him again."
4,"Ok so here is the deal, I will try almost any place that has a loyalty program and that sends me coupons (Yes, Restauranteurs that is an open invitation to send me coupons). That being said it is standard diner food, with several creative additions (Red Velvet Pancake Puppies). The place is clean and quiet. So if you are not looking for anything fancy, stop by give it a try. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
4,"Overall, my experience here has been great! The staff has always greeted me upon entering, their menu ordering is fairly simple to use, and I've enjoyed everything I've gotten there! 

My only complaint (besides the horrible parking which isn't their fault!) is that the menu is not kid friendly! I have a toddler and there's really nothing available on their menu that works for a typical toddler palate. I'm not sure if I'm missing something here, but if I am, it's not well advertised. Because of this, we rarely go now unless it's sans toddler. If they had kid friendly options, we'd be there a lot more! Please consider adding this to your menu or advertising it better!"
4,"I'll give the food a 4 star. My food was nice and warm, nothing wow but it's better than my cooking. There is something that makes me want to go back to certain places and it is nice people. I've been at this location a couple of times and I always get good service. Today, my family and I went for dinner and we had this amazing server named Joe. He was so nice and helpful. We hope to see him next time. His customer service skills get a 5 star."
4,This place is a hidden gem. Good food. Great salsa bar with a range of hotness and escabeche. Delicious big burritos. Staff is friendly. Ricardo's has become one of my favorite places.
4,"As a Bay Area transplant, it was nice to see a familiar face like Bambu in the boba-deficient land that is Arizona!

I'm not a huge fan of the Che drinks (I prefer my toppings to take up less than 50% of my drink) so my go-to is usually the black milk tea or the jasmine green milk tea. My favorite part of Bambu is that they have crystal boba, which is a crunchier seaweed-based alternative to traditional tapioca-based boba :) 

Quality is comparable to my experiences at the Sunnyvale and San Jose CA locations, but this place is SUUUUUPER heavy handed on the ice! The past 3 times I've gone and asked for less ice, they've still loaded my drink up with what feels like a default amount. I get the heat is RIDIC outside but still...

Overall, I have come back repeatedly and would return for their reliable drink quality!"
4,"Ahhhhh, I love this so much! When I was younger, my mom would make homemade ""Che"" (Vietnamese sweet dessert) all the time, but now she's too tired and busy to make any. Not homemade like my mom's, but still delicious. This totally hits the spot after eating lunch/dinner. Very refreshing and light. 

I got the #6 and it was perfect on sweetness level, and had different factors of taste and texture. From jackfruits, longan, and coconut flesh, to red tapioca, pandan jelly, and more. All these complement each other and was not too sweet or overbearing. The service was great. 

I hope one day there'll be one in Tucson! But I'll for sure always stop by Bambu when I'm in the area!"
4,"I really enjoyed my visit to honeygrow. I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon cause I was craving a hearty and healthy salad and I got it! I liked the way you went in and ordered off of a touch screen. It was easy to navigate the menu and customize the salad if you needed. Everyone was friendly and I definitely want to go back and try their bowls and other menu items. 

Also, I accidentally made the mistake and ordered a second kind of cheese on my salad. The employees asked me if I wanted both and gave me double of the same cheese since I paid extra. I thought it was a nice touch!"
4,"Great place close to the strip. Very clean grounds. Very nice staff. The pool area is clean and playful with a fun vibe. I dig the place for what it is. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have to reserve 5 stars for places like The Cosmopolitan. :-)

Stay here. You'll be happy you did."
4,"I would probably rank this as a 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4.

My family and I stayed here for about a week. Tahiti is not on the Strip, so if you want to go and not deal with the madness of driving, you should take their shuttles to and from. The shuttles aren't bad - the drivers are friendly and rather punctual, but you do have to plan your days around the shuttle schedules.

The rooms themselves were not bad. We had two rooms connected to each other, so it was indeed very spacious. The one bedroom had a decent kitchen. However, the one bedroom bathroom did not have an air vent, which was weird.

The WIFI is sometimes spotty, but at least it was free in the room (AT&T).

The lounge area is pretty spacious but you have to pay in order to play foosball or pool, which was a bit of a bummer.

The location is okay. It's next to a small plaza, including a Denny's and a Walgreens. However there are panhandlers in the area so be careful."
4,"Mondays are for 75cent char grilled wings. The stuffed avocado was THEEEE best. They have an array of sauces for your liking. The staff was friendly. They have a bluzzy brunch on Sunday,  definitely going to have to try that out."
4,"CQ is always a reliable pick for a satisfying meal. This location is no different. Big portions, good prices, and above average food.

Surprisingly, I rarely get congee at Congee Queen, since their other Chinese dishes are so vast and I always crave them. The best congee if I do feel like congee would be the seafood special. Mix in a little of their special chili oil (which comes with a spicy meat texture paste mmm) and its heavenly.

Service here is a bit slower than their other branches but not too bad.

Recommendations: the ""yinyang"" fried rice dish topped with half cream sauces shrimps and half tomato sauced pork, the scrambled egg and beef/shrimp fried rice noodles, kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, rice rolls wrapped with youtiao and dried pork floss, and turnip patties are always a must.

Reliable consistent meals for a quick lunch or dinner. Warning. There will be line ups if you go during dinner time so try making resos."
4,"Very surprise to see such a clean and neat place for BBQ pork, duck etc.  
Food - 4.5 starts
Service - 5 starts"
4,"UPDATE
Justin from Spencer's reached out to me via my Yelp post.  He asked me to call him and showed empathy for my situation and sincerely offered to assist through their in house repair.   Justin turned a bad experience into a positive one as it relates to Spencer's.  My refrigerator final was repaired today about three weeks after I first reported it to Refridgidaire.  I still think stores need to think long and hard about the brands they sell and how they stand or don't stand behind their products. Refridgidaire does not stand behind their products. 

Original post 
Bought a $2500 Fridgidaire which went out three weeks ago.  Trying to deal with the company for repair was told they have no one in the area to service the refrigerator and that they would have to find someone.  It has been nightmare and three weeks later and no repair.  Notified Spencer's through the website that they sold me an expensive appliance with no local repair support and received no reply  from Spencer's. Will not be back.  Horrible"
4,"Hung out here at the bar for a few hours to watch a World Cup match and they couldn't have been nicer about it. The smoked salmon toast is good and it comes with a massive amount of smoked salmon. Like more than you can deal with, but you'll still finish it. I wish I had gotten their Bloody Mary special. It's $36 but damn if it doesn't look good with grilled cheese and bacon and lobster."
4,"I've been looking for a great all-you-can-eat sushi place for years, and I think I finally found it.  Only $11.99 for the lunch menu, it's definitely on the cheap end.  And, you get a lot of variety offered of maki and sashimi (and other menu items).  The dinner all you can eat menu basically has the whole menu on it.  The sushi was fresh and well made.  And delicious green tea ice cream at the end!

I would definitely recommend this place."
4,"This place is great!  I came here on a Thursday to get a mani pedi before my wedding and they were able to see me right away and they did a great job.   The pricing was a little high but the place is very clean so I didn't mind paying a little bit more  Also the aestheticians were very friendly!  This place also has a ton of different colors and was able to recreate the picture that I had shown them indicating the look I was going for.  They also offered water which I declined and opted for champagne instead :).

I had a bad experience on my second visit however.  The person helping was very rushed and didn't ask me what I thought about them.  At the end of it all my nails looks thick and very unnatural. 

They were able to able to redeem themselves however on my third visit.  The aesthetician immediately noticed that the nails were not done correctly and was able to fix them.  He was very nice ensuring that i liked everything he did along the way.

As this place is so close to my place I will gladly continue to come back here. I am also looking forward to trying the other services they offer such as facials and waxing.  I believe they also have a loyalty program that I will be looking into on my next visit."
4,"I chose this salon based on other yelp reviews (thank you). I called the salon and explained that I needed a haircut and that I have super short hair (I'm a female). The receptionist said they had a number of stylists that work with short hair and she paired me up with James. 

I was nervous going to my appointment but James was great. I showed him photos of what my hair looks like (normally) right after it is cut and he was patient and talked through it. He was conservative and stopped a few times to ask if it was going how I wanted it to. I couldn't have asked for a better first-time experience. And he did a phenomenal job. I will definitely be visiting James for my future haircuts.

Prices are competitive to other salons."
4,"So many options and delicious flavours to choose from.  I was quite impressed even if service might have been a little slow that day. 

Staff were very accommodating to my friends allergies so that was very much appreciated.  We also had arrived later and they were still good to serve us.  

So many options I didn't have a chance to try them all but I definitely intend to come back to this place because it is comparably better than most."
4,Great place to stay in Vegas but not feel like your staying in the craziness of Vegas. Very calm and quiet property with great decor. 2 pools and a fitness center open 24 hours. Had a small hotel size room but great little kitchenette and all the supplies you would need to cook up something good on the barbeques by the pool. one thing to note is that there is no restaurant or bar on-site. so don't think that you will order a little drink by the pool. there is an extensive room service menu and plenty of places close by to eat if you are not cooking yourself. also I would recommend they get a second jacuzzi ...the 1 for such a big property is not adequate.
4,"Came in Friday night at around 9:00pm and it was quite busy, almost every table was taken and it was very loud. We were greeted promptly and seated at a booth. The booths were quite small as well as tables (could only fit max maybe 5 dishes) but comfy. 

Food was good but very oily. I guess that's kind of expected at most Chinese restaurants. Right now they're offering their seasonal lobster for $24.99 (I think it was 1.5lbs). Prices went up from the last time I was here. I would recommend coming with multiple people so you guys can share the dishes (portions are quite large) and split the hefty bill (e.g one vegetable dish could be $15.99). 

The service is what you would expect at any Chinese place-so many staff around but hard to get the attention of any. Food came out speedy though which was excellent for us hungry people."
4,"There's nothing like the 2-4-6-8 menu. Love going here especially because it's never really busy (when you go any time besides breakfast) and even then sometimes breakfast isn't too busy. It's cheap food, so you shouldn't expect much out of it, but to get good tasting cheap meals. I love getting the French toast. Good service, plenty of tables, I've got no complaints here. Thanks for being 24 hours!"
4,"Drove from California and chose to stay here randomly - a very good decision. 

Pros:
Affordable ($45) 
Large, suite complete with kitchenette and private restroom attached to master bathroom
Friendly and helpful staff
Washer/Dryer in room
Kitchenette stocked 
Fireplace in room
Free shuttle to strip/Fremont experience, etc.
Free parking 

Cons: 
Dated feel
Farther from strip (traffic) 
Housekeeping per day is an extra fee - will only come by per request (fee), at end of stay or if you are staying longer than a week.

Will definitely return!"
4,"I came her about 5 years ago a couple times and never liked it. Decided to give this another try about 4 months ago and found Kim, she was so amazing and did everything I asked for. She is now my nail lady for good, very professional and does what I want. The shop itself doesn't have much selection for colors, but she makes it work wonders! Go see her, tell her Keana recommended her!  Giving this shop 4 stars solely for Kim! Otherwise the shop itself is about a 3."
4,"PROs:
1. Affordable. Got the spacious studio suite with kitchenette which came useful for storing and warming up leftovers.
2. JACUZZI TUB! So spacious and with jets! One of the best bathtubs I've taken a bath in. 
3. Large pools and hot tub. 
4. Continental breakfast included (bagel, apple slices, danish, coffee, tea). 
5. 1 mile from strip. Offers free shuttle rides until 1am(?). 
6. Concierge is friendly, funny and honest. Offers suggestions for free and non-free activities. 

CONS:
1. It's mostly a peaceful, quiet property though I had to put my earplugs in as the A/C ventilation in someone else's room kept on going on/off. Though we got a top floor room, my friends who didn't said they had trouble sleeping b/c they could hear their neighbors above them. 
2. WiFi is only offered in the lobby area. Otherwise, it's ~$11/night."
4,"This place is nice, I have a family of 5 so is was nice for the kids because of the pool, fairly priced, I like that the small suites have a kitchenette and the sofa in the small living room area is a sofa bed, FREE WIFI was a plus another plus is the free shuttle to the strip and they have activities for the kids in the activity room. I also like the fact that there is no casino on the premises, and my children did not have to endure cigarette smoke.

The issues I had were that one, does not know where to go and there is no signs telling you the building numbers and or names so you do not where you're going.

 This place still a work in progress but I can see the potential for families for sure. I would recommend that they consider adding more amenities for families like please keep the activity room open  later at least until 10 pm. and have more security around the building. This place is a jungle, but then again that is why is called TAHITI VILLAGE. 

KEEP up the good work. Overall rating is I would stay here again, the kids love the pools and the lazy river."
4,"Great service and cute little spot. 4 star because the drinks weren't that good... we end up throwing both away after leaving. The pandan waffle was delicious, I'd probably go back for that again."
4,"Went there on a Sunday evening for a business meeting. The place has a large dining area but each table has an intimate feel to it. The restaurant also has private rooms to host private parties. I had the pleasure of being seated in one of those private rooms. Right away, you notice the friendly service. The staff was very helpful from coat check right to the very end when our evening was finishing up. The ambiance was very classy. The noise level was not too loud. I started with crab cakes and shrimp cocktail to share with friends. The crab cakes were delicious. They were not overdone but cooked to perfection. They had a creamy sauce to add a delicate flavour and you can squeeze a drizzle of lemon over too add tartness to the crab cake. The shrimp cocktail was good; however, the shrimp was the size of a small lobster! I had a prime rib. I asked for medium and came out as ordered. As for the sides, I had a baked potato and steamed vegetables. Both of them were average. For dessert, I had the pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream on top. The pie was not too sweet or rich. It is quite expensive, but the food is great and the service is excellent. It is a great place to go for a celebration with friends."
4,"This place is one of the legendary steak houses of the GTA. In itself, that makes the Octagon very much worth visiting, with old school service that makes every visit memorable. I fully enjoyed the food served, yet given the price, it fell a bit short of my expectations."
4,"I don't get what all the stink is about...

I've been hearing rumors about this place having an off smell due to the dog grooming place next door, but none was experienced during my visit. Apparently they have got it under control now, so if you have been avoiding visiting due to this, it seems no longer an issue.

I was quite full by the time I rolled in, but wanted something cold and sweet to finish the night. I had heard good things about this place from fellow yelpers, and saw a post for a red bean drink and knew I had to have it. 

I haven't had red bean in a drink since MITEA in SD, so I was quite happy to try the one here, and I may even prefer this one. They definitely don't skimp on the red beans, and it was well balanced and not too sweet.

They are located a couple doors down from Lee Lee supermarket, so if your looking for something refreshing after shopping, bambu would be an excellent choice."
4,"Have you stayed at a Hampton Inn & Suites?  Because they are all the same...clean, slightly modern, flat screens, etc.

About this one-
Room 338 is on the corner and big.  
Request a room that faces the airport to watch planes land and leave (since the views are nothing to write home about)
Complimentary HOT breakfast sure smelled good (we missed it by 5 minutes)
Only 1 turn to get to the strip, so if you don't want to stay in a casino, and you are able to drive yourself, this is a good alternative
Friendly staff"
4,"Is very unique in the area. Drinks have Asian flavors, but appeal to a broader audience... sweet enough, fresh, etc. Much of the traffic was walk in, order, go. They have seats and wifi, cozy enough to stay a bit, do some reading, etc."
4,"I'm usually not a big fan of chain like breakfast places like this, but with that being said my experience was better than I expected.

It was a Sunday morning so of course it was packed! 

I walked in, put my name on the list, and got seated not five minutes later.

They were very patient with me as I was waiting on someone for at least twenty minutes. The food was decent for the price and the service was as well.

I prefer many other breakfast places but for a quick, decent, well priced breakfast I would recommend this location."
4,"I first tried Bambu and was glad it opened a location in Chandler as a crave desserts such as Che Ba Mau and Bo Dam from time to time. I love that the desserts are not overly sweet and you have the option to add simple syrup to your taste. 

Generous portions, but a bit on the pricey side."
4,"Came here with a bunch of my UofT friends for some Reading week stomach stuffing... mission complete! 

Everyone left with pants feeling tighter and wallets feeling lighter. $26.50 Weekend dinner AYCE. not the most expensive I've had, but still a large amount so best kept to a ""once in a while"" outing.

The Goods!
Sashimi - White Tuna, Salmon, Surf Clam
Maki - Boston, Mango/avocado, Smoked Salmon, Spider, tons more ITIS set in so memory got a bit fuzzy =P.
Tempura - Yam, Shrimp
Grill - General Tao, Sweet and Sour Chicken.
Sides - Seaweed salad, Edamame, Agedashi Tofu
Dessert - Fried Banana w/ drizzled chocolate, Ice Cream (Green tea, Red bean, mango)
Really wished I had noticed the Boston Roll earlier and definitely regret not getting more sashimi!!
Avoid the Grill options that we got, we had some people who didn't like raw fish (sad times). 

Service was very good for an AYCE joint, perhaps because of the dinner hour (Price) they are on their best behaviour? 

Definitely planning on going again for lunch this time!"
4,Just had dinner here it was delicious. Service was fast. The beer was cold & lots of salsa to choose from. The came out & talked with just great place. The price was amazing for the amount of food they give you. I give it Two thumbs up..
4,"I stopped into the Wok Box Fresh Asian Kitchen the other night on their second day of business. I met the husband and wife owners and they seemed like really nice people that care about their customers. The Wok Box is a Canadian based Franchisor. This is the second Franchise to open in the US.

My wife ordered this noodle bowl that we shared and I ordered some spring rolls which were served with plum sauce. The noodle bowl was delicious. The eggrolls came out  a little frozen the first time around. But that was quickly rectified by the owners. I really enjoyed the plum sauce as opposed to the omnipresent orange sauce.

They have a couple of kinks to work out. But the place was comfortable and inviting with a self serve soda machine. They have a lot of different entrees from all over Asia; This includes asian po'boy sandwiches. They are a couple of bucks more than the chinese restaurant we normally go to but it's a nice change of pace. It's always good to have options. The attached link is a trade article which gives you some more information:
http://www.restaurantnews.com/wok-box-fresh-asian-kitchen-opens-flagship-scottsdale-az-location/"
4,"Great service, friendly and fast.  Love the decor, but could use some Japanese  music.  the environment was moist though cool on a hot rainy day.   The food was awesome, much to pick from. Nice bar.  Enjoyed 2 large Kirin beers. Sushi and sashimi had generous portions of fish.  Orange chicken had a nice light tempura like coating."
4,"This place is good. We ordered shanghai noodles with chicken and tofu, Indian butter chicken, & kids meal. I like the thick noodles & it was spicy!!! The Indian butter chicken was smooth, curry yumm taste. I like the fact that they made a kids meal plain brown rice and grilled chicken.
What I didn't like, their Vietnamese coffee...yuk. When user said ""it was to die for"", you've got to be kidding me?!?! I consider myself a connoisseur of Vietnamese coffee and that ain't it!!!"
4,"I'd rate this hotel about a 4 maybe a 4.5 star.  The pools were very nice, there were 2 large pools with sand in a portion, it was unique and interesting both open I believe pretty late which was nice.  The jacuzzi was also very relaxing.  Our room was about the 3rd floor.  It was clean and not over the top, but nice.  Some places, like the elevator showed a little age.  The location was very convenient and around a lot of other things.  The outside is intriguing and unique.  The staff were all kind and helpful.  The breakfast was light with just bagels and fruit options.  Overall I would recommend this hotel and I would be happy to stay here again."
4,My husband and I go here regularly for pedicures. They are always friendly and give good pedis. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to the $1 charge for using a credit card. It's not about the money but the principal of it. when they first opened they requested payment by check instead of credit card. Now they stopped accepting checks and impose a cc fee. It's not posted anywhere that they don't accept checks so you're blind sided when you go go pay.
4,I ordered the sweet Mongolian chicken and thought it was great.  Especially for the price! It's a fast casual restaurant so no servers which is also a plus to me. I'd like to give it 4.5 but for some odd reason yelps doesn't have halves.
4,"My husband and I stayed here for the Memorial weekend. It's a good thing we stayed here because traffic was hell on the strip. 
This hotel is located approx 4miles off the strip, away from all those cars and crowd. We were able to take smaller streets to avoid EVERYONE.

The front desk and concierge were very friendly. The studio room we got was pretty clean. The jet tub looked clean but we soaked the tub with hydrogen peroxide. No fizzing, which I guess is a good thing, right? Well better to be safe than sorry! BTW.. we used it each night of our stay. =D

The hotel was also very quiet. Which is great because we won't be disturbed during sleeping time! =D

Also, there's 3 pools for kids to enjoy. 

Unfortunately, that's all I got..we didn't spend much time in the room! =P

On a side note...The whole feel of the hotel sort of reminded me of Cancun Resort in LV.."
4,"Placed reservation through costumer service and booked a 1br with a kitchen upon arrival the room was a 1br without a kitchen, front desk Julie tried to speak to management to get room changed but there was none available and the change was going to be an additional $25 per night. What??????? As a owner I did not know that there were several ways of identifying the type of room without a kitchen. I did get the tutorial from Julie and it was appreciated. I called again the next morning and spoke to Thea about the misunderstanding and she reached out to her manager Kelly and called me back to notify me that they were going to change the room to include a kitchen, I just wanted to say thank you. The room was clean, comfortable and just what was needed."
4,"Clean property, nice location. The proximity to the airport obviously adds aircraft noise, but leaving complimentary earplugs is a nice perk! Interior areas, (lounge, lobby, hallways) are well maintained, bright and clean. The complimentary parking and breakfast is appreciated, (arrive early if you are picky & require a variety--as the morning progresses, so do the selections & seating). Housekeeping is preventing this review from receiving 5 stars. For the property being small, I would think my room would receive service prior to 3:00 p.m.??? Not a deal breaker, they did offer fresh towels."
4,"Very comfy Victorian style atmosphere.  Service was excellent. Every server dressed like a businessperson and they were friendly. I ordered a French onion soup, it was a little bit too salty, my hubby ordered clam chowder , it tasted creamy (good). The New York steak and peppercorn steak we order were not bad. Just the gravy sauce was a little bit too salty. The fries as a side dish was amazing and it was beyond our expectation."
4,Love his place coming since I was a kid! Right across the street from my high school. People are always friendly never too busy and food is typical Denny's dinner food. Love it! Four stars bc everytime I ask for over easy never quite yolky enough. Lol other Han that nachos and moons over my hammy are my fave here! Enjoy!
4,"The place is nothing to look at, but the tacos are delicious! Prices are seriously good, and I am addicted to the fish tacos. The Carne Asada Fries are fantastic, too, and the portion is HUGE!

If I could change one thing- -  I wish that the Horchata was part of the drink area where you take your own. I would love to just have a sip or two... too many wasted calories to get a full glass."
4,Food was great atmosphere was awesome. I ordered pancakes it was soft and yummy. Service was awesome. Ill definitely come back for their specials.
4,"This has become our go to local place to get chinese.  I hate the mall but I love this place.  The Hong Kong lobster is my favourite.  Authentic Chinese here.  You will see a perfect mix of asians and North Americans.  This is how you know a Chinese restaurant is good.  Their steak dish is amazing.  Good flavours.  I can care less for the Congee soups. They all look like regurgitated Chinese food with noodles and an egg and a splash of bodily fluids. 
But that's my opinion."
4,"I had the dan dan chicken bowl. Which was super spicy, and I added some siracha and soy sauce. It was delicious and well cooked. The place was very clean as well."
4,"Fast-food Asian fusion. A pretty unique menu. Mediocre food, but quick and helpful service. They even serve your dish at the table if you're eating in (as opposed to calling out your name or the order and expecting you go fetch).

Since this was my first time, I didn't realize that the napkins and plasticware were set up in a central location, so I didn't grab them. Rather than pointing me in the direction of the items and watching me get up to retrieve them for myself, my server told me not to worry about it, then went to get everything I needed for me. Such a small thing, but not the kind of service you necessarily expect from a fast-food restaurant.

I've definitely had better curry in my life, but I wasn't expecting anything to knock my socks off anyway. The menu is diverse enough and the service was pleasant enough that I'll be back.

Good work, Wok Box.  :)"
4,"Where have all the steak houses gone? Sure, we can go anywhere for a steak, but for the classic ""steak house"" experience, only a few tried and true favourites that have dotted the Toronto restaurant landscape remain.

At the north end of Toronto is a Thornhill staple, Octagon Restaurant. When a fire burned it to the ground in 1992, all that remained, ironically, was the fireplace.

A grand renovation included an original belle époque cast iron doorway gilded with 24 carat gold from the St. Regis Hotel in New York. Rich décor includes 18th century stained-glass panels from a Belgian Church; European oil paintings; Mahogany, walnut and European olive wood paneling and intricate carvings; custom-made Tiffany lamps; chandeliers; brass wall fixtures; and leather banquets providing the requisite grandeur for this Victorian style ""jewel box"".

Dress code is business casual. The room is all about the presentation and the ambience. The plating is about the food.

Prepared table side, the Caesar salad of crisp romaine is creamy and garlic-y with bacon and crunchy croutons that would make Caesar proud. They sure don't skimp on the scampi. Shrimp cocktail is colossal. Plump, meaty shrimp are served on iceberg lettuce accompanied by a tangy in-house made cocktail sauce. Lip smacking baby back ribs are charcoal grilled for a smoky essence, and slicked with a zesty barbeque sauce. Good thing they provide us finger bowls, because we need both hands to devour this ample portion.

The wine cellar is fully stocked to match the menu. While the appetizers pique our appetites, we've come here for the charcoal broiled steaks, and are ready for our 16 ounce rib eye. Sizzling, juicy and tender this corn-fed beef packs flavour and needs no sauce or garnish to set my taste buds dancing. Quality meat prepared with care and consistency has enabled the Octagon its longevity. Enjoying every mouthwatering bite, and engaged in conversation, we don't even notice how seamlessly our attentive waiter refills our glasses.

Dare we ask for dessert? Rich coconut cream pie and a soft crust mini pecan pie sprinkled with cocoa and drizzled with a chocolate sauce are made specially for Octagon. Served warm and a la mode, these lush sweets punctuate a decadent feast for the senses."
4,Sandy Mittens is the best hairdresser I've had in years. She helped me figure out the perfect hair cut for my face and hair. She is also amazing with color. On top of all this she is SO nice! I can't imagine going to another hair dresser!!!
4,"Cashiers are always kind & friendly. Food is consistently tasty. Menu is pretty large. They serve breakfast, lunch, & dinner. Prices won't hit you over the head"
4,"I'm glad to see ""honeygrow"" has finally made it to Pittsburgh! With delicious stir fry, salads, and fruit desserts on the menu, this unique quick serve restaurant is a welcome change to the usual Chipolte lunch. Ordering is fast and simple: either in store via touchscreen or in advance via app (although the honeygrow Android app is abysmal and hardly usuable). Although I take my food to go, there is very little room in this location for dining, if that is your preference. Meals average $12-$15 with beverage."
4,"I was very surprised by the quality of this location. It's close enough to the strip, and also just a little ways from downtown, so we got the best of both worlds. Definitely the tiki music playing when we walk in, and the employees are all quite nice and helpful. The rooms are clean and spacious as well, and it was a mini-suite complete with a mini kitchen stocked full of plates, cups, and a fridge. My only complaint would be that the water takes a long while to warm up, especially compared to other hotels, but it really wasn't a big deal. Wifi was also free and worked well the entire weekend we were there. I don't really have any complaints about this location...will be back!"
4,"Honeygrow is sweet like honey. So good. So convenient. 

I order ahead on my app for a quick pickup and it's always ready when I get there.

I go the customizable salad route every time. Some may think my order is strange, but that's the beauty of a place like honeygrow. You can add whatever you like, and create any sort of wild combination to satisfy your every craving. 

I love the wide variety toppings. I especially love the fact that they are ALWAYS fresh. 


Little pricey depending on what you add-on... but somehow I don't seem to mind."
4,"Was extremely excited about Bambu coming to AZ from my hometown San Jose! I was anticipating the opening ever since seeing the Bambu car at Chandler Fashion Mall

Bambu has fruit smoothies, vietnamese coffee, boba and the vietnamese dessert che. I Loovve the coconut milk and three beans and jellies! It's like colorful, squishy gummies with different textures on top of crushed iced and creamy coconut milk. Yummmm.. 
  
We ordered the #6 fruit addict it was hard to decide what to get. I liked that it came with pieces of real coconut and jackfruit, lychee and red tapioca.
 I wish it had more beans and coconut milk there was so much jellies that there was very little coconut milk.

 Price wise felt a little higher than usual $5 but because  the place was clean and they accept credit card!( They don't charge  minimums like most asians places) I think l'll let it slide. 

Next time I will customize my che you can choose inredients as you please. *Don't need to order the preset combos. Hurray hope bambu is here to stay! 
PS. please bring loyalty cards ! ;)"
4,"The sushi rolls were a good value. At dinner, there were several rolls (6 pieces) that were only $6, which is a good price. The service was friendly. I plan to come back for the really good lunch special, which is 3 rolls from a predetermined list for $12.95 (Monday-Saturday). I tried the Crunchy, the Hollywood, and the Spicy Salmon. Their fish to rice ratio is really good. I would recommend this place."
4,"Very nice people ! Helpful in choosing drink /dessert! I  if you are expecting Boba it's definitely different! I was full off the size ! It is a bit pricey , mine was comparable to a grande at Starbucks and it was 6.22, I did tip to 7.00 ... I had to get it out of my system and try it ! I will probably go back to try the fruit addict !"
4,We ate at The Pub soon after it opened in December.   The food was very good and all the wait staff were attentive and friendly.  It was a lovely evening.   I will definitely visit The Pub again when we are back in Las Vegas next time.
4,"Sumo opened less than a week ago, so I knew it was possible that my review might be a little more critical than if they had been running smoothly for several months. The good news is they seemed to shake off any early jitters and I had one of the best hibachi meals in Madison. Yes, the hibachi chef needed a little more practice, and the service was not quite 100%, but the food, atmosphere and overall experience will keep me coming back. We had two rolls to start the meal; a Sunshine and avocado. You must get the Sunshine. Not only delicious, it's presentation is one of the most unique I've seen for a sushi roll. We transitioned to the hibachi with our table getting all of the available options, with the exception of the lobster. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the sauce they use for the rice and scallops added a nice flavor, though I'll admit it looked a little strange coming out of their bottle. Drinks were impressive and with a bill of about $40 per person, very reasonable considering the appetizers and liquor. 

They may just be starting up, but this place is worth a visit now."
4,"Very friendly service. The place looks clean. I like that they have Sriracha hot sauce on every table. The menu is interesting and all over the place, but the thai red curry and the indian butter chicken are both good! I've ordered to-go and I received my food very quickly."
4,"We had a great and quick experience with Kevin. We knew exactly what we were looking for and he made it happen and at the lowest price we could find. The delivery and take away of our old dryer happened on time, professionally, and quickly!"
4,"This hotel was the most affordable one that I could find the weekend of May 20-22 at 111$ a night.  

There were lots of pros to the experience: 
- upgraded to a king suite because they ran out of the normal king rooms. 
-huge room, complete with a little office table, a little coffee table, and a sofa. 
-breakfast included
- not too noisy given that it's by the airport

Cons:
- it got a little cold so we turned on the heater, and once we turned on the heater, the whole room started smelling like gas.  No Bueno. 
- further away from the strip

All in all, I would stay here again, given the right price. :)"
4,Had our fav Bbq pork rice and Chicken Soy rice. The Bbq pork was really good sorry to the other one at Lawrence this was so good. This restaurant is closer to place. Will be going for more often. Price is very reasonable.. It's busy and so go early.
4,"I had a facial with Jane, and she was awesome.  She is personable, warm, and funny.  She responds to whether you want to talk or not, and she explains everything she's doing.  The facility and equipment are clean and the whole experience was relaxing.  And now my face feels and looks great!  Also, no products were pushed on me, which I totally appreciate.  Give Jane a try!"
4,"Of course don't come here expecting a fancy shmancy hotel. We actually scored a super cheap price ($63 per night) on Hotwire giving that it is NYE weekend and even Hotel 6 is averaging almost $200 a night. We actually made a mistake and initially arrived at Tahiti Village, which is the sister company. The woman at the front desk kindly wrote down the correct address and let me know it wasn't too far off (it was less than 15 minutes away). Upon arrival I was informed check out is 10 am and check in time is 4 pm. Which is a little different than what I am use to, most of the hotels we have booked were 11 am check out and 3 pm check in. Regardless, the woman was very sweet and informed me that she could set us up with an earlier check in as our room wasn't ready yet (it was closer to 1pm). Only difference was that the room that was ready was listed at a smoking room and she wasn't sure if it would smell. I opted for the earlier check in and she let me know that if it smelled at all to give a quick call and she would send someone up to the room to spray. We got to our room and were pleased that everything was clean and up to pur expectations with cost in mind. Remember, we paid less than a booking for Motel 6 and were given a studio King room. Complete with a comfy bed (not the hard mattresses with funky pattern sheets), flat screen tv, dining table, microwave, fridge, dishes, jet tub and a hefty amount of towels (I hate calling and asking for more). The room did not smell like cigarette smoke at all! Sure, it isn't on the Strip, but that was the least of my concerns. They even have a few pools and a Jacuzzi with a cute little waterfall. Did I mention that they also serve complimentary bagels, fresh fruits, coffee, etc in the morning? Another pro is parking is relatively easy! Con? We were informed that the hotel offers complimentary Wi-Fi, it either always had a problem connecting or it would connect but the internet was not working. If you're just taking a quick trip and/or on a budget and you don't mind not being on the Strip, totally book this hotel!"
4,"Today was my first experience at Shine Salon. I LOVED the building- its much larger than I originally thought. All the staff was friendly and welcoming. Also, they offer beverages which is a huge plus for me. Robbie, the assistant was sweet and does a great ""wash."" My stylist, Andrea, was teaching her and I like that that offer that opportunity. My haircut is great- couldn't ask for anything better! I asked to have the dead ends cut off and to reshape my layers- she managed this without taking hardly any length which was important. A great experience. Great vibe. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because of the price. Apparently my stylist just got ""promoted"" and her prices must reflect that. A simple wash and cut was $65- at least $20 more than I've paid in the past. However, the positives of the salon for me outweigh the one con so I will definitely be returning!"
4,"With a full kitchen, a whirlpool tub in the bathroom, two TVs, and a property with two pools and complimentary breakfast, what more can you ask for? 

We enjoyed staying at the Tahiti Resort over the last week. 

Our only complaints were a smell that never went away in our room, leading us to buy a scented candle and a room spray to help it go away. 
There is also only one elevator in the west building and if you are near suite 314+ you will have to walk quite a ways to get to the nearest elevator. 

Overall, the smell, the lack of elevator, no drying rack for dishes, and the older and too firm mattress are reasons why I'm giving Tahiti Resort four stars."
4,Great AYCE sushi lunch
4,Great steaks. You're paying a bit of a premium for the ambiance . This is another steakhouse that prepares the Caesar salad table-side - a bit expensive but tasty and entertaining. Total $100-125 per person.
4,"Viva Chicken has a cousin from the southern United States and her name is Coaltrane. Neat setup with seating and a full bar upstairs make this Plaza Midwood fast-casual spot a crowd pleaser. 

Dinner on a Saturday night after an afternoon visit to Codescape and sunset drinks at Thirsty Rabbit; I was surprised that it wasn't that busy, but guess they are still developing a customer base. 

Good price point and the fact that there are on-tap beers and other drinks available will make this place work well in the neighborhood. The stuffed avocado dish was good and the sides of mac and cheese and quinoa with vegetables was just right. Very surprised that my friends could also order the avocado as they had ""run out of it and were on their way to get more."" They'll work out any little issues like this and hit their stride soon enough. 

I don't live nearby, so would go out of my way to eat here, but a solid option affordable option while neighborhood."
4,"Plaza Midwood's new kid on the block is delicious! I stopped in the day after they opened in the middle of the afternoon. They weren't crowded so service was super attentive and quick. Everyone was ready to explain the menu, offer suggestions on what to order, ask if I needed anything at all, etc. 

The interior is gorgeous. If you ever frequented the previous tenant, John's Country Kitchen, you won't believe this is the same space. They've somehow added an open loft space, beautiful exposed bricks,  and dark wood paneling to a spot that was pretty old and well, well worn. It is literally a brand new place. 

I had the stuffed avocado with pulled chicken and a side of green beans. While the avocados were good (more about them in a minute) the green beans were the star, hands down! They are crunchy and garlicky. Sooooo tasty! I could eat them by the bucket full. The avocados were also good. The avocados themselves were perfectly ripe and soft. (I hate it when you get an avocado that's still kinda hard because it's not ready yet.) They are stuffed with quinoa, pinto beans, and queso fresco and topped with a red, creamy sauce. They didn't have quite the kick I was looking for, so I went back to the counter for their salsa verde. That did the trick!

My only piece of feedback/room for improvement... I wish they had the sauces out for self service like the other Peruvian chicken place in town that I shall leave unnamed. I would have liked a little bit more salsa verde (it's killer!!) for my avocados but didn't want to look like a total fat kid by asking for more after I already downed one container's worth."
4,"Friday's is $3 drafts and music bingo! Awesome space on the rooftop bar area. 

Food was great. I got 3 sides- half an avocado , street corn casserole and quinoa with roasted vegetables. 
Hubby got the char grilled steak plate with 2 sides! Sauces are on point! 

Reminds me of Viva Chicken if you've ever been but a bit more expensive. 

Love the area and the specials each day. Service was on point"
4,"Love this place, here 2X a month..
The only downfall is there sautéed vegetables are super oily and lack that garlic flavour. 
I recommended you ask for non MSG, and I usually feel tired and bloated after eating at congee queen,so now i say no MSG! 
Food will not be as salty"
4,"This is a very underrated hotel. First of all, because they know they're competing with so many other hotels in Las Vegas, there are a TON of perks, including: free bottled water at front desk, free wifi, free breakfast, free coffee in the lobby (tasty!) and free cookies at check in. Also, there's a gym--which isn't common in smaller hotels. The rooms:  Nice decor and well equipped. And not only did I have a mini refrigerator, I also had a microwave, which is not very common.

My only complaints (room #162): snug tub/toilet area (door almost bumps into toilet), no light in shower, the linoleum floor appeared dirty and the comforter was torn on one side--old and needs replacing.

Location isn't 'great' with airport noise (seems to stop around midnight and starts back up around 5 or 6 am) and it's about 20 mins to most casinos on the Strip. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time with the heavy traffic in Vegas...and it's getting worse.

Price was great during CES too...less than $200/night and staff was very nice. 

Recommended as a nice alternative to staying downtown."
4,"***UPDATED REVIEW***
Shane Vineyard is our hero!  He called us this morning and apologized profusely for the error on the rebate.  He admitted it was his mistake and gave us the extra $30.  He also reassured us that the dishwasher we purchased is excellent quality, but should we ever need to use the warranty, to call him first.  This is customer service at its finest.  
Original review with description of problems:
We shopped here based on a recommendation from a friend.  We had 2 problems with our dishwasher purchase.  The salesman was Shane Vineyard.  We were in the store twice and he clearly told us both times that KitchenAid was offering a rebate of $100 on installation.  The rebate card arrived, and only had $70 on it.  The explanation is that we were only charged $70 for installation, so that's what was refunded.  That may be true according to the receipt (it's not even written clearly, the fee is under ""freight""), but Shane wrote up our total cost on a business card, and he definitely told us we'd get $100 back.  I spoke with the manager, Larry, and he's just positive that his sales people don't ever misrepresent anything. I guess he hasn't actually bought anything from them.  The 2nd problem is the installer broke a pipe and we had to pay a plumber $80 to repair it.  Again, they have a ""great"" argument - their installers aren't responsible for anything except the line they replace, because houses often have worn-out parts.  Well, my house is 4 (that's four) years old, so I'm fairly certain nothing is worn out.  I've now spent $110 more than I expected, so their ""great"" prices don't beat the other stores now.  I also purchased the extended warranty from them, so I hope I don't ever need to use it."
4,"The inside is really relaxing and there are enough pedicure chairs for about ten people at a time. The workers are really professional and the nails with design turned out great. Also did a good job with eye brow waxing. 
Only four stars because of the price. It is very expensive. Four dollars extra for ""longer lasting"" nail polish(not even gel) is a bit ridiculous to me."
4,"Been here more times than I can count now, it's become a regular stop for my family especially on weeknights. Conveniently located just at the edge of the TTC network, it's easy access and a great post-work stop no matter how late I get off work.

The atmosphere is casual and typical of other ""congee and noodle"" locations. They have their own roaster, their own fish tank, and quite a bit of seating space. On weeknights there's never a problem getting a table, but make reservations on the weekend if you're set on coming! The menu prices are acceptable, and generally of worthy value based on taste and portion size. They are decently staffed but things get busy - as I've come more often I've gotten to know the servers and they're all very nice and genuinely trying - it's just not a kind of restaurant to be super polite and wait your turn - raise those hands and wave and get their attention! They're happy to help. 

Typically for dinner we order a fried rice in lieu of steamed white rice, a steamed fish, and a simple leafy green. We'll pick another two or three more dishes depending on the number of people, from beef and mushrooms, to lemon chicken, to sweet and sour pork, to various stir fried and casseroles. Their roaster also has great BBQ pork and chicken, so those are great picks. If you are a fish fan, go for steamed fish. For chicken, lemon chicken is a tasty option. For pork, BBQ pork is the go-to. Finally for beef, their hot plate beef and mushroom is great. As to fried rice, the six grain rice is a healthy option, or I recommend their fried rice with egg whites, smoked salmon, and fish roe.

The items I do not recommend include their house special stir fry, mango chicken and tiger shrimp, and garoupa casserole. The stir fry is a mix of garlic shoots, fried tofu bits, fried taro chips, and peanuts - entirely nothing special nor worth the price. It was like eating Asian bits and bites at dinnertime. The mango chicken and tiger shrimp was overdone the last few times I've ordered it, and the deep fry job was nothing close to fresh. Finally the garoupa casserole - a favourite for my family because of the taste, but I highly dislike the tons of bones and the deep fried texture of the fish, combined with only a small proportion of tofu and bok choy.

House dessert is always a cold sago-like dessert soup, with red beans, tapioca, herbal jelly, and coconut milk. Refreshing for the warmer months of the year and always on the house, so don't miss out!

What keeps me and my family coming back all the time is the quality taste of each dish and the consistency. We've frequented many other similar restaurants in the area and found gradual but significant decline in food quality, but have so far been satisfied with this Congee Queen location. Fingers crossed they keep it up!"
4,"I recently moved to Charlotte and had a horrible experience at another salon in town, I made an appointment at Shine and Jennifer was awesome. She fixed the horrible cut as much as she could and gave me tips how to style it as it grows out.  I definitely found my salon going forward. 

I didn't give it 5 stars only because I waited for almost 45 minutes with a scheduled appointment."
4,"I was lucky enough to get invited to Shine's Blow Dry 101 event by our awesome and fearless Yelp Community Manager (yay, Nicole!) and enjoyed it immensely. The salon was clean, trendy, and had a very cool vibe.

Just a bit of a background story here - I have extremely curly hair. And in terms of styling it myself, I don't do more than towel dry, scrunch with some hair products, and maybe put it halfway up (or in a ponytail for the gym). Hence this 101 class on how to blow dry my hair straight was long overdue. 

On to my learning - they had three different people helping me at one point. No joke. I'm that skilled at drying my own hair. I was (nicely) mocked for still having the same hair dryer from college and for not owning a brush (that's right - I was still using a comb for my tresses). We all laughed about it and then they talked to me about which brushes I needed (that's right - plural as in more than one type) and that I should buy a new hair dryer. Lucky for me, they had just the one I needed on sale, so I grabbed that on the way out. 

Overall, my (three) helpers were very sweet and said I did a wonderful job since I have virtually no experience with drying my hair. They gave me a ton of tips and talked about which products would help make the process easier. All were very knowledgeable and friendly and did not make me feel like a complete idiot, which was a task for them, I'm sure. 

Now if I could just get the energy to attempt this at home every so often, it would probably become much easier. Time to unwrap my fancy new hair dryer...."
4,"Such a pleasant surprise considering what was in this restaurant's place before. The hibachi experience was so much fun and entertaining, and all of the food was delicious. Bar service was on the slow side, but it was a Saturday night so I can forgive that especially since the cocktails we had were fantastic. Kind of pricey but the experience was worth it. Not sure if I'd say the same thing if I had just don't the ""restaurant"" portion."
4,"Lovely experience.... I stayed last weekend during the iheartradio event and I can't complain.  I believe I paid like $119 a night. It was a nice and quiet ambient, breakfast is included so we went down to check it out.... It needs some more variety but descent for the hotel size I guess.... Their waffles are soooo good though!!! The hotel cleanliness I must say is their best feature! There is also plenty of parking. It would be worthy of 5 stars but the room I was assigned had a HORRIBLE view it was literally a wall with bird poop EVERYWHERE! towards the bottom you can slightly see some cars parked but for the most part it was wall and poop outside the window definitely something no one wants to wake up to in the mornings."
4,"OK, *please* read my whole review. Two points to make, A and B.

A. In the 90s, in China, there was this hugely popular type of restaurant that served ""California Beef Noodles"" which everyone in China thought was native California cuisine, but of course, it was just Chinese beef noodles. But, who cares so long as the food tastes good, right? -- I've gone to Wok Box a few times now. For anyone expecting the Chinese/Viet/Japanese/etc. named dishes to taste like the stuff you get in China/Vietnam/Japan/etc. or even taste like what you could get in an American big-city China-town, etc., then you will be hugely disappointed. Not even remote. ***BUT*** if you walk in and DON'T have that expectation, then, as grub goes, it tastes just fine, especially for the price. Compared to the crap you would get for the same price at other joints, the food here is downright great.

B. Everything else, the cleanliness, the service, the interior, the quality of the ingredients.... are SUPER! This is a well-managed little restaurant.!

Bottom line: As long as you hold tightly the reins on your expectations, this place is a 4 star or better, depending on what's important to you."
4,The service was great and it's a nice restaurant. We ordered a prime rib rare. Super good.
4,Nice and clean hotel. Check in was very easy. Excellent customer service. The only downfall is the location of the hotel.
4,"Went here mid afternoon for a late lunch. The place wasn't too terribly busy and I was seated immediately. The place has a nice selection of beers and a simple food menu. The staff was extremely friendly and the waiter was particularly helpful, providing his honest opinion of the menu items and sharing feedback he received from other patrons. I very much appreciated his sincerity rather than simply saying, ""Oh, everything here is really great!"" I ended up getting the chicken sandwich. This was not the best chicken sandwich I've ever had but it was still very good, as it was flavorful and well-sized. The coleslaw was not good at all but thankfully that was just a tiny part of the meal. The fries were just fries: nothing to write home about but nothing wrong with them either. In a nutshell, great staff and beer selection, good food and ambiance. A solid 4-Star experience."
4,"Thanks for the nice stay Hampton Inn.  Nice staff, good nights sleep (although you can hear the airport, but hey, it's the Hampton Inn Las Vegas AIRPORT so not a big surprise). Everything was clean and nice and I love that the put fresh bed linens, and ALL the linens are fresh fro each new guest.  Reused bedspreads freak me out and they don't have that here.  The cleaning staff was really great and I never saw them.  No annoying push to get out so they can clean your room.Breakfast was your typical free breakfast with eggs, sausage, waffles, cereal, toast and pastries.  You know the drill, but it was good and I like having that option at any hotel I stay in. Everything about our stay was nice. I would stay here again."
4,Probably one of the top nail salons I have been to. I always go to one in the mall for my pedicures. I change up places for my acrylic nails since its almost always different. This place made me feel welcomed they talked with me and made it personalized. Definitely going back for a pedicure. Not sure about acrylic nails though. Going to test some more places on acrylic. Good pricing for a great job :)
4,"Really cool way to order foods!
I also like their App, really trendy but also detailed with their products.
I had a dine-in at the store, but one of the ordering screens was out which wasn't a big deal.  I waited about 10-15mins to get my food which was a bit long, but the food was really good! I had sesame garlic stir-fry with wheat noodles. I was really impressed by the wheat noodle option and I will definitely order it again!"
4,"Went here on a Sunday with the family. We had a party of 8. Food was delicious, fast service and you can really tell the quality difference in comparison to your everyday Chinese food restaurant. Parking was a bit of a challenge being in the heart of a mall and busy streets. Being a busy restaurant on a Sunday it was challenging getting our waiters attention. I will be coming back with the family soon."
4,"I don't have much to add except that it's a Denny's! It's America's Diner! It's always open (and of course it's greasy and not super clean, it's Denny's for crying out loud). Great place to go if you have a hankerin' for a greasy burger or a big 'ol fatty breakfast! Love their whole wheat pancakes (ask for sugar free syrup on the side). I love my bacon super crispy and the cooks here know how to deliver."
4,"Came because Yelpers really liked it. It seemed a bit more ""assembly line"" than I have been eating around Phoenix, but was still very good. Just sort of lacked that ""grandma in the kitchen"" feel.
I kept it simple with a couple chicken tacos and a few rolled steak tacos. Added some chips/salsa for good measure. They have a great little self-serve salsa bar with 5 different salsas that were all very good. Mild to Spicy, couple green, few red. 
The Tacos were huge! Piled with Guacamole and Pico, and some pretty good chicken(guessing thigh meat) The rolled steak tacos were pretty much a taquito from what I know. Service was great and friendly, location was nice and clean. There are a lot of options for Mexican food, this one is pretty solid. East to get to right off The 101 on 59th Ave. I'd probably go back if I were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't drive miles out of my way to go back."
4,"There aren't too many of these places around, but we love coming here for lunch. My company often gets food to-go from here, and the owners are so nice! They always help out their staff, cook when they are asked, and are often the cashiers. You can tell that this is someone's livelihood, as they take great pride in how the place is kept and the customer service that is given. 

I always get the Sweet Mongolian because I loooove garlic, and their spring rolls are soo good! We will definitely be back soon!"
4,"I used to go to the Thornhill location quite a bit. Now my family and I go to this location as it's much closer to us. I really like this congee queen as it's newer so the interior is cleaner and it's a bit more spacious and allows for more customers. My family and I arrived around 6:30 on a Sunday evening and we had to wait about 10 mins for a seat. We got fried rice, lobster, pork chops, green beans and tofu. All the dishes are usually consistent in taste and pretty good. The fried rice we usually have is the chef fried rice. We decided to try the Empress fried rice. To be honest I didn't really like it but I can see why it's so popular. The green onion and ginger lobster was delicious, the pork chops were okay, and the green beans were my favourite. I also had a Hong Kong milk tea which is really good here, it tastes like a true HK tea compared to the other ones. The service is always good here as there are tons of servers and you can always flag one down easily. I would recommend this location!"
4,"This Denny's has a good atmosphere with cool people! However, the food is decent but really nothing to write home about!!!!"
4,"We had lunch here yesterday to meet a friend who is now a local. We sat outside and enjoyed the day. The beer selection is always good. We tried the fried pickles and they were really good. Crispy and lots of dill punch and they serve it with 3 dipping sauces. The blue cheese fondue is surprising and delicious, I loved the BBQ and the ranch is really good too. We also shared the corn dogs and the truffled parmesan fries. We should have asked first because the corn dogs come on a bed of fries and they are really good small bites. I think my least favorite item was the truffled parmesan fries and they were really good too, just a little too much truffle for my taste. My favorite item here is the lobster rolls, everyone should try them at least once! This is one of our favorite pub's to visit while we are here.Thanks for always providing great service to go with the food and beers."
4,"I went for dinner at Octagon this week with a group of 10 people. They seated us in a private room with our own real fireplace. The restaurant and the room we were in was really beautiful - very old looking, dark woods, paintings, etc. 
The menu is mainily steak and seafood - I don't think there's much for vegetarians - sorry Michelle A.
The food was really good! - I ordered filet mignon for my main - (I'm not a steak expert but I thought it was good and everyone else seemed happy with their meals as well ) 
Two people orderd lobster tails - they're enormous and looked really good. 
I would recommend for a special occasion as it is quite pricey!"
4,Very clean atmosphere....the prices are a bit more expensive though. Similar to the prices as the Bambu in California. This is the only similar place in drinks as California. I will definitely be back!
4,"So my boyfriend and I stayed here over Halloween weekend for a quick 2 night stay. The place was actually really nice. Loved the studio suite with the fridge and microwave. There was even two sets of dishes and cups, etc in the cabinets. There was a huge spa tub in the bathroom and the granite style counter tops in the bathroom and kitchenette area was a nice touch. The pool area is beautiful with 2 large pools and a small wading pool with lava rocks in the middle. Loved the hot tub with the waterfall over the lava rocks as well.

When we arrived, we were hoping to get an early check-in (Saturday afternoon) but had to wait til 4pm. No biggie as that is the stated check-in time. Came back at 4pm and our room was ready. Not much parking on the side of the building where the elevators are located so we had to park on the opposite side and walk all the way down the hall--again no biggie but would be nice to have an elevator at each end.

Loved the cute little toiletries in the room in the festive tahiti spirit. Overall it was a great stay however I did have one complaint that there were signs all over the hotel mentioning renovations to the pool to start TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2011 and they did drain the pool starting on the evening of Sunday, October 30th and began the tear out work on Monday, October 31st."
4,"love the volcano roll and terriyaki salmon belly. of course all the sashimi and rolls are pretty good - and by good, i meant standard ayce sushi good. But still, things are quite fresh, rolls are nicely put together, adequate selection of appetizers. When it comes to sushi place downtown, this would be my place to go."
4,"Thought it was excellent HK Cantonese food for the price, conveniently located at a Western plaza. Fried noodle dishes were excellent; would definitely go again if I wanted one-stop shopping plus Chinese food."
4,"AYCE, so don't expect sushi to serve your royal guests at your dinner party.  But for $13 for lunch I can easily get my money's worth."
4,"As mentioned in previous reviews, Octagon is an old school steakhouse.  It's not quite ""Mad Men"" and ""Goodfellas"" old school, but it's about as close as you can get.  As you sit in the dimly lit restaurant surrounded by dark wood, stained glass windows, and somewhat kitschy decor, you can almost imagine Don Draper or Henry Hill sitting in the corner booth enjoying a mighty fine steak.  Speaking of the corners, the main room of this restaurant is indeed shaped like an Octagon - go figure!
The old school feel also extends to the service.  I have been to Octagon a number of times and have never seen or been served by a waitress.  The wait staff appears to consist entirely of males dressed in suits and ties - doesn't get much more old school than that.  The service is attentive, prompt, and friendly.  The waiters are also quite informative should you have any questions.
To start, my wife and I had the caesar salad for two.  This salad is prepared table-side with the dressing being made from scratch from its component ingredients in a wooden bowl which, we were informed, is made from a single solid piece of wood.  This was a great start to the meal as it was very interesting to observe the salad being prepared and it was also very good!  The salad had a good amount of garlic, anchovies, and bacon which made it delicious.  Now, vegetarians, vegans, and other individuals who do not consume red meat need not read any further.  
For the main course, I had the New York Striploin while my wife had the prime rib and both cuts of beef were superb!  The steak comes served by itself on a very hot plate.  Sides such as the baked potato was served on a separate small plate.  The steak was also prepared as requested (medium-rare) and the overall flavour left nothing further to be desired.  It was perfectly seared and perfectly seasoned.  All in all, the steak was thoroughly enjoyable.
Octagon also had a decent wine list.  Not the most extensive I have come across, but it was varied enough that I don't believe anyone would have a difficult time finding a nice wine to go with their steak.  And personally, I can't think of a better combination than a great steak and a fantastic wine!
After stuffing my belly full of beef, I had absolutely no room for dessert so I cannot comment on the quality of the desserts.
If you enjoy a good steak, you should strongly consider a meal at Octagon.  It may be pricier than some steak restaurants, but considering the quality of the steaks, I would say the prices are quite fair.  Furthermore, the only way you could enjoy a more authentic old school steakhouse experience would be to invent a time machine."
4,"First night here, room nice and tidy, off the strip but still a great deal, Denny's right next door, comfortable bed, lots of pillows."
4,"Good food, easy ordering, great service. 1 star docked for inconsistency - sometimes they forget to put the honey in the honeybowl. Still worth it.. I go here once or twice a week!"
4,"Great deals on happy hour. Lovely pretzel and hoot chicken wings. Absolutely worth a visit.

The beer selection is still huge, thankfully. I hope the nice atmosphere that TOD English had will continue at this new place. Will come back and check it out. Used to be super fun to sit by the bar."
4,"This is one of my go-to hotels whenever I visit Las Vegas. I like it because it is a smoke free hotel. There are no slot machines. It's a pretty decent hotel if you just want to be away from the Vegas action. However if you're a light sleeper, you might want to look elsewhere as you will be hearing planes land or takeoff all day and all night. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. They also have free airport shuttle service, but be sure to schedule a ride with the staff as sometimes there will be more riders than there are seats available. Their nightly rates are almost always very affordable and competitive."
4,"I've recently moved to the Charlotte area and began looking for a new salon.  I tried Shine first because of the wonderful reviews.  I gave them a call and the person I spoke to on the phone was extremely personable and helpful, she asked about the move, what my schedule normally was during the week, and the type of service I was looking for.

I decided to book a wash, cut, and style for my first appointment to try things out.  She booked me with Charlton about 2 and a half weeks out.  I was a little disappointed with how far the appointment had to be scheduled, but I took it as a good sign that they were constantly booked...clearly it means they are busy!

I arrived and waited for about 1 minute before I was seen for the appointment.  Everyone at the salon was so friendly.  The atmosphere was relaxing and you can tell the clientele quickly become regulars. He asked if I wanted to add a deep conditioning treatment that would last for 6 weeks.  I had a feeling this would dramatically up the cost of my appointment but decided to opt for it since my hair needed it badly.  

Charlton is definitely a professional and very talented stylist.  He took note of how my hair was cut previously, the type and texture, part, way I wanted it cut, way I wear it normally, etc.  By the time he was finished my hair looked healthy and sassy.  Even as it's grown since the appointment it maintained the style.

When I went to pay I was shocked...full cut, style, and deep conditioning add on only brought the total to $60 (which may seem like a lot but considering the service, products used, time spent, and competitor's pricing...it was a deal).

I scheduled my next appointment, which again was several weeks out to try some glossing.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of how long it takes to get an appointment...but I would much rather wait and have Shine style my hair than anyone else.  Definitely the best in the area!"
4,"Aji Sai is a pretty solid restaurant. 

Our school had a massive trip to the reference library, and hence, approximately 30 students made their way down to Aji Sai at some point during the day. 

My group had arrived first, and were immediately seated. The place looked fairly cramped, but wasn't so bad once we sat down. 

As the store was relatively empty, we got our massive order pretty quickly. The short ribs are really good, and anything tempura was perfect. Crispy, but not immensely oily. The sushi was actually really good quality, and better than other AYCE restaurants I'd been to. Dynamite roll is a must try, along with the spicy salmon roll. 

Once the restaurant got busier though (whole place started getting filled), the wait times for food was quite some time. At first it wasn't noticed, as you spent the waiting time talking with friends, but after a while everybody became anxious. 

Some of our orders never got to us (probably lost with the influx of all the orders), and one of the members of our group even heard the waiters talking in Chinese, saying ""These kids eat too much. We are going to run out of supply. How much longer and how much more food are they going to order?"" 

However, for the price you pay, the food is totally worth it. 

I would definitely recommend this place."
4,Got a cut and color from Christine. Book well in advance - this place fills up!
4,"Very similar to the other congee places. Good food, fair prices, speedy service. 

Would recommend and come again."
4,"Stopped in for a drink on the rooftop bar and Alex and the young lady who was there was so friendly, nice and helpful. I recommend any time but especially when you just want to chill"
4,"We had a great stay here, except for the wifi not working, which really wasn't a big deal for us (there's a Starbucks next door). The room was clean, friendly service except for the front desk girl when we first arrived... she was a little grumpy... but it was nice to stay somewhere where the sounds of slot machines didn't reach our room! Very quiet and peaceful... would stay here again!"
4,"Driving by, one does not realize how much they pack into this place. It's just amazing how large it is when you get inside. (Go ahead, say it with me: TWSS. Hi, I'm 5)

Everyone who works at Shine Salon is so unbelievably nice. Seriously, every person here. They should write a book called ""Friendly 101"" and then make every business read it.

Since this is my new hood and I fly by it every day on 7th Street, I popped in to see if I could make an appointment. I was able to get in just a couple days later.

Chelsea did a thorough consultation with me to go over what I would like to do with my hair. Color, cut... the annoying baby hairs that just won't behave. Seriously, what the hell are those things? We went with some lighter tone highlights (hello Summer) and a gloss to help ward off the red (go away brassy). Chelsea is fairly new to Charlotte. She moved here when her fiancee took on a new job here. She is just fantastic. I wouldn't be surprised if her old customers drive all the way to the Queen City to keep her as a stylist.

Bonus: I mentioned how I have been wanting to try a wand, but was a little scared. She took the time to show me how to use one. Gave me some great tips, advice and instruction. (Tune in next week when I'll be writing about burning myself)

If you are looking for a stylist, I definitely recommend Chelsea. I absolutely love my color and everything she did. Chelsea gets five stars! Cost-wise, it's not in my budget to come here on the regular. But hey, you get what you pay for.. right? For some people, probably not an issue. 

There's more than just hair styling at Shine Salon. They also offer a nice selection of products, make up artistry, nail services and facials. 

Shine Salon, you are fantastic. I'll definitely be back when it's time to treat myself with a splurge."
4,"People always want a Nordstrom experience for a K-Mart price. I have been going to this salon for at least 6 months and the reason I go back is because I get what I TELL THEM I want and the price is right.  I don't go for luxurious atmosphere (even though I find the salon to be as clean or cleaner than many others I've been to) or unlimited polish colors (they have hundreds of colors as it is #bringyourowncolor).  If you want that, go to a fancy Scottsdale salon about 5 minutes west and pay $35 for a fill while you look at glorious artwork and listen to Moby in the chamomile & cucumber scented atmosphere. Then try telling THEM you don't like how they are performing the service.  

I go to the same tech every time so that she gets to know me and my preferences.  Going back to the same person helps overcome language barriers, which are tough to deal with #putyourselfintheirshoes.   I like my acrylic nails short, square-round, and thin; Lindsey knows it and that's what I get - for a great price.  Did she know that the first fill? No, I had to explain it.  That's not unreasonable.  I say they are worth a try."
4,"Stopped for snacks   Hit the spot. Friendly service 
Good sour cream onion dip
Good fried pickles
I was too slow to get fried cheese  so that had to be good also.  
Staff was friendly and kind.  Brought my daughter crackers early as she felt week due to lack of food (when and why we came in)"
4,"I swear, just about stayed at every Hilton branded hotel in the Vegas area, I think this is getting closer to being the last one.

The location is pretty close to the Strip, about a 15 minute drive.  Pro tip: you should take the 215 from Sunset to go to the 15 and exit at Tropicana, Flamingo exit is way too busy.

A bit of a warning for light sleepers, you will hear the taking off and landing of planes.  It's a matter of how sensitive you are.  For me, I'm dead tired from a long night at the poker tables and I'm knocked out so it doesn't bother me.  For most people it should be ok, it's the A/C that is actually louder.  They did a great job with the room renovation.

The breakfast is standard, nothing good or bad.  Another plus is that they offer a free shuttle to the airport.

Definitely one of the options to pick from when staying in Vegas for the weekend (rates are lower than the hotels on the Strip)."
4,"I hate salons, but I like it here. I actually learned new things about my hair in the hour I spent with Jill, which was kind of shocking. Not one, not two, but three glasses of wine were offered to me as I awaited my appointment. I absolutely plan on becoming a regular customer once the monthly budget sees an upswing."
4,I love their gluten-free salads.  You can pick and choose your ingredients and they're very considerate if somebody has food sensitivities.  It's a great place!!
4,"I don't care what people say. Denny's is awesome. Sat down at 9am, ordered my food, and had the food by 9:07am. Everyone was working together. One lady took my order and when she was busy another lady brought the food to my table. ridiculously fast service. The waitress checked up on every 5 min to make sure I was OK. Had the lumberjack slam. Everything was great, but the pancakes were a little undercooked. All in all, this Denny's location gets a solid rating."
4,Food was pretty good a little pricey for almost 10 bucks you only got your box dinner enough for one but no drink or egg roll not even fortune cookie.   But it was good I have to say that  it about the same had a Panda Express   But they garnish it with some fresher things.  All in all I'd eat there again maybe for lunch maybe they have lunch specials.
4,"This place is good for dine-in, take-out, large groups, small groups, and open until very late. Prices are a little expensive, but if you're craving chinese food, this place never disappoints."
4,I visit this place quite often and I find myself ordering  almost the same thing. I did get to try the che ba mau and it was really good. I recommend their green/black teas with crystal boba.
4,"A great new nail salon for manicures and pedicures.  Friendly, accommodating staff.  Lots of nail polish options.  My only concern after going three times is that each time I go for a manicure, the price is different (same shellac manicure each time).  Seems like they are still working on consistency in pricing, so I suggest asking the final price before you start."
4,"My husband and I went here last night for the first time, and the experience did not disappoint!  The menu has a lot of great food to choose from.  We chose to have their hamburgers and they were awesome! (The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because the french fries were a little limp and I like mine crispy.)  The employees were super friendly and the ambiance in the restaurant was very festive!  The chairs at the booth we sat in were car seats!  It was a thirty minute drive for us, but we will definitely be back!"
4,"Definitely a nice place with terrific service and excellent ambiance. With the dim lighting, would be the place for a romantic evening with a loved one.

The food here is delicious. I had the scallop, shrimps for appetizers, which were simply scrumptous. The veal oscar with crabmeat was nicely prepared and well done.

I was stuffed after the meal, I could not look at the dessert menu...so can't comment on this. 

Definitely will be back again!"
4,"Got off of work at 4:30 am placed my order for take out,got there around 4:40.got the same waiter I got last week,nice guy I might say.i think his name was sabino,very friendly guy.greeted me as soon as I stepped into dennys,he recognized me I guess.he had my chicken fajita/season fries I ordered ready on the table,still fresh from the grill.total came out to $11.87 not bad for the amount of food I got,plus awesome company.i guess it was slow at this time,so sabrino came by to chit chat and see if I needed anything.anyways guess I found my new breakfast joint."
4,"Enjoying my chè at this San Jose franchise. We popped in today during the soft opening as per Ginger O.'s check-in. We got the 14. Lychee Jello and the 10. Bambu Favorite. Such a refreshing dessert on a warm Sunday!  For two desserts, we spent $11.59 after tax.

I'm excited for Bambu to finally be open after all these months! The storefront is small with limited seating and even more limited tables. It's still nice and clean though."
4,"Authentic Mexican & the best chimichanga in the West Valley!  Always fresh, and everything we've ever tried has been GREAT and very well priced. Dining area is reminiscent of Subway-style with some Mexican artwork flair, but if you're into great food with a casual atmosphere (or call ahead/take out), definitely a hidden gem worth checking out!"
4,"This place is different. The place it's self is nicely decorated I ordered a few things from the menu, nachos were delicious !! And a burger which was done medium well. I believe that's how all the burgers are cooked. Which is not my personal favorite I'm a well done type of person. So if you go and don't like medium well ask the server if they can cook it a bit longer. I didn't read the menu where it stated that they cook their meat like that. I catches that after I had already placed my order. But regardless it was good. Will return p.s they also have a good happy hour."
4,Thanks for the good customer service and the reasonable price.fast and efficient service ..love the quality of their job i highly  recommend it to those who wants to make their car looks cool.The quality of the film is the best   .they have a lot of choices .Neat and job well done.
4,"Was invited to dinner with a few friends. I had seen this location before, but never had stopped in.
All in all, was a very nice meal, good service and very reasonable prices.
I have been back twice since and each time, the food was consistently good and the service was quick, fast and friendly.
Overall, I highly recommend this location."
4,Just finished lunch with a co-worker.  We both LOVED our meals!  This place is a new concept to the area and WORTH  a visit!
4,"I wouldn't agree with the $$$ it's definitely a $$$$ but that's beside the point.  The restaurant has a lot of history and has been on the same lot for over 40 years.  So it probably was there when Thornhill was more of a town outside Toronto then it is now.  But I digress.

The meal was excellent the steaks where cooked to perfection and what I am more amazed by you can order anything off the menu and not be disappointed.  My wife and i had a 24oz rib steak on the bone which is generally difficult to cook properly since it is very thick and bone usually presents a problem for most people but not here.

The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that the building may be old but it shouldn't be this stuffy even at full capacity."
4,"Budget hotel 15 min away from the strip. 

Pro: Great customer service. Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping department are very friendly. Rooms are very clean and well maintained. Surprisingly, complementary breakfast goes beyond fruit and cereal. Hot meals were provided.

Con: Your next to a runway next to McCarran International Airport. You can slightly hear the planes take off and land but for me it wasn't a problem, since I live on the landing approach to Bob Hope Airport in the Los Angeles area.

Overall: My stay went pleasantly well and my expectations for this hotel went above and beyond. I will come back here again."
4,"The Congee Queen franchise has been serving up Western-friendly Chinese food without selling their souls by serving sweet and sour chicken balls. But even among their various locations, this one definitely stands out for their interior design, friendly service and generous portions.  Came here for a family get together and it's a great place to share good food. The temperature of each dish was just right and I actually ordered too much food because I didn't know how big their portions would be. (This is definitely not a complaint.) The go-to dishes are fried turnip, Canto Chow Mein, Seafood Special Congee, salt and spice squid, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, etc. and heaps of hot sauce.  You can't go wrong with this place. Centrepoint Mall is not the most hoppin' place, but CQ is definitely a good excuse to swing by."
4,Super cool place to grab a drink or bar bite especially while shopping. Really conveniently located it's in the heart of so much action. They have SUCH a great beer selection and a really creative cocktail menu. Pretty big place so lots of room for big groups too. Really awesome pub and I recommend it!
4,"The concept reminds me of Sweetgreen. Compared to it, less flavour mostly due to higher % of leafy greens than other veg. Overall, clean & healthy."
4,"Came here today for dinner after hearing good things. It took me a minute to figure out how it all worked. You order from a touch screen - which I actually loved! The system is also super easy to use. You can even log in and it saves your orders. 

As a vegetarian, I loved the customization options. I also like all the different noodles. I tried their spicy tofu with the spicy garlic sauce and whole wheat noodles. It was definitely spicy - I went through 3 drinks while eating! But it was also delicious. The portion was plentiful and the quality of the veggies was really good. I knocked one star off because the quality of eh tofu wasn't great. Had pretty good flavor, but it was super spongy. I expected more from a place like this. 

Service was also good, impressive especially considering how new they are. I look forward to coming back and trying something new."
4,"When we booked our room we thought we had booked it for Tahiti Village on LV blv. They sent us to their sister resort on Tropicana. It was a bit smaller but not bad. We got upgraded to another room because of some payment issue. (we had a studio, then upped to a one bedroom. kitchen and everything) Very accommodating Had a great time here last week. the pool was relaxing (i was in there for about 10 minutes due to time). THe bed and room were great. Only downside you can hear people in their rooms. It sounded like we had monkeys living upstairs, jumping around and dropping heavy things. Parking was another thing, we had to keep parking down from where our room was. when we had a arrived they said out parking would be in the middle, pretty close to our room. Other than that, i loved it. would i come back? Yes i would. Thank You for the amazing stay"
4,My milk tea boba choice in Arizona with great options for smoothies and other treats. I'm super picky about my boba texture as it just has to have the right amount of chew. Service is always very nice and happy to explain options. Love the iced coffee options as well plus sometimes they have cookies from local bakers.
4,"Good for walk-in, last minute beauty fix if you aren't in a hurry. $12 for threading of brows - reasonably priced. HOWEVER, there was a lady in front of me who were all bent out of shape because of the delay of her appointment. It appeared they were understaffed (one lady did everything from greeting, processing payment, answering phone AND threading). Granted I probably wouldn't make a big deal with the person threading my eyebrows WHILE she's doing it, but hey, to each its own. I can understand the frustration if one has somewhere to be and made an appointment only for everything to be 30 minutes behind because they treated walk-ins with same priority.
Overall I enjoyed the service and end result, but just be warned about the potential delay."
4,"Been here twice now, the first time I got a green tea blend and I wasn't really a fan of it. The second time I went I got ché number 10 and I enjoyed it. I recommend this place. Good for kids has a public bathroom and seating and games."
4,I get take out from here almost weekly. The food is consistently good. The service is quick and the sashimi is fresh no matter what time of day I order. I recommend this place to anyone in the neighborhood for simple and quick take out.
4,"This airport hotel is definitely a pleasant surprise.  It's close to the airport/strip and stores (there's a walmart right down the street).  The hotel is nicely decorated and clean.  Even though it's an airport hotel, I didn't hear any planes landing/taking off.  The best thing about this hotel is the free breakfast. They actually offer decent breakfast food - real warm food like scrambled eggs, sausages...instead of plain old cold cereal.  They also changed up their selections everyday.  Overall, I am quite impressed with this limited service airport hotel.  Will definitely recommend it to friends and family ever come visit Vegas for business."
4,"Good spot for reasonably priced and good-tasting Chinese. It's just a good staple spot for those lazy-night dinners. You can't really go wrong. Food quality is higher than those el cheapo Chinese joints. Decor is fancier. Service is still pretty much the same barebones Chinese resto service lol, maybe just marginally better. I have no qualms with eating here. Nothing mind-blowing, just good and dependable. It's also nice to see them using higher quality takeout containers."
4,"Nice stay,the staff is very friendly..love the free breakfast...room was clean..we're be coming back soon."
4,"I returned here to try out their menu having taken a brochure home with me on their menu. The place is very small and takeout is available. There's even an app if you want to order in advance and then take out. Outdoor seating is available.

This is the first Pittsburgh location. Their menu consists of two different offerings, which is either a stir-fry or a salad. Along with those you can order a honey bar and special juices. Everything they have is farm sourced and there is a board telling you where all the farms they use to supply their food.

Each item is listed with a calorie count but no where does it lists prices. You can build your own stir-fry or salad. Certain things are extra. Some of those are noted on the menu.

You place your order on a tablet. The tablet asks if you want to supply your phone number if you want to become a regular or ""track"" your order or just order without it. You then make your selection, it will ask you if you want to substitute anything out and you ""build"" your meal from there. The same is true with the honey bar. That consists of your choice of 3 different fruits to choose from, two toppings, and your choice of honey. Yogurt is extra. Also on the menu is herbed focaccia for an extra charge. You will be given a number and you can pay with either cash or credit card.

I sought out help from the owner since this type of menu was way too confusing for me. I was able to order the spicy garlic chicken stir-fry and then swap out the spicy sauce for a non-spicy one. I was also able to swap out the noodles for rice at no additional charge. Likewise I ordered a honey bar with strawberries, bananas, and blueberries, made with wildflower honey and topped with chocolate chips and granola.

If not purchasing bottled water they sell presweetened beverages from a machine made with cane sugar. Once they called my number I was able to pay and was given my meal on a metal tray.

The owner was nice enough to clean my table for me and sat down to a good and indeed filling meal. There was plenty of rice in my stir-fry and chicken cooked to order along with the other vegetables it came with. My honey bar was perfect as it was. Without the yogurt it had just the right amount of sweetness and wasn't overfilling. You can opt for maple syrup instead of honey if that isn't your bag.

This place is indeed a welcome addition to the city to serve local and farm sourced foods. I did tell the owner that it would be helpful to get the prices available before looking at that tablet because it can be confusing and it will add up. Every menu item is priced differently so you won't know until you see it on the tablet how much you are spending. Expect to pay anywhere between $11-$20.00 depending upon what you get. The honey bar by itself is $5.95 plus tax. It is not too big but definitely worthwhile.

The special juices as well run anywhere between $5.00-$6.00 on an average. They are open every day so I would suggest go on a Sunday when parking in East Liberty is free."
4,"Lotus is FANTASTIC! I've been going there since they opened and have consistently gotten fast, high-quality service. Their shellac manicures are long-lasting and they have a wide range of colors. They are also great with nail art. One of the techs freehanded a design for me that I got compliments on for weeks. I took in a picture of a mani I found online and they executed it perfectly! 

I have gotten one pedicure there and it was okay. They have many different pedis to choose from and the basic one includes a paraffin wax, but callous removal costs extra. Also, my color chipped within a week--it may have been the polish I chose. 

They do take walk-ins, but it's best to make an appointment as they are quite busy. Also, pay with cash or check as they charge $1 for credit/debit card transactions (there is an ATM in the salon for convenience). Overall this place is great. I used to go to another nail salon in Madison and they charged quite a bit more and took a whole lot longer. At Lotus I get a beautiful shellac mani in about an hour (add a bit more time if you want a design) for a reasonable price. I would recommend Lotus to anyone!"
4,"I eat breakfast here often. First I find the employees here really nice especially the lady at the front desk (black hair and glasses).  I always get the same thing....the Hearty Breakfast Skillet which is delicious  and always comes out piping hot. The sausage that comes with this skillet is really good and different, it is spicier than their breakfast sausage but less spicier than their chorizo. They do the very best they can when it is extremely busy. Also they take care of our military with a military discount. They accept competitors coupons at this location  which makes me keep coming back. You can also check online and in the papers for Denny' discount coupons."
4,"First, nice remodel. Warm and inviting. Didn't venture into the hibachi area, so can't speak to that. We were seated right by the waiting area, which was a bit disappointing - it wasn't super busy but it was rather noisy and distracting.

Ordered the Sumo Deluxe, Black Dragon roll and Blue Crab roll.

Onion soup and the salad that came with the entree were tasty, especially the soup. Entree itself was delicious. Vegetables cooked perfectly, meat was tender. Could have used one or two more pieces of scallop. Had the fried rice for an extra dollar - wasn't impressed. Pretty tasteless and almost zero vegetable.

The rolls were very good, although the last bite of the Blue Crab roll really should have been cut. It's was literally 3 full bites."
4,"Found wok box by my work and finally tried it. The food is good, many options and can be customized. These is something for just about everyone. I give them 4 stars because it is not the cleanest restaurant, and also they automatically charge you for a large every time unless you specifically ask for a regular. You would think it would be the other way around. If you haven't been here before it is absolutely worth a try!"
4,"The food is pretty good, expect lots of fried food choices though. I thought the hamburger was extremely tasty but the fries were soggy and limp.  Most of the beer selection was from the larger breweries and those with a hawaiian theme, sorry but Kona kind of sucks as a beer, how about bringing in some Maui beer for a good hawaiian beer. If you want beer Boulders on Broadway down the street has a better selection however the food is better at Jimmy Hula's.  Staff was great, their wifi wasnt working so the server connected us to his own personal hotspot."
4,"I recently stayed here for a business conference and was pleased with the hotel! I never normally stay at Hampton Inn's, but overall, very happy with my stay. Nice clean room, immaculate fitness center, free coffee and tea all day long, free wifi, great variety to the free breakfast, and very good customer service. I wish it was within walking distance of more restaurants as it doesn't have a restaurant otherwise (that said, they have delivery to several restaurants in the area). Happy with my stay - thank you!"
4,This place was good. Service was fast and friendly. Love the salsa bar. Four of us were happy with our meal.
4,"I just moved to Charlotte from SWVA where the same person has done my hair for close to a decade. I called and made an appointment at Shine because of the great Yelp reviews that I read. And I really, really needed to have my hair done. They were able to schedule an appointment for me very quickly.  (Within the next two to three days.)

This is a huge salon, the setup is great and the people are nice.  I'm extremely happy with how my hair looks.  I have long blonde hair that I try to highlight regularly; I also add lowlights when I have the time and money.  I did not have to spend a great deal of time explaining what I needed done-Andrea quickly understood what I wanted.

I am amazed at how quickly my hair was done!  This is the quickest anyone has ever done highlights on my hair!  I cannot stand to spend hours waiting to have my hair done, so the short amount of time it took was a total treat for me.

The only reason that I did not give the salon five stars is because of the price.  WOW!  My hair looks great-but I totally paid for it.

I'll definitely go back again, though."
4,"We had just finished getting some pho for dinner and looking for a tasty dessert to finish off the night. I yelped for boba and to my delight, Bambu popped up! I had no idea that it's been here since May 2016!! I would frequent Bambu whenever I'm back in SF so I was super excited! We pulled into a plaza which also houses Lee Lee supermarket. 

My husband ordered a taro smoothie with boba. Sadly they had run out of boba, but offered popping boba as a substitute. It's not as soft as regular boba, but has more of a springy and spongey consistency. The taro smoothie was still satiating and had a great taro flavor with the right amount of sweetness. 

I got the Fruit Addict which consists of longan, red tapioca, jackfruit, palm seed, jello, pandan jelly, coconut meat & coconut milk. Sadly they were also out of pandan jelly. I still enjoyed the drink since I love all the tropical fruit! We had come in near closing time so we were grateful they were able to get us drinks as their last customers of the day. 

The place is cute, refreshing and I will definitely be back especially during this hot summer!!"
4,"What a great little place in North Scottsdale.  Good food, with very helpful staff (I think they are the owners) who are always ready to help you with your order or explain anything you might need.  
The spicy Dan Dan noodles are fantastic as is the slightly sweeter Mongolian.  
The only bad thing about this place is the parking.  The shopping center has a very strange in and out configuration often making it confusing and slow."
4,You get what you pay for. 3.5 stars
4,"Very nice restaurant. Elegant and up market. Had chicken parm and filet. Food was tasty. Service wS refined. Atmosphere is classy. There is free valet parking when you arrive. With a bottle of modest wine and a dessert to share, the bill was $125. Not terrible for a classy restaurant.  Would certainly return."
4,The food was very delicious.  Service was very friendly and prompt.  the only complaint I have is I wish that they had real forks instead of plastic forks to eat a salad with.  The stuffed avocados with chicken on top were amazing!  A bit overpriced in my opinion but for the area its right in line.
4,What you would expect from a Hampton Inn.  Clean and decent room and a basic breakfast.  The proximity to the airport can make it a bit noisy at night.  If you are a light sleeper this could be a problem. They put a pair of ear plugs on the night stand. Free airport shuttle every 30 minutes.
4,"I love this place. Fast, precise and easy...just found out about mon/tues customer appreciation so I'll definitely be going for that discount lol. This place is also clean which I love. More private than getting threaded at the mall and no appointment needed. I like the older lady there the most, have to grab her name to recommend for next time. Good spot :)"
4,"Been here twice now, the first time I got a green tea blend and I wasn't really a fan of it. The second time I went I got ché number 10 and I enjoyed it. I recommend this place. Good for kids has a public bathroom and seating and games. The Thai tea is probably my favorite! Yum!!"
4,"This place is good for takeout ! I eat here once in a while ... Not my decor but its really pretty good food. Its near the Salon & if i have to wait its this or Rubios !! This is more Mexi ... & quiet, but the game is always on!!"
4,Had a great experience. Came here because the reviews seemed promising and wasn't let down. The environment is a little different from other salons I've come to- which is good. Love that they offer a beverage while you're getting your nails done. Waxing services available is a bonus. Will definitely return.
4,"I am glad I didn't base going on some of the reviews I read.  I was very pleased with my visit.  We were seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We had drinks within minutes, which were always filled without asking.  Our food was at our table quick.  Everything was delicious, at our table we had nachos, sante fe skillet and kids grand slam.  The restaurant is older and could probably stand to get a makeover but the service was great.  The food had great flavor.  We were in and out in under an hour, with three kids that's a great thing.  Our waiter Diego was great with my kids.  He talked to them like people and did not ignore them.  We will be back!!"
4,"This location was a surprise to me, even though I have been here a million times.  The location is also incredibly busy!  I was surprised how busy it was.  Nevertheless the wait time wasn't anything crazy.  We were able to find a table for 2 within a reasonable amount of time.   We ordered a few items, from each of the different food groups: pork, beef, chicken, you get the idea.  With all the food groups covered, we had a really enjoyable time.  The food was good, and the service was speedy.  The only drawback might have been the noise level, but there's not much you can do about that with a full restaurant on a very busy day."
4,"Bamb? is a great place filled with Vietnamese desserts/drinks. I always order the Bamb? special which includes coconut juice, basil seeds, young coconut, pandan jelly, and longans. It's not too sweet, just perfect. The walls and floors looks kind of messed up and dirty. Today, the employee thought I was tricking her when I came in with the check in offer from yelp. It seem like she didn't give me the 20% discount or it wasn't a thing. She didn't smile at all but her tone of voice didn't sound she was filled with hatred. Going back to the yelp offer, she only gave me the discount for two drinks but clearly it said the whole order and that didn't happen. It's fine, but my offer didn't say maximum two drinks. I would take off another star but I'm not. Hoping my next visit is much better."
4,Our first time there and we will be back the sushi was very cold and flavorful. The hibachi was tasty and the chief was engaging and skilled. Lunch prices were so affordable and you get a lot much food. So glad to see a great restaurant with good food and great prices.
4,"Tahiti in Vegas!? Sign me up, baby!  
We are with the Marriott Interval exchange program and received a bonus week to use sometime in January, so I rounded up the girls and we made a vacay out of it! 
 
It was a certificate for a 1BR but we upgraded easily to a 2BR for only $15 a night.  This was a great deal and we enjoyed staying off the strip a bit, but close enough to enjoy some of the typical Vegas nightlife!

We wanted a pool view, so they put us in Bldg C and we enjoyed that so much.  It was on the end of the resort, so we felt safe and secluded back there, with plenty of parking.  Lot's of great shopping and eats next door.  Denny's, Quiznos, Walgreens, Pizza and chinese.  We hit them ALL up a few times!

We were about 1/2 mile from the Orleans Casino which has a great movie theater!  You can find any type of entertainment in Vegas, and this location was superb!  Kudos to the staff and team for meeting all our needs.  We requested extra blankets and they buzzed them right over.

Need some carbs? They also they serve a light breakfast every morning of bagels, muffins, fruit and juice. Thanks for that little perk.  The hot tub was perfect temp and the pools had a sandy beach bottom! Never seen that before!

We borrowed a few movies from the front desk to enjoy in our room, free of charge!
Never used the shuttle system, but that looked handy dandy too!

We will come play again, but want to try the Tahiti Village Resort, south of town too... or maybe the real Tahiti in the South Pacific!!!! Aloha :)"
4,"The cons- it's rather dated, and there's a musty smell through all the hallways and rooms.  The shuttle won't let you take luggage or drinks with you, so you can't use it to get to the hotel to check in (or out when you're leaving), and let's face this is Vegas and everyone always has a drink in their hand.  Also there's a ton of families (i.e. kids) at the pool, so it gets pretty loud in the afternoons.  And there's no restaurant or bar on the property, so you can't order food or drinks by the pool.  However they do have room service (from a nearby restaurant I assume).

The pros- it's a great value.  The rooms are big, and every one is a suite with a mini-kitchen.  Some actually have full kitchens and a separate bedroom.  They also have balconies and gas fireplaces.  Each room has a tv and a DVD player, and there's an iPhone dock.  The rooms even have their own laundry machines!  The property has 2 large pools, with beach-like sand bottoms, a hot tub, and outdoor grills if you want to bbq.  Free parking, easy access, free Wi-Fi, free breakfast.  And there's an hourly shuttle that goes to/from 2 convenient places on the strip!"
4,"This Denny's has the best servers. Especially Fernanda, she's great - she'll remember your meal order if you've only been there 2times. She's attentive &
Professional. Excellent server. Keep up the good work."
4,"Room A116. Right by the parking lot but very quiet until the morning when you can here
everyone at the continental breakfast outside the door. Clean room nice kitchen. The bathroom is a nice size and has great water pressure in the shower. The hotel lost our reservation but quickly booked a new one and we were able to check in early (2:30 instead of 4) due to a family emergency we had to check out a day early, they were very understanding (refund pending approval from booking.com) Four stars because the staff were very accommodating but the noise from bfast was kind of annoying. Although our room appears okay  I cannot give any more because of the pictures from other guests rooms. Now I feel like doing an inspection. I want to clarify how room was booked- I thought we were staying at the Tahiti Village Resort and Spa, my friend made reservations here. Had I seen the yelp reviews I would not have chosen this hotel but the stay was not horrible and given our positive experience with the staff they might change your room if its infested."
4,OMG!!! So worth the price. I had the Indian Butter Chicken Rice Box with the Cheesy Kimchi Fire balls and my boss had the Breaded Lemon Chicken Rice Box. We found our meals to be very flavorful. Well Done!!!
4,"When I'm in the mood for fast/take-out Mexican, this is my new go-to place.  Sorry Federico's!  Although you have an ever-so-convenient drive-thru and later hours, I've decided that Ricardo's food just tastes better!  I just wish that Ricardo's offered the same hot sauce that Federico's uses - those ever-present little plastic cups filled with red saucy goodness.  Ricardo's does have a salsa bar, but it's definitely not a highlight, IMO.  Pretty much everything I've tried here is tasty, especially their beans (I love refried beans).  Prices are decent.  The staff is always pleasant, and the place is pretty clean.  I'm sold--a happy repeat customer!"
4,"This place is literally around the corner from my apartment and I'm in love with it. They're ingredients are always fresh. 

Tips:

1. Get the Wakame Salad if you like seaweed salad. It's heavenly! 

2. Sometimes they add 15% gratuity to the bill even if you're a party is less than 8 people, so check your bill. 

3. Get there early for lunches - can get super busy!"
4,"I give this Hampton Inn 4 stars because it accomplished what I always expect from Hampton and these things are the most important to me:
1) They have the most comfortable beds in the industry at almost any price level. 
2) They have awesome breakfast that is tasty and free.
3) They give you a nice, quiet, comfortable room at affordable rates.
4) They have free parking and free wifi.

Normally, I would rate Hampton 5 stars, but this one loses one (and it should probably be two) for the greeting you get from the DMV-esque surly night auditor person. She should seek a profession in local city government. It would suit her disposition better. 
And because the breakfast person was non-existent. Not there for helping, cleaning tables, or anything else. She was hiding in the back most of the time I was there.
There are also very few tables at this location and they are placed so close together that inconsiderate families gave no thought to taking up 3 tables. There weren't anywhere near enough for the number of people there. 

I will also throw a huge ""piss off"" out there to Hampton Inn for not serving biscuits and gravy anymore... my favorite reason for going there in the first place, but the other reasons still stand, so I will remain loyal. For now. Muahaha"
4,"We made a trip down to Honeygrow this weekend to see what it was all about. At this point, I wish they were everywhere.

I had the Sesame Garlic Beef and subbed the noodles for brown rice and of course added just about every other addition that I could to it. It was awesome. The beef was tender, seasoned perfectly. Then sauce from the stir fry permeated the rice, and merrier together well with the sesame seeds and the cashews which I added to it. The downside is they initially made my order with chicken and had to remake it. I'd have still ate it with chicken. 

She had the Spicy Garlic Chicken and it was spicy. We ended up trading meals about half way through and I ate the Spicy Garlic Chicken and it made my nose run. That's rare for me to say. It was hot, but damn was it good.

While I personally didn't try any of the local honey and granola options, she did. I sampled it and it was refreshing. Very fresh ingredients.

I was a big fan of the sugar cane fountain drinks, definitely different and some pretty unique flavors. 

Will definitely return!"
4,"This is your typical AYCE Sushi joint and you do get what you pay for but considering the area and the quality of food (for AYCE), we've never been disappointed. Aside from the rather disappointing wine selection (when I used to drink).

The selection is good, service can be touch and go sometimes but overall we enjoy almost every time we've been there. The selection for AYCE sashimi is actually better than most but the main reason we love this place is the seaweed salad. We simply can't get enough. 

We've been here many times and never once have they ever charged us the automatic 15% gratuity. People do know that they need not pay that 15% if they disagree? it's not law."
4,"Me and my son, who is four years old, were craving breakfast for dinner so we stopped at Denny's after playing at the park. Food was great, service was great, only complaint is I chipped my tooth on the fork! I guess I should slow down when I eat  so that's my own fault!"
4,"Yesterday I tried this place out for the first time for lunch as it is close to my job and what can I say but the food was AMAZING!!! Well at least the Buffalo wings, stuffed avocado and ""street"" corn known to us a ""grandma"" corn. We also had the black beans that had great flavor but was a little more on the al dente side then I would like (the young lady who was working was really nice and got us some more). The chipotle maple wings remind me of a spicy sweet sauce (very spicy) in my opinion but I also think Siracha is super HOT so it just depends. You could definitely taste the maple but I was okay with that, although I preferred the Buffalo. If you want saucy wings ask for extra sauce but if you get the Buffalo you probably won't need it because the flavoring is amazing. Oh, I also had the goddess salad and the fresh farmer, we went for lunch and dinner in the same day. . Will definitely be back to try more of the menu, it's small but I prefer small menus as to not over whelm me. Definitely give this place a try, I'm sure you'll be back. 4.5"
4,"Very traditional steakhouse...making your Caesar salad from scratch right before your eyes. I particularly liked the appetizer dish they bring with garlic bread...pickles, olives, and chilli pepper. Service is excellent too. I usually order the ribeye  with a little fat on it but I've tried other cuts too that are excellent. So if you're in Thorn hill give this place a try...you won't regret it."
4,"Been here a couple of times now and the very first time I came here, it was very disappointing. A lot of people were waiting at the front door because it was a Saturday night and it was extremely busy. We had a reservation for that night and the hostess at the front took forever to attend to us. We had to force ourselves in the front to get them to talk to us. And even then, a lot of customers were complaining about how they were given different information about reservations. They were questioning why they were told they couldn't reserve when others were able to reserve seats. Knowing that there were other angry customers made it really awkward for us who were able to reserve seats fine. 

Even with reservations, we waited for about 20 minutes. Finally, we got seated. The rest of the service were good from then. Food came fast (and we ordered a bunch of food) and we were able to get out there within an hour. 

The second experience I had was today...and a lot better. Service was fast and better organized. We were immediately seated and our orders were taken right away. We ordered the shredded pork congee with salted and golden egg...this congee is really delicious and comforting. They have so many other choices on the menu but this one sounded really good..and it was! Super delicious and filling. Can be shared between two people. Good portions and reasonably priced.

We also got the deep fried shrimp wontons..it came with 8 shrimp wontons..and for $6.50, it was really worth it.

Service was 10x better this time. I highly suggest to go on days and hours where it is less busy...because you get a good and quick service. The food is always good so there are no complaints there. Prices are reasonable and portions are great and shareable. Nice and clean place. Servers and hosts are okay...some need to be friendly, but if you're looking for quick service, this place is great...just avoid the busy hours."
4,"Great ambiance, complimentary valet and coat check.  The Octagon is the definition of a true steakhouse! We ordered the ribeye and salmon, both were cooked to perfection.  Wasn't a fan of the medallion fries or baked potato- both were very bland.  The Greek salad was tiny, and just enough to share.  My next visit, I would skip the sides and just order mains.  Overall great food, decent prices for a steakhouse and wonderful service."
4,"Great stay! Gonna be there for a ""Vegas 2"" trip and if I have as much fun as '10 then round 2 should be a blast!"
4,"Good fast service, pretty broad menu, I got my fill.

They had sashimi when I went. 

I only had a few annoyances like lack of tea and unpredictable portion sizes.."
4,"Good hotel to stay in off the strip. It was my friends timeshare that we stayed in and got two rooms connected to each other. 
Good customer service, always there to answer my questions or assist in any way. No extra cost to get parking for extra cars. They helped us set up a taxi service to a hotel. They also have a shuttle that takes you to the strip every hour. 
The pools were nice with actual sand in them. 
Of the things I didn't like thought were the fold out couches. So uncomfortable and hurt my back, did not sleep well. Might as well just sleep on the normal couch."
4,"Ever gone into a restaurant and have one of the friends you're with create a bit of a fuss with the waitress and you spend the rest of the evening wondering if the staff will spit in your food?

Welcome to my evening. Thanks to a pretty innocent misinterpretation on what was going on, we started off on a bad note with the waitress. So I'd first like to say how professional and polite the staff was to us despite this. Serving people is a tough job and this restaurant did a good job of serving us well. 

The food is pretty typical of All-You-Can-Eat. The quality is pretty decent but nothing mind-blowing. I personally felt the quality was better than most. The selection was particularly surprising and I was pretty pleased with the selection of hand rolls and regular/special rolls. If you feel like meat, this place hits the spot pretty decently as well. They have nice Chinese dishes and interesting cheese wonton bites. 

I do have to say I haven't been to many AYCEs in Toronto, but compared to what I'm used to I thought it was quite solid and reasonable for the price."
4,"Amazing place

Prices obviously on the high end. 

Handmade Caesar salad at your table is delicious (always get it when I go)

Steaks--- amazing. Melts in mouth. Always right seer 

Wine - great selection. From high to low prices 

End of day it's a nice treat once or twice a year."
4,"I have been a fan for years!! Mark used to cut my hair when I first moved to Charlotte in 2008.  For the past two years...for what reason..Im not sure. I had not gone to Shine. Recently, my hair has just gotten really long and was looking through photos from before...I realized; I need to go back and see Mark at Shine Salon (love love love the new location)!! 
So, last week I set up a consultation to talk about cut and color..I wanted to talk about doing highlights (I've never done anything like that to my hair). Mark took time with me and discussed the coloring process...

Next Tuesday I'm getting my hair cut! Can't wait. 
Im excited!!!"
4,"I hadn't been itching to try this place because we've already got RoCo and Viva Chicken rocking the rotisserie close by. I'm really glad the group I was with came here. I had the pulled chicken fresco bowl and it was much better than I expected. The pickled onions, arugula, and house sauces made this meal stand out. I'm a creature of habit and tend to frequent the same places. It looks like Coaltrane's will be added to the rotation! Oh, and they have $3 drafts on Fridays which doesn't hurt!"
4,"We love this place. It is not elegant but it is a very relaxing place to vacation. We have stayed in some of the most beautiful casino suites which are nice but there is something to be said for an off the strip hotel. Our pool was open 24 hours. There were grills, hot tubs, and two pools. We loved sitting on our balcony over the pool each morning. No waiting for valet, centrally located by a grocery store, pharmacy and access to the freeway to get to Casinos within 10 minutes. The staff was excellent. We are staying again in August."
4,Good Mexican Food menudo Saturday. Been here several times and the food is good. Hawaiian Burrito the best you need to try it
4,Very good Carne Asada buritto. Good prices and quick service. Good little joint to go to in the area
4,"Came for breakfast around 8am on a Sunday. Not very busy but the waiter was very attentive to our needs.
We ordered breakfast burrito with hash browns and toast, and sausage griddle platter that came with sausage links, 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and hashbrowns with two drinks was under 15.00!! Was very good and filling.
The restaurant was clean and fast."
4,"This Hampton Inn & Suites is extreme clean and 100% smoke free, that's the best part. The downside it's close to the airport and you hear the planes land and take off,  but not too much late at night.  The other downside it's far from the strip, (5-7 miles)you will definitely need a taxi,  a car or take the bus. Clean and Smoke free sold me. Enjoy."
4,"Other than the service being sucky.... the food is GREAT. Huge portions and a huge variety. A few dishes that stand out as favourites are: Seafood Vermicelli, Salt and Pepper Squid, Cantonese ChowMein as well as the BEST SHRIMP WONTON SOUP EVER. Do make sure you make a reservation because it is always busy!"
4,"Monday afternoon, co workers and I amble to Sushi Inn http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushi-inn-toronto#hrid:q56OXpYiMNBnRBufpQMOtQ to get some lunch. It is full, and the downstairs is mysteriously closed. Not wanting to wait 30 min for a table, we head to Aji Sai. 

I don't love AYCE. Its usually gross. But I went for it and I was shocked. I have been to Aji Sai in Barrie and it was sub-par, so I never returned. This location was actually good. The fish was of good quality, the menu was extensive including udon soups, teppanyaki, sushi and maki. No sashimi however they did have butterfish sushi which was fantastic. The rice to fish ratio was well balanced overall. 

Some of the best sushi I have had in Toronto lately, surprisingly. (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushi-marche-toronto#hrid:nLERMU8gcxKpquphj8eJpQ) And lunch price was $12.99, which was tremendous value, especially considering what you get at Asahi http://www.yelp.ca/biz/asahi-sushi-toronto#hrid:CzczcqhOxWkVlFQ2h2fAIw for the same price in the same neighbourhood. (18 pieces of cucumber and avocado roll for example)

Solid choice. Service was ok but not great. I will return however, and soon."
4,Try the Butter Chicken! You'll love it. Fun menu. Excellent service. I've tried many dishes but keep coming back to the butter chicken. The quality of the food is high
4,"This place was very good.  We stopped in after a very long morning.  We were not starving but we were hungry.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.  Their menu is just the right size,  not so long that you can't decide."
4,"I never thought that I would be reviewing Denny's but why not. IF you're not looking for the local flavor and you're ok with a chain...there is no better place to go for a good, inexpensive breakfast. They have delicious pancakes. They make eggs just the way that you order them. They have great choices if you're watching your calories. AND...they are the only place that I know of that serve grits. The grits are not too soupy either. The service at this Denny's is fast and the servers are attentive and professional. Definitely worth a visit when all of the local restaurants are too crowded with long wait lines."
4,"Went there today around 14:30 with my husband and the place was still on the busy side.  We were able to get a booth which we prefer.  I ordered the Shredded Pork & Gold Preserved Egg Congee. It was delicious with no complaints and for only $6.75.  My husband's order of Pan Fried Minced Beef & Golden Mushroom Rice Noodle was a bit late in arriving but it seemed to have been made fresh and then pan fried, thus hence for the delay.  He thoroughly enjoyed.  His dish was only $6.50, so the meal came to $14.97 (including $1.72 HST) so one cannot complain about that.  The decor in this location is a bit more up to date than some others, and it is very clean.  This is actually our second visit.  Our first visit, the place was packed and we were seated at a rather small table with other customers basically in elbow's way.   So we definitely enjoyed having a booth.  We will most likely go back again."
4,"We tried the new hot sushi spot in town because it's right near the Sun Prairie theaters, we needed to be immediately seated and have a quick meal which they delivered.  The place is huge, very nice decor.  You would never know it used to be an Old Country Buffet. 
We got the edamame (delicious!), Crazy Tuna roll- OUTSTANDING!! Get this item if you want pleasure in your mouth. Blue crab roll- pretty good.  And the cheaper/generic Alaskan roll. I would say skip these- they're mediocre and we know that going into it, so just skip it! But the price is right for only $5.75. Overall, inexpensive and delicious. Highly recommend!"
4,"My husband and I stopped in today for lunch. I wasn't really sure what I wanted, but we decided to split because the portions seemed huge. After looking at the menu outside, I decided I wanted their version of beef and broccoli, so we entered the restaurant. The inside is rather small, but it is decorated with bright colors and feels very open. You can watch them preparing the food before your eyes and can see all the ingredients lined up. 

Luckily, there's a menu above the ordering counter that is visible from almost anywhere in the store. As we waited in line, my order slowly changed from beef and broccoli (with rice) to Mongolian beef (with noodles) to Kung Pao with shrimp. (Due to my husband's subtle and clever persuasions.) I saw Vietnamese Iced Coffee on the menu and was sold. It was quick and easy to place our order and we didn't have to wait long. We ordered it to go, but when it was ready it wasn't packaged to go. An employee was quick to package it up and made light conversation with me. He expressed how much he really enjoys the iced coffee and I agreed - it was really good. I asked if they made it fresh every day and he confirmed that they did. He also pointed to the canisters of coffee that were lined up and talked about the brand a bit. 

Overall, the customer service was great and I loved my iced coffee. The Kung Pao Shrimp wasn't my favorite, but it could have been because that wasn't what I wanted originally. The portion was rather large - definitely can make two meals out of it. I'll be back for some more coffee and to try some of their other offerings!"
4,"They are quick, nice, and clean. Only complaint is that my eyebrows look good or great depending on who is working that day. But I consistently come back so I guess I shouldn't complain! :) Also, don't even try to come during lunch hour or at 5pm because parking can be hard to find thanks to the Harris Teeter."
4,Good service. I had the two beef tacos. The taco shells are really good. Taste like they deep fry the shells. My girls had the kids bean and cheese burritos. I like the tortillas too. The beans are a bit think but not bad. I will come back.
4,"The Octagon is a pretty cool place if you're coming for the first time. That is to say, for a steakhouse out of the city, it's relatively high end.

I had the filet mignon, medium rare. It was without complaint, but I've also had better. I'd rank this place well above the average Keg, but considering the price range, it could use a little work. I did like how the waiter will prepare a cease salad in front of your table - that's nice.

Overall old give them a 3.75/5."
4,"This is a nice property with nice rooms.  Located next door to Denny's, the gym, Starbucks, and some restaurants.  This is a timeshare joint, with a small fitness room of its own, mini golf (which is a joke), 2 pools, and a hot tub.  Free continental breakfast during the week, with the addition of waffles on the weekends.  They provide a shuttle which goes to the Strip (about 2 miles), which I have never used.  Minus 1 star for the unprofessional front desk people."
4,"I am rating this based off other Denny's I have been to in my lifetime :).

First of all it's a Denny's, perfect for late night breakfast cravings, random fried food and in our case a late night brownie a la mode. 

I always am so surprised at how cheap Denny's is. The service was good but it was a Tuesday night at 2am with only 2 other booths filled. The waitress even let us substitute our hot fudge for caramel at no extra cost. 

Don't expect to be blown away by the food, but expect to meet your inner fat kid's craving."
4,Great portions of sushi for the price. Very unique decor and fun atmosphere. They have some unique rolls that I have not seen at other places. The Chicago roll and Hawaii roll were excellent!
4,"We went here for dinner with my officemates. Service was very good. I have tried the lobster and steak and I was stuffed. Steak was cooked to perfection, I had mine medium rare. I had to mention the Caesar Salad that they prepare in front of you, it was superb. Prices are a bit steep compared to some steakhouses,  but for the service and the good food, I'd definitely come back."
4,"I called around 9:50am on a Saturday and booked a 10:30am pedicure appointment. When I arrived at 10:30, I didn't have to wait at all. They took me straight to the pedicure chair. 

The place is very clean. The pedicure tubs are lined with plastic. They use new nail tools for each person, and they open the package in front of you. 

I got the organic orange pedicure. The hot stone massage was wonderful, and I loved the paraffin wax treatment. I had a great relaxing experience and will definitely be back.

They charge a $1 fee if you use a credit card."
4,"**Great cheap alternative to Vegas hotels (if you're not a gambler)**

First off, there is no gambling at this Vegas establishment. If that's a major concern for you, stop reading now. That being said...

-The place is immaculate and the staff are helpful and easygoing.
-The concierge service is top notch and provided me with a gift bag upon my arrival and passes to various VIP passes to some hot Vegas clubs (example: Pure). On top of that, they offer rental service through budget for dirt cheap which I suggest being that you're off the strip.
-The pool is open 24 hours but they do have request quiet time from 10:00P-7:00A.
-My only gripe was that the hot water in the shower doesn't get a hot as I normally like. But then again, I take steaming hot showers.

I'd definitely stay here again but I have a couple of disclaimers for other travelers. This isn't a Vegas hotel, this is a time share and they will offer you to go on a tour of their new facility. It's purely optional. But...I went and bought a vacation package. :)

Additionally, don't expect the typical hot Vegas skirts and heels in this place. It's a family type spot. Party somewhere else, and crash out here when you stumble on in the morning."
4,"Like a lot of other Yelp reviews for Shine Salon, I too have recently relocated to the Charlotte area and was in desperate need of a hair cut.  I did hours of research on salons in the area, salon shopping was definitely the scariest part of relocating to a new area.  After all, I was with my stylist for 12 years!  I chose Shine based on the great reviews on Yelp - so I called & made an appointment.  Meritt answered the phone, and she was super nice, friendly, and helpful in getting me an appointment.  When Meritt called me to remind me of my appointment I had inquired about a possible brow & lip wax also. The salon was easy to get to, and such a neat place in general!  Chelsea was at the front desk when I checked in, she greeted me and we were off to her station!  She asked questions, I showed her pictures of my hair on a 'good hair day' and she did a great job cutting to my picture. Chelsea & I talked through my whole cut so there wasn't a bit of awkwardness at all, and I completely appreciated that.  I was very pleased with my cut since I'm pretty picky with how my hair is cut!  Rosie was able to fit me in for a brow & lip wax also.  I was super impressed with Rosie, and the time she took with me on doing the waxing.  She asked about my skin care routine, etc.  I ended up with a sample face cleanser - and a fabulous wax job!  I walked out of the salon feeling so pretty (especially since I was 4 weeks over due on a cut & wax!)  My only reason for giving 4 stars is due to the price.  I almost had a stroke with my $93.00 total for a cut (I have short chin length hair) and wax!  I would have thought there would be some kind of incentive for a new client so I was taken back. The cut was about 20 dollars more than what the web salon site advertised.  I will go back, but will definitely not be able to afford a cut every 4-6 weeks!  Overall a great experience with the salon!"
4,"Great server she seem very tired 
But once i brung it to her attention 
She did the best she could to make me n my guest feel welcome.

Very clean compared to ones here in Arizona"
4,"This Aji Sai a tiny place on Yonge St. just north of Bloor.  There is another affiliated location on Yonge St. SOUTH of Bloor that's much larger but the AYCE menus are different, as are the AYCE hours.

I like THIS Aji Sai WAY better than the one further south, although I have been to both many times.  This Aji Sai is small and intimate, quiet, and seems much more sophisticated and professional.  The service is great and so is the sushi chef.

Sushi rolls are great, good balance with rice and ingredients, well-made.  The variety on the AYCE menu is good, I like the sesame chicken a lot and the general tao.  The sauces are tangy and tasty.  

Only thing is that they don't have dessert on the AYCE -- at the south location they have several on theirs."
4,"First time, awesome food. Wipeout taco combo/great customer service, will definitely go back again!"
4,This place is better than alot of your fast Mexican food joints around town. Not saying it's the best but I think they have decent food at very fair prices and restaurant is always clean unlike alot of others out there.
4,"Stopped in to this shop around 4 pm on a weekday after a short commute from Texas to Phoenix. We were staying at the hotel down the street. I ordered the Hula taco and cracked corn and my coworker ordered another type of taco. Instead of lettuce, I subbed cabbage on my Hula Taco. The taco was amazing!!! The corn? It was extremely overroasted. I would recommend this place and would definitely return if we stay at the Phoenix Doubletree Hilton again."
4,"Stayed here about 3 months ago for some days. Friendly service, clean rooms, complimentary breakfast, free wi-fi, and quiet. From the map, it may look like you can walk to the hotel from the LVS airport. But, it's actually quite a distance. They offer free airport shuttle which we used. It was very noisy the first night/morning. Turns out, there was a big group of teenagers on a trip, and they happened to be staying there."
4,"Congee Queen is my go to for Cantonese style cuisine. My preferred location would have to be at Leslie/Hwy 7 but I find myself coming to this location more often for the convenience. It's always busy at this location but the wait time is no more than 10mins usually. 

We ordered a bowl of chicken and corn soup, noodles in scrambled egg sauce, and hong Kong Style lobster.

This place is my favourite place for lobster and every time I order it, I'm never disappointed. The chicken and corn soup was good and tasted balanced. Not salty and all and the corn adds a sweetness to the soup that works. The noodles in scrambled egg sauce was average. I didn't enjoy it as much as the other two dishes."
4,"I brought a groupon to this place after checking their menu & yelp reviews. Brought To-Go a Rice Box - Indian Butter Chicken (I'm an Indian) & a Noodle Box - Singapore Cashew. 

Had the rice box for lunch & it was just OK - the spice level was decent as promised & the usage of different spice ingredients (definitely not Indian) made the butter chicken ""interesting"". What pissed me off was the missing Naan bread from the box (Not sure if they missed it intentionally or by accident) - MAKE sure you ask for it next time you order. Saving the Noodle box for dinner (Looks quite promising at this point). 

FINAL VERDICT: Wanted to try this place cz the menu looked interesting (yes, fusion it is). The place looked well organized & maintained to me. For the quantity, I say they are a little pricey (again, Where is my Naan bread peeps?). I'd probably go here another time just for the ""fusion"" experience, but NOT anytime soon!

UPDATE: Had the Noodle Box for dinner & O.M.G - one of the best I've ever tasted! Perfect balance of flavor & well cooked. Change of plan, I'd definitely visit this place again to try out their other noodle dishes.Dan-Dan, anyone?"
4,"We were hungry and had a good experience. Mike was very busy and it showed but he kept that smile on his face each time he came to table. Experience would have been 5 stars because food was fast, tasty, fair price, and server was nice.  But, Bailey the cashier, was not friendly at all. I am hoping that is not the norm. But I will be back."
4,"Went: Sun Nov 1st, 6:00 p.m. (74/100)

The décor is quite attractive, having a church-like feel to it. The wood work and stained glass was exquisite. When I opened the door to go down the hall to use the restroom, I was very impressed at the beautiful wooden hallway. It was unique and felt very upscale. That was a wow moment. The design of the hall extended to the washrooms, and it was either the nicest washroom I've been to at a restaurant or very close. That's the good news.

If you are looking for exquisite and attentive customer service ... keep on looking because you will not find it here! Our waiter was not friendly, did not smile and did not attempt to create a memorable occasion for us. From what I could tell, that was how other waiters treated other patrons. It must be some mandate from above, but they should rethink it, because I think it will turn a lot of people off.  In some Asian restaurants, the waitresses are cold and functional and that is the vibe I got here. For the prices we were paying, I think some TLC should be part of the service, and was disapprovingly absent.

They seated us in a way where we are right angles from one another which I did not really like.

We had the escargot, six in total.  I dipped the escargot thoroughly in sauce that came with it and did not taste much, the flavour being missing. The last piece I ate I tasted more of the flavour I expected. My date thought the garlic bread was well done, and it was but no one is blown away by garlic bread. They gave us complimentary pickled peas, olives and dill pickles. The pickles tasted like they came out of a can. The olives were nice and the pickled peas were different but not really for us I think.

We ordered a 24 oz bone-in rib-eye. The outside was blackened and seared. The meat near the end was more medium than the medium rare we requested. The steak itself was pretty good, though I remember going ""hmmm"" at our two previous steakhouses, Ruth's Chris and Elements at Niagara Falls, and I did not do that here. My date found some so the pieces a little tough. I dipped each piece in the pool of meat juices; otherwise it would be bland. I find I didn't have to do this at other steak places. It wasn't the exceptional steak I was hoping to find. With the steak came garlic mashed potatoes and three large mushrooms. These were both very good.

The impressive décor could not make up for lack of customer service and high price vs. quality of the food. I would not recommend it to others and I definitely would not come back."
4,There are so many dishes to choose from. I especially love the congee and the eel fried rice. They are to die for. Customer service is great and fast. There is surprisingly a short waiting time when you order to when you get to eat :)
4,"Really Good sushi. Slightly overpriced. Kinda kitschy decor, including huge sumo statute. Service was slow. No wait to get in."
4,"I would come here again. The place is nice and the staff is very sweet. FYI I wasn't sure at first because they nickel and dimed me a little bit. A buff and shine instead of polish is ""extra"", callous removal is ""$5 extra"" - so it was a little annoying when you are trying to relax and enjoy a pedi and every five minutes they ask if you want to pay extra for this or that... it started out as a good pedi - a little mechanical and less spa like at first - its  worth noting it was redeemed with a very good leg massage and in the end she didn't up charge me for the buff and shine. They are open on Sunday which I appreciated. I would probably come back but I wouldn't prioritize this place over my usual place. It's great. It's just not quite amazing but every bit of a 4+ which i consider a good score."
4,"I'm just going to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Las Vegas. As a Salt Lake transplant in Los Angeles, I have had to travel through this city more times than I probably would have by my own accord. For those who love the endless party circuit and over indulgent culture, Vegas is a great place to be. I can't really hate on it. After all, I've spent my fair share of time experiencing ""Las Vegas"" (the strip) 

Last time I stayed here, I was on the strip. (Polo Towers) and really enjoyed that property. But when I came to book this time around, turns out the two properties that my timeshare partners with, were booked. Thankfully, they sometimes rent out through other time share companies, and well, that's how I ended up at the horrifically tacky Tahiti. 

BUT here's why I'd still stay at Tahiti. 

1)- OFF the strip. The Polo Towers were fantastic, and a great, spacious place to stay if the ""right on the strip"" experience is what you're looking for. But Tahiti is wonderful because you are quite literally within 5 miles of both the airport and strip without having to deal with all the traffic, noise, etc. Tahiti is very quiet, and can be a great place to come to rest after you're beginning to feel overwhelmed by the strip. Probably not ideal though, if you're trying to party into the wee hours of the morning. But hey, they do have a shuttle and a parking lot. If they're not located right in the midst of the action, they make it easy to get there.

2)- Nice, spacious, CLEAN rooms. 

Okay, so the place itself is really tacky. (It is Vegas after all) and I did get a good laugh at the fact that they have an entire poster dedicated to facts about Hawaii. Because apparently the 2,000 mile difference between Hawaii and Tahiti, need not apply. This is Vegas after all, nothing really has to make sense. But I digress. What makes the Tahiti great is the fact that the rooms are SPACIOUS. Something that's hard to find without having to shell out major cash. They have all the amenities you could need, big bathtub, washer and dryer, living room, separate bedroom and best of all a kitchenette! (And a good one at that) Ah yes, I can always count on timeshares to come through for me. Luxurious? No. But, I've said it many times before, and I'll say it again, usually, I'd much rather have space over luxury. There are exceptions, but certainly not for me in Las Vegas. 

Only downsides I experienced were this. Because I was staying only two days (less than 7 days) I had a mandatory fee added. To me, that's bullshit. I'm sure there's a rhyme and reason to it, but frankly we pay enough in timeshare fees to begin with. 

The WiFI is horrible. 

AND, the place itself is kind of hard to navigate? Gate after gate, hall after all. Not really worth  going into details about, since maybe it could've just been me. But personally, trying to navigate was at first, difficult.

But, I had a good experience nonetheless. And while it may not be for everyone, I definitely enjoyed the quiet and peace that staying here granted me."
4,"We had our doubts walking in hoping it wasn't yet another buffet and we were happy to be wrong!  Gone is any remnant of Hometown Buffet that previously filled that building.  The inside has been completely renovated and you wouldn't even know the building had once housed a buffet.

We weren't in the mood for full hibachi experience, but peeking there revealed several hibachi stations with chefs putting on the standard show for patrons.  Back at our booth, we were pleased with the menu offering hibachi meals, bento boxes and of course, sushi.  It was very much on par with other hibachi restaurants in the city.

Hubby had the pineapple fried rice which was actually served in a half a pineapple.  Very impressive looked.  He noted it did lack a little flavor but nothing that a little soy sauce couldn't solve.  Perhaps they serve it this way for less adventurous eaters.  I got a rainbow roll and tuna roll, both which were excellent.  Our table mates both had bento boxes which were huge and they both took home half their meals.

The staff was friendly and wanted to make sure we had a good experience.  This is a perfect addition to the East Towne area and we will be back!"
4,"I've always gone to the Queen Street location instead of the Yonge location but today I chose to come here since I was in the area. It is a lot smaller. The service style is different since they provide a checklist of the AYCE menu which is not as diverse with the choices but at least it still kept the special rolls. My coworkers and I sort of overordered so by the end we had 16 unfinished pieces. To avoid getting charged a freakish amount for it, I quickly asked the waiter if I could take it to go instead. The to go charge was an extra $5 to the bill which was fine by all of us. 

We ordered:
Miso Soup
Green/Black Dragon Roll
Mango Avocado Roll
Fire House Roll
Rock n' Roll
Alaska Roll
Sushi Pizza
Chicken Teriyaki
Gyoza 
Cheese Wontons
Shrimp & Squid Tempura
Vegetable Tempura
Dynamite Roll

Just a quick note, every item after sushi pizza...I don't have pictures for because those idiots devoured them before I got pictures of it. I manage to get the others because they all ran to the washroom lol"
4,"Food is great!  Service could be more attentive and friendly.  Everything I've tried here has been good,  so enjoy!"
4,Bambu I still love you but last few times I've come in the quality has not been what I've come to expect. The green jelly has been kind of hard and the coconut slices have also been hard. I ended up feeding the coconut to my dog because I didn't want it. I'll still keep coming back but if things continue like this I'm not sure how much longer that will last... there is a new boba place in my neighborhood that is quickly becoming a favorite of mine!
4,"I've been looking for a place to get my brows done for awhile now and after reading the reviews I decided to give this place a try. I came here on a Tuesday afternoon to get my brows threaded. The place was clean, there wasn't a wait, and the best part was on Mondays and Tuesdays they have 25% off on all threading. I was in and out within 10 minutes!"
4,"This will be the new stay-at hotel for Channel 70 Productions when we are not on The Strip. It is close to the airport (I enjoy watching the airplanes) and shopping and restaurants are a short drive away. The parking is excellent. The hotel offers a van all day long that will deliver you anywhere in town and then come back and pick you up. Don't forget to tip the driver. The suites are nicely appointed. The staff is top notch. Four smallish negatives - I could hear the people talking in the suite next to mine in the wee hours. The free wifi is glacially slow. My 3G netbook was 4x as fast (1mbs vs .25mbs) according to Speakeasy.  Flat screen, but no HD signal. This hotel is also part of we-don't-wash-your-sheets-because-it's-the-green-thing-to-do scam.The leftist newspaper USA Today is delivered to your door early in the morning. 
Lastly, a very nice continental+ breakfast (limited hot food) is served at no charge.
We'll be back.

(just added photos)"
4,Woke up with a huge appetite and the $2/4/6/8 menu did the job.  $2 for biscuits n gravy with crispy hash browns satisfied my need for some carbs.  Very large portion for 2 bucks.  Try to beat that at Micky D's.  Dennys coffee is AAAA+ too.
4,"We stay here a couple times a year and the hotel is always clean, rooms are kept up great, and the pools are always wonderful. We have excellent vacations while staying here!  When we stay here we are always on the top 3rd floor over looking the pools and always have an excellent view on our balcony! The kitchen is nice and is a decent size, it had granite counter tops, and all the amenities you would need to cook.; from pots, pans, toaster, spatulas, pot holders, to all the dishes and utensils. The master bath is pretty big, has a nice jacuzzi tub, two sinks, as well as a vanity which also is granite counter tops. The pool area is excellent!! The two pools were heated to a nice comfortable temperature, they are open 24 hours, and quiet time is between 10pm-7am, they also play light music out there during the daytime, which is nice to relax to. The pools were always clean and grounds are very pretty, lots of palm trees and greenery. They also have a nice hot tub which we spent a lot of time in, it has a waterfall that you can sit by while in the hot tub! They also have new propane Barbecue grills and even has refrigerators out there to keep your grilling foods cold while you are preparing. The barbecue area was nice and there was only a few people ever utilizing it while we were there. On the first floor in room 101, from 8-10am they offer a continental breakfast which consists of danishes, bagels and cream cheese, coffee, hot chocolate and different juices. I must also say all the workers were so nice, if we ever passed one in the hallway or outside they always said hello with a smile on their face and asked how we were doing; from the housekeeping, to the maintenance men, and other workers, they all went out of the way just to say ""hello"". 

They do have a sister property called ""Tahiti Village"" and is located on Las Vegas Blvd. That hotel is a bit newer and has an awesome lazy river. But, overall we prefer this one (the original Tahiti) because there are much less kids running around and nowhere near the same level of crowds as that one has and it's easier to relax. 

If looking for sites to see I strongly suggest the Valley of Fire, the drive is an hour away but it's a very easy drive and totally worth it because the scenery is beautiful and breathtaking, especially if you find the slot canyon while hiking! So pack a picnic lunch and go on out there!"
4,"I just adore this place! Everyone who works here is so nice and they actually know what they are doing! It took me too long to find a new salon after leaving the NY Metro area, and this is now my Charlotte ""hair home"". I have seen both Andrea and James to maintain my highlights and cut and have been pleased each time.

The only con is the price (NY prices)...but you pay for what you get! Definitely a diamond in the rough in Charlotte."
4,Yum! The curry & steak sandwich were great. Very fresh!
4,"This hotel was perfect for my family and I after 2 long flights. It was clean, and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and the young lady at the front desk was exceptional. She suggested a really good  place for us to eat ! It was really quiet, forgot we were even near the planes(room 314).

Positives:
Coffee in the lobby ( I so needed this)
Shuttle to and from airport and car rentals
Kid friendly
Free WiFi
Breakfast
Clean and spacious
Pool open til 3
Personable and Professional staff
Shuttle driver, housekeeping and reception made us feel comfortable.

Cons:

I received the crib I requested, but my little one kept getting his arms and legs stuck in between the rails when he rolled around. I was afraid he would hurt himself while he slept, because he's an active sleeper. Breathable mesh bumpers would have been nice. 

My experience was great and I would visit again."
4,"Met a friend for lunch. We wanted a place where we could sit and talk for a long period of time and not feel guilty about depriving someone else of a table. Not looking for gourmet food. We were looking for a clean restaurant with good food at reasonable prices. We got everything we wanted at Denny's. I had the senior menu fit omelet. Under $10, under 500 calories, very filling, and delicious. Our server was very attentive and very friendly. A perfect fit for what we wanted for a lunch."
4,Great tasting food with good service. Only set back is the pricing. It's cheaper to buy a fully loaded bagel.
4,"Came here for a shellac manicure and basic pedicure after being shell shocked by the prices for salons around the Capitol. (I'm use to higher prices in Chicago but I refuse to pay 90-100$ for a mani/pedi) I was pleasantly surprised by this nail salon. It was nicely decorated, extremely clean, and professional. Though located in a small strip mall next to copps it still has a peaceful and quiet vibe and the staff was friendly. Onto the services: the shellac manicure was great and is still going strong and chip free 10 days after. The pedicure was average and the only reason I deducted a star from my review because after getting home I still had dead skin on my heels and a few rough spots. I guess if you want more callous removal you have to pay for one of the more expensive pedicure treatments. Overall definitely come here for a great shellac manicure but I might look elsewhere for a more decent spa pedicure."
4,"Coaltrane's is a great new addition to Plaza. Very, very similar to Viva Chicken with a few differences on their menu. My only recommendation for ownership is to cut back on the amount of salt and speed up the service. I waited about 25 minutes for my meal. Try the char-grilled steak - good stuff!"
4,"This reviews pertains to brows only. I came here on a Sunday, which was my first time here. A few things to note:

- conveniently located in shopping center in Dilworth
- threading is walk-in only (no appointments)
- there was one woman working, but she worked quickly and was amazing!!
- cost is $12 + tip (25% off on Mondays!)

I definitely am going to check out their facial services as they use Dermatologica products."
4,"This franchise has become our dining spot/chain of choice, particularly when we're in ""default"" mode - and why not?  Yes there's often a line during the lunch and dinner rush hours, and 'intimate' is not the first word you'll think of (i.e., take your boy-/girl-friend some other place for a romantic VD-type dinner), but the food is usually of decent quality.  Prices have slowly crept up, even when one's mindful of the difference in exchange rate between CAD and USD, but it's still pretty good value, as portions are usually large.  Service can be spotty when they get busy, but on this visit, it was good."
4,"I have been waiting for this place to open and I am so glad it is right before summer hits. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend opening day but made a point to show my support the following day. 

Inside is relatively small, enough to fit maybe 4 small groups and a few more since there are chairs along the wall. It was very clean, which is always a plus. 

I ordered the fruit addict ($5.50 plus tax $5.93) and in a few minutes my order was ready. I took a sip of the coconut milk on its own and thought it was too bland, however, once I mixed everything up and took a bite... it hit the spot on sweetness. It took me back to, driving to get chè in Garden Grove... Oh how I miss home. I typically only get this treat when I go home and visit-maybe once a year. 

When I had my daughter and my parents came out to visit, I told my mom she needed to open a chè shop in this same exact plaza because there isn't one and she literally laughed in my face. Low and behold, almost 4 years later and the one and only chè shop is open in the East Valley. See mom, I sometimes know what I am talking about LOL! 

I believe this place is here to stay! I wish much success. I can't wait to come back."
4,"I had the sweet Mongolian beef on udon noodles. I paid for extra meat, and there was a ton. It was pretty good, and the food came out quickly. So, if you're on lunch you should be good. I will be back to try some other other items."
4,"I had the Banderita  burrito and it was amazing, a party for my mouth. The best chile roja EVER! I've never been disappointed with Ricardo's. The carnitas torta is scrumptious, too. It gets crowded at lunch but you'll be able to find a seat.
Try it! If you enjoy authentic Mexican food, you'll love this. The salsa bar has some fabby sides, my fave is the onions. They're brown, sautéed a little, very tasty. Remember: you're going for the food, not the ambiance.
It's about the art of food cooked with passion!"
4,"Honeygrow is my go to place when I don't feel like cooking dinner, but want a home cooked meal.  I've been here more a few times and the staff is always really friendly.
I've only ordered stir fry, and love the freshness of the ingredients!
You can order a stir fry from the menu ($7.99 - $10.99), or customize your entree's ingredients.  This is my favorite way to order.  
My favorite stir fry has egg white noodles with the red coconut curry sauce and a kitchen sink of veggies with chicken.  Please note that the price can really climb if you go too crazy!....The portion size is perfect for dinner.
You won't be disappointed with your yummy bowl of tastiness, Enjoy!"
4,"Ate here with some friends from out of town and it was an overall decent experience! We came in on a Saturday night around 715, and were able to get sat in the dining room within about 25 minutes. The first thing I noticed was that the prices were very reasonable! I ordered a hibachi chicken dinner for $14.95 and it came with soup, salad, shrimp, fried rice, a large portion of sautéed vegetables, and chicken with teriyaki sauce. Their ginger sauce is AMAZING. They also have seemingly the best sliced ginger I've ever had at a sushi place. My friends all ordered sushi rolls and their selection of specialty rolls was impressive, as well as their classic and basic rolls. Our server seemed slightly overwhelmed and frazzled (not uncommon on a busy night), but was still friendly and made sure we got everything we needed! 

Overall the atmosphere was great, and we had a lot of fun. We even made friends with the people in the booth next to us! They did a good job with the decor in keeping with the Sumo theme. I recently moved to Madison and this was my first time going out for sushi/hibachi, and I will definitely be back!"
4,"The atmosphere is lavish, the food is pretty top notch, I had the steak Neptune and escargots, boyfriend had the baby back ribs for appetizer (the weren't fall off the bone but still tasty) and the rib eye bone in was delish. Garlic bread is very good. The service was really great our waiter was attentive and personable. The only things they were missing was that extra touch that Peters Fine Dining offers (asking if it's a special occasion and doing something to celebrate it and of course the rose) for those that have been, you know what I'm talking about."
4,"Stopped in to Coaltrane's for a Wednesday night dinner around 7 p.m.  You order from the counter - the ladies working were very helpful in explaining the menu and the various sauce options.  

We went with 2 salads and added chicken to both.  I got a side of the salsa verde (mint and jalapeno - not spicy, very yum!) and my husband got a side of all three hot sauces (he said they weren't overly hot, but they were tasty).  The chicken was good and the salads fresh and crisp.  They were delivered to our table very quickly.  

We had our pick of tables...because we were literally the only customers in the restaurant.  We opted to sit upstairs on the outdoor patio - it was a nice feel, but a bit lonely.  We were told this place gets quite busy on music trivia nights...

Overall, the food and service were great.  This will be a repeat for a quick, casual dinner."
4,"Very, very nice salon. I've had some hair disasters in the past couple months and shine salon made me believe in hair styling again :) I saw Brett who is a few weeks new to shine salon (although not new to hair styling) and he worked a miracle on the coloring by restoring the brunette coloring I had back to the blond I desired. He listened to my story about the issues I recently had with the coloring and he found a way to achieve what I wanted while keeping in tact the integrity of my hair. He spent hours upon hours on my appointment and had patience throughout.  Although I do admit it was pretty expensive for the corrective coloring I desired, I think it was worth it to get amazing results. The other stylists were helpful to him as it was a time intensive process and chipped in to help it along. Overall this salon had a friendly atmosphere and if I was going to be in the area longer, unfortunately I'm moving, I'd be going back for a long long time. From what I saw of the other stylists all their clients left happy and everyone seemed to enjoy their experience as well. If you need something specific for your hair or if you have a vision for your coloring try Shine Salon and Brett."
4,"First time here. Great service (thanks Brittany). The Frisco Bowl was delish and the flank steak had great flavor. Would have  given it 5 stars had the steak not been over cooked, making it a little dry and tough. I'd ordered it rare. Too hungry to send back but I know they would have replaced it had I asked. Good sized portions too! Prices reasonable. Do check it out!"
4,"4.5 - I really wish Yelp implemented a half-star system. 
I was driving home from work today as usual and I noticed its big red sign. I always take that route and I have no idea why I haven't noticed it before lol. It looked like a fancy mansion so I got curious and decided to check it out.
The restaurant is beautiful. It sort of has a nice cozy home-ish feel, as well as a church-y feel. Fancy old school style. Also there is a doorman and complimentary valet parking! :) 
The garlic bread served is heavenly. I asked for a second basket because it was SO amazing. I tried not to fill my tummy with the bread before our main but couldn't stop myself!!! :(
I know this is a steakhouse but we (two people) got a seafood platter for two and two glasses of wine. The platter says market price on the menu which turned out to be $185. And it was so worth it! Such huge shrimp, scallops, crab legs, and lobster!!! Super chunky! Drool! The garlic butter to dip your food in was just perfect! I couldn't believe how big the portion was. We weren't sure whether to get an appetizer or not, and the server said the portion of the platter is big and won't disappoint, and it sure did not! We couldn't finish it so we asked for the leftover to be packed to go. The platter also came with some veggies (asparagus, zucchini, and cauliflower) as well as two sides of choice. We got rice and mashed potatoes. Fries and baked potatoes were other available side options. The sides were okay - didn't stand out as much as the seafood. As we were super full, we had to skip on dessert. 
The service was great too - attentive, friendly, and knowledgable of the wine and food. 
The bill came to almost $300 with tax and tip, which I think is a bit higher than the average prices here, but what can I do? I love seafood! A LOT of seafood! 
I definitely recommend this restaurant, especially for a special occasion. I think it is a safe spot for a fancy dinner. I know I will be back - I had a very pleasant time!"
4,"Every time I have been here (about 10 times now) my food is consistently spot on. I give 4 stars because there's always an issue with seating (dirty tables, employees taking up whole tables while it's busy, and just a general lack of design when it comes to fitting in enough useful seating to begin with). I'd say just anticipate that you may not be able to sit inside so you're not disappointed."
4,"I really like it!  Here's what's good:

- I love the order kiosks. The touch-screen system is easy to navigate. I'm not rushed and I can order my food exactly like I like it. 

- The food is delicious.  It's full of flavor. I like the roast pork noodle bowl, but I will try others soon. 

- It's a nice little space to hade a seat and enjoy a meal. It's clean and light, if a bit cramped in regard to how the tables are spaced out. But it's kind of a community eating space, so make a friend."
4,"Eat fresh. Eat local. Eat healthy. All great goals for 2018. And honeygrow checks all the boxes. Basically a sleek fast-casual, farm-to-table joint. Located in the ever changing and gentrifing East Liberty, this new spot offers diners unmatched customization via kiosk (or mobile app) of MTO stir fry, salads, fruit cups (aka honeybars) and cold-pressed juices. I appreciate the level of detail that went into the touch screen menu, which made meal customization more transparent and easy to accomplish. However, less tech savvy folks may find themselves a bit overwhelmed and the overall user experience cumbersome -- if one of the kiosks is down, it can take awhile to order during peak times. Nonetheless, the wait time during this visit was reasonable. More importantly, the food was delicious! Fresh, quality ingredients simply taste better. Your palate will thank you, but your wallet may not depending on how custom you made your meal. I was also delighted to see non-Coke/non-Pepsi products available at the fountain...Maine Root FTW! The sleek, minimalistic interior design was open, bright and inviting though a little more seating wouldn't be a bad idea. And a friendly staff is always a welcome change. Lots to love at hg, so I look forward to future meals here!"
4,"Liked this place for healthier fast food.

 For a vegan, at least you can have a good look/read through what is available and make choices for a totally custom dish or modify other offerings. 

Fast, fresh & good portion sizes. 

My DH is mostly vegan but will have butter from time to time and had a thai style dish, I created my own salad - of course. 

Both good & filling. They have TOFU. 

Staff at the time we visited was VERY upbeat & the place was clean. If I am in a rush and in that area I would definitely go back again."
4,"All you can eat buffet.  Major yum.  The dinner buffet has different dishes than at lunch.    The dinner is better if you like shrimp and squid.  And I love shrimp and squid. One of my favourite buffets - everything is made fresh.  And their sushi is of respectable quality.  I would rate their sushi 7/10; it's not just good but very good; but not excellent; but hey the price is right.  You have to eat all you order or they charge you a surcharge for everything you didn't eat which I think is fair to avoid waste and to keep prices reasonable.  I like their garden salad, salmon sashimi, unagi sushi, ikayaki which is grilled squid (aka calamari), and their shrimp tempura.  Although their waitresses don't speak perfect english, they are helpful and efficient which is great in my books.  If you have the buffet I would highly recommend you go at least with one other person for their buffet, so you get a better variation; ideally 3 or 4."
4,"Ate here during the soft-opening. If it wasn't the soft opening, it would have been 3 stars.

They had messed up my salad order and didn't bring the food out at the same time, and then just couldn't get the dressing down right so I just ate the salad as was.

Decent flavors. 

Unimpressed with the stuffed avocado and the boy didn't love the quinoa too much.

Definitely going to try the wings next time, those looked dynamite.

Saying there is a ""patio"" space is a bit of a stretch. There's about 2 seats, maybe 3 at the bar, and a couple of tables so not exactly the spot where you'd go grab a cold one on a patio somewhere when the weather is nice."
4,Service is fast. Food quality is consistent with other Congee Queen branches. And there is an option to reserve a spot for the family to avoid waiting in line.
4,"Having grown up in Vancouver, I love me some good Chinese food. Imagine my devastation when I moved to Toronto and discovered that my expectations needed to be adjusted way down! It's almost like you're forced to pick 2 out of 3 attributes: cheap, delicious, or clean. It's such a rarity to find all 3 in one restaurant.

That is, until I came across Congee Queen! For those not familiar, this is not a place that just sells congee! Their menu is vast and includes a variety of rice/noodle/congee dishes, as well as barbecued meats and traditional Chinese dishes. Their prices are very reasonable, given the quality of food you are getting. You can definitely find cheaper Chinese food, but you usually get what you pay for...

While the Centrepoint Mall location is not the first one I've tried, it's definitely one of the best. I believe it's the newest one of the chain, and it's very spacious with many large tables to accommodate bigger groups. The staff are not particularly warm and friendly, but this is on par with what you would expect at most other Chinese restaurants (unfortunately). The only other drawback to this location is that their drinks (in particular, their HK-style milk tea) is not as smooth and delicious as the Kennedy/Sheppard location. Milk tea enthusiasts take note!

Nonetheless, this location offers free delivery on orders above $25 for as far south as Yonge/Sheppard. A great place to dine-in or take out for any occasion!"
4,"Been driving past here for almost a year, so I decided to finally stop in for dinner. It was a Saturday night, but my party of two was seated right away. I had the Rainbow roll, Alaskan roll, and Hollywood roll, and my father had the chicken hot pot. The rainbow roll was phenomenal with multiple flavors that made each bite unique. The Alaskan roll and the Hollywood roll were not all that special but enjoyable all the same. My fathers hotpot was the biggest surprise. When it came out, it looked very small and bland, but after a few bites it was anything but (the portion is very deceiving). Contrary to other reviewers, I had wonderful service with multiple visits from the staff for refills and dish clearing. Definitely will come back to try some other things on the menu."
4,"The wait at the door took 15 minutes but I guess the service made up for it. I was quite impressed at how quickly the orders came to our table. So far, this location is better overall compared to Congee Time which is nearby and the food had more flavour. As for the interior, they have an odd mixture of decor and I guess they attempted to aim for a fancier restaurant compared to other congee places. All in all, much cleaner than other congee locations with a tad loud but still casual atmosphere. I guess if I have to go back to a congee restaurant, it'll be this one for now."
4,"So the big sumo wrestlers at the front entrance? You're gonna look just like that if you eat the hibachi here too often. The fried rice is full o' butter, salt, sesame seeds and other naughty goodness. It was the highlight of an already very good meal. Considering they haven't had their grand opening yet, that's saying a lot.

Sumo has taken a dingy Old Towne Buffet and turned the space into a really beautiful salute to Japanese style. It's modern and fun with tradition still in place. I can't even believe this is the same space. I mean, the floors aren't sticky and the lighting is great. Really well done.

We will be back to try the sushi. If you do hibachi at dinner, plan on taking home a box full of food for the next day. It still smelled delicious when we were bringing it in from the car."
4,"Went during the soft opening but visited again today so I could officially provide a review. Ordered #3 and #10 ~$10 for both. The #3 Awesome Trio was pretty tasty but very heavy (red and white beans). The #10 that my wife had was actually my favorite as it had a great combination of jelly, tapioca and grass jelly. It had this unique crunch that reminded me of water chestnuts. Overall happy to see that Bambu opened up in Arizona but the one thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is the price. For the size of drink you get the price seemed high. I'll likely still return but just not as often ;)"
4,"Spicy DanDan noodles are my favorite. Samosa are NOT good, do not order them. Way too much flour & potato filling does not have much flavor. Besides the samosas, place is clean, friendly employees & dandan is perfect."
4,"I recently moved from Atlanta to Charlotte and discovered Idolize through Yelp!- Where I find all my favorite places.
This Dilworth spa is opposite where I work and near one of my most frequented coffee shops. I had called to make an appointment and booked with Jane to have a facial done, and eyebrow threading . As I walked in I was impressed with layout and cleanliness of the spa.

I don't often get facials but my time with Jane was excellent. She explained what I could do to improve my skin and described what was causing the blackheads that would often pop up. My skin came up bright and refreshed and I noticed a few days later that I was glowing even more. The environment where the facial was performed was clean and calming with nice peaceful music.

Later I decided on the Brazilian waxing service that I was quite frightful of, but she told me that she would make the experience as least painful as possible. She was right! I was actually laughing in pain but either way it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. She told me once I completed this service I would be hooked, I think she might be right.

I finalized my beauty trip with getting my eyebrows threading with Ila, she was fast and experienced and made my eyebrows looks clean and shapely.

I would definitely recommend this spa as one that is upscale, clean and friendly."
4,"Such a fan. It's a rather new ""chain"" but don't let that word fool you, this place delivers quality food that makes you forget it's a chain. You have a basic choice of salads, stir fry, juice (good juice) and honey granola fruit bowls. I have never had a bad meal here. At work, this is a once a week stop for the office. You can build your own salads or stir fry's, OR you can choose to have one they have built for you. Either way, you won't be let down. This restaurant went from 13 to 26 shops within a year. They doubled in growth and there's a reason for it."
4,"Hibachi is a favorite for our family, we were all delighted with our dinner.  Service was fast and friendly.  The chef was entertaining and interactive with the kids.  Most importantly the food was delicious!! We are excited to have a new place that we can frequent without a crazy wait time.  The only reason I gave four stars is that there was a patron that had very limited view of the grill at our table.  Watching the chef is a big part of the experience.  We will be back and next time I want to try some sushi."
4,"The women who do the eyebrow threading here are just lovely. Quick, friendly service. They'll do the best shape with what you've got, so if you're trying to grow out your brows to even them out, be sure to tell them, because they're not going to ask."
4,Stuff had great attitude and was really helpful. Food came out hot and on time. Dinner was in good clean conditions.
4,"The Octagon is a really beautiful restaurant, with lots of stained glass and wood paneling.  It feels really old school, or like a steakhouse from a movie.  The atmosphere is upscale but very cozy and nice.

Our food was excellent.  My husband ordered the rib eye, and he said it was one of the best steaks he has ever eaten.  

I am a vegetarian.  We came to the Octagon because it was my husband's birthday and I am an awesome wife.  I was expecting to order a salad and maybe a few vegetable sides for dinner, but the waiter offered to put together a veggie plate for me.  It was EXCELLENT! It was heaped with broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, julienned peppers, a roasted tomato, grilled mushrooms, and a baked potato.  I am sure that no one is reading this review because they are curious about the vegetarian options at a steakhouse, but I cannot emphasize enough how thrilled I was with my dinner.  I didn't even have to eat the emergency granola bar I had in my purse.

This would have been a 5-star review if it wasn't for the service.  It seemed a little...uneven.  I noticed that other tables regularly had their water glasses refilled or the crumbs scraped from the table cloth.  Our waiters came by to take our orders and deliver the food, but that was all.  The waiters were polite and professional, but not warm or friendly, or particularly attentive.  I might not have noticed if it wasn't for the calibre of service I saw at some of the other tables.

Overall, I would still recommend the Octagon for a special occasion dinner.  Hopefully you will have better luck with the wait staff."
4,"Note: this is a casual dining experience. There are no waiters and waitresses. It's just like Viva Chicken or Panera except with beer and wine and some other spirits. 

The FOOD is GREAT! Perfect for to-go orders. I hope thy continued to build out that option (there appears to be a walk up window). Tons of healthy options - no seafood option: - chicken, steak and veggie only. I ordered the wings and the Rice Bowl - the Fresca Queso cheese is a shaved fresh queso not a sauce (like at a Mexican restaurant). My friend ordered a salad and it looked amazing. I will
Def be here in the summer on the deck ordering a salad.

If you choose to dine-in, the atmosphere is casual and relaxed. Good for kids, groups of friends that want to eat and chill. There is a small rooftop deck (on the backside) with a small bar. Cute and cozy. Will surly be packed in the summer cause drink prices are reasonable."
4,Never had such a giant bowl of seafood congee before (the house super bowl). It was huge and DELICIOUS! We also had a plate of pad thai that was less than remarkable (but still decent). The service was alright. The food arrived quickly which was nice.
4,"I've had the phó and the banh mí, which no one probably orders since it's not a very well-known dish. (What it is: a vietnamese sandwich with French bread, chicken, carrots, jicama, cucumber, cilantro, more vegetables, optional jalapeño peppers, and chicken with sauce - delicious!) I'm rather impressed with both of them, especially for this place being a fast-food restaurant. They were both really good, and my family makes banh mí homemade, so I can tell you I'm not a novice when it comes to this vietnamese sandwich! 
My father ordered the lemongrass chicken, and I tried it - the spice was not the lame, bland type you usually receive from fast-food. It had considerable heat to it, which I liked. A lot of good flavor! 
Definitely would recommend this place for any casual lunch or dinner. Very reasonable prices for great tasting food!"
4,We had a great time and enjoyed our hibachi meals. The kiddos rank Herman as our best ever hibachi chef.
4,"I, too, was the victim of a bad color job done elsewhere. . . 

A friend suggested I go to her hairstylist at SHINE to attempt a ""fix."" CHRISTINA totally delivered and then some! I was extremely pleased with the results and have decided she is officially now ""my girl"" . . . I just want back for my second appt last night. She is a master at color and cut!

The only reason that I'm not giving four stars is the price (hey, a girl can dream, can't she?) but the prices are fair and you really do get what you pay for :-)."
4,Always busy and worth the wait! I love the made to order touch screen and being able to see your food prepared. The watermelon and beet cold pressed juice is also amazing.
4,"I've been here a few times the food is fantastic the place is clean and you can't go wrong with $13.99 all you can eat lunch and even dinner is only $19.99 The food is absolutely delicious but the service is shit, that's why there's one star off and also because we went this Monday at 11:30am but they opened the doors at noon we thought we were mistaken but even the sign on their door said 11:30am. It's a nice location and it's so worth it. 

Note: take it easy on the tempura stuff the portions are crazy huge."
4,"Great old school steak house. Older traditional waiters standing on the outskirts reacting to your slightest raised eyebrow. I hate asking for more water or being disturbed when its actually being topped up...not here. The staff know what they are doing at the Octagon.
Shrimp cocktail, the way it should be. The made at your table ceasar salad you'll find no better. The steak done the way you ask. 
Old school, not really any flare - except for the made at your table ceasar salad and pepper corn sauce but if that's that you want. The Octagon does nothing wrong"
4,Great place the tacos were stale I must have came on a bad day. Ill try it again tho.
4,"honeygrow is an awesome new addition to the burgh! It's a great lunch spot with pretty speedy turn around! Ordering at the kiosks makes the process quick and efficient and gives the customer total control over how their meal is prepared! I did custom built salad and it was delicious! Unfortunately, it was also $11. I wants to try their fresh juices, but that was another $6, so I had to forgo that choice or it becomes a really pricey lunch! 

All in all, I'll definitely be back soon! I love a healthy option that's close by. Just be cautious of parking. It's on S Highland right by Penn Ave so it can be a little tricky. Try to snatch a spot on a nearby side street!"
4,"Boba is great and fresh! The selection is just right.however they take wayy too long for a drink long enough to where i had time to sit and get impatient enough to write a review. If youre not in a rush to get somewhere then stop in but if youre on break and need a quick boba, then you did yourself a favor by reading my review."
4,Service was excellent and attentive and things came fast and when needed. Steaks were cooked perfectly though I wonder if they were aged or not as menu doesn't say ? I think the fries were not good though. They tasted like as if they were frozen before.  Caesar salad was Yummy though overdressed but still Yummy and garlicky. I'd say the menu needs a serious update though with attention to more innovative sides and they might want to consider changing the fries.
4,"Fresh sushi.  You get a checklist and check off all the stuff you want to eat.  It tasted pretty good for an all you can eat.  I liked the sushi pizza.


Beware, you have to pay the menu price for items you do not eat.  I do not mind this.  In fact, I encourage it.  Charge double.  People need to realize that food isn't free, and if you don't like it, it isn't an excuse not to eat it (think eating at your own house).  Only time it is acceptable is if it is not fresh.

Overall, I liked it."
4,"Stopped in here a few times since it opened. Have only been for lunch.  This used to be a Long John Silvers, so it has a somewhat unusual layout.  All things considered, they did a nice job with the remodel. 

Every time I go, I get the combo plate which is two tacos, fries, coleslaw, and a drink.

My go to is the Wipeout taco (steak, shrimp, fries) and the killer shrimp taco. 

I think I would like the restaurant a little more if it was a fast casual restaurant instead of sit down. Food has all been very good and service is quick and attentive.  This is a great addition to the area."
4,"Lobster chow mein is a must try here. Generous portion enough for two people. Duck BBQ is also freshly made and good. Servers are nice enough. 
I enjoy this place. All foods here are good. Big menu so there is always things to try out. 
Totally recommended!"
4,"Carne asada burrito, tasty and filling, served with side of chips, under $6 for most burritos. Salsa bar with various salsas and marinated carrots, onion, jalapeno, garlic. Hidden in a strip mall, near the Del Taco in the Home Depot area. Pick up your day workers and lunch too."
4,Stopped by here because of the overwhelming positive reviews and wasn't disappointed! This will be my new eyebrow threading spot. My stylist was super knowledgeable and made sure to take care of every stray hair. I felt as though she made sure to take her time to make my brows perfect. Eyebrow threading is $12 here. Will be back!
4,"Great customer service.  Places are very nice and comfortable.  Walking distance to drug stores, restaurants and other amenities like spa, fitness, etc.  Enjoyed our time there.  Close to the strip, but far enough to have peace and quiet.  Shuttle service to strip is nice too."
4,"Fish tacos here are great! Decent prices for Mexican food.

Only reason they don't get 5 stars from me is that the salsa isn't great. It has heat but not much for taste.

I would definitely recommend them. The staff seems good and food quality is consistent."
4,"Recently I needed to get my nails fixed before going to a wedding for the week. I was unsure where to go and wanted to go on my way home which was around 5pm. They got me in quickly and there were multiple polish colors for me to choose from!! 

The only reason they are not receiving 5 stars is because even though they were very welcoming and quick the lady constantly talked in her other language with a co worker and continuously kept laughing. This made not only me a little uncomfortable but also  the lady next to me who even gave a look as if she couldn't believe what was happening."
4,I have only been for breakfast and man it is delicious! Their breakfast sandwiches are little pockets of yummy! They are sealed up with all of the ingredients inside which keeps them really hot and the combo includes tater tots. Definitely one of my favorite quick breakfasts by work. The only reason why they get 4 stars and not 5 is that they aren't that quick. If you have the time to wait in the drive thru for a few minutes then definitely stop here because it is well worth the wait instead of the crummy fast food joints all around here. Loco Moco breakfast is my favorite!
4,"This is a great Denny's. Food is great, service is friendly and usually very good."
4,"I've gone from blonde to black back to blonde then to red.... I get bored quick! I move around a lot so I'm always having to find a new local go-to spot. James did a full highlight and ""glaze"" to lighten my roots. It came out exactly how I wanted it! From the beginning of the appointment to the end he was making sure I was comfortable and making sure he could do anything and everything to get me to my hair goal. He suggested a cut and I jokingly told him I cry when even an inch comes off (even tho that's true) so he said we should wait.

Great stylist with a great personality. The whole salon had a great personality too. The only reason for the 4 not 5 is the price. Way more than I would expect to pay (more than I've paid in NYC) but I will go back for James :)"
4,"My parents, my uncle, and I all needed a place to stay when we were in town for an anniversary party, so we ended up here. Basically, we were only going to stay one night, because my uncle had to get home the next morning for a party he was throwing and my parents and I had to leave town a few hours afterward due to Sunday night traffic and the weather (it called for a slight chance of snow on our route).

Basically, another one of those no-frills hotels I stayed at for a night or two. Breakfast was amazing, as was the view of the Strip from my room. They also had lapdesks for laptops in the room, which I wanted to smuggle out of the room.

However, I had two cons with this hotel, and they are -

1. The Strip is farther away than what the photos say. It took us about fifteen to twenty minutes to get to the Strip from the hotel.

2. There's nothing else to do in the immediate are besides go to the park across the street. And why would I go to a park when I go to Las Vegas?"
4,"I was super excited to try this new place since my go-to drink spot is Boba Tea House. I tried the fruit addict and really enjoyed it! The blend of different fruits and jellies with coconut milk is super refreshing and not too sweet. My favorite thing by far is the strawberry fresh fruit tea! It's so delicious! The tea itself isn't very sweet, but the fresh strawberry on the bottom with the basil seeds is sweet enough to balance the whole drink out. 
The tapioca balls were not nice and chewy, but more on the mushy side. Because of that I would stay away from the boba and stick to their speciality drinks and teas."
4,"I'm all about service as much as, if not more than, the food. The food was good - nothing fancy here. I would like to give a shout out to our server, Marissa. She was super nice and attentive with us. In a word: awesome. Thank you, Marissa!"
4,Walked in to this spot instead of panda and ordered 2 fish tacos being taco Tuesday I figured I'd eat tacos and to my surprise the tacos were really good only down fall was the tortillas could have been warmed up a bit more but hey this spot was worth would have given it a 5 star if the tortillas were a bit warmer but all in all I'll be coming back soon to have some more fish tacos and maybe just maybe try something else on the menu
4,"The food is pretty good here,  the employees are friendly and the service given is great."
4,"On a whim we decided to try their sushi one night. Overall, the food was really good. They did put more sauce on the sushi than I personally care for, but that might have been the rolls we ordered. The fried scallops appetizer was awesome! I highly recommend it. We will definitely be back for the sushi and want to try the hibachi too."
4,"First impression after exciting the elevator on the second floor, I was worried. Wide, empty, soiled carpet and marred walls.

Entered the room and forgot all about what I'd just come from.

Spacious. The room would serve well as a descent studio apartment. Everything needed and expected given the rate was available.

The lobby was adequate. The free breakfast was better than most.

There's nothing nearby to walk to but the neighborhood was better than most given its proximity to the airport."
4,"Classy place. Old-school appointments and traditional steak-house fare.

I went there for lunch and service was good. Not fast, not slow, not rushed, just fine.

The onion soup was wanting. It is not a signature dish.

I had the tomato salad, which was okay -- good portion and fresh.

Also had the pepper steak, lunch portion, which was excellent. It came as a New York, very peppered, very juicy, perfectly cooked medium, with a lot of pepper sauce as well.

The garlic mash was good with the sauce, but a bit weak on its own.

Overall I'd come back for dinner. Classy place.

Lunch  less than 50 for one before tip."
4,"So having eaten here 4 times now I feel I can accurately review Jimmy Hula's as a whole.  
To begin with the food is amazing (sans one incident that was corrected by the amazing owner).  Some of the best fish tacos I have ever had and growing up in southern California that is saying something.  The pineapple mango salsa is to die for and I now always order an extra side of it.   The sweet potato fries and zucchini fries are perfectly crispy and the dipping sauces take it to a whole new level.  The only negative I do have is about the service and not from the wait staff but from the kitchen; it is slow and frequently they mix up orders.  Most recently my husband and I both ordered 2 tacos and one of my tacos was on his plate but not the end of the world as we just switched them.  
If you are in a hurry I wouldn't stop in but if you have some time to sit, relax, and enjoy the ambiance this place won't disappoint."
4,"They have a huge selection of beers. We got the big pretzel and it was ginormous and really yummy. The shrimp cocktail was really good...good size shrimp and the cocktail sauce had the perfect amount of horseradish. We also had the chicken wings...perfect amount of heat. Our server, Joany was awesome...super nice and friendly. We might go back tomorrow for the fish and chips, which I heard is really good"
4,"This is a stir fry sort of place where you walk up to a kiosk screen, pick all your ingredients and pay, and then everything's prepared and brought to you within a few minutes. It's not cheap (a typical bowl will cost you around $10-14), but the ingredients are super fresh and I never felt like the meal was a waste, or too small. I wouldn't eat here all the time for obviou$ reasons, but it's certainly a good option for a night out or a special, fresh meal."
4,"Cute, clean little place. I always order the same #1. Dessert is more on the sweeter side so I request less sweetened. Nice customer service."
4,"Decided to try this new place out when visiting a friend in Madison. It seemed to be one of the very few Sushi places in the city. It was very busy when we walked in but they got us in after about 15-20 minutes. When we sat down we ordered edamame right away and that got to us pretty quick. It was delicious (pretty hard to mess up edamame). My friend ordered chicken hibachi which came out pretty quick but my other friends and I's rolls took quite a while. We assumed the sushi bar was pretty backed up because of how busy it was. But the rolls were delicious! 

I could tell our server couldn't understand everything we were saying but was pretty good still and attentive. 

The restaurant had two areas, hibachi and regular restaurant. 

Place GREAT for groups and families.  The space has great ambiance and has a very authentic feel. I will go again."
4,"A decent experience taking slow service into consideration lool
We came in a group of 10 with reservation at 7pm but regardless we arrived 5 min earlier, we were still kept waiting for 15 minutes before being seated. Ordered 12 dishes in total :D 
Love their sweet sour chicken, I know it sounds like a white peoples dish but as someone grew up in China, we do have such dish in canto region and Congee queen makes it real legit I.e. Not the one you usually get at food court, much better 
Tried their seaweed and crab meat salad, refreshing  as we have had many meat dishes, will order again :) 
Other thumbup: turnip patties- man you have to get this one, it's my must order here.. even my friend who doesn't like turnip loves it, it tastes better with their hot sauce ;) also, salt pepper pork chop is very yummy too heehee 
Average: disappointed at BBQ duck! So slim that it's  basically skin attached bones!! No meat! Where's my juicy meaty BBQ duck!?!? Also the two fried rice were average.. we ordered one salmon and one eel, tasted pretty much the same loool and the chicken congee is disappointing too, it's the ""special"" one with many fancy ingredients.. I'd recommend going for the traditional/ basic congee which is more original and flavourful in my opinion (basically the cheaper one at the bottom of the menu) 
10 people, 20 bucks each including tax and tips, not bad at all! Will def. come back again and again lol"
4,"Well...revising my previous...was disappointed to learn today that the personal service of taking your order at your table that they offered when they opened has been cancelled....they are trying to act more lile a fast food chain versus a resturant....food still awesome....just disappointed with the reduced/elikinated personal service....they will dedinately see reduced tips as wwll because who tips for no service.

Still worth a try however"
4,"Good place for a bite to eat in Vegas. Food was excellent, but with the typical Vegas higher price tag. Would recommend for lunch or just to stop in for a drink. Atmosphere is casual and somewhat noisy but the place is not for quite dinner, it's more for groups getting together to have a good drink, great food, in a friendly atmosphere."
4,"Unusual experience on the service end. We arrived shortly after they opened at 11am. Guy took our food and drink order. Did not write anything down. Drinks were brought out to us but kitchen worker came out and asked how my husband wanted his build his own ""kahuna""burger. Then when my husband's food was brought out, I had to ask about the fish tacos I ordered! They were then brought out-and were delicious! Great blackened fish, flavorful slaw and sauces, generous portions, coleslaw really good with cilantro flavoring. Husbands burger and fries were good but they failed to provide the cheese he requested. Good beer and margaritas. Drinks reasonably priced and they made the errors tolerable by giving us a free round of drinks. Later server Dezmond F. was a super worker!"
4,Had takeout from this Congee Queen the other day. We  were very impressed. Much better than the Laurance and  Steels locations. Will come back to this location  rather than the others ones
4,"Offspring #2 and I recently popped in for some Hibachi fun!! Offspring is a veteran of this local establishment, but this was my maiden voyage!! I was a bit surprised as we walked into the somewhat kitchy entrance, as it felt like it was a detractor to the sweet idea of Hibachi. Once into the dining room, it was pretty sweet and we were seated at a ginormous table with a delightful young couple on a date night. Having no clue as to what to expect...I gleefully ordered a Sapporo and Hibachi Salmon, while Offspring ordered the Hibachi Shrimp. It was so cool to watch each step of preparation to the final product from our table-dedicated Chef! And I was in no way prepared at the expected participation of catching a flipped broccoli IN MY MOUTH! Say whaaaat???? Gasp...this was stepping waaaay out of my comfort zone but was fairly hysterical to Offspring. And of course, the first piece bounced off my face...just sweelllllll... After three attempts, and a lot of laughter, I gave up and so did the Chef (THANK GOSH!!!). Both shrimp and salmon dishes were fab, with half left over for lunch and I am most certainly coming back!!!"
4,Nice and reasonably priced for pedicures. Very sanitary with tub liners and pumice/emery boards that are disposable. Relaxing and enjoyable. The pedicure chairs are definitely the very best massage chairs I've ever sat in with upper and lower massage.
4,Have been coming here for over 10 years but the last trip was the last. Their prices have been hiked again and it is no longer worth the money they charge.Shall miss the Octogan and the great food they serve but I will not throw my money.
4,"This became my absolute favorite sushi place when I moved in to Toronto in 2004. However, unfortunately, it became too popular for its own good. Longer line ups, grumpier waitresses and lesser fish quality.
Still a good spot for sushi cravings though, at a very decent price and a perfect location!"
4,"Writing this review because I think this place deserves better ratings. The service is exceptionally friendly, and my pedicures have always been excellent. The one time that I had to rush out the door before my pedicure had fully dried, the owner told me to come back and he'd fix it for free if it smudged. Prices are a little higher than some other places nearby, but I'm happy to pay it for consistent quality and a clean, welcoming salon."
4,"I've dined here about 4 or 5 times over the past 2 years and the value you get is tremendous if you split various dishes for several people.  I usually come here with a group of 4 and the variety of food is impressive from many types of congee dishes, various noodle and rice dishes, dumplings and meat and vegetable dishes.  Every group I've gone with has always been satisfied after a meal which usually around $10 all-in when in a group of four.  The place is fairly clean and generally has a nice decor.  The closest franchise I can compare this to is Congee Time, and I would rate Congee Queen a bit higher since the place appears cleaner.  Service-wise, the place is standard, but to me this is less important than the quality of the food.

Congee Queen offers a excellent amount of variety for groups of people with unique tastes, with above reasonable quality food at excellent value.  If you are just ordering single dishes, you might be underwhelmed.  The key is to order multiple dishes to share amongst a group of 4 or 5 ideally."
4,"Most of all the foods on the menu tastes great , the service portion is lacking but overall a fine place to eat."
4,"Nice Hampton. Close enough to the airport and they offer a free shuttle to the airport and car rental building. They had complementary earplugs available in the room which concerned me at first, however I didn't have a need for them. You got to eat at the Village Pub & Poker which is within walking distance. There is also a seven eleven next door.

Breakfast was what I've come to expect from Hampton."
4,"This is the first Congee Queen that I have visited. I loved the clean modern design complete with several drawings of women in traditional Chinese dress. I noticed a tank with fresh fish as well as a display of BBQ meats. Since I was there alone and portions are generous, I could not try a lot of menu items. I did try the hot and sour soup as well as a seafood with noodles dish. Both were quite good and were very filling. As I do not live close to this restaurant, unfortunately I will not be a regular customer; however, I do want to come back and try some of the BBQ dishes."
4,"Solid sushi restaurant at a reasonable price. Came for dinner. We tried two specialty rolls, the Blue Crab Roll and the Volcano roll. Both were very good and a large size. I'd probably prefer the Volcano over Blue Crab, but you can't go wrong with either. 

The restaurant itself is very nice. Clean, interesting decor and a very friendly staff. The service was great! I will definitely be back."
4,"Best congee place in toronto! We had the queen congee and lobster, only 40 bucks to feed two adult. Love it!"
4,It was my first time getting my brows threaded and I'll def be back! So quick and painless and only $12! The salon is clean and had a very pretty interior. We walked in at around 12pm and it was packed so I suggest making an apt if you're in a rush. New beauty addiction = brow threading! #browsonfleek
4,"I've been frequenting Congee Queen since its inception at the Steeles/404 location, and I'm excited that a new location opened up closer to home! Generally, I've had nothing short of great experiences with the food. Always consistent, delicious, and worth the price. The service however... can be a hit or miss. Sometimes, it takes forever to flag down a server, but when you finally get their attention, they address your needs quickly and right down to the t. The reason as to why I'm giving this review 4 stars instead of the full 5, is because I ordered some takeout last week, and they forgot something in my order, only to find out once I arrived home. This was really disappointing, but I've let it go!"
4,"What a suprise! Read good reviews, but when we pulled up- it had a drive through- not what I was expecting. These were the best fish taco's we had in AZ- (they are HUGE) and they come with fries which is weird, but very American. The teens had burgers and loved them. We did have to ask them to change the music as they had some very offensive rap music on and there were kids in there- but the waitress was happy to do so."
4,"I love going to Denny's for a late night coffee with my sweetheart. Diner food is good, good service and clean."
4,"Reasonable prices for the services and definitely a relaxing atmosphere. I LOVE their pedicure massage chairs! High tech and fully customizable from your seat to your shoulders. Best of all, no crazy acetone or acrylic fumes (which is a huge deal breaker for me at other ""cheaper"" places! I can't enjoy the experience if I'm leaving with a migraine). My bestie and I have even dubbed this our annual ""birthday spa"" place!
Minus 1 star for rarely listening to my request to leave my nails longer (shaped, not cut down). Last time I also had to keep asking them after she was ""done"" to remove the obvious shellac paint she got on my hand and fingertips."
4,"With the loss of Ginza of Tokyo this is a welcome addition to the area!  

Upon walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and ambiance. It's a bit over the top, but that's why it's awesome!  

We got there kind of late, so we were lucky enough to get a hibachi show of our own. These guys are really talented with a knife and spatula!  The act seemed a bit insincere but it was still a lot of fun. 

The food was done perfectly. We enjoyed a fire roll to get us started along with some warm sake. We followed this up with the hibachi shrimp and scallops. The food was really good and there was plenty of have a second round for lunch the next day- total win!

We really enjoyed our experience and the food of Sumo and we are already looking forward to our next visit!"
4,"Been there three times in the last two months on the weekends with an average party of about 8.... and we had a great time! The menu is somewhat extensive with both sushi and non-sushi options. It covers the basics... Generally, I stick to fish, but for those who are not fish lovers there are some nice soups and your typical tempura and meat dishes.  

For lunch, the price for AYCE is $13, which is tremendous value as far as sushi is concerned. Yes, there are a few items obviously missing, don't expect Tuna sashimi or a lot of sashimi for that matter or large shrimp nigiri. But then again, come on, let's be realistic, it's $13. Mind you they do have some shrimp, tuna and some eel makis, which a lot of the AYCE's do not even offer. I am talking of course, about the eel. 

If you go for dinner, I think the price goes up to $20 and of course, with that so does the selection. But for a nice, laid back lunch, you simply cannot go wrong here. 
 
Although I still consider Aji Sai on the low-end price-wise on the sushi totem pole, along Generation Sushi and Sushi On Bloor (meh), I do feel like they are trying to strive for something a bit better. 

No one is going to call this place a full fledged authentic cuisine, it is not, it is however a tasty Japanese simile which is worth having again and again... and for $13 it's great value and at a fraction of what you would pay if you went to an authentic Japanese restaurant. Guu anyone?

It is centrally located and about 3 minutes north of Yonge and Bloor and the decor is simple but straight forward. Also, I have found their service quite good, yes, they do shy a way a bit because like a lot of different Asian restaurants there is always a language barrier among the servers. Also, I think the place is run by Chinese, not Japanese, if that matters to you. I will double check this next time I am there eating my happy heart out."
4,"The food is so good. But sometimes we come, the wait can be obscene. We have been waiting 37 minutes and counting with not much going on in the restaurant. I'm hangry now. 
  
PS I was in food service for 10 years, so i promise I'm not just an ""I wanna speak to your manager"" type.

Update: added a star because I know you guys really care, and I appreciate you gently handling my hangry review. We're going to keep coming back bc the food is so good--especially those wings"
4,"First off, let me say that another reviewers assertion that you're better off going to Panda Express is, in my eyes, way off base. Maybe I've been to the wrong Panda??

I'm super happy about this addition to the area. It's exactly what the area needed - a tasty, healthy, fast Asian food option. I got the Firecracker noodle bowl with chicken, and it was very good. I have to admit that I was mostly curious because of the ""bacon"" aspect, and it wasn't all that prevalent in the dish, but there was plenty of chicken, noodles, and veggies and it was all very good. Spicy-wise, it had a little bit of kick, but not overwhelming. It's nowhere close to ""Thai spicy.""

All in all I'll surely be back to try something else. It was a good amount of food, and I wasn't leaving with a greasy gut-bomb feeling that was going to put me in a food coma going back to work."
4,"I will say that while my purchase experience at this store was great, the fact that I had service needs almost immediately following was disconcerting, but I write this review to say that this store and it's manager Larry took care of the concerns and problems with professionalism. I will definitely recommend them to my friends and family."
4,"We did a lot of comparison shopping on our appliances and found that Spencers had the best prices on our fridge and washer and dryer.  This location's showroom is more spacious than the Mesa location which made it easy to wander around and really get a look at all of our options.  The salespeople were helpful and informative and they were super flexible with delivery.  It was easy to reschedule our delivery date on very short notice (less than 24 hours) when our move hit a bit of a snafu.

I would highly recommend Spencers for appliances.  Their TV selection, on the other hand, is lacking.  That didn't matter to us too much since we weren't in the market for a TV, but with just about 10 TVs on display, I wouldn't say this is the best place to go for variety.

Check them out, get good deals, and support local business. :-)"
4,"Pretty darn good for a place just off the freeway! Two huge breakfast burritos and two drinks for just under $20 is a pretty good deal, especially when they were very big, stuffed burritos. No, they don't skimp here, not at all. Strangely enough I had a burrito with refried beans in it, something I usually hate in anything and everything, but here I actually enjoyed it! Maybe it was because unlike some other places, they didn't insist on filling 95% of the burrito with the stuff, so it was more of a compliment than a main event. The only reason for four stars is that my burrito was supposed to come with sour cream. Small ding but bad luck, I really like sour cream so I missed it. Yes I probably could have asked for it, but it got busy just as soon as I took my first bite, so I figured I could give the woman at the register a break and just let it go. In reality with the nice, pleasant service, the clean place, very decent prices, and the good food, Ricardo's really deserves 4 1/2 stars!"
4,"Was so impressed by this salon. A few friends had suggested this place and now I know why! The level of professionalism begins when you make the appointment and follows all the way through to check out. The salon was clean, organized and quite lovely inside. My stylist was Christina and the color consultation she gave me was the most thorough I've ever had and I felt she really listened. I walked away feeling wonderful and confident and was pleasantly surprised at the quality to price ratio. I can't wait to go back for a haircut. This place would be booked solid for 6 months if in NYC!"
4,"This place was surprisingly good. I didn't want to go thinking it would not be worth my time. We ordered the sumo deluxe, the blue crab sushi roll, steak teriyaki bento box and the orange chicken. Everything was good. Our server was great. No complaints"
4,"My 2nd trip was better than my 1st time. I had an appt both times, but was taken 20 minutes late my 1st time. The nail tech kindly apologized and thanked me for waiting though, so not a deal breaker. Much more timely the 2nd time, but regardless it was a quick service both times! ~30-40 minutes w/o polish to remove and 50 minutes with removal! They do QUALITY shellac that DOES last til you're ready to get a new one! I personally prefer no more than 2 weeks though because I have fast nail growth, but the polish doesn't lift prematurely. Also, they have a reward program via text to sign up for that regulars will benefit from! All in all, not a place you'd go to feel absolutely pampered, but they're friendly and do a nice job! Will continue to go back! :)"
4,"This place is perfect for something quick, easy and yummy. My only problem is I feel seating isn't that great, but they are doing their best with the building's size. I often get annoyed with people around me because you can hear the person's convo beside me clear as day and it's very distracting. I feel like if you were going here for business or a first time date, I would pass because of that. For casual dining, hanging out with friends or going alone? Absolutely though! 

Their selection is pretty decent, I've never received late or cold food and I've always enjoyed what I ordered. I've heard some people complain about how distant or ""rude"" the wait staff might be, but you can tell that they are busy and want to keep the work flow happening. They are thinking about what food goes to what person at what table. I've been there on slow days and busy days, they are always on the move! I wouldn't let that bother you tbh. Would you rather they were chatting it up at another table while you waited for them to finish just so you could order? Probably not :P

I personally like it here, although on busy days it may be a tiny bit of a wait or overwhelming (noise wise). Their bento boxes are well priced and I love going there for all you can eat."
4,This is such a great sushi place with an amazing all you can eat menu. Definetly worth going back to again and certainly not a hole in the wall.
4,"I came here about 2 weeks ago for a mini vacation with some friends. I was a Vegas Virgin at this point and had no idea where this was in location to the strip. But that didn't really matter as this place was so great we hardly left!

The weather was so nice we stayed poolside for 3 days! It wasn't very crowded so getting a spot at the pool based on where the sun was, was very easy (read...we moved when the sun shifted). There are 2 pools both with sand bottoms (only the kiddie end). The pools were warm which was a bummer because I was so hot I would have liked to cool down. There was a wading pool with a waterful which seemed to be the popular kid hangout...i stayed clear from there! Also the hot tub was pretty sweet as well.

The rooms we had we nice. The beds were comfy. We had a suite, so we had a full kitchen, living room area with pull out couch, 2 large bathrooms and 2 bedrooms. It was perfect for us! 

The location was ok food wise. Tahiti is located next to a strip mall, so we were able to get denny's for breakfast, Qdoba for lunch and walgreens for snacks. However...no liqour stores!!!! 

The staff was super friendly and gave us a welcome package. There is also a shuttle that drops you off at the strip but stops running around 11:00pm. Cabs from here to the strip run about $15.

Overall I would come back here. Its serves it purpose and we all left pretty happy!"
4,"If you are 40+ the odds are you will love the place. If you want the ""party-till-u-drop"" type atmosphere, you should stay elsewhere.

One star subtracted because you have to stay around the lobby area for free WiFi (ask for login code at the Front Desk) which is very slow to download. I had to cancel my Apps download after trying for 30 minutes. This should have taken 5 minutes max. I am glad the Front Desk person advised us not to connect to the paid room WiFi service company mentioned in their property book because the service is very unreliable. This saved me that frustration + $10, at least.  AT&T phone service sucks here. Unable to send emails or IMs via an iPhone 4S or 3G. TV has basic channels only. With no room high speed Internet service my DirectTV HBO TOGO service or any TOGO TV service does not work. 

Loved the king size beds and the space. If you like protein for breakfast go someplace else. The AC is literally a ""blast"". In the living room there are 2 large round vents that can not be adjusted. If you sit or sleep on the couch a vent blast the couch, as the AC cycles. B-r-r-r-r! If you adjust the AC to use the couch the bedrooms get hot. If you adjust the AC to get comfy in the bedrooms, the couch area is to cold. We clipped a face towel to the vent using 2 office alligator paperclips to deflect the air stream toward the floor, since the vents do not move. (See my photo). It worked.

Breakfast is a carbohydrate laden affair (big bagels, sweet pastries), strong coffee (Starbucks is next door) and watery juice. I did not see the fruit mentioned by some others. Take the room coffee cups over or you have to use the small Styrofoam cups provided. If your stomach is on east-coast time, the 8AM breakfast start time is to late anyway.

Very nice pools with sand. BBQ area and tools are a nice touch also. The bus transportation to the ""strip"" and a few other casinos is very useful."
4,Went here last night. Very awesome atmosphere. Great bar with unique drinks!  Dinner was great. I love hibachi and have had it in many different states. Fried rice included and was one of the best I have had. Sushi was nice and fresh. The chef and the waitresses were extremely nice. There was a delay with our chef so they gave us a free appetizer which was nice. I didn't care for the sauces. Both were really mayo based. Wish they would have had a ginger soy sauce. Shrimp came out on a teriyaki ish glaze that I would have liked it plain or given the option. But overall very good and same prices as most hibachi places. Would defiantly go back
4,"This review is only for their car park service.

I always park my car here when I'm going out of town...which has been much more frequently within the last year. The front desk is always very friendly and the shuttles to the airport are always pretty prompt. If its a busy time of day with a lot of customers, they always leave on time every 1/2 hour. Sometimes I've had to wait a little longer than I'd like when I land for the shuttle to pick me up, but its never been unreasonable. I also feel like its a much safer parking lot than some of the other hotels near McCarran and I'm never worried about leaving my car there for a long period of time. And if I have a morning flight and breakfast is being served, they always let me eat something before leaving for the day...a great perk!

My only complaint would be for one particular employee who works at the front desk. He's usually there in the early mornings. He always makes me wait 30 mins for the next departing shuttle to the airport even though I get there on the 1/2 hour mark (which the employee I talk to on the phone the previous night instructs me to do) because the ""other guests will be late"". Well the other guests had not even boarded the shuttle yet so I'm not sure why I was asked to wait and take a later shuttle and almost miss my flight!"
4,Went there for the first time with some friends who were raving about it. This place sure lived up to the hype from my friends. I had the JimmyChurri tacos and they were great..the fries that came with the tacos were nicely done as well.  I Highly recommend this place!
4,"Very nice for a busy Saturday morning.  Build your own Grand slam for $6.49 is hard to beat for the portions you get.  I had 2 eggs over med, bacon, hash browns and very nice fresh pancakes.  Server was very helpful.  Service A- Food B+.  Will be back."
4,"This place was actually pretty good. My husband ordered the carne asada burrito and I ordered the veggie burrito; we both enjoyed them. Out of all the sauce options we thought that the green and the medium sauces were the best choices. The only downfall was the MAJOR grammatical mistake on the salsa bar. It reads ""grilled onion's"", ""hot carrot's'"", and ""season onion's"".... fix that fast!!!!!!"
4,"We always enjoy dinner at the Octogon and this visit was no exception. Impeccable service from true professionals with food and ambience that is beyond reproach. Not to be missed is the Caesar salad made from scratch table side and the steaks... my filet was cooked perfectly and excellent quality as always. 

Excellent wine list with many selections that you will not find at your local LCBO. We will definitely be back!"
4,"Tried Sumo last week and I was pretty pleased. I tried a few of the sushi rolls and really enjoyed them. I got the Hollywood roll (avocado, crab, cucumber, and cream cheese), which was my favorite. I also tried the Chicken Tempura roll and the Sea Chicken roll, which were both good. The prices were really reasonable, especially for dinner. Sumo also has a good rice to ingredients ratio when it comes to their rolls. The service was a little weird as we were sitting at the bar and still had to order rolls with the help of our server. At other sushi restaurants I've been to, I typically get to order straight from the sushi chef when I sit at the bar (and the server takes my drink order). Other than that, no complaints. I'm excited to come back for the lunch special, which is pick three rolls (from a selected set of rolls) for $12.95. Very happy to have an affordable sushi place on my side of town."
4,"I was a starvin marvin by the time my friend and I reached Dennys last night.  It was not that busy...a few tables finishing up as we were parkin out butts in the booth. A couple of other new tables. 

Obviously being night time, there was likely 1 cook and like 2 servers. Totally get that. However...service was a tad slow for busting out some breakfast. We only ordered the standard grand slams so it's not like anything had a long cook time.

Waiter was nice though and the food hit the spot. Bacon was nice and crispy.  French toast was just yum... granted I was drunk off my ass and hungry as all hell so I was shoveling that ish down my throat. ;)

The place was clean though and overall...a great Dennys. Id go to this one again."
4,"What a neat place with an unusual name. 

My wife and I were visiting a friend in Pittsburgh and she brought us here for lunch since our hotel was nearby.

The concept at honeygrow is build your own stir fry bowl. You have a touch pad with a clear and easy to understand interface that allows you to select the ingredients you want to prepare your meal with. You don't have to give your order to a person at the register who has to wait for you to make up your mind as you go back and forth with choosing what ingredients to use while a line of people are waiting for you. PRESSURE! Instead, there are multiple touch pads so no one really has to wait to start ordering. 

You have the option of selecting their suggested bowl options that still even allows you to substitute in or out ingredients to your liking or you can try your hand at making your own bowl from the wide list of ingredients available.

Just a suggestion, maybe ask for the sauce on the side. Whoever was making the dishes the day we ate there put a lot of sauce. A lot of sauce."
4,We came here to have a drink and watch the marathon dodgers vs Red Sox World Series game. Very cool pub. Enjoyed the old school feel and English vibe. The bartenders were polite and attentive. They have a good late night happy hour which we took full advantage of. Would recommend if you are staying close by looking for a real pub.
4,"TL;DR - clean, friendly, accommodating, professional, great customer service

My sister and I visited as walk ins on a girl's day out for pedicures. 

Atmosphere: The salon is very tasteful and relaxing with elements incorporated into the decor to promote relaxation. The lighting was well done so the technicians have light to see, but is not overly bright for customers. Relaxing music is piped through the salon at an appropriate level to be heard, but not infringe on conversation. The nail bar is separated from the pedicure stations by a partial wall that includes a water fixture (faux fish tank). We were greeted very warmly upon arrival and offered a choice of complimentary water or wine. Other customers in the area appeared very relaxed, and the general feel of the employees was warm and inviting. 
The pedicure stations are simply amazing! The chairs feature massage seats and backs with various settings that the customer can choose from. The seats are comfortable even without using the massage options. The foot baths are lined with a new plastic bag for every customer and either new implements are used (such as pumice stones) or autoclaved between clients (such as clippers). The technicians make sure you are aware of their sanitary practices. 

The service: Fabulous! My technician was gentle and asked before doing anything beyond a normal pedicure. For example, I had heavy callousing and she asked before doing a callous removal treatment. She did an excellent job on my nails and feet. The service included removing old polish, cuticle treatment and removal, clipping and filing toenails, pumice and callous remover for feet, parrafin treatment, foot, ankle, and lower leg massage with lotion, and paintedtoenails. All this cost $35 dollars, which is a great deal! 

My only criticism is that my technician didn't appear to speak English and so her communication with me happened through another employee. However, the manager/owner made sure to pair her up with a technician who worked on my sister's pedicure that could translate translate for her. 

Overall, I would and definitely will visit again. $35 every few weeks for a pedicure is a wonderful treat and I feel I get more than enough value for the cost from the service and atmosphere."
4,"I  purchased appliances and a mattress. Salesperson was knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  I was given  a ""deal"" that if I purchased a mattress also I would receive a ""free"" range and microwave.
I was also told that if I saw a cheaper price on anything I purchased elsewhere within 30 days to let them know and I would receive the difference back-if I had never been told this I would not be unhappy with my Spencer experience right now.
Delivery went well. Items are adequate and while I received a ""deal"" it was in no way a low cost purchase.
I saw the mattress on sale elsewhere for $400 less but when I called the store I spoke with someone (not my original salesperson) that informed me that the cost of the range and microwave come off as a discount on the mattress so I did not really pay $3899.00 for it.

Lesson learned. My deal was not a deal but a way to manipulate numbers to make  me feel that Spencer's was giving me something I couldn't get anywhere else. Guy on the phone was pretty quick with his explanation on the pricing manipulation so I think I am not the 1st customer that has made that call. Not really sure I would go back

Update: I received a call from Spencer's regarding my review. Kudos to Kevin for the follow up and for providing good customer service. 
  Perhaps I misunderstood the offer I received. I do believe I received my purchases for a fair price and as I said previously my salesman and delivery service was great. I am changing my review to a four star and hope that if I use Spencer's in the future for my extended warranty or future purchases that I will receive 4 star service."
4,"I feel lucky to have this place in my neighborhood! When I'm here my go-to order is their Shrimp Chipotle Burrito with extra cheese, and then I get their mild salsa to top it off and it's delicious! A must try if you love Mexican food."
4,"Came here with my wife for a dinner date after I drop the Swarovaski Crystal Snowflake bracelet on her we had some very nice apple saki.

Some vegetable spring rolls which I liked and she didn't because they were deep fried but cold inside.

I had the shrimp and scallop hibachi... shrimp was a little overcooked but the scallops were perfect and the vegetables and rice were Dandy.

My wife had these sumo deluxe and it was delicious she said she had all chicken and I thought it was OK but I'm not a chicken person you can get chicken all day long...Service was fast restaurant was decorated nicely and clean so"
4,"We stayed here 3 nights, and even tough the airport is across the street, we did not hear any planes!  We did not even have to use the free supplied earplugs!  Staff was helpful - always gave us free water when we asked, the free breakfast spread was huge and we had no issues with check in, or out.

Hotel was clean and modern, we had a microwave and refrigerator.  Pool looked nice.
There are only 2 places to eat within walking distance, Pizza Company (pizza & staff were good, but small divey place) and Village Pub (we waited over an hour to get order taken and food served!!  Food good.)  Homeless men camping out near Village Pub."
4,"Had The Pub for lunch today. It was good but nothing super special about it. Started with the hush puppies and had the fried chicken sandwich. The waiter warned me that it was spicy so I got the sauce on the side and am glad I did. My friend had the fish & chips and I think the fish must have come from Free Willy cause it was huge. 

They have a nice outside seating area and since the weather was beautiful we sat outside and people watched. From that we confirmed that many people don't look in a mirror before going out in public. 

Overall a fine lunch but nothing I couldn't get at home or Applebee's"
4,"I woke up at 2 a.m. to feed my baby when it hit me....holy crap, today's the day Bambu officially opens! I have been looking forward to this day since being 8 months pregnant and wished with all my pregnant-craving-might that it would open sooner rather than later....and the day was finally here! I made sure we went there early to be their 1st customers, just to find out they had a soft opening the week before. Super sad face. BUT...we were still their 1st customer on their official grand opening today and I'm certain Mia is their youngest visitor at a whopping 3 weeks old, so I'm happy. ^_^ The owner, Rada, is super cool, and I wish nothing but great success for what is to be Phx's # 1 go-to spot for che (Vietnamese ice dessert 'drinks').

Seeing as they're brand new, there will be kinks they need to work out and I'm sure the place isn't completely finished, but that don't bother me none. The tables were clean and my only suggestion is to have some fun games to play. (i.e. Jenga, Connect 4,  Rock 'em Sock ' em Robots, chess, etc) as I forsee this as a great place to bring the family, meet friends and chill. On to the che review! 

My oldest daughter and I both ordered the #6 (Fruit Addict) which had everything I could love....longan, lychee, jackfruit, coconut meat, toddy palm seed, pandan jelly, red tapioca, and coconut milk and juice. Sooo yum and very refreshing. 

My hubby got a milk tea with crystal boba, and my younger daughter got a Raspberry Rama with crystal boba and added fresh mangos on top. The youngest had breastmilk, but that wasn't on the menu. Lol. Everything together (4 drinks) cost $17 & some change. We loved it and can't wait to try out the other flavors!!! We will definitely be back."
4,"Pretty good mid-downtown AYCE. Food is yummy.
GET THE BUSHIDO ROLL. Sashimi was all good, AND THEY HAD SABA SASHIMI.

Service is pretty shit though. Asked for cups of tea 3 or 4 times before it ever came (other people were served tea, so they had the stuff ready)."
4,"I stopped by here this past Sunday with my wife for lunch.  We were looking for a place nearby our location for lunch whenever I consulted Yelp and noticed that Honeygrow was nearby and that I had it bookmarked. So we headed on over.  It is located right on south highland street and the inside is bright and modern.  The tabletops are made of stainless steel and you walk up to a monitor in order to place your order.  They have a selection of stir frys and salads, all of which at least sound healthy.

For lunch on this day my wife went with the Chesapeake crab stir fry while I went with spicy garlic stir fry and substituted in whole wheat noodles for the egg white and also added some jalepenos for spice.  So that means my stir fry consisted of chicken, whole wheat noodles, pineapple, jalepenos, bell pepper, broccoli, onion, parsley and the spicy garlic sauce.  My food here ended up being quite tasty.  The fresh noodles had a nice bite to them while the jalepenos and sauce added a spice and the pineapple added some sweetness.  Meanwhile the chicken was a perfect canvas for the sauce and provided some protein and the rest of the vegetables helped to make my meal feel healthy.  My wife also enjoyed her meal and told me that they added the perfect amount of Old Bay to it.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I enjoyed our food and thought that it tasted great in addition to feeling healthy."
4,"Though I am very said that John's Country Kitchen has been replaced, I guess having another eating place (that isn't just open for breakfast/brunch) is okay.

It was a rainy day when I visited but the rooftop seating was filled to the max.  Glad to see restaurants are getting creative with using existing buildings and working to make some exciting spaces.

Order at the counter and receive a number.  Staff and servers were all very friendly and the food was made to order.  I wasn't that hungry but the appetizer wings and a side of street corn casserole was more than enough to satisfy.  The buffalo wings had a nice char on them and flavor.  A little heat to them but came with a dipping sauce that mellowed out the bite.

The downstairs eating area feels a little tunnel like, as the counter is located in the back and there is a half bank of booth seating that delineates the route to place an order.

It is plaza midwood, so not my favorite place to park.  Luckily I had scooter-ed over to the neighborhood that day and took an Lyft back."
4,"We stay at this hotel often as my husbands conferences are affiliated with this hotel. Always able to get great rates as Hilton honors member, service is wonderful. Front desk always manage to accommodate any of our requests. Our 5 year old enjoys the stay as there's a park right across and ducks to feed. We watch plane landing from our suite. Plane noises  die out after 11pm tho. Lots of restaurants etc nearby and super close to airport. 

We are happy with our stay here and recommend anyone avoiding the busy strip area."
4,"I would stay here again, I was really bum that we couldn't stay at Tahiti village this trip and had a sour attitude about staying at the Tahiti but over all it was a nice place. The pool was nice, refreshing and not crowded at all. They had a nice BBQ area with fridges so that made it convent to have a nice get together and BBQ with our friends while we swam.
The whole hotel had a very nice and clean smell thru-out. The jacuzzi bath tub was a nice treat. Everything was 24 hours and the staff was extremely friendly.
The activity center was updated and clean. They have movies to rent for free which was nice for the kids.
They had a continental breakfast 7am-10am that consisted of plain bagels with cream cheese, blueberry waffles, bananas and apples... Coffee, tea and orange juice. I felt that was a nice treat considering other hotels don't offer it.
They have a small putting green, NOT  MINIATURE GOLF... This could be why people had a bad review about ""the miniature golf course""
I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 stars only because I've stayed at other places that are better and have more to offer but this place was enjoyable."
4,I live very close to this place and was in desperate need of a mani. Thankfully I was able to make a same-day appt for a Shellac manicure. They had overextended themselves with appts and walk-ins and were doing their best to accommodate everyone. It took 15-20 mins before my appt began and then I sat there with the acetone on my nails for another 30 mins before the manicurist was available. But the staff was very friendly and apologetic and really worked to make my experience positive. And I wasn't in a hurry so was patient. The end result was fantastic!  He did an amazing job. I have received many compliments. I am very happy and would go back.
4,"Great value if you're traveling to Vegas with family or for an extended trip (3+ nights). 10-15 min drive to most casinos on the Strip, so it's convenient enough to access without being in the middle of it all. If you want a relatively quiet place for a good value, check this place out. If you want a ""resort"" that pampers you and makes you feel like you're on a honeymoon or something, this probably isn't the place for you.

Pros: 
- Huge Suite (full kitchen, washer, dryer, fireplace, balcony, 2 TVs)
- We were upgraded even without asking!
- Self-parking (I like having access to my car when I want it; none of that valet business)
- Quiet
- 24 hr pool, grilling, gym
- Home-away-from-home feeling (almost like a condo)
- Pretty good Wifi speed
- Kid friendly (they'd love the pool!)

Cons:
- Breakfast (was definitely expecting more variety. carb fest, not very impressive)
- Room decoration (comfy, but not very ""Tahiti"")
- No maid service during our 3 night stay (it really didn't bother me, but it might turn some people off)
- No bar or restaurant (but there are a number of good places within walking distance, so again, this was not a huge deal for me)
- Overall, not really a ""resort"" (the pool area is nice, but there's no service or pampering that make it feel like you're on a resort vacation. I guess if you want to be pampered, you can go to one of the million other places in Vegas, so there!)"
4,My wife and I have bought from Spencers for years and have always found them a great place to buy from and wonderful people to work with. They found us an even better deal on our double-oven (than Lowe's on sale) and I love being able to buy from a local AZ company. Keep up the great work Spencers.
4,"This place was suprisingly good amongst the Americanized Asian fusion places I've been to. Ordered 3 or 4 of the noodle dishes, all were solid. The kimchee rice balls were solid as an appetizer. The Vietnamese iced coffee, while great to drink, is really too sweet for me to consider authentic but I'll drink it anyways!

Various Asian elements are here, but I've seen more Vietnamese than at other locations. Noodle dishes were fine, haven't tried the pho, and I would not suggest banh mi if you wanted something close to the real deal. Then again, you wouldn't be here if you wanted the real deal =D

For an easy lunch that's different from the everyday sandwich or hamburger, Wok Box has my endorsement."
4,"First visit for lunch today. Greeted by friendly staff, ordered pulled chicken as platter not sandwich with green beans as side. It was delicious, those fresh green beans were perfection!!  Chicken was nice and moist sauce was great. 
Loved the food a step above Viva Chicken."
4,"I have two simple tests for congee. 

1.  Does it have a good flavor without having to add chili oil or soy sauce.  Most places just cook a giant pot of plain congee and then add the ingredients to order.  The good places spend some extra time cooking the plain congee with the ingredients you chose so that the ingredient flavors are imparted to the plain congee. 

2. Is the consistency good and does it stay good.  Poor quality congee turns watery after a little while because it's cooked with starch and other binding agents to ""shortcut"" the slow simmer process

Congee Queen semi fails the first test and passes the second one nicely.  The flavor was a bit bland but it could be because I chose ingredients with subtle flavors (seafood and meatballs).   I think if I would have ordered it with the preserved egg and fried oysters the flavor would have been much better.   The consistency was excellent and stayed so all the way to the end.  

Highly recommended and I would suggest getting a congee with preserved egg!"
4,"Great food and cheap beer. The folks are always nice here, good neighborhood place. The decor is authentic and so is the food."
4,"Thank you for moving into my neighborhood! Delicious Mexican food, nicely priced & run by super sweet people. Have had the carne Asada burrito and the ""banderita"" burrito and plan on trying every single item in the menu! Lol :-O 
I recommend!"
4,"Nice place for a quick lunch. The owners are very 'present', which is cool. You definitely get plenty of food if you order the combo. It's a little pricey for an every day lunch (about $13 for my combo), but like I said - there is a ton of food. If you are light eater, you will have leftovers for sure. This location has the (pretty darn spicy) Dan Dan option, which is very good."
4,"If I had been yelpin' at the end of 2008, I would have dedicated this review to my first months in Vegas! Now, it is the end of 2010, and I am wondering where two years went and dedicating this review to my first two years here! 

Before I officially relocated, Tahiti was my home in Vegas. We came to Vegas on two extended scouting trips. We were here so long that we brought along our GameCube and hooked it up to the TV. We ate up and down Spring Mountain, hit up the Pinball Hall of Fame, looked at hundreds of potential homes and holed up here. It was the perfect spot for a longer stay, especially because our goal was to get a feel for life off the Strip. The location was central, perfect for exploring the rest and best of Vegas.

The rooms are big and clean with a basic kitchenette (microwave, mini fridge, toaster, coffee maker, sink). Our room also had a huge, garden tub, which was nice, but made entering and exiting the shower a bit of a challenge! We were visiting in the winter, so we didn't use the pool, but it looked like it would be quite the summer treat. 

If you are looking for an extended stay spot, Tahiti is a safe bet, and it will always hold a special place in my heart for being my ""gateway"" to Vegas!"
4,It's definitely better than Kyoto AYCE :) and cheaper
4,"We definitely had a great experience and can recommend this for a relaxing trip to Vegas. We traded a time-share and phoned the desk. They were very helpful and allowed us to upgrade our room. When we arrived at noon, they were very gracious and we checked in immediately- 4 hours early. The Concierge (two different ones, actually) were extremely helpful and never once strong-armed us for any time share crap. We were logged in for the free Red Rock Canyon trip and also were able to purchase a great discount dinner.show package without the need to talk about or look at the ""property"".

The room was very clean, overlooked the pool as we requested, and quite comfortable. Ice machine was close by (even though we had the full kitchen) and the complement of dishes, coffee maker, etc. was great. There is even a free continental breakfast (very skimpy but totally unexpected and free!) and the pool and hot tub are open 24 hours. They keep to a Quiet Time which is posted prominently and Security walked right out to tell some kids they were making a little too much noise.

It's close to some shopping and some quick food and the free shuttle to the strip was on-time and the drivers were great!

Overall, we would go back to here OR their companion property (Tahiti Village, since we had stayed there about 18 months ago) without a second thought!"
4,"The Plaza Midwood neighborhood in Charlotte welcomed it's newest eatery and added another awesome dining experience to an already impressive resume.

We had an opportunity to preview the Coaltrane's Char Grill which opened it's second location in the Queen City at 1518 Central Avenue in a recently renovated early 20th-Century brick building that once housed John's Country Kitchen.

Coaltrane's founders Mike Libretto and Mario Flynn went above and beyond to bring this location to life, including adding a second floor dining experience for some intimacy and a tree house deck for sipping suds under the stars with a spectacular view of uptown.

With a menu that has a little bit of everything (as long as it isn't fried or unhealthy), even the most the discriminating foodies on a budget will feel right at home.  From rotisserie chicken, flatiron steak sandwiches, quinoa w/ roasted vegetables, stuffed avocados, and a supremely delicious desert menu that includes Tres Leches, Coaltrane's has their bases covered.

For our craft beer aficionado's, Coaltrane's has you covered too.  Their rotating tap has some great local craft beers and several from outside the area as well.  They also have a decent wine and spirit selection if you lean that way.

Fantastic family-friendly restaurant in a gorgeous building run by an amazing staff.  Who could ask for anything more?"
4,"Full disclosure: This is the only All-you-can-eat sushi restaurant I've been to in Toronto as of this review

After going here twice, I can say it's enjoyable. It's got everything you would need in an all-you-can-eat sushi resto:
- Fast, reliable service even during peak lunch time (12pm)
- Solid selection of sushi, rolls, and the usual sides
- Rice is not mushy, done well enough
- Great price ($11 + tax)

Overall, if you're in the area and hankering for some sushi this is a great place to go."
