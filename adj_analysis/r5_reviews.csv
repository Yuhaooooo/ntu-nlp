5,"We had my Mother's Birthday Party here on 10/29/16. What a Great time we all had. The food, music and waiters were Great!!! Thanks Lyles!!!"
5,"Was recommended to try this place by few people and today was my first time here. All I can say is, I am coming back very soon.

SERVICE
Wasn't sure if the guy was the owner but he was friendly and talked story while we waited for our food. Loved it!! Food came out within 10 min. 

FOOD
Tried hamburger steak and it was so delicious. Gravy/sauce they put on the hamburger steak was perfect! Also came with onion rings on top which I love. Chicken katsu was amazing! Chicken katsu here is crunchy and surprisingly has a flavor by itself that you really don't need a sauce for it. Best chicken katsu I had. 

OVERALL
It was a journey to get to this place as it took about 30min from my house but the service and food here made it worth the drive. I also love how they had a poster of Keali'i Reichel. (They had other posters but Keali'i Reichel happens to be my favorite). Place is clean, service is fast and friendly and food is delicious. What more could you ask for?"
5,This place is really nice inside it doesn't seem like your at the cannery. The crab cakes are good and I had the chicken and it was really good too. The best part was our waiter he was soooo nice and was very attentive. Great customer service here.
5,"Nice atmosphere, plenty of TV's. Priced affordably. They do serve food, but stop the dinner dinner menu at 10:30. We ordered the BBQ chicken nachos and they were so good!!!"
5,The food was amazing. The filet and lobster tail was perfect.  Its hard to beat a great steak and lobster tail for under $30.  Also the service was on point.
5,Great spring roll and pho. We got our food fairly quick which made it a great stop for lunch.
5,"The prime rib was excellent, the service was excellent. Our while dining experience could not have been better"
5,"Phenomenal practice!  Dr Wellish is absolutely top-notch, the staff is incredible and friendly, and I love Heidy -- who does all the extra level of service and follow-up.  When i was diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes at an unusually young age, I was amazed at the expertise and knowledge, choices and recommendations, and terrific  care.  The office seems also to run very efficiently.

The surgery itself was a breeze, 1 hr of prep, and a 10 minute surgery.  i did one eye per visit, and could see immediately afte, albeit sensitive to light.  Dr Wellish is truly terrific.

The follow-up vists were very accomodating to my schedule, and I am very pleased with my vision now - no glasses and i can see fantastic!

One word of caution: with the choices in lenses, there is a great variance of costs. Some, my insurance would have paid 100%, others only 50%.   If financial is part of your decison choice, make sure you understand ALL the costs for out-of-pocket.  This would include the meds, drops, and surgery center costs along with any lens costs before you choose."
5,Visited for the first time today. Red door signature facial. Jordan was amazing. My skin looks and feels smoother and moisturized. The atmosphere is so elegant and relaxing . I'll be be back again soon!!
5,"I have not one qualm to announce about this TJ's! Not a single qualm.

Parking is available via two lots (one off Monroe, the other off Spooner). Carts are always tidy, never massively dumped and sprawled in the parking lots or in the streets. The store is so tidy and well-maintained. Staff are always on top of tasks and helpful, friendly 95% of the time, and many come to recognize you after recurring visits!

Produce is decent quality and I always find what I need. Specialty, holiday, and seasonal promotions are always fun too:  pizza crust dough, my summer iced coffee concentrate and winter holiday panettone! YUM!

A hidden gem IMHO:  tea tree infused body care items. Body wash. Face scrub. Face/Skin cleansing pads. Oil. I'm drinking the TJ's tea tree kool-aid!

I would head local for something like coffee beans, though."
5,"I recently started working uptown and I wanted to find a local place to hang out  after work some nights, I found this little gem.  On the corner of Brevard Court and Church Street, this place is simply amazing!  I'm on a budget, so 3.50 pints on Thursday night is exactly what this girl was looking for.  The bartender, Libby, knows what I want when I walk in and I've only been there few times.  Great service and excellent prices!  I love this place!!!"
5,This outback location really knows how to keep their customers happy. After a slightly bad experience they did everything in their power to make sure my next experience was nothing short of awesome! Michelle is an awesome manager and really knows how to provide great customer service! The food as always was wonderful tonight. I will continue to go to this outback location!
5,"Every single time I come in to town(which is often) I hit this place. 

Whether it be for breakfast, lunch or a quick pick up order of spam musubi, their food is always good. The last time I came I had a moco loco and dang near passed out from a food coma because the serving was so much and was so good that I couldn't stop eating. Being Filipino, a lot of their dishes are similar to what I can make already but why go through the effort of having to make it myself when I'm on vacation and someone else can make it just as good?

Add to the fact that I can get my fix of Lilikoi here makes my decision just that easier. The proprietors here are so friendly - I always seem to talk to the one gentleman with the goatee. I swear if this is how all people from Hawaii are(friendly and conversational) I really need to book my trip there now. 

I'm sure they remember me - I always order at least 10 spam musubis for pickup."
5,"Haven't been to Denny's in years bc I always had a bad experience in the past, but something drew me there today. The food and service were SO GOOD! I got egg whites mixed with bellpeppers, onions and tomatoes, avocado and fruit, with an English muffin. Super healthy and yummy! I asked the cook to make it with Pam instead of butter and they willingly accommodated! This was great! Definitely recommend! The server (Matt!) was AWESOME! Come and visit--worth it!"
5,"I have eaten here three times so far, and I have walked away very pleased. Service has been great and highly recommend the burgers and boneless wings, both are the best I have ever had at a restaurant. Great selection of on tap beers as well. Give it a try."
5,Food is good for a 24 hour place. A little pricey but would definitely come back. Walking into the restaurant the aroma makes you hungry.
5,Had a great dinner here tonight. I asked the waitress for a suggestion and she was spot on. Service was good employees were friendly and warm. Salads are fresh and terrific and overloaded with ingredients.
5,The waiters are amazing and very attentive to their customers needs. We never felt like they forgot about us and didn't have to ask for refills. The food was amazing! The lighting is perfect and the seating? Oh my goodness.. Amazing! Overall I loved my time there. It was my fiancées first time and we'll definitely return. Thank you Waverly's!!!
5,This place is amazing!!! Great prices! Clean!! Most of all great customer service!!! We come at least once a month if not more! I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves sushi!!!!!
5,Low carb is the way to go. Sub cabbage for noodles. Delicious and less carb/fat/sugar.
5,"I had LASIK with Dr. Wellish in 2004. My vision was horrible- 20/2700. Eleven years later and still no glasses. My vision has held steady at 20/40, and I still don't need readers at age forty-five. LASIK was life changing. If you're considering it, do it. Dr Wellish is the best. The office was organized & on time. They know what they're doing."
5,Customer service is great I had Never eaten Pho before and all I  did was describe what I was looking for and the friendly girl up front was able to point to a dish that suited me ! I loved it . I brought my family back for some to try as well !! Thank you
5,"I am extremely happy I made the choice to finally get my LASIK surgery. I had been doing lots of research about it and was patiently waiting for a place that I can trust. 
I finally made my appointment to go and check it out, I was greeted by their amazing staff. They are very attentive and kind. I was greeted by Aldo as I was checked in by Bianca at the front desk. Bianca then asked me for my information and to fill out some forms. Next I went in to talk to Taylor, she sat down with me and explained to me in detail how the procedure works and what I can be expecting as we moved forward. She gave me some instructions to follow preparing me for my next appointment. I was instructed not to wear my contact lenses for 2 weeks, and to take some hydro eye pills to keep my eyes moisturized. The 2 weeks past by and it was time to get a few test done on my eyes. My pupils were dilated so they could see deep in my eye. Gabby was the lady that was running the exams, she did an amazing job and made me feel comfortable as she was guiding me through the exams. The next day was surgery day. I was a bit nervous because this is all new to me but I knew I was in good hands. Dr McCandless sat down with me and introduced himself with me, sat me down and told me what to expect. Prior to the surgery they gave me some pills to relax me and they did help me to keep calm and at ease. Once I sat down on the chair I knew that was going to walk out of the operation room a new man, with 20/15 vision. The surgery was a success and now I am so happy to have great visión, no more wearing glasses or contact lenses. Thank you all for your help and amazing service. I definitely recommend them if you ever think of getting your LASIK."
5,O. M. Gizz in my mouth. Hidden gem. And surprisingly affordable.  Nice classy place where u can wear casual clothes so that's a plus. Staff was amazing.
5,Love this company. Bread is baked fresh daily. They sell there day old bread for 50% off. They have great lunch specials with sandwiches. I would recommend white chocolate cherry swirl or pumpkin spice for bread. But if u cant decide they will give u a free taste.
5,"One of the best sports bars around. The food is always good and the servers are always nice! 
We usually get burgers or ribs, both are great choices."
5,"Excellent special pho. Have had it many times here. Get it to go on a cold winter night.  

Call in ordering fast and problem free. Friendly employees. They have 10 min parking in front for pickup but sometimes people use them for long term parking."
5,"We went to this steakhouse not sure what to expect, but WOW!! My husband and I each had a $25 off coupon from playing slots so we figured at worst it would be a mediocre meal for a reasonable price, but I am happy to say this place exceeded my expectations.

Service was exceptional and prompt. We made a lot of different requests and they were able to accommodate almost everything. All of the food was good, even the bread basket, but here's a breakdown of what we ordered:

Veal Oscar Roll - Very tasty, and pretty unique too. Served kinda like sushi (although it tastes nothing like it). They also sell this as a larger entrée but if you want to just try it out without spending too money, this is a great. It only came in 4 bites though, so it was gone pretty fast. Definitely not something to ""share"" with the table.

Portabello Frites - Husband LOVES portabello mushrooms, so he was a big fan of these. I'm just so-so on mushrooms, so I was just so-so on these. They are VERY mushroomy. If you love that then go for it. If not, you can pass on this.

Chopped Salad - Decent size and in a rather large bowl. It got the job done as far as a salad was concerned, and they were very accommodating when I wanted to switch out ingredients.

She-Crab Soup - For the price, this  was a little disappointing. We were hoping it would be a little meatier, but it's really just more of a crab bisque. We did ask for some Old Bay and while they didn't have that, they were able to bring out some sort of substitute that perked this soup up. I'd pass on this unless you're in the mood for a bisque.

Ribeye - VERY good. My husband likes his steak medium-rare and I like it medium. We asked if they could cut the steak in half and cook it differently and they were happy to do so - no plate sharing charge. Honestly we ordered so many appetizers we didn't really need two steaks at this point anyway. The steak tasted great and comes with a variety of sauces. If you can't decide (like me) they'll just bring you out all three. Mashed potatoes on the side were just all right, but I was pretty stuffed at this point anyway. 

Chocolate Decadence - It was my birthday so they brought me out a chocolate dessert. We were already pretty full but we can make a little room for chocolate cake. This was a hearty portion and it was a little too rich for me, but it was nice to finish it off with a sweet!  

Sadly there is no piano player anymore, at least not when I went. When I asked management about it, they said he still plays occasionally. 

Overall this was a fantastic steak restaurant for a reasonable price."
5,"Had a wonderful dinner with impeccable service start to finish last night.  I ordered the Ribeye 30 dollar dinner..very good steak cooked perfect... straight up horse radish which was right on the money !  good stuff! 
everything was good ..meal included a choice from 3 different kinds of salads..I had a strawberry  spinach and walnut salad with poppyseed dressing.  perfect! . awesome cheese and bacon scallop like potatoes and fresh asparagus..and choice of 3 sauces if you so desire
au povre. ..I think a bearnaise..and a third one..
   .homemade  bread too.. ..also dessert of warm home made bread pudding with a  sauce  on it.  I am not a bread pudding fan but this was very good!   A bottle of wine added and my sons amazing Kobe beef burger he enjoyed and daughter in laws NY Steak with side salad and a side of yummy fresh spinach  came to 124.00 .   The decor is classic and nice and no smoking allowed...just make it through the casino and you will be fine.  This is our new go to steakhouse in town..nice ambiance and reasonable.. with wonderful old school service that won't break the bank!...really enjoyed ourselves.. give it a try.
5 stars for overall fine dining feel and experience at
a reasonable price"
5,"Had a late lunch here today, the service was great. He was friendly, quick, and helpful when I asked what was in the veggie pho, he went to ask the chef what's in it. 
The veggie pho was amazing, the best by far I've had in the Phoenix area! Flavorful, not too salty, and with fresh veggies and jalapeños to go in it. 
My boyfriend enjoyed the shrimp spring roll things and his shrimp pho as well. 
We will definitely go back next time we want pho!"
5,The food was fantastic ! The waitress picked up on us being vegan quickly without having to be told and made sure we had a great selection of food to eat .
5,"I love Great Harvest for many reasons.  Reason #1 is that you can go in and get a free slice of fresh bread with butter--two of my favorite things.  I CAN live on bread alone, unfortunately.  Reason #2 is the pumpkin chocolate chip bread that they sell and this is the best time of year for that.  Reason #3 are the gift bags that you can get and give, especially during the holidays--I've gotten one at Christmas time for the past 4 years from my boss and I always look forward to the loaf of fresh wheat bread and 2 giant cookies nicely wrapped up for my enjoyment.  People love receiving delicious edibles and Great Harvest offers a selection that should satisfy anyone on your gift list."
5,"Best veggie burgers w/ pepper jack cheese! 

Becky is absolutely the best server!

Highly recommended!"
5,"my pool motor was out of warranty. Shasta was very expensive, double the service charge compared to Aaron's.  Stetson came over and inspected our problem. He was polite and professional.  He fixed our issue and then said he noticed a small leak and would need to return later with a new part.  An hour later he was back with Daniel. They took about a half hour and now everything works great.  Total charge was $150.00.  Eureka, I have found my pool company for life.  You can trust this company.  Ask for Stetsen.   Thank you Stetsen and Daniel, great job.

Sincerely
Bob and Maria Atanasio"
5,"I didn't specifically get Dr. Wellish, but I loved Dr. Langford and the rest of the staff at Wellish. I'm guessing it's due to the area they're located in, but the other patients were a little....ghetto. And the office is kind of run down honestly. But as I said, the staff are so great and the equipment seems fine so that's all that really matters. 

I haven't been to the doctor since I got lasik a few years ago, and I mainly just went to get occasional glasses since I'm still pretty nearsighted. This visit was prompted by the fact that I went to see a show Priscilla Queen of the Desert. From my sh*tty seat in the back, I honestly couldn't tell if some of the background dancers were dudes in drag, or just bigger ladies. That was a wake-up call about how bad my far sight really was..... 

Anyway, the techs were nice and personable both times I was there. Dr Langford was awesome too (very nice and cute), and I was surprised by the fact that he wanted to do a topography map of the surface of my eye just for his peace of mind to make sure everything was ok. He made the point to say that he wasn't billing for it, he just wanted to be thorough. I told him that I have insurance so it doesn't matter to me, but I was impressed that he was that honest and caring. 

I say this way too often lately, but my dumb@ss happened to get the date of my appointment wrong, so I showed up a day early. I was pretty shocked when they took me anyway. It did mean a longer wait time, but it was so nice of them to squeeze me into the schedule. I would've been fine coming back the next day. 

The only negative is that they don't do glasses on site, so I still have to find a place to pick out frames and do the lenses, but that's only a minor inconvenience. I'll probably find a better price not getting it in a doctors office anyway."
5,Their soondae is the best in the entire city!!! Mmmmmmm! I also really enjoyed their spicy crispy chicken. Take a look at the wall and you will see a poster for grapefruit soju. Trust me on this : order it ASAP! I love everything here and it's my favorite Korean restaurant in the entire city. And it's 24/7. Seriously? That's a game changer!
5,"Me and a couple of friends decided to try this new place.  YUMMMMMOOOOO.  I had the curry, another friend had a banmi sandwich, he liked it so much he had one to go.  Another friend is a vegetarian and loved what she ordered.   Great place, great prices.  Will definitely go back."
5,"We eat lunch here at least once if not three times a month.  The monday lunch special pulled pork sandwich.  What we really like is the zippy bbq sauce, different sides and ice cone for desert."
5,I have been thinking about Lasik surgery for years. These guys made my decision easy. Not only was it the best decision but the staff was so great. I was very nervous but they told me everything I needed to know and made me feel calm. They are the BEST!!
5,"Stetson is the best pool tech!!! He came on time and fixed the problem within 15 minutes. Aaron pool is sent to me by the warranty company. But I always make sure I ask for him. He is extremely knowledgably and courteous. You can ask him anything, and he doesn't mind you standing over his shoulder asking questions!!"
5,"Absolutely the BEST dinner I've had in Las Vegas in 15 years!  Top it off with fabulous service from Frederick, this place can't be beat.  We had three of us there for dinner.  The onion soup was perfect (not too salty like most other places), the raspberry viniagrette salad was delicious, the button mushrooms were huge and scrumptious, and we had prime rib (2) and filet with shrimp for our entrees.  The prime rib was over the top for flavor.  I just can't say enough about this place.  It's not often I think of dining here because it's in the Cannery, but I'm so thankful I remembered this hidden gem.  It's nice and quiet, food is great, and service is five star.  What more could you want?!"
5,"I can't say enough great things about this practice, Dr. Wellish, Dr. McCandless, and the staff.  While I'm originally from Las Vegas, I now live across the country and they were more than accommodating when it came to scheduling my appointments and even finding a doctor for me locally for all my follow ups.  I flew back for LASIK because I've heard nothing but great things from people I know who have had their surgery done here, and now I can see why. 

My LASIK procedure went very well, I felt that I was well informed going in to the surgery and the post-op care was just as attentive.  I rarely write reviews for anything, but the level of care here warranted the time to recommend them and, furthermore, I'm free from glasses and contacts for the first time in 23 years.  I really couldn't be happier."
5,"Love this place, amazing bread, sandwiches are fabulous, service is always great! 

However, to the guy in yellow shirt at noon on 1/18/2016, sitting at the table by the chips, talking ridiculously loud on the phone and watching videos even more loudly..... Buy some headphones, you are rude!"
5,Great red white blueberry bread.  It has cranberry's and blueberry's.  Yummy in my tummy.  Really have enjoyed there bread and sandwich's for years.  Tried the lemon bar today and it was so good.  Just like my receipt but better flake on the crust.  Very good.
5,"OMG! What an amazing experience! The food was extraordinarily delicious and the service was spectacular! 
It was a busy Saturday night, we didn't have a reservation but the 1 hour wait was absolutely worth it. Our waiter Frank made our experience even better. He was putting so much love and care into his job that all 10 of us was inspired by him. He paid so much care and attention to my kids that they keep asking me when are we going back?
Needless to say that the general ambience of the restaurant was so warm and friendly. I totally recommend this place to all Italian food lovers!"
5,"Love, love, love!   Wish the parking was better, but always love the variety and prices.  Bought some frozen chicken tamales that were sooooo good!  Always enjoy the sesame rice crackers...did NOT enjoy the roasted seaweed snack."
5,"We came here for lunch, food is really good and friendly staff. I highly recommend the ""bo luc lac"". Best Vietnamese restaurant in town."
5,"Excellent food and exceptional, friendly service.  Never disappointed with the food or the service."
5,"Excellent staff, procedure and outcome. I couldn't be more happier with the results. Thank you so much Wellish Vision Lasik, the whole process was definitely a great experience."
5,"A few months ago, I was experiencing some irritation in my right eye and wasn't sure of the cause. It seemed to happen in the morning time and the irritation would last a few hours and leave my eye extremely dry and red. I used over the counter eye drops and nothing! Finally I found Wellish Vision Institute because I couldn't take the irritation and saw they had great reviews. I was treated by Dr. Isaac Ortiz and let me just say, he is one of the best eye doctors I have met. His staff treated me very nicely from the beginning, they gave me all kinds of eye exams to rule out what the cause would be and by the time I saw Dr. Ortiz I was in a lot less pain. He was very knowledgeable in explaining all of the different things it could be and really took his time with checking me out and making sure I was comfortable at all times. Turns out it was a bad allergic reaction to my face wash. I had seen an eye doctor before Dr. Ortiz but he couldn't figure out what the issue was. So thankfully Dr. Ortiz was able to figure it out. He gave me all kinds of eyedrops that are so much better than anything you can get at a drugstore. He also educated me on what they do and how to prevent my issues. Overall, it was a great experience and will be using Dr. Ortiz as my eye doctor from now on!!"
5,I have been going to the Red Door for years treating myself to a monthly mani/pedi. I love the customer service at The Red Door.....they take their time with your services and it is so relaxing. The manicurists are amazing and do a fantastic job. I have been seeing Sharron for the last couple years - she is a wonderful manicurist and knows how to make my experience so special.
5,Best Outback Steakhouse I've been to. Been to different ones in Arizona and California. This is by far better service and best food!
5,"Let me start by admitting I'm FAR from a sushi aficionado. In fact, I'll only eat California rolls because I'm scared to try anything else.  A huge craving for teriyaki chicken led us here. We were really impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and especially the restrooms. The customer service was awesome as well.  We had the happy hour special which was only $8 and included 2 items and soup or salad. The miso soup was satisfying, the teriyaki chicken was really delicious and hit the spot. The California rolls, in my opinion, were fresh-tasting and delicious. For under $20 for two we left really happy and definitely plan to return. I'll be excited to try a Bento box on the next visit."
5,"I can't rave about The Wellsh Eye Center enough! Everyone in there was beyond friendly while maintaining excellent professionalism! They took time out of their day, after office hours, to check on me personally. I had no complications with my Lasik. I can't believe I waited so long! I'm extremely happy with the results, the Wellsh Eye Center and each and everyone one of the staff. I would recommend them to anyone considering Lasik."
5,"I had my Lasik procedure performed in September of 2016 but I wanted to wait a few months before I gave my full honest review of my experience.  I'll start from the date of my free Lasik consultation, Taylor the counselor was very helpful in explaining the difference between Lasik and PRK and which one I was a candidate for.  Based on my needs I chose Lasik.  I met with Dr. McCandless and some of the techs on the date of my eye exam where scans of my eyes were performed and everyone was extremely helpful in answering all my questions related to my upcoming Lasik surgery. Moving forward to the date of surgery, the staff in the Lasik center were very helpful in keeping me calm and relaxed.  The entire procedure was very quick! I was surprised at how fast and painless it was! I had absolutely nothing to be worried about and I should have done it sooner! I have been using glasses since the age of 15 so not having to search for my glasses first thing in the morning is a great feeling.   I had to use a few drops after the surgery but that is a small price to pay for my great vision.  My office visits after my surgery were just as pleasant as my visits before the surgery. Everyone I have met there has been very nice and knowledgeable, I plan to recommend them to my friends and family. Today, my vision is 20/15 ,that's better than 20/20.  I'm glad I chose to have my Lasik done by Dr.Kent Wellish and his wonderful staff."
5,"Loved Grazie! 

I don't like how they don't take ressos during the week days but I quickly got past that. I visited this restaurant on a Thursday night with some work friends. Combined, we ordered a bottle of Malbec, two salads, two pasta dishes and bruschetta. I can't recall one complaint being said about the meal or the service. Not one! 

Our server was really friendly and gave us some distance at the end of our meal for chatting while we finished our bottle of vino. She didn't over crowd us or give the hairy eyeball to leave when it started to busy-up. I really liked that. 

The food was incredible. I ordered the baked goat cheese salad and the Penza pasta. Mmm. Simply Mmm. The goat cheese salad was wrapped with phyllo and had grilled eggplant and peppers inside. It was delightful! The Penza was loaded with pancetta pieces and the green onions really enhanced the flavours. I didn't find my meal too heavy at all which is rare for a creamy pasta dish.

My friend ordered the Tasca pasta dish and thoroughly enjoyed it, too. It came as a surprise when it arrived in a package. Literally arrived in a small, cute, bundled up pasta package. Visually appealing. Another girlfriend has a prosciutto salad with added chicken which looked tasty. 

I honestly can't wait to return to Grazie."
5,Nice little place and not the average menu items either. The bento's can feed two and the lunch specials are great.
5,Harvest Peach Honey is the best!!!! But they were out of it!!! The staff is nice and helpful.. Its always clean.. You get a free slice of bread with butter and a punch card and the 10th loaf of bread is free!!
5,"I picked up several plates via takeout to share with my family and enjoyed everything; a combination bang mi, the special pho, and a#42 plate.  It was a cold Friday evening and all the dishes were tasty and hot the spot.  The flavors were good, and the veggies and herbs were just what the doctor ordered.  Fast friendly service!"
5,"This is one of my favorite Steak houses. The Food is always excellent service is to match. Great place for an elegant meal, hidden away in the Cannery Casino."
5,"Alway a great steak here!

Gotta come check out the Valentines Day weekend special...bread, appetizer, 2 steaks, 2 salads, 2 sides and a cheesecake all for under $50!!!  Definitely pick an upgrade!  They make the best steaks...better than any of the steak chains by far and not as pricey!

Hubby was in Heaven and I was stuffed...kids always love the dessert! It is always a g'day down-under mates!"
5,A wonderful place. Pedicure and manicure and I feel pampered.  I highly recommend. Such a nice atmosphere and the customer service is exquisite
5,Saw the review by Pepper and had to try the oxtail pho also. I mentioned Pepper's review to the server and she assured me they fixed it son all the beef is very tender. And it is!!!!! I'm thrilled to have this place on my way home. We'll be seeing each other a lot more. And ordered a bahn mi to go.
5,I loved this great harvest! I have been to a couple and this one felt so home-like and it was cute inside! They had the cutest stuff to buy like aprons. The food was so good I had a turkey pesto sandwich and I recommend it grilled and it was so good. The bread is all so fresh and they make everything there! I love it!!!
5,Our exercise group loves to go to this restaurant. They always make us feel welcome and give us excellent service.  Good food!  Good service!   Good people!
5,"I love this restaurant. Food is cheap and delicious. Best Penza ever!!!!
Wish they did reservation cause it sucks waiting 1 hr for a table. There bread with the dipping olive oil and the spices they add is soooo yummy. Keep up the good food but plz consider reservations. It's hard to wait for 1 hrs with a 13 month old"
5,"So thankful for Dr. Wellish! I got quotes and was cleared for lasik surgery by 3 other clinics and even completed my pre-screen with Dr. Wellish's assistants. I decided to go with Wellish because I had heard he was the best, and, it is my eyes! However, when I came for the pre-opp appointment Dr. Wellish identified that i had a rare corneal disease and told me he did not recommend any surgery because it would further damage my cornea which already had ailments. He sent me home with no charge. THANK GOD for doctors with integrity! He could have done surgery that day, collected several thousand dollars from me and I likely would not have known for years that I did something that wasn't good for my eyes. All of the other places I saw either ignored the condition or were not well enough trained to identify it. After my experience, I'd feel very safe recommending this honest and skilled dr who saved my $ and my eyes!"
5,The ribeye was great! Waitress haley was nice.
5,"If you want a Great Doctor Welish is the Best a  2 hours is nothing for a lifetime of sight if your getting the Best traveling is no big deal for sight it's relaxing and a peaceful place.,And you can watch your loved one getting it done if you choose so 2 hours or a lifetime there is no comparison they treat you like royalty."
5,"Dr. Wellish was recommended by my regular eye doctor and after much research, he was the best candidate. Not only does he use the latest technology, his staff is very friendly. I was a bit nervous right before the surgery but speaking to Dr. Wellish calmed my nerves. He was friendly, very down to earth, and accommodating to any needs I had. This is the 1st day after surgery and I'm already seeing 20/20. If I can give the doctor and his office 7 stars, I would."
5,"First time here. Went into Smith's and heard about this new little Hawaiian restaurant. Place was very clean and had a nice open kitchen. Very friendly workers who checked on us frequently. I had the Chicken Katsu (onolicious!) Came with two scoops rice and mac salad... My boyfriend had the Steak and Pork Chili Dog (this thing took up the entire plate!) and waffle fries. Everything was very tasty I can't wait to go back and try their Teri chicken and island burger, which first caught my eye."
5,"Came here for AZ Spa Week and it was a great experience!! I got a $50 Stress Melting Treatment (Normally $230!!)

John was my treatment specialist and was super personable and sweet. The changing room is a bit small//tight if there are multiple gals changing at the same time. But otherwise, the whole spa is CLEAN!

I would go here more often if I could afford it!"
5,Great food and prices. Was a nice night to sit outside. There was only one server but we didn't wait too long for food but we weren't in any rush. Everything we ordered was great with good portions and hot temperature.  We will return.
5,Great Monday night casual dining and the staff is very friendly I had Rebecca! She was very nice
5,This place is my favourite. They're open 24hrs and the food is comforting and always hot fresh and really delicious.
5,"Great sushi and spring rolls! 

I ate here 8 nights in a row while I was in town for work. Every night I would order the sushi to go, and eat it back at my hotel room. It tastes great even 2-3 hours after it was made. 

I tried over half of the special $9.25 8 piece rolls. All were amazing. 

The soy paper sprint rolls are my favorite especially the Avocado roll! 

They also usually have a roll on special for the entire week."
5,"Went to Chef Bens tonight for the first time. Wanted to get some sushi and some appetizers to go and this is close to my house so I have it a try. When you walk into this place it reminds you of a typical Asian food express restaurant, but the sushi is what sets them apart. They have an extensive sushi menu and you will not be disappointed. I ordered the salmon sashimi, some nigiri, the big four roll, a salmon roll and crab puffs. The lady that took my order was very patient with me and helpful. She pointed out that one of the rolls I ordered and the crab puffs were on a happy hour special that came with a soup or salad. I placed my order and waited maybe 6 minutes before they were calling my name and handing me my food! The lady who handed me my order let me know they even gave me a free order of egg rolls! When I got home my husband and I started eating and we were so excited because everything was delicious! The salmon was fresh and the sushi rice was perfect. We will definitely be back again!"
5,"I had the most amazing facial today with Lavonna! See her for a glowing, radiant complexion! She is fabulous!"
5,Can't say enough good things! Took my partner here for  essential massages while on a weekend getaway for his birthday. My massage was wonderful with Rachel! She was super gentle and sweet. The whole staff were very friendly and accommodating. Very clean and chic. They even surprised us with complimentary birthday cakes to take with us at the end of the treatments. Will definitely come back next time we're out in AZ!
5,"I go there at least once a month. Amazing selection on wine, the services is always good and very friendly, the pastas that I have ordered were delicious. I haven't tried them all yet, I always get there Torino pasta and there amazing baked goat cheese salad. The only thing I can say they should improve on is there mussels, they were not very fresh the last couple times i tried it. Other then that i love this place, weather  you want to go in a date or bring your family. And the price is pretty good for what your getting :)"
5,"I've been getting pedicures here for years. The service is impeccable from the moment you walk in the door until the moment you step out. I've only ever been to Helen because after my first pedi, I didn't ever need to go to anyone else! Helen is wonderful but all the gals here are fantastic so you can't go wrong. Go pamper yourself."
5,"I don't hand out 5 stars casually. But Chef Ben Sushi & Asian Express deserves it. I went there today for the first time, and enjoyed a wonderful lunch. I work nearby and can only wonder why it's taken me 2 months to check this place out!

I was greeted as soon as I walked in, and asked if it was for here or to go. When I said ""for here,"" I was invited to sit anywhere I wanted (they were not very busy, lucky for me!). The server was very efficient, and her attentiveness was spot-on. Not annoying, but there every time I would have wanted her to be.

I started with the egg drop soup. It was as good as any I've had before, better than most. Other options were miso soup or a salad. 

I ordered the ""B"" Bento Box. Teriyaki Chicken, steamed white rice, four chicken dumplings, and a California roll (8 pieces). 

Everything was delicious, the portion sizes were filling without being too much, the wasabi was perfect... okay, to sum up, I had a great lunch, okay?

Along with a diet soda (fountain drink, free refills) my bill was just over $12. I left $15 and went away happy, and ready to tackle the afternoon."
5,"Wow, super surprised to see the negative reviews, not sure if they changed things, or if some of the bad reviews are bogus, because my experience was perfect.

My pool pump was making a crazy loud noise, and then just shutting off completely. Like others, I have a home warranty through Old Republic, and I placed a service request. I had previously placed a request for the same problem, and got a different company- which was a nightmare.

As luck would have it, I got an email back from Old republic saying Aaron Pools was going to take care of it. About an hour after getting the email, I got a call from Stephanie, who was super friendly, and helped to get me on the schedule.  The day before my appointment, I got a reminder phone call from her, and again she was very nice and answered all my questions.

Today, Weston showed up to look at the pool pump. He spent time explaining what the probable causes of the failure were, and he began his diagnostics. Weston was super friendly and answered my million and one questions. After just a few minutes, he identified that the motor was cooked. My options were to put in a refurbished one, or for a minor fee get a brand new motor. I opted to get the new motor, and Weston didn't put any pressure either way, in fact he suggested going with the refurb, so I was only out the cost of the copay. Weston installed the brand new pump, and when I fired it up, I have never heard such a quiet pump, and my pool vacuum was swimming around so fast I thought it was on bath salts.

I really appreciated the customer service, support, and professionalism from Weston and Aaron Pools. I would have NO hesitation in recommending them to a friend. In the world of home warranty repair, we know that it's a crapshoot, but it's nice to win once in a while, and with Aaron Pools, you have legit people taking care of your summer survival tool. Thanks Aaron Pools, I appreciate it!

(Footnote. I can't help but point out the majority of the negative reviews are from people with limited or no profiles, or only one or two reviews and no photos. In the Yelp community, these are called ""Orange heads"" and honestly you need to strongly consider the validity of their reviews. They could just as easily be employees of a competing business. I always put more stock in reviewers with a good history of reviews, and Elite status reviews are usually very legit. Good luck!)"
5,"We were looking for real Italian food and Grazie did not disappoint.

We went three times and every time it was full, we only waited a few minutes before being seated and it was well-worth it. 

The atmosphere was great, staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the food...

The food was absolutely wonderful. We tried pasta, salads and dessert, each was equally delicious.

The prices were very reasonable, cheap in comparison to what we would pay for a meal of equal size in Alberta."
5,"OMG!  I love this steakhouse!!! My Ribeye was cooked perfectly! The portobello fries were delicious!!! Decent wine list..,,and my server took good care of me. I didn't care for the Manager...He was really rude!!!! Note to Manager: Don't  interrupt your staff when they are speaking to a customer JUST because a high-roller enters the restaurant!!!"
5,Some previous reviews painted a bad picture but we tried it anyway and the service was great as was the food. One of the best Dennys experiences in a long while.
5,"It is a good one. #14 is good and also the spring rolls. The broth ishave lots of falvor and trip, meatballs and meat are tender. I will recomend this place for lunch."
5,"My only complaint is that they need to also add one of these stores downtown and/or the east side!

Trader Joe's has a great selection and the prices are so much more reasonable than other health food stores in the area. The Willy Street coop is a second best. 

I love that most products are free of artificial colors and flavors!

The staff is helpful and friendly!!!

Did I mention they need another location on the east side?!"
5,I highly recommend the salon they can do anything that you are looking for and their staff is absolutely incredible and accommodating! I recommend Dessirae Henderson for your hair she is a true artist!
5,"Best stuff on earth right here! I've been there countless times from actual sit sown dining, to just running in and grabbing a Spam Masubi on my lunch break. its great."
5,"Mike came out in response to my home warrant call.  I was contacted by the company right away and Mike was even running ahead of schedule!  He was incredibly knowledgeable, able to correctly predict was was wrong simply by looking at my pool.  It turned out that my issue was not covered by the home warranty and was about to cost me.  However, Mike found the exact part I needed without replacing an entire section, and so I only had to pay the basic call fee.  All the while, he explained everything that was going on and answered all of my questions.  What a positive experience!"
5,"I can't believe I waited so long to go to Trader Joes! My experience exceeded my expectations. Parking was easier than I anticipated and the prices were lower or average compared to other grocery stores in the Madison area. 

Their flower section was impressive. They are fresh and reasonable priced and they have the best cards! I will definitely be returning to get more cards, flowers, and ""Everything but the Bagel"" seasoning!"
5,"I go here all the time. It's cheap. Interesting variety of food. Lots of cheap wine.

The only thing is every once and a while you'll find some basic food item isn't even available here. I guess TJ's is sometimes a victim to its own uniqueness."
5,"I'm in love with the Bento box deals as well as the sushi. The spicy sushi rolls do not disappoint. I used grub hub to deliver and it was at the door within the half hour, much faster than anticipated on the app. I will definately be trying more from here in the future."
5,"We stopped here for a quick sandwich while our car was serviced. Let me just say that they give you free samples and they were amazing. We tried the cinnamon burst bread with their apple butter. The apple butter tasted like Fall time . 

My husband is a fanatic of tuna sandwiches and usually he doesn't like it from other places only the ones I make him. But today he ate the sandwich  in a heartbeat and he's hooked. We live about 35 minutes away but I guarantee we will make the trip for his tuna sandwich. 

I got the egg and cheese sandwich and it was amazing. It's tasted like an omelette inside of some warm bread. The veggies are not mixed in the egg which I like just in case there is something I don't like I can pick out but everything on it tasted amazing. I only wished they had hot sauce but I get it's not a breakfast joint it's a bread company. 

Thank you to LeAnne the cashier for letting us know about the rewards program. That will definitely make the trips worth it knowing we are getting points to get free  bread. Yummmm!!"
5,Great food and atmosphere!  Try the shrimp and grits and grape salad. Great place to watch the game and play pool.
5,"The best part about this place was the great service. The owner, his son and our waitress were extremely attentive . The food is definitely on the heavier side but it was good. I would definitely recommend trying it. Its a small place but it has a line out the door on Sunday. My boyfriend had a fried sandwich and I had their version of the Reuben. The prices were extremely reasonable. I will definitely be back."
5,"Great food. Great prices and friendly services. I try pho and my friend have "" bo luc lac"". It's really good too. Definitely come back."
5,"Came here for my birthday. Great service and great food. 
Loved our server. Forget his name but he was an older gentlemen and so enthusiastic. 
Really liked him. And the food is always consistent and great. 
Restaurant is clean, plenty of options for food and drinks. 
Will be back!"
5,This is seriously THE most amazing bread shop and sandwich shop in town!!! I love it! Always such friendly staff and immaculately clean!
5,"This place was recommended by a buddy of mine. So glad we took the ti.e to try this place out. Ya, there are other Hawaiian food joints out there. This is our new favorite place! Portions are huge!! Great place! Love the food and the owners are really nice"
5,"Always great service & wonderful food at Waverly's!!!!! It has become our ""Must Have"" when we visit Las Vegas!!! The General Manager, Mr. Todd Landis, always has the entire staff smiling and ready to give 5Star Service!!! Thanks Todd, & keep up the great work Waverly's!!!!!"
5,I always have a wonderful experience when I come here. Sharron gives excellent manicures and pedicures. She's very thorough and gentle. All tools are sterilized and everything is sparkling clean. Big plus. It is always a pleasure to come here.
5,"So strange to see all of these comments. My experience with Aaron pools has been spectacular. I have been using their service now for over six years in both repairs and for cleaning services. The technicians that have serviced my pool equipment have always dressed professionally and have been extremely knowledgeable in explaining repairs. 

Thanks for your service. I'd like to personally thank Stephanie for being so friendly and fitting me into the schedule."
5,"The wait time wasn't bad at all. The most I waited at all my appointments was maybe 15 mins. I've waited longer at airports and when it comes to my vision I don't care how long I have to wait. 

Tehani at the front is so sweet and remembers everyone. The refractive counselor Rebecca was always on top of her game and even called me after my surgery to make sure I was ok. Britney was so caring and attentive and made sure I was comfortable right before my surgery.  Dr. Wellish was so amazing and awesome and kept me calm during the entire procedure. His staff is so caring and attentive. Dr. McCandless is so nice and caring and answered any questions I had.  Bernie did my pre-op exams and was awesome as well. 

I was -6.25 in one eye and -5 in the other and now I have 20/15 vision which is better than 20/20.  It's a freaking miracle I tell you!

I definitely recommend Dr. Kent Wellish if you're considering LASIK surgery. I can't thank him and his entire staff enough!"
5,"Friendly, fast and DELICIOUS!! This is a place to go when your looking for a quick good sandwich. I love how you can customize your own sandwich or if your indecisive they have a list of sandwiches you can choose from!"
5,"I just had the most amazing lunch for under $10.00.  I go here all the time and it's consistently good.  Today I tried something different and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm from LA and I'm really picky about my sushi - but I love Chef Ben

Your Customer
Roz"
5,Aaron Pools did a great job for my home warranty fix. They called me quickly and the tech Andrew they sent out was very knowledgeable and even helped with another issue my pool was having.
5,The first time I came to Great Harvest was just because I drove by and saw it. When I walked in a friendly employee greeted me and offered me a huge sample of a cookie. I bought a salted caramel cookie (amazing!) and a loaf of sourdough bread. I'm in love with the bread now. Their sandwiches are awesome too!
5,I used a few other Yelp reviews to decide to go here. It's a little out of the way but it's totally worth it. So good. My daughter LOVES the boba.  The pho was so good and the waitress was the nicest lady in the world. Will definitely return many more times.
5,"I'm officially taking back what I said earlier. KAUAI CAFE IS MY NEW FAVORITE  SPOT FOR HAWAIIAN FOOD. They don't have desserts or a big menu but with what they serve looks so good and taste so good that you make plans for the next visit when you're still there and still recovering from that kanack attack.

What to order? Order anything and everything. The mahi mahi plate came with pieces of crispy fried battered mahi mahi. It's fried but felt light and not greasy at all. Perfect crunchiness on the outside, moist and delicious on the inside.

If you come here on Friday you have to eat their lau lau feast. You dont get lau lau OR kalua pig like another Hawaiian place in the SW, you get lau lau AND kalua pig AND you get more extra items thats not old like that same other place. What else you get other than the lau lau and kalua pig? Some  haupia like a coconut gelatin. Poi, pounded up taro just add sugar if you dont like the taste, I don't usually. Squid luau, its green but just try it. Chicken long rice, lomi lomi salmon, poki, rice and mac salad. I finished eating one on my own then went back to work with a smile on my face. 

The Island burger looked good too and came with thick sliced potato chips made right there. Oxtail is delicious and perfect now that its colder outside, read my other review or just try it haha. Its tender and what I've been craving for the last few weeks. Could've sworn they were open today but looks like I have wait a few days.

Trust me when I say order anything and everything. When you go, tell me if you notice how good it looks. I don't know how to explain it, everything looked bright like I was looking out of a HD lense. LOL I don't know I'm weird.

Service is always excellent."
5,"This was my very first visit to the Red Door Spa. At first I thought the price was a little high, but let me tell you....completely worth it. I got a Signature Manicure and a Milk and Honey pedicure. They were absolutely wonderful. I HIGHLY recommend the technician Sandra. She was very professional, creative and thorough. Thank you Sandra!"
5,"Went with mother in law who lives in Phoenix. We were originally scheduled for hair appointments but morning of we had a change of heart. She got a pedicure. I splurged on makeup, bought a couple of lipsticks and was impressed by Elizabeth Arden's classy and fun colors. I could not resist and bought a beautiful makeup box of eyeshadows, lipsticks etc so mother in law could enjoy. Staff are very courteous and professional. I would definitely recommend and return."
5,This is such a cool little place to get food from. The folks who run it are always so nice to talk to. The food is always good. I always get the chicken katsu plate lunch and it never disappoints. Give it a try!
5,"Came here to try out the kbbq as the pictures people have posted made it look so good. It did not disappoint. I went with my family of 4, and we got kalbi and pork belly (each of the orders required minimum of two orders). These orders also includes a soup, I believe one was tofu soup and one was soybean soup. 

As for the meat, they did not skimp out on the portions of pork belly or the kalbi. The pork belly had a good mix of ones with layers of fat, and ones a bit more lean (but still some fat). That worked out with my family as my mom doesn't like tooo many layers of fat. There were enough side dishes to go with the food as well. As the usual Korean restaurants, side dishes were unlimited refills, as well as the lettuce. It reminded me of being in Korea.

The Kalbi was marinated very well with lots of flavors and we tried not to overcook it, so it wasn't too tough.

The only downside was that there was no ventilators above each table, so it can get a bit stuffy inside. 

In the end, we were all satisfied, and had food leftover to pack. I can't wait until the next time I go!"
5,"I'm so glad my husband and I found this place! We come as often as we can. Delicious pho at a great price, the Thai tea is really good too. The people who work here are wonderful, always remember our order, very friendly."
5,"Great food, great staff. I usually get the chicken Cesar salad, always delicious. Beef wellington is amazing! Get portabello mushrooms for your appetizer. You won't be disappointed. Ask for Frederick for the best service."
5,"Food was really good! We tried Lau Lau plate (only available Fridays and Saturdays) , hamburger steak, and mahi mahi. One of the best local food places in Vegas! Service was good too! Coming back for sure!!!"
5,Dr.Langford is the best I have received awesome care. I ended up getting an infection in both eyes after getting pink eye that has taken over a month to heal. I had no insurance and he made sure he saw me every week at no charge for over a month. I am extremely grateful and cannot say enough about dr Langford and his staff he truly is an exceptional dr. Thanks again for all the great care
5,always come here late at night to do homework and everyone is so nice! service is always fast and friendly. beats starbucks wifi!
5,"We were immediately greeted and offered a free sample of the their bread. Bread was delicous, we immediately bought 2 loafs. Bread is made fresh at the store. Very friendly service. They also sell sandwiches, will update when I try their sandwiches."
5,"Yesterday was mother's day and my family and I made a reservation earlier in the week to eat here. They had the table ready for us when we arrived and we sat down immediately. Our waiter was extremely nice and patient with everyone. We got our drinks and food in a very timely manner and everything was delicious. No one had any problems with their food, except one and the waiter fixed it before she could even tell him what was wrong. My drink from the bar was excellent. Great lunch for all 13 of us!"
5,The Monte Cristo sandwich is balls to the wall amazing!! I'm always trying to eat healthy during lunch but I just had to have it!!
5,"My experience with wellish vision institute was great. Their staff is amazing. Taylor is a true asset to the team and delivers great customer service. my initial consultation for LASIK was easier than most eye check ups given I hate anything near my eyes. I felt confident with Dr. wellish, he is one of the best eye Dr's in town. Every time I mentioned his name everyone is familiar with him and has nothing out positive things to say. He is not the cheapest but I wouldn't go anywhere for a lesser price - we only have one set of eyes"
5,"Dr. Wellish and his entire team is beyond amazing!!! My husband had Lasik almost 10 years ago in California, and I had always wanted to have it, but was too scared.I had a few consultations with doctors that were close to my home, but I just wasn't feeling the connection. I ended up calling my husbands doctor in Beverly Hills, and he told me that Dr. Wellish was an amazing doctor, that he highly recommends....he said he's the best of the best! I made my appointment with Dr. Wellish, and knew from the moment that I stepped foot in his office that I was in the right place. The testing that they put you through to make sure that you are a candidate is impeccable. No other place that I went to prior even did half of what Dr. Wellish did as far as testing. I met with Dr. Mattheis prior to meeting with Dr. Wellish and he was just wonderful. At the end of my appointment Dr. Wellish came into the room to congratulate me and tell me I was a candidate for PRK. Dr.Wellish is so gentle, kind, warm and extremely intelligent!!!! He put all of my worries at ease and I was so excited to have the PRK! I did my first eye in October, and then waited to do my second eye after the holiday season. The procedure took just a few minutes...and I felt ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! In my opinion...I would rather have the PRK than a teeth cleaning!!! The first eye I had done i now have 20/20 vision in, and the second eye was just done last Thursday so the eye is still healing. I wish Dr. Wellish and his staff could be my doctor for everything...not just eyes!!!! I love him and his team so much...and am so grateful that he was recommended  to me. I can't think of any doctor that I have been to in the past that I would hold to the same standard as Dr. Wellish...he's in a class of his own, and I'm so happy that he is my doctor!!!!"
5,"Really liked this place, even tho it got super busy. Good food, good beer selection, really nice atmosphere. Price was on par for quality. Wait staff and bartenders were very friendly and attentive. Will be back if I am ever this way again!"
5,"I just had THE BEST Italian sandwich EVER, with just the right amount of sauces and ingredients... it was made perfectly ...by a gal...I think her name was Kenalee.  Soft delicious bread baked to perfection.  DELICIOUS Italian sauces. BEST sandwich I have had anywhere in a long time!!! Mmm!"
5,My family's go-to restaurant for special occasions. We love this restaurant. The food and drinks are great. Service is amazing. We always look forward to going back!!
5,"The food and staff is amazing! The owner is super sweet and she took the time to talk to us. I ordered the hamburger steak and my bf ordered the beer battered chicken with fried rice. We also ordered the poke. The hamburger steak was delicious and the portions are giant! The hamburger steak is like the loco moco but no egg. The gravy on it was good and had mushrooms in it. The poke salad was good as well, with giant slices of tuna, it was plenty. It was seasoned with salt and onions on top. The beer battered chicken was cooked to perfection. It was crispy on the outside and juicy meat in the inside. The gentleman that was serving us was super nice and was always checking up on us. I love small businesses with lots of passion. I will definitely will be back to support them!"
5,"Such great pho! I've loved it the two times I've gone. Tonight I went to get pho to go because I'm sick with the flu. I told the gal at the register where I ordered that I was sick so I'd wait in my car right out front while they made it. I told her I didn't want to get anyone else sick. She was SO KIND! Within minutes of me getting in my car, she stepped out and gave me a ginger tea to sip on while I waited to help my flu. If everyone in the world was this considerate, the world would be an infinitely better place!"
5,"I stopped by today on the recommendation of a friend.      Being I have L&L right next to my office and love their offerings I figured I would give Kauai a chance.   My only regret is not finding/trying this place sooner.     L&L is good but Kauai was out of this world.  

I ordered the Kauai chicken and their homemade waffle fries to go.   On the drive home my car smelled so amazing that I had to open up the bag and at least try a fry or two.   I was excited to find that they are cut thin (the way I like my fries) and crispy.   On my first bite the flavor exploded and I was immediately hooked.     I must have had about half the order by time I pulled up in front of my house.   

I grabbed the food and walked inside and instead of my normal ritual of changing out of work clothes getting comfortable, I immediately opened up the chicken and took a bite.      The meat fell off the bone and just like their fries the flavors were going crazy in my mouth.        

The portions were huge, which I have hard all hawaiian restaurants serve huge portions.     I am excited to have the other halves as leftovers as soon as possible.   

The service was great and the food was spectacular.   It is definitely worth a trip if you are looking for great homestyle cooked hawaiian food."
5,"Their entire menu is awesome. During my lunch hour I order the westerner with a side of mac and cheese. One of the best BBQ I've had in a long time. The sides they serve are also worth checking out too. They have barbecue beans, backed potato casserole, coleslaw, and much more. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves outdoor BBQ. I will definitely be back soon enough."
5,"Bought a package treatment deal for my friend about 2 months ago. She went today and called me back, she was so happy! She said everybody was super nice, very friendly and relaxing atmosphere. She said they offered like a small upgrade. I am real happy to hear that she had such a wonderful day. It was a gift for her and Red Door Spa came thru in making her feel special and appreciated.I want to say thank you to all the people that worked there on April 14."
5,"My boyfriend get takeout from this place whenever we want food that we know won't disappoint. I usually get the happy hour special with miso soup, the big four roll, and the spicy shrimp roll (or 2 egg rolls + 4 crab puffs) and my boyfriend has decided that he's a big fan of the teriyaki chicken bowl. All of these are awesome and well priced! Next time I'm going to eat inside so I can get try some of the fried items - they just don't do well for pick-up or delivery because they quickly get hard and cold - not the restaurants fault.

Overall, it's fast and the people are always friendly. Not to mention that the sushi is good and very inexpensive. Obviously it's not the best in town but I've been there numerous times and I have yet to leave a review because I wanted to make sure it wasn't a flop but trust me, the the food is GOOD and worth the money. They deserve a 5 star review for what the restaurant offers.

You know what you're getting with Chef Ben's. Definitely try it out if you're not trying to break the bank!"
5,Love love love this place! Great customer service and great food and desserts. They offer a variety of bread samples everyday of the week. My favorite is the coconut bread...SO yummy! All their sandwiches are delicious. Can't go wrong with this place. I will keep returning.
5,"Our company placed a big order for our monthly luncheon and they were very accommodating. They helped us order all the great items on their menu and  ordering the right amount for our group! Dawn, especially was very helpful and super nice! 

Definitely will be back to order more! Our favs were the ribs and the Mac salad!! Yum!!!"
5,"Good Kau Kau !   My only compliant and others that I know that frequent Kauai Cafe is that they should charge more money and put some salmon in their lomi lomi salmon. We all have recipes !  Please I realize if it doesn't sell you lose money, but everybody says the samething..."
5,My wife and I are regulars here. We come quite often and sit at the bar for dinner.  The food is consistently good and always comes out hot.  Great service and friendly atmosphere.  It's our go to Italian spot in Vaughan!
5,"This place is honestly one of my husband and my favorite places to eat a nice meal.  The decor is wonderful and comfortable.  The booths huge you.  And the staff is amazing.  This last time we had a new waiter eddie, who turned out to be really great.  Our usual waiter even stopped by the say hi to us!  This place makes you feel special.  The food is phenominal!  everything tasts wonderful, and the wine is the best.  I am always excited when we plan our dinners here."
5,"I can't believe there aren't more reviews for this business. I have zero complaints.... from the initial consult to the the final product I have been 100% satisfied. The staff is friendly and efficient. The process is clear cut with no unanswered questions. Wait times are minimal, while results are optimal. I will recommend anybody I know to Wellish Vision Institute without hesitation."
5,"Aaron Pools has been out to my house twice and I was very happy with their work both times! Aj came out here the first time to replace my sand filter for my pool and he did a wonderful job and was very nice! And recently Mike and Aj came out to my house to install a grab bar hand rail for my pool. They did a wonderful job and cleaned up the area fantastic!
The cost was very fair and was half of what another company quoted me and I knew that they were trying to rip me off.... I would refer my friends and family to Aaron Pools anytime.... Thank you!"
5,"Love the spicy onion rolls! We have been coming here for years and we love it. The staff is friendly, the sushi is made to order and the restaurant is clean with a good atmosphere. I also love the dumplings and the egg drop soup. It's a must when in the Avondale/Goodyear area."
5,The price is good and the sushi tasted great my normal sushi place though open had no cook or sushi chef so decided to try this place again I was impressed. Got a bento a which is different sushi and rolls and I bought a 9 dollar roll spent a lil over 20 after eating realized the bento would have filled me plenty lol. I was happy and will come back
5,"Fantastic store full of inexpensive, quality food and drink. The layout is easy to navigate and find all the essentials.

Love the array of frozen seafood and veggies. The coffee selection is great [don't forget to grind it yourself] and I love the green juice [!!!].

As always, the staff is super attentive and helpful.

Love the covered parking lot (although I could do without the meter)"
5,"If I could sing the praises of the staff and Dr. Wellish from the heavens I would! I am so glad I chose this facility and Dr. Wellish to do my Lasik, if I had to do it all over again - I would go back!! From the initial intake with Theresa to the pre and post-op with Bernie and Dr. McCandless, every single staff member was so nice and professional and just the absolute best!

I was an absolute wreck before my surgery - literally a wreck. Crying in the pre-op waiting room. Oh yes. I was that person.  The young lady downstairs (I think her name was Tracy??) who gives you your meds before you go into the surgery did so much to help calm me down (mostly, gave me more meds) but she also was so comforting and really just helped put me at ease that by the time it was my turn, I was ready to go! (also, the two Xanax and like 8 Valium had kicked in...I am sure that had nothing to do with it at all....) And then after the surgery when I went home I woke up to a text message from her asking me how I was feeling and if I needed anything! SO NICE! 

And then Dr. Wellish. He was just great. Explained everything that he was doing during the surgery and walked me through the procedure so that I wasn't surprised by anything. Bernie who did my pre-op was in there as well which was comforting.  My surgery went perfectly.  I now have 20/20 vision - no complications, no problems and am so happy I went through with it. My only regret is I didn't get the surgery sooner.

OH! And I can't forget Tehani - the patient relations girl at the front desk who set up all my appointments. You can tell why she is in charge of patient relations. So nice and what a personality!! Answered all my questions - remembered me every time I came into the office (probably because I was that 32 year old girl who came with her mom and was absolutely terrified. Yep. #noshame) 

I almost wish I needed a correction or something with my surgery - everyone at the office was so nice and I wish they could all be my friends. (knock on wood)

Thanks Dr. Wellish and staff. You guys are awesome! I will (and have) recommended anyone I know who is interested in Lasik to your office!"
5,"First things first, try their pumpkin bread.  Moist and spicy and full of pumpkin flavor.  Yum!   

Now on to the sandwiches. Their made on their homemade bread and the meats and veggies are always fresh.  I've tried a few sandwiches there and I love the beef with pesto.  As well as the turkey with cranberry.  

Service is friendly and they have preserves and spreads on sale.  As well as sauces etc.  

Love this place"
5,"Mike, the owner, personally came out to address a spa light issue that ended up just being a bad bulb. He changed the bulb out as a favor, even though we were outside of our warranty period. Thank you, Mike, for your customer service!"
5,Have been coming here for years and they are always spot on!  Service is always fast and the food is consistent. They run these daily lunch specials for around 6.50-8.00 and that includes your tea. Try the Baked chicken on Thursdays or my favorite is the Blackened fish on Fridays. They do a pretty good happy hour as well.
5,"Delicious and so fresh! And our server Kim was so friendly and helpful. The shaken beef was perfect. A very wide range of dishes, easily accommodated everyone's tastes and dietary needs. Tee even offered suggestions and items that were not on the menu, for our vegan daughter. We'll definitely be back again and again. There's so many more things to try!  :)

Went back this week and tried the Crispy Noodle with chicken, beef and shrimps. And this time I remembered to snap a pic. So delicious!  :)))"
5,"Aaron Pools was assigned by my home warranty company as the service provider for  my pool pump, which was leaking.  I was contacted by Aaron Pools very quickly after placing my service order online with the warranty company.  They were able to schedule a technician (AJ) the next day.  AJ showed up on time, diagnosed the problem, and came back within a couple of hours with the needed parts.  I am very happy with the service provided by AJ and Aaron Pools."
5,Just a fyi it is being remodeled and is closed should be back open at end of September
5,"This review is for Hannah who helped me out at the Bakery as I was passing thorough town! 

Greeted me. Kindly explained to me about their ways of getting things done from scratch and how variety is added every day. Super sweet. Gave me a delicious sample too!! 

The bakery is CLEAN, and inviting. The music was nice too. 
And their retail is so tempting!!! Too bad I had no more room in my car!"
5,Desiree a great colorist and stylist. Very nice and really knows her stuff. Lucy in the spa does fabulous eyebrows!
5,"Had out of town company and decided to show them some decent Woodbridge restaurants.
Service was fantastic...our male waiter was stellar...friendly, humorous, attentive and knowledgeable regarding the menu.
As our out of town guest was overwhelmed by their menu, we decided to get 3 different dishes and share them..with each of us selecting one dish.
I chose their potato pizza. Still the best out there..it was delish.
Person 2 chose their gnocchi in a tomato sauce. IMHO...it was the weakest of the dishes we ordered.....probably because I prefer my gnocchi in anything other than a tomato sauce. However, it was still very good.
Person 3 ordered a pasta dish with chicken, rapini and an herb garlic sauce. It was, IMHO..the hit of the night. I'll go back to order this dish myself. If I could have licked the bowl, I would have, but I had to settle on sopping up the sauce with bread.
We then opted for 2 desserts.....their tiramisu and their meringue cake. Both were excellent and were consumed fairly quickly.
All in all, a great experience. Our out of towner loved it !"
5,This place is amazing!!  Love love love Jamie!! He has changed my life. The salon is professional and really knows their stuff!! Thank you!
5,"I have only had mani/pedi's at the Red Door, but they are the best I've ever had anywhere. I don't have artificial nails, and I've always had problems with the polish on my nails chipping - like the very next day!!!  I don't know what Gina does, but the polish on my fingernails lasts a full week, and then they don't chip, they merely wear at the tips. And the toe polish lasts weeks & weeks! 

The warm 'bucky' on the shoulders is an added bonus as are the complimentary neck/shoulder massages (when the masseuse has time)"
5,"I shouldn't have waited as long as I did to have LASIK done.  I was super, super nearsighted before the surgery, and now I'm seeing 20/20 without glasses or contacts.  I did A LOT of research for a couple years beforehand, got a recommendation from my eye doctor, and went for a consultation twice with the patient folks at Wellish Vision Institute before I finally decided to JUST DO IT!  

The staff at Wellish is awesome!  Like I said, they're very patient and take the time to explain everything so you are comfortable with the process and procedure.  I had no complications, although I do recommend that if you have LASIK--LISTEN TO EVERYTHING THEY TELL YOU TO DO!  Dry eyes are one of the side effects and I can see how patients that don't listen to the instructions could cause their own complications by not taking care of themselves.

I would absolutely do it all over again and I would only trust Dr. Wellish to do it.  I should not have waited as long as I did--the results are fantastic!!!"
5,"Decently priced great broth and the spring rolls are fresh, not old  like some other places. Oh I got the beef broth.  If I'm in the area I'll definitely be going again."
5,My pool timer went bad and Aaron pools came out same day pin pointed problem and installed timer at a very reasonable cost.  Then about 6 months later my pool cleaner died.  I contacted Aaron pools for recommendation on replacement. Again they came out and replaced old with new at a very reasonable cost. They also replaced my backwash hose at no cost. My pool looks great and is problem free. I would definetly recommend Aaron pools for any large or small problem.
5,"It's the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa; what more can I say?  Great, relaxing experience all around."
5,"Recently opened, bright and freshly renovated dining area, experienced kitchen, wait, and management. What's not to like? Food is delicious, healthy and consistent. The owners of this restaurant were managers of the popular Im Ga Ne down the street. Open 24hrs, reasonable prices. Check it out!"
5,We get the pork belly table BBQ every time! The value is really good and good portion for 2. The side dishes are good and they refill them if you ask. The soup that came with the combo is really nice and I recommend to choose the tofu soup.
5,"My pool looked terrible and was in need of an acid wash. Alex from Aaron Pools arrived on time, set the pump to drain the pool, returned the next day and completed the acid wash. Pool looks fantastic! Thanks, guys!"
5,"Just had lunch here with a coworker.   Place was packed with a capital 'P'.   We probably had to wait some 15 minutes to get a table.   Once we finally did, I ordered the Monte Cristo while my friend had the Gyros (not very Cajun, I'll give you that!)   We both had sweetened Ice tea to drink.    

The ice tea was very very nice.... Best ice tea I've had in quite a while.   Granted, it was sweetened, so that could have something to do with it.

Monte Cristo?   Damn!   I'm not a connoisseur but this is the best deep fried French Toast Ham & Cheese sandwich I've ever had.   Yummy!   And it cost me all of 10 bucks.   Well worth it!"
5,Awesome and home made fresh breads .... congrats move to corner store and look great and more room for customer
5,"I see there are a lot of this in the Charlotte area, and I can't speak for those, but I loved this place.  It was just a little pricey, but I really enjoyed the food, and the beverages.  The service would have received the Gold Star, except the server forgot to bring the tea we ordered.  

We went to this place because it was near our hotel, and the hotel actually gave us a coupon for 10% off.  I'm glad we took them up on their offer.  They had a Garden Burger that was as good as the one at Red Robin, and I believe that is the best I've ever eaten.  It did not, however, come with the bottomless fries offered at Red Robin.  The fries on this one looked bad, but actually were pretty good.  They were good enough for us to order more.  The meal was excellent, really hit the spot, and, except for that one noted glitch, the service was great.  

I also enjoyed an alcoholic beverage since there were no liquor stores in the area.  I had a ""Tennessee Lemonade,"" or something like that, with whiskey in a lemonade type drink.  I loved it.  I had two, even though they were kind of pricey for my budget.  

This place reminded me of the Yardhouse in Lakewood, CO, or any higher level sports bar.  Good food, and good service, but it costs a little bit more.  This place would be fine and perfect for entertaining family on the way through town, or for watching any sport on the big screen TV."
5,"We tried the click through seating and that seemed to work very well.  Our server was awesome and patient with our party of 7 and the need for two checks.  She was attentive and very efficient.  The food came out in a timely manner and all orders were correct.  Yahoo!  Great experience tonight, which I appreciated since we were celebrating a birthday."
5,"First time here. Try the she crab soup if you're here on Friday or Saturday, and the Cajun Salmon is excellent. Great service, friendly waitress, and the food was top-notch. Good beer selection as well!"
5,"Had dinner at Waverleys on Saturday night to celebrate my wife's birthday and our friend's anniversary. Our waiter ""Nills"" was awesome and the food was even better! The escargot appetizer and portebello fritta were to die for and the main course was great as well. Will be back to Waverleys during our next visit to Vegas."
5,"Just returned from a fabulous dinner to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. Manager Todd and server Nils and the entire staff went out of their way to make our evening special and surprise us, including working with our relatives back East. The short ribs were succulent and tasty while the scallops were the best we have had in town.  Try the chocolate cake and creme brûlée for dessert. It was made to share. Waverlys never disappoints and always surprises with their attention to detail. It is one of our regular haunts and we will be back. Thank you.  Ask for a booth with Frederick or Nils."
5,This is my new go to place for Pho. My wife and I are on keto and they offer low carb Pho with cabbage instead of noodles. At first I was hesitant but gave it a try since we wanted Pho but didn't want to kick our diet. It was actually pretty good. We are there often enough now that the cashier recognizes us and knows our regular order. She is sweet and the food is good. Glad to recommend it.
5,It's awesome for those who love meat and combos here are cost-efficient! Besides it opens for all day !
5,Went here on a work trip. We were looking for a quick good spot and this place was perfect. Loved the chicken pita and my coworker loved her grilled chicken sandwich. Service was wiki and really nice!!! Definitely recommend this spot.
5,"First time here, absolutely amazing stylist Matthew Geyer, such attention to detail I will definitely recommend using him and I look forward to my future visits!!"
5,Excellent! Top notch service and wonderful food!! We will tell all our friends and family and look forward to many returns. So yummy!
5,"At a time where my soul isn't happy, this veggie pho is definite comfort food.. amazing. My best pho place prior feels like a 7/10 to this 10/10 place hands down. The broth is rich  and hot and the furthest thing from watered down like some others tend to be."
5,"He's the eye doctor I've ever had. He makes me feel comfortable and really cares about his patients and yes,it take awhile before being called and what not but its worth it since he's the best eye doctor in town!!!!:)"
5,Aaron pools has been out 3 times this season for unrelated issues. Each time I was consistently greeted with professionalism throughout the process from the office scheduling to the technician calling me when on his way. Being a new pool owner I was completely clueless. Mike gave me some valuable maintenance tips to help prevent future service calls. It was a good experience every time!
5,"I work in uptown and I frequent here at least once a week for lunch. 

I usually get  a salad, they are always fresh and a pretty big portion.  If I don't get the salad, I opt for the special, they are always under $8 and it  comes with garlic bread and tea. Great value!

The service and food is always consistent and great!"
5,"Haven't eaten here too often although it isn't far from where I work. Each time I've enjoyed something new based off the friendly, young staff's recommendations. They have deals going on once in a while and their prices are great. Overall, everything is delicious and the environment is well themes and decorated. Although I know this is a chain, it is in a prime and clean location. As a matter of fact, I think I'll stop by again for lunch tomorrow."
5,"Great place to grab lunch when you are craving sushi and in a hurry. I love their happy hour special. You get two items (30 different choices to chose from) and one side. I always get the tempura shrimp roll, mini teriyaki chicken and egg drop soup. Big portion for the price of $8.99."
5,This place is AWESOME!!!  The breakfast sandwich is the best!  Never mind that you are able to have a free sample of the bread that is made fresh daily.
5,Amazing. Customer service is the best and I will be returning for gift baskets each time I have a need. I was surprised that they give you such large samples of their bread. And it was delicious. The baskets hey custom made for us were affordable and very professional. Good job guys.
5,Best mani pedi ever. A little pricey but worth it. Miranda is excellent.
5,"I love steak.

My family and I go to Outback frequently, and most often we go to this location.  The food is great, it's affordable, and it's close to my house.

Unfortunately I can't remember her name, but there is one waitress who has happened to have our table several times.  The second time was months after the first, and yet she remembered us...down to our individual orders!  The manager Amanda was very helpful the one time we had a small problem (the salmon was a little underdone in the center) and went out of her way to take care of us.  There are a couple of other servers who haven't left an impression one way or the other, but I have had no negative experiences.  I have no doubt we'll continue to choose this location when my parents are in town!"
5,"So delicious. Real deal, authentic, homemade Hawaiian food. 

I absolutely love the oxtail soup. The broth is so rich and flavorful. It's served with a side of minced ginger, that when added to the soup, gives it that little bite and a pop of freshness. The meat is fall off the bone tender. Mouth watering. 

The barbecue chicken plate lunch is also choice. I've honestly been so addicted to those two dishes that I've yet to venture out! They do a traditional lau lau with poi and haupia and more. It's only served on Fridays so I'm gonna have to make a date for that!"
5,"My husband and I recently discovered this gem of a restaurant! We love the attention to details....everything from their bread basket to their side dishes is amazing! For mid-range steakhouses, this is the best!! The waiters are efficient, really friendly and really knowledgeable about the menu! We love it here! Highly recommend the portabello appetizer, French onion soup & the strawberry salad!"
5,"The Mac Salad is the best I've had in town. 

I recommend the Linka's Mixed Grill, the Pork, Chicken, and Beef are all great."
5,"We went into this location for a fast lunch. We were seating immediately and the hostess was friendly and has a good sense of humor. I had the potato soup which was
creamy and HOT most restaurants serve warm soup. My husband had the steak and it was tender with lots of flavor. Our serve was pleasant and attentive. I would recommend this location for a tasty, fast lunch."
5,"Food:  if you're looking for authentic Italian food, this is the place with a big selection of amazing pastas! I've had the Bruschetta, Paesana (pasta with spicy sausage) and the Penza (rigatoni with bacon). The Penza was my absolute favourite! They serve complimentary bread. 

Ambiance: Nice and not too fancy. 

Price: Average 

Service:  Really friendly and helpful."
5,This is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town. It has a really good facility and great customer service. If you're looking for a place to relax and enjoy a good pho bowl this is the place.
5,"Quick service very tasty food! Love coming here. So if you are tired of the burgers pizza and subs, come on over, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I do every time!!!"
5,"My husband and I stopped here at random, and I must say the food, drinks, and wait staff were pretty awesome! I had the angus beef sliders with fries, and my husband had the six pepper dry rub wings which were ridiculously good! Also try their Apple CinniMule - surprisingly pretty darn good! Overall, great place to stop by if you're looking for a well seasoned meal, good drinks and pleasant staff. Should we ever find ourselves in this area again, we'll definitely come back!"
5,"It's rare when the whole family agrees but everyone liked their food. The sauces they use on the meat are really tasty and the noodles and fried rice were amazing. I liked the music they were playing too upbeat and happy. Only thing that could have made it better is if they had more hawaiian decor, it's nice to feel like you left vegas and imagine you are in hawaii, but the bomb food made up for it and we will def eat there again."
5,Always appreciate high end spa and Red Door doesn't disappoint. I had a facial with LaVonna and she was great! Would highly recommend her!!
5,"I highly recommend you research your doctor VERY carefully and don't try to get the best ""deal.""  I could never wear contacts on the plane (I work on an airplane) because the extremely dry conditions caused too much discomfort and hated wearing my glasses but read hundreds of accounts of botched eye surgeries that kept me from getting it for years.  I researched for about 5 years and finally found a doctor I trusted.  The thing about lasik is that (unless this has changed) ANY doctor can certify to do the surgery.  You don't even have to be an eye doctor.  From what I read even dentists could certify.  That's all fine and dandy (since the machine does the entire procedure) until something goes wrong and you're blind for the rest of your life.  I am an over-researcher and found this guy who is one of, if not, *the* best in the entire country/region.  One of our pilots at work recommended him after he told me about the stricter standards for air force pilots and that Dr. Wellish did his lasik.  People travel from all over the world to have him correct their botched jobs. 

 I have large pupils and thin corneas so I only qualified for the all laser- lasik (where they use a laser to create the flap) which is a more expensive procedure. I think I paid around $3800 in 2009. They give you Valium before to keep your eye from moving.  A suction device is used to keep your eye still (creates ""bruising"" on the whites of your eyes that lasts 7-10 days) It's like a hickey on your eye and it LOOKS awful and painful but it doesn't hurt at all.  You have to wear these protective glasses 24/7 for a number of days (even in the shower) and you cannot wear eye makeup- I believe for at least a week.  At that point you are instructed to only use brand new cosmetics to keep the chances of infection down.  Mine went smoothly and while I now have better than perfect vision I do have minimal ghosting (which I also had with glasses) around street lights at night and dry eyes (but not as bad as when I tried to wear contacts on the plane!)  I currently take 4 fish oil pills a day and that has completely resolved my dry eye issue but if I forget to take them I definitely notice!! 

 I am 110% satisfied with my lasik and would recommend it to anyone willing to do the research and find a doctor they trust with their vision.  While I would do it again in a heartbeat I wanted to give you a better picture of the possible outcome.  Many people experience visual distortions after the surgery and while I do still have a TINY bit of ghosting/halo effect around bright objects at night it was much worse for the first few months and I did experience some difficulty driving at night.  I don't even notice it at all anymore, I'm not sure if it has gone away COMPLETELY, or I've just become used to it.  The only thing that continues to bother me is it's difficult/not enjoyable to read subtitles of white letters on a black background now so if you are REALLY into foreign movies, it might not be for you. Also, since you're probably not accustomed to wearing your glasses naked, you may be surprised that your butt isn't as cute as you remember it now that you have 20/15 vision :0)

5,Had an issue with dinner 2 weeks ago.  Owner (mike) invited us back for a second chance.  My wife and i were blown away!  The maple pork chops were sooo tender and delicious and the prime rib sandwhich was as tender and juicy as u could ask for.  Wr also had the peach sangria which really added a nice kick to our meals.  I would definitely reccomend this place and will for sure come back.
5,Marie was great! Thoroughly enjoyed the signature massage. Nice relaxing and clean space. Only regret was my limited time. Definitely recommend.
5,"Among all my reviews, my best and deepest compliment to the waiter in the downstair level of this Korean Grill House. I gave him extra-gratuity for his effort. Beyond expectation performance. The guy walked and walked, and constantly working. Don't remember his name, but I went back to dine last month, he was still there, skinny Asian guy. Food of Korean Grill House is always standard, but this waiter attracted me back to dine in this location."
5,The service is always great.  The food is awesome and I love the breads they bring to the table. Loved the pecan encrusted chicken. The potatoes are delicious. Good eats
5,"Love this place, I work a few minutes away so I thought I'd try it with some colleagues on lunch - great choice! So fresh, the staff is great and friendly! Will definitely be coming to Grazie regularly! The pizza with soppresata is great!"
5,"I have been going here for over 8 years, everyone is professional. The services are top notch and the staff well educated n analyzing your spa needs. Get a gift card for yourself or a love one, let them pick the services. They provide everything.
When you are done shop and eat at the Biltmore Fashion Park."
5,"I placed a service call with my Home Owners Warranty company regarding my pool heater and it was assigned to Aaron Pools.  The called me very quickly and were very professional on the phone.  AJ arrived at the scheduled time, and called ahead to let me know he was on his way.  He was very knowledgeable about my heater and determined quickly what was wrong.  I mentioned to him that I had guests coming for the weekend and hoped to heat the pool.  He took care of getting the parts and repairing the heater in time for me to have it working for the weekend.

AJ was a pleasure to work with.  Very kind, professional, and explained exactly what was wrong with the heater.  

Thank You AJ and Aarons Pool for the Great Service!!!"
5,"Love the sushi, service and great prices! I come here three or more times a month and I am never disappointed. My favorite roll is the cream cheese roll. YUMMY!"
5,"I've recently turn diabetic and have had to modify my diet considerably. I was under the wrong impression that rice cakes were a good snack item as they are very low in calories ..about 50 to 90 depending on the flavor. But all other things considered my blood sugar value has been a very mild roller coaster. Well time to hit Google and study up on these round tasty treats. Much to my surprise
I discovered that they are nothing more then pure puffed rice. Well we all know that rice is on top of the forbidden list of carbs. Right ? Fellow campers. Of course bread is as well. But reading through all the research and 350 responses one truth stood out like a cheap Saturday night $10.00 chrome pistol in a Mississippi juke joint. 
Pumpernickel bread. 
Instead of the rice cake substitute half a slice of pumpernickel bread. The same 50 calories and no artificial ingredients.
So off to Yelp in my quest to find the best in Vegas- Henderson area. It didn't take long to determine that this bakery would be the answer to my dreams.
I called about 3.30 pm to make sure it was still in stock and their hours of operation. The kind person who answered informed me that they had 3 left and was kind enough to place 1 aside with my name and phone info. Sure glad that I did because by the time I arrived...about an hour later it was the sole survivor. The bakery  has a very large seating area ...a good sign of a heavy loyal customer base. On the left side of the counter is a sampling area...just point and ask and you will receive mamma from heaven. I succumbed to the banana bread....a very wish choice indeed. 
I departed with my pumpernickel loaf tucked under my arm as if I were a star quarter back running for the goal post and the other side determined to place my face in the grass. Of course I made it home without as much as a single red light. Oh how I wish you could savoir the flavor of that first bite...and the second one. What a delight. On a score of 1 to 10 this is with out a doubt an 11. As Clint Eastwood would say...I'll be back."
5,Had dinner here with Diane C and as she stated everything was to notch. The steaks were very tender and cooked spot on. The sides were a la carte but very plentiful. I thoroughly enjoyed my Kobe beef burger with some of the house wine. If I were waiting in my last hour to go to the  chair I'd have another Kobe burger and a glass of wine then be clicking my heels along the green mile. Great place for a nice dinner date or a milestone and priced right.
5,"This place is great to come to. You get a higher quality product for a fair price. If you want a high quality olive oil this is your place. Inexpensive flowers to take home to the family, yup. Underground parking to not have to walk in the WI weather, yup. I honestly don't know what you would want that Trader Joe's doesn't have. 

I always try something new. This time I'm trying the bar soap. I have high hopes but for the price I can't go wrong. It would cost me double to get a quality soap at Woodmans or a Walmart."
5,"Good food, great staff, good prices! Got the portobello sandwich with an extra side of tzatziki sauce to dip my fries in."
5,Literally reminded me of the islands and it was amazing . So good and I would recommend
5,"I had been craving pasta for a good little while and somewhat knew where I wanted to go already too. It has been a while since I've been to Grazie, but I remember the food tasting great and oh my goodness the tiramisu. Finally found someone who was willing to go with me, so I went out with my sister for some Italian food!

I called ahead of time to see whether they were fully packed. Last time I tried going, there was over an hour wait...so we decided to go elsewhere. I wanted to be prepared this time. The gentleman over the phone said they were busy, but it shouldn't be too long of a wait for two people. Okay, great!

We came down and were informed that a table should open up in about 25minutes. So we actually ended up waiting about 10 and had decided what we would order while waiting. 

My sister got the Capri (Linguine with shrimps, clams & diced tomatoes) and I went for my beloved Basta (Spinach linguine with shrimps, green onions & parsley). We didn't wait too long, but had received their complimentary bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic in the meantime. The bread was unfortunately cold and didn't taste like it was freshly taken out of the oven, but the restaurant was full so it was to be expected. 

The food was delicious! I loved my pasta and even though I was just about ready to burst, I still forced myself to finish every last bit of it. My sister tried my dish and loved it too. I tasted some of hers and thought it was pretty good too. It had hints of anise that surprised me. She didn't particularly enjoy that bit about the Capri, but she ate it all! 

Then, how could we finish our meal without Tiramisu. Honestly, it is so delicious. They serve it like three scoops of ice cream and it has all the perfect flavours in it. 

Overall, the atmosphere was great. I feel bad that I cannot remember our waitress' name, but she was so nice. Even the girl that was cleaning the tables made such a wonderful impression on us. I am most definitely coming back here! My sister and I decided that we would try to be less conservative with our choices and try something new like a pizza next time! So stay tuned.."
5,Great place to go for lunch and/or after work for a drink and yummy food! Highly recommend.
5,What ever happened to my initial review of this place?  That was so not cool YELP!
5,"The search for a great Korean restaurant end here. This location is usually very busy, especially during regular lunch and dinner hours. Although, they are great at getting a table set up quickly. The service is very basic but the staff is accommodating and attentive.

The food is second to none in the area. If you're looking for decently priced food (10$-30$) this is a great location. Amazingly enough, you would think that because this location is 24/7, something must be lacking but Huh Ga Ne proves that although they are busy 24/7, they are able to keep up. Would definetely recommend this resturant to anyone!"
5,"Absolutely lovely spa. Friendly, professional service and relaxing ambiance. Great location! Highly recommend getting a massage with John!"
5,"For a birthday present I was referred to Wellish to do lasik on my one eye. Being a ""mono-vision"" contact wearer for the last 10+ years, and contacts for 30+, I was ecstatic to learn they could in fact, do just my one eye also. From the initial consultation with Taylor, thru the procedure and follow-up appointments, I was treated with the utmost care. Their patient and customer service was of the highest caliber, The procedure was quick and relatively painless, and I'm so happy to have done this thru Wellish.  Taylor texted me after the procedure to make sure I was doing ok, genuinely concerned with my welfare, and every time I went into the office, everyone called me by my name and was extremely friendly. I see by other reviews (Morgan R) that they make all their patients a priority and treat each with such care. I was extremely impressed of the level of professionalism and care they exude. I'd recommend this office to anyone thinking of doing laser eye surgery. Thanks Wellish, for my new eyesite!!!"
5,"My go to sushi place when I want something delicious, and I don't mind waiting for delivery. I've been to this place in person maybe once, but I remember it being such a good experience. That's why I still order from here.

I like that happy hour is all the time, and there's endless things I can get from the menu. I really like getting the salad when they ask if I want soup or salad because the salad has a dressing that is so good. The sushi itself is super good also, always ordering Philadelphia rolls or California rolls. Whatever interests me.

There had been times, however, when my delivery person didn't bring me any utensils, or a straw, but it's okay! I still managed. I love this place."
5,Mike has always been quick to respond and competitively priced in the service he has provided over the years.  I always know he has my back!
5,"Had the best deep massage ever! Therapist was smart, talented, and insightful to my needs. Hope to have her again in the future. And the spa is terrific. Nice ambiance and lovely, comfy area to relax and wait. Also loved my pedicure. Excellent, very attentive and skilled."
5,"Very tasty pho. It is on the sweeter side and the size I would say is a small/medium, so it is not enough to share. For $8 it's definitely worth it. Comes out fast and the server was really nice."
5,Great service!!  Just ordered a mani/pedi treatment from them over the phone for my mother-in-law.  This is an annual treat for her on Mother's Day and she absolutely loves it.  This salon is well organized and professional!  And my mother-in-law raves about the quality and service for months.
5,"My wife had lots of eye complaints over the years and she experienced bad vision dry eyes and other problems.  She looked all over for a good eye surgeon and settled in on dr Wellish.  The decision was not an easy one and it took a lot of time, with the custom service that he provided it was the right one.  

When I took her there for the procedure she was seen right away.  They took her back there and did the eyes and you could tell that the equipment was top notch.  Obviously this is a good operation, otherwise why would they allow anyone to watch through the glass.  This doctor has nothing to hide and is proud to put his work on display.  He talked to us both afterward and provided guidance.

The follow up was extensive.  There were precautions given about what she could do in the time following the operation and everything was accurate.  The vision was totally improved better than 20 20 and that was checked by a second independent eye doctor

I can't think of anything not to like"
5,This is place is amazing for their fresh bento boxes. More affordable than other sushi hotspots.
5,This is our new favorite and the kids love it too!! Wonderful and kind staff who always have a smile.
5,"If I could make bread like this I would open my own bakery and be awesome!  This bread is so delicious and their sandwiches are pretty great!  The price is right and they give you free samples of their amazing bread while you wait.  Big samples.  Like whole slices of bread, not mini little bites.  I don't eat a lot of bread so when I do, I want it to be worth it!  My wife also told me this place originated in Montana.  Anything from Montana is good in my book.  This place, Moose Drool, my Wife.  All top notch, and from Montana."
5,"I know that some chain restaurants can be hit and miss, but this specific Outback always treats us right. 

The Victoria fillet with horseradish is always my favorite, and it always is just the right amount.  And I can't say enough about the hot, fresh, brown bread - in fact, that's what usually makes me want to come in.

Our server was friendly and professional, and we got the Chocolate Thunder for dessert, and YUM! Keven isn't a huge chocolate fan, and I thought he was gonna start fighting me over the desert (not really, he's a super generous sweetie!)"
5,I love this place. Kayla is a great waitress. Soda and coffees always filled. Our order taken right away. Food arrived very timely. And delicious!!
5,Omg where to start Darrel! Is the best server ever he make sure you need nothing for the best dining experience. Friendly and very professional outstanding customer service is better than Top5! I go at least 2-3 times a month don't miss out ask for Darrel! Everyone is great but he is a shining STAR.. THANKS ALL SEE YOU SOON. Jennifer Jennifer Jennifer at the bar is the best go get your sidecar or any other amazing Because of them this place is better
5,"As a note, I give stars based on how well the establishment accomplishes what it has set out to do. Happy Moose is a bar and grill. As such, it succeeds masterfully. 

The environment is really cool - renovated from an old EatNPark. The room is filled with local memorabilia and is very spacious. 

All of the food has been great. The French dip, custom burgers, and appetizers are all exceptional. The menu is vast, yet the kitchen seems to be able to pull it all off very well. Surprisingly a lot of the spreads, dips, and sauces are made in house. 

They have a great beer list comprised of about 10 craft draft beers and seasonal bottles. I love the fact that the menu gives you a price for all the alcohol...sooo nice! 

Prices are all very reasonable and the service that I have experienced has been great. The perfect neighborhood bar and grill."
5,"Have never had a bad meal here. Don't be thrown off by the name of the place as its definitely not French! Basically, it's an American Bistro/Greek menu but the price is right and you can't go wrong w the timing and the service."
5,We have been here many times and are always happy with the experience. Everything we have tried on their menu is excellent. Their burgers are probably my favorite. They usually have a nice selection of craft beers as well. Our go to place on a regular night. The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and efficient. We love Happy Moose!
5,"I love that this place is so close!  I traveled across town to eat at other Hawaiian restaurants and Kauai cafe is still at the top of my list! I had Da Surf Rider which had coconut shrimp, macadamia nut scallops, teriyaki beef. It came with fried rice and Mac salad. I loved the way everything was perfectly seasoned. It also had all of my favorite items on one plate! My husband had the hamburger with fries. Their waffle fries are delicious! I can't wait to go back because the food is yummy!"
5,The staff there is very professional and friendly. The doctors were very thorough in assessing if I was a good candidate for Lasiks. Everything was explained in great detail and all of my questions were answered to my satisfaction. The procedure was quick and painless. I am 20/20 in both eyes 4 days after surgery. Nothing short of a miracle.
5,I am not sure about the other services. But there is a hidden gem here. Lucy is an aesthetician. I strictly go to her for all of my brow waxing. My brows are a challenge and most have royally screwed them up. My brows should be the test for beauty schools. Lucy is seriously the brow whisperer. Go to her for your wax needs-- she is in a class all her own. This is the only reason why I give them 5 stars. Also the front desk service is always attentive and super nice.
5,"FINALLY got to eat here for the first time today. It's a but if a journey from where we live, but with pops in town visiting.. All the more reason to take a cruise. There were 6 of us (ma, pops, the bf, daughter, baby and myself). All I can say is good food and great service!
Our order: mahi mahi w/fried noodles, Kauai chicken (so ono) w/fried noodles, kalbi and garlic shrimp w/rice and saimin.
Everyone left with happy opus :) 
Need to drive out more often just to come eat here"
5,"I am an optometrist practicing in Minnesota and had to send a patient to a clinic for an urgent matter when they were out of town. The staff and doctors at the Wellish Vision Institute made the referral process a breeze! They were friendly, helpful and I knew my patient would be in great hands! Dr Ortiz spent time educating our mutual patient on their condition. I would recommend them to anyone looking for quality care with a personal touch!"
5,First visit to Red Door and I had a great experience. My appointment was with Jazmine for color cut and style. She was amazing. She answered all of my questions before we started and helped me pick out a great color. The cut was a big change for me and I couldn't be happier.
5,"I went through home warranty to get my spa fixed - it continued to trip my breaker.  The technician was very knowledgeable and let me know immediately what the issue was.  There was replacement parts required and I was quoted a fair price and quick turnaround time.  AJ was my technician, the company gave me a reminder call the day before the appointment with a 2 hour window.  AJ called at the front end of that window the day of the appointment and let me know he was 20 minutes out.  He was great to work with and showed me more about my spa than what I knew.  Very good service."
5,"My goodness, I have missed you.  We headed to Madison for our 1st anniversary and since we booked the hotel I was trying to get my hands on a large cooler so I could stock up on my loved and very missed items at Trader Joe's.  Thank you husbands coworker for the mighty fine cooler you provided!  

This is a particularly nice and well stocked Trader Joe's!  The parking, as everyone claims, truly is a bit of a pain in the ass - oh well, parking at the one I frequented in Chicago was a bigger pain in the ass.   The staff here is just as nice as any other TJ's, maybe a little nicer.  I was surprised by how well stocked everything was considering how busy it was and that it was a Sunday morning.   We walked out of here with $180 worth of deliciousness and we have now decided to purchase a deep freezer - well, we've been wanting to for quite some time, but this little trip and 1st time trip for my husband really helped seal the deal I think - and make a trip from good ol' Wausau every other month or so.  

My god I've missed this place."
5,"I no longer live in Madison (*sad*), and their are a ton of things I miss about that place (the terrace, Genna's, my roommates, Saturday morning tailgating, the smell of Madison in the fall, etc.) and surprisingly one of the things I miss the most is Trader Joe's. 

Once every weekend I would walk from my Randall residence down Monroe street to my favorite grocery store!!! It was always nice that even though I was on a pretty tight student budget, I could still indulge my self in all of Trader Joe's wonders: organic soaps and shampoos, daffodils, their famous two buck chuck, spicy salsas, my favorite vodka sauce, fair trade coffee, hot chocolate, and delish teas. Also, I don't know any other grocery store that will give you a free sample of bacon wrapped scallop's!!!! To top it off, everyone who works here is so friendly, and, seems to really enjoy working here, AND always seem really happy to see me bring in my re-usable grocery bags :). 

Oh Trader Joe's... I miss you so. I can't wait til I live by you again :)"
5,"I really like this restaurant.

There's usually a wait to be seated, but they're pretty quick at getting you a table. All the dishes I've tried - gamjatang, galbitang, kkanpunggi, dolsot bibimbap, tangsuyuk, the bulgogi and octopus hotpot (my favorite, but definitely needs at least 2 people) - have been flavorful, cooked well, and seasoned to perfection. The banchan is a good variety and I've never had an issue getting refills. I especially like the radish and the dried fish things. The prices are reasonable, they take card, and it's 24 hours. This is my go-to Korean restaurant now.

I've never had the KBBQ here but I really want to get some friends together and go at it. I've sat next to people ordering the kalbi and pork belly and it smells amazing.

110% recommend."
5,"I had to write this review (1st time I've done this) since it was his Yelp reviews that convinced me to have my surgery done by Dr. Wellish. I had cataract removal, astigmatism correction and lens implants in both eyes. I could not be happier. I'm seeing better than I ever have. I can't believe that people would complain about the wait time for their visit. I waited too but you're talking about your sight. Dr. Wellish is well worth the wait. Also, the wait was only for the 1st visit. The follow-up visits done by Dr. McCandless (also a fabulous & caring doctor) were very short wait times. I was a wreck before the surgery with worry & fear. Dr. Wellish & his group took amazing care of me. Now I tell everyone I can about how wonderful this group is & how glad I am to have found them. Thank you again & again."
5,We stumbled into this cool pho place. I had spicy beef noodle soup and it was delicious
5,"I don't know why this place got such mediocre reviews?! I eat a lot of BBQ and have eaten it pretty much everywhere in the valley. I came here and got the usual pulled pork sandwich and potato salad. It was cheap...quite a bit cheaper than Scottsdale BBQ and a lot tastier. There is a Drive-thru here which I actually find awesome, so I can get quick BBQ lunches on the go...but it's still a sit down restaurant too. I've been here multiple times and always leave satisfied!"
5,Best prime rib I've had in awhile! Jennifer the bartender makes an exceptional dirty martini. Great service and food!
5,Ladonna made my experience one o remember. Absolutely amazing message and very knowledgeable! Great experience!
5,"If you're looking for authentic hawaiian food, this is the place to be. Great tasting food and they serve big portions. Every penny spent is worth it! We'll definitely be back, great place to chill and enjoy delicious hawaiian food!"
5,"Grazie is one of my favourite Italian restaurants. It's good quality, fresh ingredients and reasonbly priced. They have a ton of different pastas on the menu - i've tried about 5 diff ones now and liked them all - I'm never disappointed when I eat there. My favs include the branca salad, penza and tasca pasta.

I hear the location at Yonge & Eg always has a line-up - the Vaughan location is the same menu and i have never had to wait!"
5,Love the food. Order chicken teriyaki and it was delicious. We just moved her from CA and found it difficult to find good teriyaki until now. We tried California rolls and they were very fresh and tasty. We will definitely be back. Staff very friendly and is super clean.
5,"Hub and I went here for dinner because we had bid on an auction that included a gift certificate to Waverlys.
We entered promptly at 5 PM for we had a show later at the Southpoint.
Hub and I ordered a bottle of Moët to start.  Our server Derrick was spectacular and brought the bottle over to start us off.
They also delivered a bread basket that had the best lavosh I think I have had in Vegas.
We did not order apps, for we do not normally eat large portions so we went straight to the main course and both ordered 8oz Filets, mine medium rare and hub straight medium.
The steaks arrived and they were Excellent!  Perfectly cooked and just full of flavor.....how in the world do they get that great flavor?
We both had mashed potatoes that were not saturated with butter.  You could actually taste the potato....and they were delicious!
Manager Todd came by and asked about our meal.   I immediately let him know how pleased we were.   I think it is particularly nice when a manager does this, but you can tell he really has his heart in it when he speaks with customers!
We finished off with a small taste of Port that finished an absolutely wonderful meal.
This place is GREAT.....find a way to get here.....just a beautiful experience with beautiful food!"
5,"Went to the Wellish Institute on Flamingo Rd with my 87 year old mother for Cataract Surgery diagnosis. She walked in scared and anxious, but from checkin all the way to the very end where we scheduled the surgery it was a surreal and amazing experience. The staff is so friendly and sympathetic that it brings calm and peace to the patient. They explain everything thoroughly. Wait time as far as I'm concerned is acceptable, because no one is rushed.  Always remember that the same time and courtesy will also be extended to you. Special thanks to Jorge, Mia, Gisel, Juan, Dr. Wellish and his assistant. Surgery is scheduled for the first eye on Feb 27th. We can't wait for this ordeal to be done, however, we will recommend this office without any hesitation. Thank you Dr. Wellish and your stellar team for being so kind to my Mom and putting her at ease.
Sincerely,  J Topol and A Macias"
5,"I'll admit, I was a snob. I assumed that Cannery food was only for the drunk, broke, or desperate. 

I was wrong, and happily so. The meal I had was pretty terrific. Service was prompt, attentive, and my filet was one of the most tender steaks I've experienced in a long time. 

Oddly, I would recommend this establishment with all the Cannery caveats."
5,"I first had contacted another LASIK center for a consultation but I needed to reschedule a few days after due to work. When I called to reschedule, the guy  gave me an attitude so I just told him to cancel the consultation (even after he was asking if I still wanted to reschedule...yeah, no). 

Anyway, I called my insurance company to see which LASIK center is under my insurance and good thing they said Wellish Vision Institute. I called them to schedule my consult and saw Brittany a few days after. I kid you not, they have the nicest staff EVER; not a single person there is rude AT ALL. Brittany was such a sweetheart, she explained everything about the LASIK procedure, Dr. Wellish, pricing, etc.. Tehani works up front and she is beyond nice, super friendly, and professional (actually they all are). I didn't decide right then and there if I wanted to get it done so I went home, contemplated about it, and called them that same day to let them know I wanted to go ahead and get LASIK done. The appointment before surgery and the day of, it takes 2-3 hours but it goes by fast so don't worry (just make sure you don't have anyone waiting for you so they don't complain about the ""long wait""). 

I got LASIK done last Thursday and I'm SOOOOO glad that I did and that I chose Dr. Welish. I now see 20/20, I don't have to spend so much money on contacts anymore, and I can wear sunglasses without having to put it over my eyeglasses lol. If you ever decide on getting the procedure done, you HAVE to go to Wellish Vision Institute. He is truly the best LASIK surgeon in the State of Nevada. My experience was flawless from my consultation up to my post-op. 

Dr. Wellish, THANK YOU VERY MUCH for correcting my vision. You and your staff (especially Brittany, Tehani, and Dr. McCandless) are the nicest, most caring, and professional people. Wishing all of you the very best. :D"
5,"Wow I am so excited this place exists! I work in the area and go out for lunch once or twice a week, and while Cafe Rumba nachos are an absolute staple, sometimes you need a little variety. Cue a big fat bowl of pho -- I had just been complaining about the lack of good pho around here!

Pho KC just opened a couple months ago, and they're dishing out some fantastic Vietnamese cuisine straight out of the gate. You can't go wrong with the pho special, which is what I got, but if you don't like tripe or tendon (a texture thing -- personally I'm a fan) you may want to get the Pho Tai or one of the other options. They definitely make a great bowl: really beefy, flavorful broth and noodles with just the right amount of spring to 'em. 

After the pretty big normal sized bowl (there's a larger size if you're really confident), I felt the need to cleanse the palate with some Thai boba tea; also glad there's boba in the area now! Next time will have to try the banh mi."
5,"Been here twice. The staff are really nice. Lunch special is the bomb! Sadly, I went vegetarian so no more KBBQ for me. Anyways...I love this place. Oh don't order the fish to grill...it was such a pain to get out..almost burnt it"
5,I have dealt with this company twice now. Both times excellent service both on the phone and the repair person. He fixed the issue in no time. Excellent service!!
5,"Love the food and Staff. Spring rolls, great broths and good portions.
They need to get a website with the menu. hunting through the photos for the menu is a pain."
5,"I wanted to get LASIK done for a few years but I have always been to nervous to even go in for the consultation. I finally met with Rebecca and she immediatly put me to ease, especially to know the procedure only will take less than two minutes per eye. I went to get a second consult at LASIK of Nevada.I didn't feel as comfortable plus I waited in the waiting room for quite a while. I think it was funny to fill out the papaerwork and they are trying to promote collagen injections among other things. Anyways I had my surgery done a couple weeks ago and I couldn't be happier!!! Dr Wellish did the actual surgery and he makes sure you feel very comfortable before he will even take you to the operating room. He talks you through the whole thing and let's you know everything that's happening. Some places may tell you he is retired and he will not perform the surgery but he does. I thank everyone at Wellish, Dr Wellish, Dr. McCandless, Rebecca, and the very friendly office staff. :)"
5,"awesome experience! 20/20 24 hours post surgery. The staff and doctors are great and super knowledgeable. They are a little pricier than the other places in town, but why would you worry about prices when it comes to your eyes! No Wait Time, easy to schedule"
5,"Continuously great customer service. They are always patient and helpful. 
NEVER a bad experience and ALWAYS love the food.

Must try the new bread pudding bars. They are heaven. They aren't too heavy for what they are and the sweetness level is perfect. Very soft and always fresh. 
Lemon bars are good. The citrus taste is the main focus as a bite is 75/25 tart/sweet. It tastes fresh and bright. Love the tartness!"
5,"Visiting the Red Door Spa is an experience every time I go.  The ambiance is amazing and serene. I love the location at the Biltmore, conveniently located by great stores and restaurants. I have had the opportunity to venture to many of the high end resorts/spa and in the Phoenix area, and I have to say Red Door Spa is certainly up there.

Highly recommend getting a facial with RENEE, she is outstanding at what she does! She is so gentle, yet firm, and I always leave there with rejuvenated, brighter skin. All of the products she has recommended are now my staples in my skin care routine. She is also an expert on eyebrow waxing; unfortunately, my eyebrows have been ruined in the past and Renee has been able to get them back looking pristine. She always takes her time and is extremely detail-oriented. I highly recommend the Red Door Spa! If you do decide to indulge in this amazing experience yourself, Renee is a true gem and she will not disappoint with the amazing work that she does!"
5,"I don't see what people complain about here. If i wanted bistro style, high quality expensive food I would go to Rosewood. 

I go to the happy moose because the prices are good, the servers are pleasant and the alcohol is great. My only issue would be to tell management to hurry up on that Sunday liquor license. I wanted to go cocktail crazy but had to stick with beer!"
5,"Let's get one thing straight: I love Trader Joe's. So much so that me and my college friends took some of our graduation pictures at our local Trader Joe's back in Davis. Trader Joe's is hands down my favorite place to shop for groceries and this one is no exception. 

Sure, it can be hard to find parking sometimes and on Sundays it's so packed with students and families with children that it can be a little hard to navigate but it's still Trader Joe's. The service here is always solid, even when they're busy they manage to have a lot of stock, and it's a great location with lots of cute restaurants nearby if you're like me and you've realized that shopping hungry is a bad, bad idea. 

My favorite TJs products include: mochi ice cream, their Moroccan Mint Tea, Soyrizo, Hold the Cone mini ice cream cones, goat cheese, frozen cauliflower rice, dark chocolate covered pretzels, and flavored kombucha. 

Long live Trader Joe's."
5,"The first thing I saw when I came in is the woman on the front asking me if I want to try their fresh bread, after trying the bread which I like very much I told her that I will come back to try sandwich later on and that's what I did. 
I tried the sandwich tuna which was really good and I highly recommend it. 
The place looks very clean and appealing and above all the service is really good. 
I recommend this place to whoever love different type of bread and homemade style!"
5,Very cool hole in the wall bar. Our server was very friendly and the food was delicious. I had the po boy sandwich. It was yummy and the cajun sauce was the exact amount of spicy!
5,I had the pho special for a late lunch and it was great. Soup was flavorful and they give pots of garnish. The iced coffee beverage I had was great too. Highly recommend this restaurant!
5,How come the rating is so low??? How can you not love this bar???!!! They always have a great beer selection and awesome monthly drink specials.  The new food truck menu is amazing (reminds me of home) and the shrimp and grits are to die for. Seriously! If I was on death row hickory tavern shrimp and grits would be my last meal.
5,"I love this place!  I live out of state and recently called Elizabeth Arden for a gift certificate for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day.  I have done this annually for her for several years and she had always loved the service.  I must admit that I was going to go to a less expensive place this year...cut backs and the economy.  After reading reviews online, I selected a nail spa close by.  The service was really horrible on the phone.  I can only imagine what it would have been like in person.  I ended up not purchasing a gift certificate from them and instead coming back to Elizabeth Arden again.  Yes, I spent twice as much for her mother's day present...but I would rather pay double verses deal with poor service and questionable product.  When my mother-in-law comes here she is always happy and feels pampered on her special day.  And they really do gift certificates well.  I will not shop around again!!"
5,"This Denny's Dinner has always been awesome!  The food is good,  the service is excellent, & location, just off Loop 202, very convenient.  =)"
5,"Aaron Pools was sent out by my warranty company to repair my pool filter and the heater. Alex and Andrew were the technicians who worked on these items, and they did an excellent job. The pool is working great and they were super easy to work with - my schedule was crazy that week, and they handled everything. I especially appreciate their communication. I've worked with a lot of trades since buying this house, and good communication is hard to come by, and both of these guys went above and beyond to keep me informed. The office staff is super friendly and helpful as well. Hopefully, no more pool issues, but should one arise, I look forward to working with them again in the future."
5,Great place for families and if your on a date. Nice size place to feel right at home. They make the food as you order it. Always fresh and hot. This placed really surprised me with the taste of pho.
5,I received a great facial treatment by Jordan. May or may have fallen asleep during the session. Looking forward to my next visit.
5,"Amazing service! By both Frederick and Todd. And pretty much anyone that worked there. Food was unbelievable. Delicious and worth every penny.The parents and I decided we will definitely add it to our once a month dining experiences. :)
The dinner special is a bargain and includes dessert ($30). The lobster tail was on point and with the warm drawn butter - super amazing. Oh yes the white chocolate bread was unreal...yes I said white chocolate BREAD."
5,The service was excellent! The food was great. I loved the atmosphere. Everybody spoke when you walked in. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Thanks!
5,"I'm always looking for the next wonderful brisket which is verrrry hard to find. Well today I found one. I went in for a small sandwich for the drive home. When I got in the car and tasted it, I ran right back in for another to take home. The brisket just almost melted in my mouth, the little french bread was great and the barbque sauce was so good... (they didn't put a sauce in the bag for the second sandwich but I had enough left over). Will definitely go back when I'm in the area."
5,"After years of contemplating on getting the LASIK procedure, I finally decided to make an appointment with the Wellish Institute.  Dr. Wellish was well recommended by my own optometrist and found excellent review across the Internet.  From the first consultation to the actual procedure, and even after for post op care, it has been nothing short of an excellent experience.  They have made sure that I have gotten all of my questions and concerns answered so that I can make a well thought out decision that the LASIK procedure was right for me.  The procedure was quick and painless.  Dr. Wellish had me seeing 20/25 the next day and is still getting better after a couple of weeks.  This is mind blowing for me especially when I started out from a pair of glasses with a prescription of -10, and can't remember when I was able to see without contacts or glasses.

I would highly recommend Dr. Wellish if you have ever thought about getting LASIK or any other sight correction procedures done.  He can help you determine what is best for you and he is not afraid to tell you that you are not a candidate.

As for myself, I am more than ecstatic about my results and would like to thank Dr. Wellish and everyone at the Wellish Institute for helping me to regain my sight."
5,"Delicious sandwiches on artisan bread, yummy sweet treats, Kitschy shabby sheik decor with classic tunes to get away from the Vegas heat, served by friendly faces."
5,Had the laulau plate tonight and it was amazing. Great local staff as well. Will be back.
5,"I've been coming to Chef Ben's for years, and have taken several friends and family members. It has amazing, inexpensive sushi and chicken teriyaki. The bento boxes are a good deal, especially with their loyalty card. My favorite is the 'B' box with chicken teriyaki, California rolls, dumplings and soup or salad. The restaurant is quiet and the staff is always friendly."
5,They have great food & definitely excellent service. Tried their mochi mango flavored and it s definitely delish.
5,"After careful research I chose Wellish to do my LASIK. Are there cheaper places in vegas? Yes. More experienced, trusted & respected in his field? No! I wanted to choose the very best for my eyes. Definitely had to go with the top option Custom Vue LASIK- I got it done 4 days ago- it really is a 24 hr recovery! 
From the first consultation I had with Rebecca to the pre-op exams I had with Bernie & McCandless, even the front desk ladies - every single member of the Wellish team that I encountered were such a comfort to talk to, I truly was made to feel like I was a valued patient every step of the way & most importantly: never pressured! Dr Kent Wellish is of course the master he is definitely worthy of trusting your vision, just wait til you meet him, you'll understand what I mean. 
I now feel so proud of myself for having the courage to take this huge step I've longed to do for years. I am grateful that I found Wellish Vision Institute to make this an easy and regret-free decision for me. I highly recommend!  
Btw this LASIK procedure pays for itself in 10 yrs its what I would've spent on contacts alone, not to mention the elation of visual freedom!!"
5,"I came in an hour before close and wanted to order a sandwich. They were pretty much sold out of all flavors of bread except for some different wheats. But the girls were all very helpful and kind while I chose my sandwich and ask about soups. The sandwich was made fresh and delivered to me within two minutes of ordering. 

I got light wheat, mayo, turkey, provolone, cheddar and lettuce. The give a generous helping of the meat! A nice meal for a reasonable price. You MUST try their oatmeal chocolate chip cookie!"
5,"One look at my pictures will tell you I'm not from Hawaii. But I like the beach and I'd jump at the chance to get with a Hawaiian m--

Oh. TMI.

Point being, Hawaiian culture fascinates me, and even though I haven't been (yet) I find Hawaiians (and Pac Islanders) to be attractive not just in looks, but in personalities and in their cuisine!

Our foodventure last week took us to Kauai Cafe, which looked fairly unassuming from the front. Another hole-in-the-wall joint, one may say. But step inside, and you'll find what makes Kauai Cafe so ono.

I love chicken katsu, but it was a heavy battle between that and a platter called ""Da Surf Rider"" which basically is a Hawaiian fried seafood platter. I went with the less expensive of the options, the katsu, and thank goodness I did because the portions were HUGE! Emijandro's kalbi short ribs were practically falling off the plate as was my chicken. It was served with macaroni salad and the option between fried noodles, fried rice, or steamed sticky rice. I was trying to keep it healthy but since I had already spoiled that with chicken katsu, I went with the fried rice. Another great choice, as the fried rice has the usual accouterments, but also has bits of fried Spam (that ono Hawaiian treat!) mixed in. It was a fun and tasty addition to the usual fried rice one might find.

I thought the chicken was a little bit on the dry side, but the katsu sauce rectified that problem. Overall, a mighty fine meal.

So why the five star rating? I believe in Hawaiian slang you would say it's because of Da Kine Service.

The server (who may be an owner or related to an owner?) was super nice. He chatted with us for quite a bit, telling us about Kauai, which I found fascinating as Emijandro has been, but I never have. He talked about the experience of moving from Hawaii to Las Vegas, and the fact that like every other person that moves here, he never really suffered from allergies until hitting the 702.

The fifth star that sealed the deal came a week later, chatting with Emijandro in the car about the experience. Apparently behind where we sat (she could see it, I had my back to it), a homeless man was being shown island love: he was fed a warm meal, and they offered him one of their t-shirts to wear as the weather was starting to cool off and their t-shirt was heavier than the one he was wearing.

That, my braddahs and sistahs, is doing business right. Return trips are already being planned, even if it is way out past where the 215 wraps around the side of Vegas.

(OK, screw TMI -- any Hawaiian, Samoan, or Tongan men, I'm single and ready to mingle. We'll go to Kauai Cafe together... heh.)"
5,"I love TJs! They always seem to have a bagful of deliciousness that I need to try. It is really great that they serve samples of items in their store too. A little sample for me ends up with an impulse purchase for them. Seems to be a win-win! I like their fresh flower selection and the prices for flowers is pretty reasonable for our area. I like the take-n-go items in the chiller area. A quick bite for lunch or fun items to throw into your next tailgate/picnic adventure. The bite size desserts are great for my office gatherings. You don't feel super guilty when it's only 2-3 bites of a dessert. I've heard a lot of people complain about their high prices, but I think that they seem actually cheaper than Whole Foods or some of the big chain stores. One thing that I wish they had more of is.... BEER! They have A LOT of wine on their shelves, but this is Wisconsin. We like beer too! I just learned about their return policy for food that you don't quite like. You can return items if you find that they were not to your liking. That's kind of a cool concept that you will probably not get at other stores. I hope others don't abuse that policy and ruin it for those that may need it."
5,"I made an appointment with this office and they gave me a timely one. Before my appointment they sent me the forms I needed to fill out. That saved time at the lobby. When I arrived, they checked me in and got seen immediately. They performed a routine checkup and dilated my pupils for the doctor to check. (Expect some blurriness for a about 1 hour)
I got seen by Silvia and Dr. Ortiz, with Gladys assisting. They explained the procedure and were very nice about everything. They performed the checkup and got the results. All was ok and was on my way back home quickly. They are very efficient on what they are doing and felt comfortable at their office.
I would recommend Wellish Vision Institute any time."
5,"Rene made me feel like I was the most important person in the spa and my experience was heavenly. The facial left my face glowing, my skin was smooth, hydrated, and I felt totally beautiful. The hand massage with hot mitts melted away any tension left in my body if there was any. Her voice is calming and she moves gracefully around so as not to disturb your serenity. She recommended the Cranberry Enzyme and I love the product. I'll be back for more pampering."
5,As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly staff offering bread samples. Ham and swiss on sourdough was fresh and delicious. I love ham and their ham is delicious. Swiss cheese was excellent too. You pick from their signature sandwiches or build your own. They offer a daily soup as well as breads and cookies. Will definitely return.
5,This place is friendly and delicious.  When it's not 150 degrees outside I enjoy a nice bowl of pho meatball.  One night I left work sick and rushed in there 20 minutes before closing to order some pho to go.  They were amazingly nice and sent me on my way with a bowl of deliciousness.
5,"Do NOT trust you vision to anyone else.  I've checked into other doctors for lasik, same price but NOT the same service (the others made me feel like I was dealing with a used car salesman).  Everyone is wonderful at this office.  I'm highly impressed with the service I received and still am receiving with Dr. Wellish.  I just wish I would have done this sooner!  It's been 3 months and I still am amazed with the results!    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR. WELLISH!!!  Best investment I've ever made!!  I had my Lasik on Thursday afternoon and I drove for my follow up early Friday morning.  I've been in glasses since I was 6 years old, had -6.75 in both eyes, plus +1.50 needed for reading and astigmatism in both eyes!  I still have to remind myself at night that I don't have to take my contact out......I don't wear them any more!  Thank you Dr. Wellish, Dr. McCandless, Rebecca Maloney and the entire staff!  Tiffany V."
5,"Waverly's is a fabulous place for an evening out.  The ambiance is cozy with a talented live pianist .  North Las Vegas has very few nice restaurants with the kind of atmosphere and attentive staff that Waverley's offer.   As it is close to our house, we find Waverly's to be our ""go to"" place for fine dining.  Darrell has been our waiter often and is outstanding and very professional.  This is a place you can go and have a relaxing and enjoyable meal.  I have nothing but praise for Waverly's. Keep up the good work!"
5,"Servers were on their toes and the 3 course meal was awesome. They offer different items each night for the 3 course meal option. Ours was the salad of choice or soup, bone in filet choice of potato and the vegetable was  asparagus. The entire meal was awesome, filet cooked and seasoned perfectly the garlic mashed potatoes were also very tastey. The desert that followed was as amazing as the rest of the entire meal although at this point i was full and could not enjoy the entire thing."
5,"I just had LASIK done a little over a week ago now with Dr. Wellish and it is so worth it!  I've had a few friends go to Dr. Wellish for the surgery and he came highly recommended.  It's a pretty intensive process, but the staff was great in keeping me informed and being patient with me and any questions I had.  There's the initial consultation, the pre-op day, the actual surgery day, then two post surgery follow ups.  So you encounter a lot of different staff in the process, and I really don't have anything bad to say about any of them.  Everyone was very friendly and my wait times were minimal.  The surgery itself was unpleasant, but it is quick enough and the results come fast enough that I wouldn't hesitate to do it again.  I also liked that Dr. Wellish talked to me throughout the surgery and I wasn't just left in silence wondering what was going to happen next.  I've always been too freaked out to wear contacts because I'm grossed out by the idea of it, so having voluntary eye surgery was a pretty big leap for me.  But the fact that I woke up the next day with 20/20 vision makes me really happy that I took the leap.  #treatyoself"
5,My favorite hawaiian place of all time! I always get the kalbi short ribs which is just the perfect flavor for me sweet and tangy and the chicken katsu is also very good. The staff are also very friendly. I try to come here as often as I can.
5,"Well, we love our TJ's.  Much more than we would have expected when we moved to Madison (in Chicago, it was our favored quick-trip for cherry soy chocolate stuff, but not the regular spot the Madison locale is for us), it's our go-to place.  Ridiculously - as in, an embarrassment of riches, not saccharine or insincere - friendly staff, many of whom we're on a first name basis with.  Great finds in wine (secured and sustained by a staff that knows and enjoys nice vino), good meats and poultry, many staples.  Our lad is always eager to try out the samples.  Nothing but our highest praise.  Thanks, guys - we appreciate you!"
5,Great food. I have never had a better pulled pork sandwich ever. It was fantastic. The only downside was the noise level due to the industrial decor
5,This restaurant is very nice. First time trying pho and I was very impressed. Generous size bowls with lots of beef and noodles. Service is fast and place is very clean and nice atmosphere. Everyone there is kind too. Very good experience :)
5,"This place is perfect. Great location. The service was great, the pho was phenomenal, I will certainly be back here many times in the near future. The restaurant was not crowded, everything was clean, and everyone walked away from dinner full and happy."
5,"I have used Yelp and Open Table for years. This time I found a fabulous little gem right close to home. The Cannery has Waverly's Steak House. The atmosphere is fabulous. The service impeccable Frederick was attentive, fruendly and had an A+ sense of humor. 
Food range was 30+. But let tell you they have a little gem on the menu. It has a meal deal of all things. For $30 you can get soup or salad. Steak and Shrimp, with potatoes and asparagus , and a chocolate lovers dream.  Amazingly tender New York steak however it may change as it is a Chefs Choice. Try it you will not be disappointed if you do. Blessings all."
5,First time eating here.  Stopped in for Happy Hour with my wife.  Great prices and the service was excellent.  We will definitely return.
5,"I try to go to the French Quarter once a month to eat. I wish I could go more often but I do not work downtown. The food is fantastic and the price is very reasonable. The ambiance is great, as it is in a courtyard and has good outdoor seating. I would highly recommend anything off the menu, but the tuna, hamburgers, Monte Cristo sandwich, and Greek salad are my favorite. I took my husband there as we were tailgating for a Panther game and he tried the hamburger and was licking the the packaging he said it was that good. One of the best lunch restaurants in Charlotte!!!!!!!"
5,"Right when I walked in and asked to look at a menu for a to go order, there was an older hawaiian gentlemen (almost like Mr. Miagi from karate kid LOL) he immediately said hello, introduced himself and was INCREDIBLY nice.  You gotta love that hawaiian culture I absolutely love it.  I just had a feeling right then and there that I was gonna love whatever I ordered. WHY??? because you can tell that there is passion and care put into his business and food. 

This place is definitely not your typical L&L hawaiian or aloha kitchen type of place.  They have a much smaller menu and although you will see a few typical items, but they are missing several known items as well, that you would find at other hawaiian places.  The prices here are a little higher on a few things too.  

I decided to go with their variety special that was posted on their display board out front it was $15 but I figured what the hell because it'll give me a variety of their food and I'll really know if I like it or not and want to return.  After placing my order and waiting a little bit, I saw the man I met (I'm sorry I forgot his name) back there cooking for a few minutes and then again in the dining area just out and about talking with the few people that were there. 

I got my food home and as I started to unpack it I was just wowed over at all the yumminess I was seeing.  I didn't know what everything was (only some of it) but I was already impressed.  

I had something in a broth like stewed collar greens sorta thing (VERY yummy), some shredded chicken in a soup with small noodles (VERY YUMMY) tuna poki (INCREDIBLY YUMMY) salmon with tomatoes (forgot the name of it, sorry) my main entree had some lau lau (which was INCREDIBLE and not the least bit dry at all)  there was also kaluah pork (again sorry for the spelling). I was very impressed with everything.  

I will absolutely return and highly recommend to anyone to goto this place. It was VERY obvious that the owner put his love of Hawaiian food into his cooking."
5,"Food is good for the low lunch/dinner prices.  Service is excellent and location is excellent.  I have no idea why I haven't tried this place sooner.

I ordered te London Broil and I was pleased."
5,"The boneless wings are really good. We got the moosey platter which is 30 wings (we picked the boneless) and one side. We chose garlic parm, hot garlic, buffalo ranch, medium, and six pepper dry rub. I don't have anything bad to say about any of the flavors. The fries were also really good. For the price, it is definitely worth a try. This was a good meal for my boyfriend and I and for 24.99 we will definitely be back."
5,"Being a kauai boy growing up then relocating to oahu for a good 7 years and now in vegas, i saw this in the kama'aina magazine and was like no sh*t lol i had to try this place. So i drove cross town to eat here. Totally worth it. Home cooked food. The staff here were very friendly and the prices were fair. There is choke parking so no worries on that. Not hard to find either. If you from kauai or just hawaii in general and want some home cooked food, hit this place up you wont be dissapointed."
5,"I wonderful atmosphere with perfect service! Pedicure, manicure & hair color & style!"
5,"I am so in awe of the combination of professionalism and personality at this office. Each and every staff member is so courteous and kind AND they all greet you by name every time you come into the office. Literally every time I walked in it was like ""Hey, Morgan so good to see you!"" and I'd be like woah they really care about their patients here. 

Taylor and Felicia are outstanding in their roles at this office. They made me feel so comfortable and really worked with my schedule to make sure the procedure happen.

I went in for a free consultation to see if I was in good enough shape to get any kind of eye surgery and they did ALL the tests. Like THOROUGH examination and explanation of what my eyes look like and what they're looking for in good candidates for surgery. 

Once the pre-testing is done, the doctor will come in and look at your eyes and your test results and everything and let you know if there is anything they can do to help you and your vision. From there they will tell you exactly what kind of procedure they can do and how much it will cost and what to expect. They're seriously so great over here. 

The procedure itself maybe took 5 minutes I was in and out.

I had my surgery yesterday and I'm already seeing 20/20. I'm so happy right now I can't even put it into words. 

Thank you Dr. Wellish."
5,"I love TJs!!! It is in walking distance to my apartment, and I am a poor college grad paying off her student loans, who probably should shop somewhere more affordable, but the quality of the food I buy usually exceeds my expectations, and it ruins other grocery stores for me.

Just a few of the awesome TJ items I am obsessed with:

-Berry and Yogurt cereal- 4 types of berries!
-Roasted Garlic pasta sauce- puts other pasta sauces to shame, tastes super garlic-y but not in the stinky breath kind of way
-Chicken Tikka Masala frozen dinner- I love to cook so I don't do frozen dinners too often, but this one is sooo good.  Just as tasty as an indian restaurant, much smaller portions :)
- Naan- to go with my Tikka Masala of course! 


The employees are really nice and it's also cute how much kids love going here.  It seems like every time I'm in the store a kid is looking for monkey or whatever it is they hide for the kids to find.  Even everyday items like the pasta, the tea, taste better than what I buy at an average grocery store.  How do they do it???!"
5,Good size! So worthy for what you order! You have to try the rips in here!good place!
5,"Good Bahn Mi's, and good price. Can't be $4 sandwiches. 
We had 3 different Bahn Mi and all were delicious."
5,I love this place!  The food is delicious and the employees are incredibly friendly. My friend and I have come here on different occasions when we've been feeling under the weather. The main waitress (I don't know her name unfortunately) went out of her way to offer us hot tea with ginger. You can tell not only does she care about her business but also the customers. My favorite pho place hands down.
5,Had the teriyaki chicken bowl lunch special. It was great food. Love the location and terrific staff! Will be back soon
5,"Friendly staff, delicious spring rolls, reasonable prices for pho. Super Vietnamese authentic."
5,"Love the Pho Tai here! The staff is always friendly and very prompt. Establishment is extremely clean and you can see pride of ownership! 

Pro tip - Try the chili oil on the table!"
5,"Vegan options were very good. The broth on the pho chay was amazing, and meatless! Veggie noodles and spring rolls are also tasty. Nice atmosphere, very clean, and friendly service. Our new favorite on this side of town."
5,"Great food and service! My companions had beer. I was undecided between the Pinot Grigio and the Chardonnay. I asked the waitress if I could have a taste of each to determine which one I preferred. (A common practice in AZ). She stated that they don't do tastings and the alcohol was weighed so they couldn't just give me a little. We asked for the manager who promptly came to our table. She said the same thing but said she, too, would have to get permission from someone else. As it turned out, they did bring me a sample of each and I chose the Pinot Grigio. They were very accommodating although I suspect if we hadn't pushed it they would have just left it at no. Everyone in our party was very pleased with their food selection. Ambiance was nice and they weren't too busy. We definitely would go back."
5,Oh my goodness! The wings and oysters are amazing!! You cannot go wrong with them. The staff was extremely friendly and gave great customer service. Definitely going back next week!
5,"Awesome food, awesome price. I found this place by accident but quickly realized what a gem it was. The sushi is more than reasonably priced. The service is awesome. I've become a regular, service like this is HARD to find. Youre treated like a valued customer, which is something that is rare in this day and age. If you want awesome sushi, even better service and keep some money in your wallet, I definitely recommend you try this place."
5,"This is an awesome restaurant. t's definitely a little more on the fancy side, and the service was excellent. 

I went recently with my girlfriend and her parents, and all of the staff was excellent and helpful. For appetizer, we got the fried squid (calamari? I forgot) and Portabello Frites, which were both extremely good. The bread they serve is also excellent. For the main course, I had a grilled salmon and it was cooked very well. I may not know much about fine cooking or anything along those lines, but I loved every single bite of it. The chocolate cake they gave my girlfriend was also pretty great; it wasn't too sweet, and included with it was a dollop of house-made whipped cream. I literally have no complaints! Our waiter made us feel very at home and welcome. Would gladly come back for another round."
5,"Love love love this place! 
After a seriously horrible day, we came in to grab a quick bite before we hit the road. The servers were so fast and so friendly. The sushi was amazing! When we got our bill, we were so shocked. We got beers and 3 rolls of sushi, and it was only 20 bucks! By far the most affordable sushi place I have ever been to. Best part is, it was delicious!"
5,"Was in the area and decided to try this place. From the outside, it looks like pretty much every other Hawaiian place in town. They had a mix plate special, which I ordered figuring that it would be like any other mix plate. I was really blown away! Their meat stands out from the other Hawaiian places in town and is delicious. I thought the mac salad was really good, but for some reason prefer Ohana and Ross Js mac salad. Service was great. This is by far the best hawaiian I've had in Las Vegas, and I can't wait to go back and try some other items."
5,"Here on vacation with my family and we stumbled upon this little restaurant on our hunt for food. 

The food is GREAT! Huge portions! You really get more bang for your buck. Also, the staff/owners are really friendly. 

BONUS POINTS: I read on their menu that one of the owners are also from Kaneohe, HI where I was born and raised!"
5,Dr. Wellish is such a sweet little man. His staff goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and not at all anxious about your surgery. I would recommend this place to anyone looking into Lasik. I've had one eye done to great success. I just got the second one and am feeling good!
5,"I'm used to getting horrible service and sub-par food from Hawaiian places. It must be because I frequent Aloha Kitchen more than I should -- but what can I do when it's the closest thing to UNLV?

Now let's look at Kauai Cafe. The server was awfully kind, the kitchen staff look like they enjoy their jobs, AND THE INSIDE OF THE PLACE IS SUPER CLEAN. I can't emphasize enough how sick I am of walking into restaurants that are super dirty -- especially most Hawaiian places.

On to the food -- the portion sizes and the quality of the food is pretty good. I shared lunch with my co-workers and from what I remember I ate some kalbi, teriyaki chicken,  and pulled pork; all of which were quite tasty. If I had a complaint, it would be that the rice itself was a bit mushy but it happens.

I know that Kauai Cafe is still a fairly new place, but if this is their style of work I can only see things getting better from here."
5,You have got to check this place out if you're a vegetarian and looking for something super healthy and super tasty. The service was above par and I couldn't believe there was a place in Glendale finally. This will definitely become one of my Staples of somewhere I go once a week.  Addicting to say the least
5,"Daryl, Giovanni, Dorian, Eddie and Todd .. You guys are the best.  Superb service and food!"
5,"I was experiencing sharp pain in my right eye and the white of my eye looked as if it were bleeding.  This was very scary.  I did a google search and called all around Las Vegas but there was no one who could help me on a Saturday and there were no hospitals with an ophthalmologist on call. This was not good!  I came across this office, read the reviews, called,  received the after hours answering service and a Dr. was paged.  That is when I spoke with Dr. Langford who said he was willing to open up his office so that he can examine me.  Very well mannered and friendly, he examined me, gave me something for the pain and assured me that I would be okay. I also have a follow up appointment in a couple of days. I highly recommend him for anyone looking for an eye care professional.  I cannot thank him enough for treating me on an emergency basis and easing my anxiety."
5,Came here on a Friday evening for a pedicure with my husband (his first!). Theresa and Maryann were both very professional and kind and gave us great pedicures that lasted a full hour. My husband was asking a ton of questions since it was his first time and they were very patient in explaining everything. The pedicure station is comfortable and quiet in the back. It was a good experience and I'm glad my husband had a good first impression of pedicures!
5,"Go here almost everyday for lunch, the service is quick and the staff is always so friendly! Tuesday's with the chicken creole is my favorite day to go."
5,This dennys location has never let us down. We always try to ask for a young lady named Krystal. She gives great service fast and always correct. The cooks do a great job. It clean and delicious.
5,"This was a little gem I found right by my house. They make all of their breads fresh daily and you get a free slice every time you go in, so you can try every bread you want! My mom and I ordered sandwiches and they were amazing! A bit pricey but I would rather get a sandwhich there then go to say Panera. Definitley try the white chocolate cherry bread and next time I go in I have my eye on the pumpkin choc chip bread! MMMMM!"
5,We were greeted by a happy wait staff and treated to a free beer -for a tip- and were able to get a table outside in just few minutes.  My friend and I ordered the London broil pita tziki sauce-recommended by our waitress. The meat was very tender and the entire meal was great! Will definitely be back!  Oh and the ladies room was neat and clean!
5,"AJ did an exceptional job repairing our pool pump and filter.  He was professional and had everything running quickly.  AJ replaced the piston, valve and made certain that everything was working properly before he left.  Thank you for the great service"
5,"After a miserable experience with another pool company, our home warranty company decided to send Aaron Pools out for a second opinion. My husband and I were working at the time of the appointment so I had my mom head over to our home to speak to the tech while he was there. He couldn't have been nicer. Alex was very kind and professional and told me that we didn't deserve the treatment from the last company. The last company told us that they couldn't replace our pump motor because our warranty company denied it which, in fact, they hadn't. Alex told me that they will never deny the job while a tech is on-site if it is obvious a repair/replacement is needed. He had a rebuilt motor put in within about 30 minutes and our pump is running better than ever. He even told me that they'll replace the motor, at no cost to us, if something happens to it in the future. I appreciate the great customer service and attention to our immediate needs."
5,"not only was the food amazing but the service as well. we ate on a slow night and the manager gave us free glasses of wine which was nice. he also offered to take a picture of me and my date. very clean restaurant, tablecloths are replaced after every meal."
5,"Excellent Pho, great other dishes, too! Friendly, clean, fast service, great food, inexpensive! Love to go there!"
5,"This place is great for cheap and fast Japanese style food. The sushi is not premium level but it's still great for the price. I was pleasantly surprised at the great value this place offered especially with sushi and sake. I think we've found our favorite place for a simple, casual, fast bite for those Tuesday night's when you don't want to cook. It's a great place and you should try it out. It won't break the bank so it's worth trying at least once."
5,"This was my first time in Arizona and my first time going to a spa. I figures there would be no better way to celebrate my birthday than to treat myself to the complete spa experience! And I'm soo glad I did! EA Red Door did not fall short!  I did the milk and honey body scrub and wrap and 60 minute Arden Signature Massage. These services were all done by Jon. Jon was absolutely amazing!!! He was completely processional and friendly. This was my first time going to a spa. He made sure to explain each step of each process, before doing them. He made me feel completely comfortable! His hands were like magic, transforming my skin to the softest it's ever been! His massage made me melt away! Jon worked away a lot of the tension I've had in my back for quite sometime.

After my time with Jon,I was off to see Lucy for my Signature Facial. She was super sweet and very attentive! After asking me a few questions about my skin, she went in to do a thorough evaluation of my skin. She explained what the service consisted of and made some recommendations that would improve the look of my skin. Based on these recommendations, I added the Vitamin C pack and enzymes to my facial. Lucy was incredible! She made me looked like a whole new person after she was done. she was so gentle with her touch, I was so relaxed! 

I definitely will be scheduling with both Jon and Lucy on my return trip in November!!"
5,"I have been coming to the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa since 2001.  David is a wonderful colorist and Frank cuts and styles my hair better than anyone I have had in my life.  I am Asian and my hair is not easy to cut, so kudos to Frank and all the other stylists that have filled in in the past when I didn't call ahead to book an appt.  I have never had a bad hair day since 2001.
In the past year, I have seen Jon for therapeutic deep tissue massage.  Because of my work, a good massage is not just a luxury; it is a necessity.  I take my out-of-town girlfriends to the Phoenician to chill-out, but I take my back and shoulder issues to Jon.  He is the best therapeutic massage therapist I have experienced, and I am so glad he is at the Spa now. Selfishly, I am hoping he doesn't get too many requests after this post to still have time to fit me in!"
5,Immer wieder gut. Die Steaks sind immer so wie ich sie bestelle. Auch der Service ist hervorragend. Komme gerne wieder!
5,"You know when you really want a sandwich and you have that perfect image in your mind of this stacked up beauty of a creation?  It has that toasted bread, fresh colorful veggies and those perfect slices of cold cuts all stacked perfectly as if it's a tribute to the sammich gods?  That's exactly what they make here, it's the sandwich of my dreams a SILF if you will.  The consistency of quality here is amazing and I've never been disappointed by them at all.

The staff always makes you feel welcome and greets you as soon as the door is opened, almost too early... I mean they're not quite waving at you as you park but they notice you right away.  They always offer a slice of their fresh baked breads and ask if you want a little butter on it.   The breads are perfect and there is really not trick to them at all, their secret is they just made the bread the way people used to.  No additives, no flavor enhancers, nothing besides quality ingredients and a staff that knows what they are doing.  As the girls behind the counter have been there as long as I have been coming I think they have it down by now.

There is also an assortment of gift baskets, cookies, spreads and other nice touches that would be great for a gift or an office party."
5,"I'll get straight to the point. I walked in and was greeted by a super nice girl who immediately asked me if I wanted to sample any of their six or seven breads they had ready. I had a hard time choosing but eventually settled on the White Chocolate Cherry Swirl. She cut me a good one inch piece off and put a dab of butter and evened it all out for me. I realize this place has a religious affiliation but man oh man is their bread HEAVENLY. Soft and fluffy with bites of cherry to give it some crunch with the white chocolate so amazingly creamy. I was blown away. I had been wanting some ice cream or yogurt all day but after having some of this I was more than satisfied. At eight dollars for this particular loaf I can't say I will make this a weekly stop but every couple of weeks they can bet on seeing me in there. 

Great bread, Great service. Little bit on the pricey side but I think it's worth it. Especially when you get an entire loaf which will probably last you at least a couple of days unless you are like me and use it as a meal replacement."
5,"Fantastic breakfast ! Thanks Tyler.  Very attentive service. Delicious food.   Clean, friendly, helpful staff.  We were lucky. No wait on a Sunday morning."
5,"I am a regular at the Red Door Spa, and I am so pleased with the work that they do I decided to share a little bit on here. I have been fortunate to go to many high end spas/resorts and this is definitely up there!

The Red Door Spa really is a hidden gem at Biltmore Fashion Park. It's the perfect location to do a little leisurely shopping before or after your appointment as well!

I absolutely adore the facials they have to offer; my personal favorite is the Advanced Brightening Facial. My esthetician is Renee Lange, I have nothing except rave reviews of Renee. She is extremely knowledgeable, professional, and experienced. She is great at recommending great skin care products, yet not pushy whatsoever. She is genuinely interested in getting your skin to be the best version possible. I also strictly go to her for my brow waxing/shaping. My brows have been destroyed in the past by inexperienced estheticians, and Renee has managed to get them looking amazing.  She is extremely detail-oriented and she takes her time. She has also taught me shaping techniques and recommended some amazing brow mousse that I now can't live without. I always leave the Red Door Spa feeling so refreshed, rejuvenated, and my skin feels absolutely amazing.

The spa itself is quite serene and peaceful. The staff members are extremely polite, friendly, and prompt. I highly recommend scheduling an appointment with Renee Lange, you will not be disappointed!"
5,"Great service!  

Not sure where the negative reviews came from, but they have definitely stepped up their game.  

My pool motor quit working and I was assigned to Aaron Pools through my home warranty company.  Usually the warranty company contracted pool services have been miserable.  This was a very welcome surprise.  Stephanie was SUPER nice on the phone and contacted me within a few hours of placing the service request.  My service was scheduled for the next working day.....I had an emergency reschedule and again, Stephanie was AWESOME.  She managed to get me scheduled for the next day, no problems.  Service tech came while I was at work and now my pool is working great!  

Everyone at Aaron Pools seems to have it down and they're a company I will now consider calling when I need something done outside of warranty service.  Hard to come by an excellent service like this!"
5,Good sushi and low prices. Food is consistent and always tastes great. And I couldn't forget the service. They never fail to take care of my myself or my family.
5,"I have had Chef Ben 4 times now (3 of the times I ate there and 1 time I got carry out) i am by no means a sushi expert but, I have had it numerous times at numerous places before. Chef Ben is such a great place. They are clean, friendly, and quick.

It is not a very big place, but they really treat you well. I have had the bento special, and also the happy hour special. Both of these give you so much food and they are not expensive at all. 

I have never had fishy sushi or gotten sick from any of it. It always tastes and smells great. 

I highly recommend it! :)"
5,"DELICIOUS!  We went for the first time to grab a little snack. We were surprised that they offer a free slice of bread.  We bought a berry bar and chocolate chip scone...yummy.  For our free slices we tried the pumpkin spice and the cinnamon swirl bread.  These were heavenly.
 The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was clean and enjoyable.  We can not wait to go back and try other goodies."
5,"Delicious and so fresh! And our server Kim was so friendly and helpful. The shaken beef was perfect. A very wide range of dishes, easily accommodated everyone's tastes and dietary needs. Tee even offered suggestions and items that were not on the menu, for our vegan daughter. We'll definitely be back again and again. There's so many more things to try!  :)"
5,"Jamie is AMAZING! I am blonde, and he is more magical with highlights, balayage, and glazing than anybody else in this town! I have been seeing him consistently for a few years now, but have known him for about 7 years, total. In our time together, we have gone from bronde to platinum, and hit every shade in between! I cannot/will not let anyone else touch my tresses! He is a sweetheart, and every time I leave his chair, I look and feel like a total Rock Star!"
5,"Trader Joe's is awesome! My go to place, as everything is healthy and on top affordable. Also you can find some special and unique products.

I love their frozen section, but it is hit or miss, I have my favorites such as the chicken quesadillas, chocolate croissants, and hash browns.
Don;t forget to keep trying their samples as often that's how I discover my new favorite products such as new trail mixes, wines or cheese. It was here were I found a unique cheese: chocolate Parmesan, weird combination but awesome taste.

The staff is great and always really helpful, the one negative point is their parking, too tights, which is why I like to go on off hours and avoid rush hour."
5,We stopped at Denny's for ice cream. Daijerin was working alone and made it such a pleasant experience. She seemed to have time for everyone; even making a suggestion of her favorite ice cream sundae. Of which I tried...and i loved it. We would come back to this Denny's because of her personal service and professionalism.
5,"Come to see Dr. Wellish and his amazing staff for all of your vision needs! They are patient, friendly, funny, and affordable. The Wellish Vision Institute is the classiest group of doctors and staff that I've ever come across. I had LASIK done last March and I feel like the only patient they have because they are so quick to answer as many questions and ease any concerns I have. Dr. McCandless is also amazing. I needed plugs put in my tear ducts because of dry eye, and he was talking me through every step of the procedure. At one point, I started to get really sweaty and freak myself out and he immediately stopped to go get me water and the entire cart of snacks from the employee break room. I was so embarrassed but he made me feel comfortable and at the end we laughed it off. Come to see them, and don't go anywhere else!"
5,Hickory Tavern is a great place to relax and unwind. TVs everywhere. Food is great and service is very good. Great convenient location on Harris Blvd and Statesville Ave.
5,"Food are delicious. Very authentic and flavourful. Their menu offers a large variety of Korean dishes. Prices are very fair for the portions you get. Table cooking can get slightly expensive though. 24/7 operation is a huge bonus. Service-wise, speed is decent but the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired. Overall an awesome place to get your fix of Korean cuisine!"
5,Delicious. Fresh. Unique and new flavor each day of the week. I live going there. Generous sample size and I always end up buying something I like. I tried pastrami sandwich one time and I liked it.
5,"Thank you Trader Joe's for coming to Madison. 

After I left CA and came to Madison, this is one thing I missed so much. I don't know how graduate students survive without Trader Joe's.

I realized that the major product distribution center is different for CA and WI store. It didn't come as a surprise, but the variety and the quality of the products (especially diary products) are quite different. One huge disappointment is the pizza dough. I used to love the ones(wheat, plain, and garlic) sold at CA stores so much, but the WI one that comes from MA lacks in flavor and the texture is not right. The selection of milk, butter, and yogurt are somewhat limited, too. 

But I still think that they deserve 5 stars for providing convenient grocery option at affordable price. Also, on Tuesday 5-7, the food sample counter turns into a wine sampling counter. It's free, and they provide cheese sample to snack with the wine. Though the wine selection at the Madison TJs is not excellent, but once in a while you find a decent bottle at a bargain price."
5,"I had kalbi/kbbq in LA and this place was better. 

Even without dipping sauce the kalbi is BLESSED. marinaded to perfection and they even give you BONES to give to your dog after. 

10/10"
5,The food was pretty good they were out of the pumpernickel for the Rubin sandwich so I got it on sourdough it had great flavor and I am sure it would of been even better on the right bread  the salted caramel cookies are awesome so give this place a try and it also sells while loafs of bread
5,"I wore contacts and glasses for 31 years. My left eye was -10.00. My right eye was -9.50. And this past year, I started needing reading glasses. I'd been considering LASIK for many years and was planning to have it performed by Dr. Whiting (the best LASIK doctor in Minneapolis). Then I moved to Las Vegas. 2 1/2 years later, after much research, I chose Dr. Wellish. After my personal experience, I can assure you that Dr. Wellish is the *only* LASIK surgeon to consider. He is board certified, he brought the procedure to Las Vegas, he has the latest/up-to-date equipment and methods, he teaches other doctors LASIK, and he corrects other doctors mistakes! My first post-op appointment, I was seeing 20/30. Today, nearly 3 months later, I'm seeing 20/20! I wake up every day in amazement that I no longer need glasses or contact lenses! The entire staff at Wellish Institute are exceedingly kind, understanding, patient, thorough, and professional. The actual surgery was quick, painless, and anxiety-free. Thank you, Dr. Wellish and staff!!!!"
5,"Andrew was at my home today because my pool filter was not working. He came right on time, diagnosed the problem and fixed it within 15 minutes. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely be using them in the future."
5,"This pool problem took 3 trips by Aaron Pools to get the job done, the total price was the AHS service of $75.  Each time they called 3 days ahead, said the repairman (Bailey) would give a courtesy call when he was on this way.  The first time Bailey said he would call back when they had the parts.  They did about 5 days later and on the second trip Bailey said the filter was faulty and would need to be replaced.  So he said they'd call once he had the parts.  After 3 more days, they called and Bailey came out and replaced the filter.  Now my pool is completely clear again and we can enjoy our pool!  This company did a great job keeping me informed, dealing with AHS, and did great work.  I've seen the bad reviews here but did not have a bad experience at all with this company, I highly recommend them."
5,"The service was impeccable!  She gave us suggestions on when-how to serve our food to accommodate everyone. Our drinks were refilled without us asking. Our waitress was really on top of her game. We shared a blooming onion, I ordered the surf n turf  w/ a salad for my birthday dinner. My husband ordered  a Ribeye steak, w/a salad. One of our children ordered mac n cheese w/ fruit , and our other one ordered a grilled cheese w/fries. Everyone was pleased and that's not always easy! If it wasn't for the fact that our kids were getting sleepy we would have gotten desert as well. We will be back!!"
5,"Fillet minion, onion soup, desserts. It is a real steak house. The food was good, and waiter knew our next wishes one step before us. Total $123 for dinner for 4."
5,"Excellent small, family-run Vietnamese restaurant in Glendale on 59th just off the 101. Service was friendly and attentive but not overly hovering.  I ordered the Shaken Beef after the waitress said it was one of their most popular dishes. I can see why. It was delicious. The beef was tender and nicely seasoned.  The egg was cooked perfectly and I mixed it into the rice. My friend had the vermicelli noodle salad (bun) with pork. He said it was delicious. Serving sizes were perfect. Prices seemed a bit higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but so good!  Worth every penny. We will definitely be back."
5,"Wonderful place, my girl explained about my hair type, she listened to me, I felt at home, hope to try their spa soon, worth traveling 93 miles"
5,"We discovered this place off the strip and decided to stay at the Cannery Hotel & Casino since my father lives in Nellis AFB, only 10 min away.  This caliber restaurant is a hidden gem among this quaint, cigarette-filled casino.  Don't let it fool ya!  We had a very memorable, beautiful time!  The food is delicious, and the service IS impeccable!  The live piano music played in the background set the mood for a lovely evening. The pianist even charmed our 3 year old when she gave him a visit, and even played a couple of nursery tunes for her...Darling!  We enjoyed our 3-course Valentine's special...Wild Mushroom soup, your choice of halibut or steak, and chocolate lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  We also ordered extra appetizers -oysters, portobello frites, and escargot...aside from also filling up  on their delicious bread basket.  
We were comfortable, dressed ""crisp"" casual, and had the best dining experience!!  The food is absolutely delicious - filling! ..And we rolled ourselves right out of there.   See you again soon.  THANK YOU!"
5,Chef Ben is a new place for us. The dinner special with sesame chicken and orange chicken we excellent. It was very very good and extremely reasonably priced. We are fans and will be back for sure. Give them a try and enjoy!!
5,"Finally an ono 808 kau kau place near my house!

Kauai Cafe is not your typical cookie cutter ""Hawaiian BBQ"" place. It is ohana owned and operated and they serve legitimate island style home cooked food. No half-hearted bootleg island-wanna be food here. I put my local seal of approval on this place. (I'm born and raised in Hawaii just in case you couldn't tell by now) 

Some menu highlights and recommendations that I've tried:

Heineken beer batter chicken. It's a solid size hind-quarter. The chicken has a nice solid crunchy skin and still moist and juicy on the inside.

Portuguese Bean soup. man I wish they served this as a main dish instead of a side order. I look like a fatty when I tell them I want a big bowl of this. My dad would've loved this. 

Pau Hana Friday Hawaiian Plate special $15.99 Broke da mout!
 If you want real Hawaiian food food you better make it here early on Friday they usually sell out.
For 15.99 you got:
Kalua Pig w/ Cabbage
2 scoops rice
1 scoop mac salad
Ahi Poke
Chicken long rice
Squid Luau
Lomi Salmon
Poi (if you don't want it, give it to me!)
Haupia
*It should come with a pillow because I was DONE! after killing the whole thing!. Kanak-attack!

Needless to say I'm tempted every Friday to pick one up. 

Neva mind those other guys around the corner.. Come here for your 808 cravings. You can thank me later :)"
5,"Perfect location! I absolutely love their setup and most elated by the food! Their London Broil Pita was great! Steak was beautifully cooked! And tried Cajun Salmon as well, which was a delight too!"
5,This place was yummy. Gave it a try after someone recommended it to me. Their plates are a good portion size ( I couldn't finish my chicken Katsu).malasadas are super yummy! I'm from hawaii and this was better than some local places that are on the island.
5,Delicious!  My daughter and I have been trying various pho throughout the west valley... one of our favorites!
5,"This is our favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas.  The decor is nice, not over done or gaudy.  The tables and booths are spaced out and not on top of each other.  The staff are always friendly, engaging, and attentive.  And then there's the food...

So good.  If you're a soup fan, both the She-Crab and French Onion are second to none.  Their steaks are always perfect with marbeling, and always cooked perfect to how done you want them.  The sides are freakin' amazing and the vegetables always taste incredibly fresh.  Great wine selection and a full bar for those who enjoy a vodka, martini, or whatever you want!

It is pricey, I'd say $80-$140 for two, but I've always felt I got more than my money's worth there still."
5,"I have been using Aaron Pools for 1 year and have received outstanding service. It is a pleasure to speak with this team of professionals. From the time I dial and speak with the customer service representative until the work on my pool is completed, I have received world class support. 

Mike and his team know pool equipment better than anyone I have ever utilized. They come prepared, are meticulous as they service equipment and the work is done correctly the first time. 

I highly recommend this pool service corporation, you will not be disappointed!!!

Thank You Aaron Pool"
5,"Been going to this place for over ten years now, excellent service appetizers are Devine and creative, the escargot is absolutely wonderful, steaks are good , however not very prime tasting , but good enough"
5,"We were looking for a quick and easy meal after skating with the kids. We arrived just before 10pm and the 7 of us were seated right away upstairs. The night owl was great value, food was tasty and service was pretty good."
5,"I'm surprised to see all the reviews mentioning slow/bad service. I've always had great service here, even when the place was fairly busy. I don't often go on NFL Sundays or for real big sporting events, so maybe that's the tough time. 

Food is mostly good in my opinion. Nothing incredibly special, but I have always gotten what I expected! I will continue to visit fairly regularly."
5,"Super great and fresh! I'm vegan and the veggie pho was delicious and flavorful (an important yet rare quality for veggie pho). Came here with my parents and they got meat options, and both were pleased with those as well. The service was fast and accurate, and I don't have a bad thing to say about it. Try it, you'll love it!"
5,Great place.  Good food.  They treat you like family.
5,"Who reviews a surgeon? I do! It is important.  I had lasik performed by Dr. Wellish in November of 2012. Since then, I have recommended him to friends and coworkers.  I was really impressed by their friendly, efficient and professional service. I have had good results and still am sometimes amazed that I can see without any correction. This is the best thing I have done for myself in years. 

They have different surgery options and I went with the one that gives you 20/20 vision. They have one that is more expensive but gives you super hero vision. I decided to pass, since it seemed unnecessary. 

Dr. Wellish was recommended to me by optometrist and I can't thank him enough.  I was moving out of state just a couple of days after my surgery, so they made arrangements for me to see my regular optometrist for my first followup, then I came back to him for the next one. That extra step, and the fact that the doctor himself called me the night of my surgery really reinforced that I made the right decision. Fantastic service, great results! 

I think we've all heard those $299 per eye commercials on the radio for other places. I love a bargain as much as the next woman, if not more, but this is not the place to cut corners."
5,"Dr. Wellish did an exceptional job customizing my procedure for my individual needs. He really listened to how I use my eyes on a daily basis and together, we chose a monovision treatment.

My starting prescription was quite high, -10.00. Dr. Wellish made absolute sure that I was stable and that all the measurements revealed that I was a good candidate. He followed me closely month to month and showed extreme care and concern in my outcome and healing.

His office is beautiful and the staff are all friendly. I highly recommend Dr. Wellish as your LASIK or PRK surgeon if you want the best treatment before, after, and during the procedure."
5,"Not really sure what happened since my last visit,  but wow was it great! 

The food was cooked perfectly and all of us left full.  The green chili was so great I sat there looking up recipes for when I get home to make it!

Phenomenal fresh salsa... Perfectly cooked pulled pork,  and the mooseadilla was awesome as well! 

Wait staff was great and right on with service,  drink  refills,  etc. 

We will definitely be back again and that is a promise!"
5,"Hip hip hurrah for no-animal-product-pho! I'm so glad that this restaurant popped up when I yelp-ed ""vegan"" in Glendale. Their veggie pho is light, flavorful, and not overly salty. It comes with all the regular veggie fixings as well as fried tofu, carrots, cabbage, and baby bok choy (my fav!). My food came out quickly, so it'll be a great spot for those who are looking for a restaurant on their work lunch break. 5 stars for efficiency, staff, location, cleanliness, taste, and menu. Well worth the 8 bucks...I'll be a regular for sure!"
5,Aaron Pools is a good company that tried to make things right. I would say there is no reason you would not get great service with them. American Home Shield should be avoided like the plague if your getting a house warranty.
5,"Love this place! Great BBQ. Would Definately recommend. The smoked ham is great, as are the side dishes."
5,"Love this place!!
When you go in wether  it is to look or order they give you a slice of homemade bread with butter as your there!! I have had sandwiches, rolls and bread from here and they all are fantastic..
The service is always great and this time we were welcomed by the store owner in which he told us how they make the breads. They do the whole wheat there where in back they have an area where they grind the wheat etc by hand!!
Awesome place and will always go back"
5,"When we first heard rumors it might be coming to town, we'd email the TJ's mother ship and they'd deny everything, but eventually it landed, and our quality of life has decidedly improved. Everything there tastes so good, we're pretty sure it's laced with crack. Lots of organic goods, often at lower prices then conventional fare at grocery stores. Amazing selection of great tasting, relatively healthy convenience food (already cooked balsamic chicken breast or BBQ pork, chopped squash ready for stir fry, fried rice & chicken that takes 3 minutes to prepare). Produce can be pretty shoddy, but nice to have available. Tons of yummy snacks, often made with real sugar instead of corn syrup. Great greek yogurt at great prices. Staff is incurably friendly and helpful and hard-working and laid back at the same time."
5,"I recently moved into our house and was faced with maintaining and fixing the pool. The storms have been destroying the pool and the previous pool guys havent been helpful in a lot of cases. This pool was put together like shit and unfortunately I'm the one eating said shit now.
After a summer AZ monsoon destroyed my pool motor, I called Aaron Pools and they had Tyler come out and help me. He not only helped install the new motor in the brutal heat (with my pain in the ass golden retriever running around him) but walked me through the measures to take to prevent its demise from a storm again, timeframes on cleaning/fixing the filters, things to look for I wasn't aware of, and gave me his number so if I have any questions he can try to help over the phone so I don't have to make & pay for a full appointment. I cannot say enough how big of a pain in the ass this pool is even before the storms so I'm really happy with the help and additional service Tyler provided us."
5,"Want warm and fuzzy....how about the fresh smell of baked bread!
Walking into Great Harvest Bread is like walking into your grandma's kitchen on ""bread"" day. 

The store is very warm and inviting with all kinds of breads displayed that have been freshly baked that day. Overwhelmed at what to buy...don't be. They  give FREE samples every time you come in.

I have only tried two breads from here so far and am addicted

1) Pumpkin chocolate chip bread - it will change your life! It is so good that I will probably give everyone I love it over the holidays. YUMMY! ($7.00)

2) Cinnamon Sugar Spice loaf ( I got a free sample of this one) It is so tasty, sweet and buttery. Delicious.

GHB sells made to order sandwiches as well that I am yet to try but will in the future.

All I know is that these breads really RISE to the occasion! :)"
5,"Our waitress, Jessica G, and the manager went above and beyond the call of duty!! Thank you very much for making sure everything was to my satisfaction. My dinner was delicious and I will definitely be back. Thanks again and Happy Birthday!! to me..."
5,"Over the last 20 yrs, I've been to a number of salons throughout the Valley. Have to say, where nails are concerned, it's reallllly hard to find quality, regardless of price and location. And I'll admit it: I'm persnickety (albeit, in the best way possible). As a result, many appointments ended in frustration and wasted money (generally, because I ended up having to fix what I'd paid someone else to do). That all changed when I discovered Red Door. I go about once a month for a mani/pedi. Have also had massages there. Always a pleasant experience. Front desk staff are polite, attentive, helpful, personable, and professional. The massage therapists are fantastic. And the majority of the nail technicians are very good (i.e., know what they're doing, ask questions to provide the best service.) I have to say, Sharron is the best, though. Everything she does is perfection (shaping, painting, hand/foot massage). I've finally found ""the one."" Can't recommend her enough.

My gift to the ladies of Phoenix. Enjoy!"
5,"I had LASIK performed on both eyes here and had a really good experience. I read a few reviews mentioning long waits but never experienced that myself. Everyone on their staff was upbeat and informative, from consultation to post-op.  I have been recommending Dr Wellish to a lot of friends."
5,Family friendly spot for sure. Rare to find an Asian spot without the usual sake crowd. Service is quick and friendly. My family has been here 4 times in a months time. They've never disappointed.  We've even called in take out and it was done quick even though I was actually already on my way there...lol! Let's not forget that it is very reasonably priced.
5,"Yep, 5 stars.  This is a kick.  I read the ratings on Wellish before I scheduled the work (cataract removal) - it was either 1 or 5, none in between.  Well, I am a 5.  With the evaluations and surgeries, I have been in both Flamingo offices and the surgery center off of Tenaya.  I have to say that every person I encountered (maybe 20 of them) was considerate, seemed professional, and was gentle (I am a pansy in such matters).  None of the staff seemed to be interested in pushing me along (i.e. quantity over quality).  Dr. Wellish was a hoot - he made a point to see and chat  with me for a moment at each surgery.  The result is I can see better than I have in years.  

I have not been to the other ophthalmologists in the city but I can sure recommend the Wellish Institute."
5,"Maria is an amazing stylist-She takes her time, is always engaging, and makes you look like a million bucks. Highly recommend!"
5,"Great staff and great doctor. I feel special every time I go.
 I just hate I moved further way. But it is always great to get good service and feel satisfied with everything you received. I only hear good things about him and I have only good things to say. Bless him."
5,"Wonderful food. Great hidden gem . Great weekday specials. It will be a place I will return to!
They even have mochi for dessert!"
5,"This was our first time at this location. We decided to get the unlimited crab. It was delicious. We also had semi- frozen crab but Chris, the manager, made sure things were made right and took great care of us. We will definitely go back."
5,"I eat a lot of Pho around the Phoenix area and have to say this was some of the very best no question. Everything was very fresh and full of flavor. We also tried the papaya salad which was excellent. Their other dishes looked very good as well, can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"
5,"My hubby made reservations for my birthday and thank goodness - because this place is busy! There was a 45 minute wait list, but we got seated right away (love it when they honor reservations).

There was a live piano player who played all of the classics, yes even ""As Time Goes By."" We felt pretty classy. I was wearing a tiara for my birthday, and I felt like I was treated accordingly. Frederick is a class act, and he took very good care of us. I can see he has a lot of fans on here, and he deserves it. He alone is enough to come back for - but then there's the food...

I don't know if it was a special thing for that Saturday, but a lady offered us a wine tasting. Not only did we fall in love with one of the wines, but the prices were actually reasonable! We each got two glasses.

I got the scallops and...well...the only nice way to put this is that they were so incredible I almost needed a towel and a cigarette afterwards. My husband laughed as he watched my eyes roll into the back of my head. From the break basket to the green beans, the entire meal was extraordinary.

Birthday girl got a free crème brûlée for dessert - HEAVEN!

I sneaked a peak at the bill - not scary at all! We got so much for such a reasonable price. I am sincerely impressed.

After seeing a movie in the luxury theater, this dinner was absolute perfection. Then, on to a concert right on the other side of the casino. It was a wonderful night, and all under one roof. We are already planning on our next excursion."
5,"Terrific food, craft beer and service. Came on a Tuesday night on a business trip and there were a ton TVs playing the Indians game. It was 59 cent wing night and the wings were a great quality. They came out hot and fresh with many different flavors. I had a nice Lake Erie Monster Imperial IPA to go along with it. Great well run restaurant."
5,"I had a party of 20 catered by Dickies. Everyone loved the food the brisket was so moist and tender, pulled pork was fantastic, the beans were great,  the loaded mashed potatoes were a hit . We had coleslaw also that had a perfect amount of sweetness and tang. We will order from them again . A thumbs up experience. Thank You"
5,This place is great. They even have dog treats. Great rewards program also. Sandwiches are great also.
5,"I've been using Aaron Pools for several years.  I've used them to replace my pool heater, repair a leaky pool pump, repair the floor cleaner valve assembly, pool timer, and replace the pool filter assembly.  They were quick to repair/replace the items and explained all of my options.  I've not had any issues with the work performed by them."
5,Me and my roommate go here a lot. The BBQ nachos are so good  we had some younger guy server and he sucked so bad we didn't even want to go back again. We ended up going back last night and had Amanda as our server and she is so amazing! We will deff keep coming back and we will be asking to sit with her. We were going to tell the manager about how great she was but I didn't see her when we were leaving so I hope she reads this. Thanks for being a great server Amanda
5,"Nothing beats grandma's homemade bread...except the breads at Great Harvest. They know their stuff. Staff is so friendly. Met the owner today. Her joy and enthusiasm is infectious. You can tell she loves what she does and, boy, it sure translates. 

Don't forget to grab a free slice of bread."
5,"Been going to this place for over ten years now, excellent service appetizers are Devine and creative, the escargot is absolutely wonderful, steaks are good , however not very prime tasting , my escape!!!!"
5,I have been coming to this place for several years now. Owners are very friendly and the food is fantastic! One of the best Teriyaki Bowls at the best price you'll find! I LOVE this place and you would too!
5,"Very flavorful vegetarian pho. Lots of fried tofu and bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, and carrots. It was a little salty. I put the usual hoisin sauce and chili sauce but def wish I would of skipped the hoisin. The extra large was the perfect size to share with my daughter."
5,"I just moved into a house with the water valve leaking. I had a pool guy come check it out and bought different pieces for it and it still never sealed the leak. I actually had the leak for about 2 weeks. After my pool guy couldn't fix it, I ended up calling my home warranty company to come and fix it. They had Westin come out from Aaron pools. He came to check the valve and ordered a new piece. The next day, he came back and replaced some old piping and replaced the whole valve under the home owners insurance. He was great to work with and very knowledgeable! Thanks Westin for your awesome work!"
5,Friendly and clean place ! Has plenty of veggie options!! Papaya salad and pho is great !! Their spring rolls are great . Thanx
5,"Went to Chef Bens tonight for the first time. Wanted to get some sushi and some appetizers to go and this is close to my house so I gave it a try. When you walk into this place it reminds you of a typical Asian food express restaurant, but the sushi is what sets them apart. They have an extensive sushi menu and you will not be disappointed. I ordered the salmon sashimi, some nigiri, the big four roll, a salmon roll and crab puffs. The lady that took my order was very patient with me and helpful. She pointed out that one of the rolls I ordered and the crab puffs were on a happy hour special that came with a soup or salad. I placed my order and waited maybe 6 minutes before they were calling my name and handing me my food! The lady who handed me my order let me know they even gave me a free order of egg rolls! When I got home my husband and I started eating and we were so excited because everything was delicious! The salmon was fresh and the sushi rice was perfect. We will definitely be back again!"
5,"I have been in the Service Industry for over 30 years and I have made  many visits to Medical facilities for appointments, treatments, etc.
I would have to say that the staff at Wellish Institute and the Doctors are super fantastic.
They should make a customer service video on how to effectively run a facility and sell it to some of these other places in Vegas.

I wanted to do Lasik for a while, but wasn't comfortable with a few places that I visited.
Then 2 of my wife's friends had their eyes done by Wellish Institute, and they loved it.
I was still a little hesitant. But after the consultation and exam, I was totally impressed and ready to go.

I have been wearing glasses for almost 15 years and I hate contacts and prescription sun glasses. Plus every few years your shelling out more money.
I had my Lasik done less then a week ago, and I am extremely impressed with my vision.
I am a very active out going person.

To not have to worry about glasses, poking contacts in and out, breaking or scratching and cleaning glasses, is a blessing in disguise.
Guess what.   My eyes are going to get a little better.   

After 15 years I am finally glass and contact free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dr. Wellish, the techs, receptionists, consultant's assistants, all deserve 10 stars.
All of you guys are the greatest.
      
If your thinking about Lasik go see Rebecca for a consultation 
Tell them Boyzie from Buldogis highly recommended him."
5,Best Cuban I've ever had. Great friendly service. Plenty of tvs for sports. The music was just a bit loud for my old ears.
5,Really great steak house. Wonderful staff that is on the ball. Ask for Darryl for your waiter - this gentlemen is a true professional and made our night very enjoyable. We had portobello fries as an appetizer and it came with an amazing sauce. The steaks were great along with a very good Wedge salad. I would highly recommend this spot for a great meal.
5,"I just got PRK done on both my eyes, and I couldn't be happier. I had all my pre and post ops with Dr. McCandless, and he is the sweetest most down to earth guy. He's super knowledgeable and walks through everything with you. They were very thorough with all the exams and hence why we chose PRK for my surgery over traditional LASIK. After the pre ops, I was not an eligible candidate for LASIK, but a candidate for PRK.

 It took me about 8-10 months from my first visit to actually decide to go through with the procedure. And not once in that time frame did I ever get harassed or hounded about it. And that, to me, shows that they aren't there for money like some of the other offices, but to do what is best for you.

Dr. Wellish, who does the procedures, is also a very sweet man, and very knowledgeable. I would completely trust him with my eyes. I'm just thrilled that my eye doctor recommended this place, and that I can wake up and see clearly."
5,"Food was very good. Service was friendly and fast. Great draft specials. Prices seemed reasonable. Also, this place is located in a very nice area. Would recommend."
5,Good food and fast service from friendly staff for lunch. My glass is rarely empty.  They have great specials for lunch everyday but my favorite menu item is the Fench Quarter salad.
5,"This place is fantastic.  You'll get the best massage you've ever had here, but they also offer facials, makeup applications, hair services, body treatments, waxing services and more.

You can also buy some of their great products here too.  And if you're planning a wedding, bachelorette party or any other occasion, you might want to consider one of their group packages. You could have all the ladies in your bridal party come get facials and massages before the wedding or even invite the groom and groomsmen too.  They cater to both women and men here and the staff is extremely professional and the services are luxurious and pampering."
5,"Don't get all the bad reviews.  Controller inside my variable speed pump failed on Monday morning.  Opened a claim with American Home Shield and soon got a call from Aaron Pools to schedule.  They showed up on time, with an advance courtesy call, diagnosed the problem in five minutes and left to get the part (the electronic control board).  Returned a couple of hours later and completed the job in 30 minutes.  Everyone from the office to the field technician were prompt, courteous and professional.  Did exactly what they said they'd do, when they said they'd do it.  Best experience I've had with a repair company coming to my home in years."
5,"Second visit here. As good as the first time! I had the A Bento Box this time, with miso soup and I added an order of egg rolls (comes as 2 small rolls).  Same server as before. I will keep coming back here."
5,"TLC. The staff here at the Red Door go out of their way to pamper and take extra good care of their customers. I received a facial and pedicure. Both were just what the ""doctor ordered"" during these stressful times. My facial included many layers of applying creams and other natural ingredients. While a mask was on, my technician massaged hands, arms, neck and chest. Sooooo nice.  My pedicure was amazing with Teresa. I just can't say enough. She paid extra attention to every detail of giving a pedicure. I would go back in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Phoenix. Thank you ladies for a lovely morning."
5,Went on a Tuesday. Wings were only 59 cents and the beers were under $3. My favorite of the top three spicy flavors was the Mango Habenero. Fresh cut fries were pretty good too and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. Lots of TVs and the bartender Crystal was very friendly and informative. Happy Hour is 12-7pm Monday thru Friday - just wish we had one of these in Wadsworth. There's really no good wing places like this nearby.
5,"Every time we go to this location the servers and staff are friendly, even the managers walk around asking how everything is. The food is always fantastic! We LOVE our prime rib and they always have delicious cuts, perfectly seasoned and cooked. The sides are wonderful too!! We'll continue to go here for our steak fix. MMMMMM!"
5,"I followed my stylist Jamie here a few months ago. If you are looking for someone to trust with your hair, Jamie is the guy!! The first time I met him, he took the time to really understand what I was looking for. He gave me exactly what I wanted and I've been a client ever since! I swear when I go to meet with him, he always takes it up a notch. I'll explain what I'm thinking, he'll agree and maybe have a suggestion or two, and I've learned to trust his suggestions...and I end up walking out looking like a million bucks! He is just fantastic and I highly recommend him!! He is so professional and is a genius with hair!!"
5,Always pleasure to be there and always having exceptional experience.  I would recomend Helen at the Red Door to all who would like an exceptional services
5,I had a Swedish massage by Nene - I'm a bit of a massage junkie and this was seriously the best massage I've ever had. Nene is amazing.
5,"I love the sushi and the staff here. The prices are great and i always leave happy. Try the tempura spicy tuna, its heaven."
5,Love this office!! Tehani is a favorite of mine! I have had cataracts removed from both eyes and I am amazed at the difference in my eye sight. Dr Wellish did my surgery and Dr. McCandless has taken care of all my post-op appointments. I have nothing bad to say about them. I have read others reviews and their complaints about the wait time. I personally don't have a problem waiting for Dr.'s that are amazing. There is a long wait time because they are top in their field and worth every minute and penny!! Any Dr that is as busy as they are is normally because they are excellent at what they do! I have recommended them to many and will continue to recommend them in the future!
5,This Outback location is great! We live fairly close to this Outback and every time we have been here the service and food has been wonderful. I usually get a 6oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and the steak is always cooked and seasoned to perfection. I have asked for a few minor modifications such as a gravy for the mashed potatoes which they do not have but our waitress recommended the mushroom sauce usually used for steak and it was great on the mashed potatoes. The lobster mac and cheese that they recently had as a special was AMAZING! The bartender on our last visit also recommend that I put a shot of peach schnapps in my blue moon beer and once again it was AMAZING! This Outback just does it for me. I don't need to spend a fortune at a fancy steakhouse when the Outback down the street meets my every steakhouse need. Well done!
5,"Once you see Sharron for a pedicure, you will never go anywhere else!  Amazing service, friendly staff, and peaceful atmosphere.  Highly recommend!"
5,"My biggest regret with my surgery and Dr. Wellish's office?? Not doing it sooner!!  I originally put down a deposit for my surgery 3 years ago and just finally had the surgery in December, 2013.  I was really scared about the process, but in the end it was extremely simple and pain free.  Unfortunately I didn't qualify for LASIK because of my astigmatism so I had to have the PRK surgery, which has a longer healing time.  I went in for my one month follow up this week and my vision is so great that I received a notification to the DMV that I no longer have a restricted license due to vision correction!

All in all, the experience was wonderful.  Dr. Wellish spent over an hour with me going over the differences for PRK vs. LASIK and discussing why he recommended PRK for me.  I didn't feel rushed or like just a number, I felt like I was his only patient that day.  His goal was to satisfy my concerns before moving forward and he took the time necessary to do that.  The day of the surgery I was given some medication to take the edge off and my eyes were numbed, so I didn't feel much of anything.  In a matter of minutes it was over.

I've been back to his office several times for follow ups and have been impressed by his facility and staff.  From the front desk staff to his support team (other doctors and nurses), everyone is friendly and competent.  

One note on the cost.  I imagine some people are detered by the cost, I know I was.  I found Dr. Wellish to be a bit more expensive than other doctors in town.  I'm glad I took my optometrist's advice and went with him.  There's a reason he costs more--he's the best in town, bar none.  I think paying a bit more for such an important surgery is a no-brainer.  Why mess around and take chances with something as important as your vision??

Highly, highly recommend Dr. Wellish.  If you are even considering LASIK surgery, GO FOR IT!  It's one of the best things I've ever done and I'm so grateful to Dr. Wellish and his staff for their work."
5,"Fresh everything! I will review my favorite items from there as everything from there is yummy and fresh. I have nothing bad to say.
Also, you get a free slice of any bread they have.

Caramel Scone: To die for. The scone itself reminds me of pie crust. It is so flaky and I can taste the butter in the best way. There are bits of caramel and what I believe to be white chocolate through out. It is just heaven. I had 3 in one day one time. I really could not control myself.

Caramel Apple Bread: Best bread for bread pudding. It is the right amount of sweet and it is the softest you will ever touch.

Cinnamon Pull Aparts: Basically mini cinnamon rolls. Really soft and tons of cinnamon and frosting. Not ooey gooey like Cinnabon, but delicious all the same!

Customer Service: Wonderful. Everyone is always so cheery when you walk in."
5,I've only had facials here. The products are great and I love the facility. Having someone as attentive and thorough as Maria providing my service is just the icing on the cake :)
5,"Some of the members of our Motorcycle Ministry and I went last night, and it was great. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was amazing. The service was amazing...Definitely will be back!"
5,"We went because yelp friends said the food was excellent and it was amazing.  Frederick was our server as my friends had enjoyed him before and
 highly recommended him.  What a great waiter! If was as good as any steakhouse I have gone  to ever! 

Bob Millard who is one of the best piano players in the country was there playing. What a treat to dee this legend up close + personal.  What a nice guy. He played with Tom Jones, Dudley Moore, Phyllis Diller and Dustin Hoffman to name a few.  He is as good  today as ever!

Go and enjoy their 3 course meal and listen to Mr. Millard tickle the Ivories. You will have s great night.  Friday + Saturdays ."
5,Coming to Wellish for my LASIK was literally the best decision I've ever made! I am incredibly grateful and happy with the results. Worth every penny to know I was in great hands! I LOVED working with Dr. McCandles and Dr. Wellish. They are so knowledgable and calming that they made the situation so comfortable. Rebecca and Tahani are also among my favorites there for their friendliness and patience. Once again so so so grateful for the good hands I was in and for my now perfect vision!
5,"Love this place for drinks special and just to hangout on a low key evening after work.  Love the waitress Jennifer, she is amazing"
5,Food was good and service was efficient. Went there for the all you can eat korean bbq special. Not a bad price for what you get.
5,"I have returned to give this location a 2nd chance. Meat was flavourful and rather good cuts. We wanted for nothing, refilled sides and tea, brought meats out quickly. Service was prompt and professional. In the end the experience was a pleasant one."
5,"When I visit a restaurant, select a dish of my preference, and the dish arrives hot and tasty, I am a happy camper.  My selection was the Seafood Bayou with tilapia and shrimp both grilled to perfection.  The steaming hot entree was served over Tavern Rice with a side of fresh fruit that was absolutely delicious.  Being in a Tavern, I had to order something to drink.  I opted for the hard apple cider which tasted pretty much like an apple martini with a bit less punch.  It was quite tasty and I had to remind myself to sip rather than drink!  For dessert, the chocolate cake sounded delicious but I could not stuff any more into my mouth.  Although I drive by regularly, I had forgotten Hickory Tavern was at this location.  I enjoyed my meal and anxiously look forward to my next visit.  This lunchtime visit was superb.  

I almost forgot to talk about the sweet potato fries!  They are fabulous with honey drizzled on top (or you can have it on the side)!  If you are not afraid of something that tastes good, give them a try.

NOTE:  Since the hubs and I had the kids with us, an evening meal in a Tavern would have been out of the question."
5,"Getting LASIK surgery was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. The ending results with my vision were remarkable, and it wouldn't have been possible without Dr. Wellish and the rest of his amazing staff at the Wellish Vision Institute.

From day one, everyone was very attentive, helpful, and understanding to my needs and concerns. The professionalism of the staff was astonishing. They made me feel right at home like family once I stepped foot in the door, and had my first consultation. They helped me pick a vision plan that fit perfectly for my eyes, and took time to make sure everything was planned accordingly and perfectly to my schedule. They have many different surgery options to fit everyone's needed, which I also admired a lot.  Although I was very nervous when I considered doing this surgery, thanks to one specific staff member Rebecca, all my fears were gone, and I couldn't wait for my surgery date. I recommend everyone to meet her when having their first appointment. Lastly, Dr. Wellish was one of the best doctors I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. When I met him the day of my surgery, he reassured me that I could trust him with this big and positive change in my life, and he was right. Within hours after my surgery, I was emotional with tears of gratitude as I could see clearly for the first time in my life. I've never felt so blessed to be able to do something as simple as to see. Some people don't understand how frustrating it can be to see blurry at all times and not see objects without halos around them, but I do. Now, I can proudly say I have 20/20 vision when I used to have such a thick lens prescription, that it was impossible to find frames to secure them.

I recommend everyone to consider the Wellish Vision Institute when thinking about getting LASIK surgery. Dr. Wellish changed my life in ways I cannot explain, and it all started with a dream to be able to see without using my contacts or glasses. Now this dream has come true, and I am now ready to conquer my next goal.

5,"15 minutes for a cold sandwich when no one is in front of you is too long! My sandwich was made and set aside then other orders after me where started. The lettuce was old.

12/4 thank you Kim for making thing right!"
5,Have been here several times. This is great little Bakery which moved into its current location from next door about a year ago. We stopped in there every time we grab a coffee at the Starbucks next to it. They also make gluten-free bread which is available fresh one day a week.
5,"I've been to the location on Yonge near Dundas a few times, and it always tastes amazing. The restaurant is always full, but the service still manages to be good.

It's probably not ""authentic"" Korean food, but every item on their menu I've tried tasted incredible. I especially love their kimchi, everywhere else I've tried just makes it spicy, but these guys make theirs sour too."
5,"Have yet to have a bad meal. This has turned into our weekly go to place. Noticed some turnover in the wait staff but food, service, and cleanliness has stayed consistent. Wish they had a patio and a larger parking lot. Would really be nice if their website provided current info regarding performing bands each weekend. Great place for family dining or a night out without the kiddies."
5,It was particularly amazing tonight great service food was perfect fresh and hot and tasty. The owner came over to check on us. New owner which explains the drastic improvement.  If you haven't been here in a while give it a new try.
5,"I encountered Aaron Pools through my Home Warranty- Old Republic.  I received a call after I submitted in my ""claim"" and they were able to schedue with 48 hours.  The day prior to the repair visit, I had a lady call to give me the time window.  Our tech was on time, professional and courteous.  He did an exceptional job and explained each step to us and was able to show where the leak was, why the equipment was loud (motor had to be rebuilt) and provide thorough explanation.  I am very happy with their work and the professionalism and expertise that they demonstrated yesterday!  For all the work that was done, I paid my deductible and possibly changed who will maintain my pool for the future."
5,"Love, love, love this place!!  Went to the original location at Yonge and Eglinton for years before the vaughan one opened up.   Always had either the Basta or the Milano which are both delicious.  Just recently I tried the Udine and now I go to bed thinking about it.  It was that good.  Yum!!"
5,"We went there in a game night, so there was some brutal noise, but we didn't mind =) 

""An Asian girl"" was our waitress. She was very helpful, very kind and when she noticed we were out of States, she begun to articulate more, thanks for that! Well, food was very good, service was excellent, wine was cheap, game night was actually also kind of fun.

Next night we went back and I asked our new waitress what is ""grits"". She didn't know how to explain so she got me sample from kitchen!

If you go there, ask what is days vegetable :)"
5,"I am usually not big on chain restaurants. However I can't help but give the local Outback at Chandler Blvd. and the 101 five stars! The wife and I dined there last night with some friends and here is how it went:

1. The doors were held open by two waitresses.
2. We were greeted with smiles from both of them welcoming us and we were also greeted with a smile and a welcome by the hostess. 
3. Expecting a wait I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately. 
4. We were immediately greeted by our waitress with a smile and a welcome. She was prompt, helpful, and you could just tell that she was there to make our experience a great one! 
5. Our friends got some cheese fries which looked awesome but I couldn't eat them because of my diet (low carb). I was laughing when I pointed out that they just HAD to put bacon on those fries. The waitress smiled and left and came back with a bowl of bacon ON THE HOUSE for yours truly!
6. When my steak came out it was cooked to perfection. 
7. My drink glass was never empty the entire time. 
8. I was asked if I wanted a box for what I couldn't eat. 
9. Oh and the manager came by to check on us with a smile. She also asked if we needed anything and when my buddy said he would like some more iced tea instead of sending the waitress back to do that she got it herself! 
10. When we left we were again thanked for coming and the doors held open for us BY THE MANAGER! 

I have to say that I have never received this high level of service from any restaurant anywhere. 

BRAVO! 

I give this restaurant and its staff and its management two thumbs up...way up!"
5,Omg where to start Darrel! Is the best server ever he make sure you need nothing for the best dining experience. Friendly and very professional outstanding customer service is better than Top5! I go at least 2-3 times a month don't miss out ask for Darrel! Everyone is great but he is a shining STAR.. THANKS ALL SEE YOU SOON. BTW get a side car from Jennifer these to are the best perfect for any occasion!!!!
5,"Best local food I've had in Vegas!

The Friday special comes with everything you need. Rice, lau lau, kalua pig, mac salad, lomi salmon, chicken long rice, squid luau, poke, poi, and haupia! 

I am picky when it comes to local food(born and raised on Kauai), I don't eat at L&L because I consider it Hawaii's fast food, so when I say I loved this place, I mean I LOVED it.
The lau lau and kalua pig are perfectly seasoned and not too salty, the mac salad is balanced and not drowned in mayo. 
The poke is fresh and delicious-I could eat poke and poi everyday, lol.
The poi is real poi, not the sweet 'Hanalei' poi.

Very impressed with this restaurant. Writing this review and looking at the picture I posted is making me hungry! 

Go try it!"
5,Great service.  Actually a very good place to eat. Steak was perfect.  Mash potato was the shit... No lie I can probably survive off of it. Will eat here again.  Kind of expensive but worth it.
5,"One of the best sports bars around!!! Great food, good beer selection, and reasonable prices. On top of that the servers are super friendly and are exceptional at their jobs!!! Highly recommend!!! (And the fried pickles/dip are the bomb!!!)"
5,"Not just for the ladies, not to mention, get to wear a robe that will make you feel like Magnum P.I. in his down time. Seriously though, I had a fantastic experience.  LaVonna, has an incredibly relaxing and beneficial technique.  I had a facial that allowed me to escape all the worries of the world and will keep me looking as young as Rob Lowe and John Stamos. Trust your face and body to LaVonna's magical hands and you will not be disappointed.  Oh!..and make sure you have the post treatment cookie! It will put your mouth in a blissful place after your body has already been sent there by LaVonna."
5,We were very happy while eating at the Happy Moose! We went on Saturday around 5 and were seated promptly. They weren't very busy which was great. Our waitress was super friendly and was very attentive. She even offered suggestions and boy were they good! I had the wing and pretzel combo and it was perfect! Although too much food for me they were sure tasty. The buffalo ranch sauce was perfect! My husband had the ribs and wing combo and he said they were fall off the bone and very tasty. I'm glad we tried them out and we will be back for sure!
5,Every time I come over on this side of town I must stop and I must get something I don't care beds down to a little tube of honey we're a big loaf or bread this place is absolutely outstanding I love it love it love it love it
5,I am soooo glad I found this bakery. They have the best spinach and feta bread I've ever had. Also really good customer service.
5,Super 'Ono!!!! I got the chicken Katsu and my friend got the loco moco. Both were super delicious and filling! The staff are all very nice and friendly with the aloha spirit. Will recommend this place to anyone!!!
5,"I had the absolute best pedicure of my life today from Raisa.  My feet were in sad shape after months of neglect, and she worked on them for an hour and a half and turned them into gorgeous, soft, smooth, perfectly polished feet. I've been happy with pedicures at the spa at Camelback Inn and the spa at the Royal Palms  but  the pedicure I got today was nothing short of a miracle.  I would recommend Raisa's Signature Pedicure to anyone and plan to go back in a few weeks.  It was an indulgence, but it was completely worth it!"
5,"As someone who wore contacts and glasses for 20+ years, I cannot say enough about how happy I am with my LASIK procedure from the Wellish Vision Institute.  Going to bed without having to take out your contacts, and waking up being able to see is the most incredible thing when you've been basically blind your entire life. I am so appreciative of the work they've done.  I had the custom procedure done and my vision is now better than 20/20, somewhere between 20/10 and 20/15.  

Everyone at their facility was super friendly and knowledgeable.  Any question or concern I had was addressed quickly and professionally.  

This is absolutely the place to get LASIK done in the Vegas area."
5,Called in after a long day of work and order some pho and a spring roll. They always get my order right and taste pho-king amazing every time. Thank you for the quick service and always getting my order correct.
5,"I was on my way to Costco. Noticed the bakery and went in. Ordered a breakfast sandwich that was great. Their products looked amazing and the smells were intoxicating. I bought a cinnamon roll for the road, and when asked, they willingly scraped off most of the icing. It was really good. This is now the best reason to visit Las Vegas !"
5,The two technicians that came to my house were genius.  They were kind and didn't push any services.  I learned a lot and would highly recommend them to anyone.  I used a different pool company at first and this company actually knew what was wrong with my pool and the wiring.  5 Starts.   Very very happy!
5,The Heineken beer battered mahi mahi is onolicious!  They also give a military discount.
5,"I had my LASIK eye surgery today. Dr. Wellish and his wonderful team are excellent, from the friendly receptionist with the great memory, to Brittney, the refractive counselor, Dr. McCandless, Bernie, the technician, the counselor manning the desk in the operating suite and all the people assisting Dr. Wellish with the surgery. The whole experience was so positive and easy. I highly recommend Wellish Vision Institute. And if you are scared, don't be! I was terrified and it over so quickly and the surgery really was painless!"
5,"Best Denny's in the entire Phoenix area.  Has the nicest waitresses and is very clean, friendly and accommodating to kids and special requests. We miss it since we moved an hour away. All the Denny's in Northern Phoenix could learn from this one!"
5,What a great experience! Today was surgery day and everything went as planned. I can see!!!!!! I'm so happy. From the first visit to the surgery day everyone has been so helpful and comforting. I never felt nervousness and anxious at all. The surgery was so simple and easy. There was no pain and I felt like it went so fast. I have lots of friends and family that had already went to Dr Wellish so I knew he's the best in town. Thanks to all the staff and especially Dr Wellish!
5,"Omg, I don't know where to start. If you love bread and you want it fresh over the grocery store stuff, this is the place. I was in there last week and bought pumpkin bread along with apple cinnamon swirl. Omg!!! You can even try samples. You can't go wrong."
5,We love this place. We can get the best alcohol-free wine: the white sparkling chardonnay with a very reasonable price. The people are nice and helpful. They also have the best lentil chips! Only in TJ's!
5,"I don't understand why anyone would rate Trader Joe's lower than 5 stars, the place is perfect. Their staff is always friendly and they have a great selection of products that are all quality, quite tasty and in my opinion all reasonably priced.  And if you are a wine drinker they do have a great selection of lower priced wines."
5,"this place has rescued me from so many hung over work days with their amazing Bento combo (pick anyone, they're all amazing!)."
5,"The Best Bánh Mì ?ac Biet in town (Vietnamese Combination Sandwich) If you think Lee's Sandwiches is good, you have to try this. This is way better."
5,"Love, love, love this place!  They have all these amazing snacks and healthy foods.  Everything here is delicious and the staff is always so friendly.  I don't understand why the review has two dollar signs because groceries here are relatively inexpensive compared to the same item sold at regular grocery stores.  There are very few items I need to buy at a regular store that Trader Joe's doesn't have.  Highly recommend this place."
5,"Really fantastic lunch specials during the week! I went today and had great spaghetti and garlic bread (comes with tea too!) for $7.75. Honestly, for Uptown, that can't be beat. My friend had the jalapeño burger and it was also delicious. This place has the best fries. And homemade ranch dressing that is also very good. For uptown it's quick, reasonably priced, and of great quality! I will be back!"
5,"Without a doubt, one of the ""Finest"" steakhouses in all of Las Vegas! Unbelievable service, fantastic food, & great ambiance! From Steve Uricchio, to Todd Landis, this amazing dining destination never fails!!! And a big shout out to Vegas's top bartender, Jenn! Always a winner & We'll see you again soon!!! #ToddLandis #WaverlysSteakhouse #AlwaysGreat"
5,"My experience with Dr. Wellish and his staff was nothing short of amazing. From the day I met for my consultation to the after surgery follow up appointments the staff and Dr. Wellish were as friendly as can be. Working in the customer service industry, I wish my staff were as nice and caring as Dr. Wellish and his staff are. When visiting Dr. Wellish's office I was always greeted with a hello and a smile and never had to wait longer than 5 minutes before being called to the back. Each and every employee I met was very helpful and kind. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Dr. Wellish to anyone considering LASIK."
5,"I walked into the building and was immediately relaxed by the atmosphere and the soft music. I was led back to the relaxation area, with a robe a wrap and a nice cold glass of pure water. In walks Maria with a smile on her face and she les me back to the facial area. I have to tell you it was the best facial I Ever had in my life. She was extremely gifted and I would recommend any and everyone to try it least once. I got the advanced brightening facial and I haven't had to moisturize my face since. That was three days ago. I am over the moon happy. I've already scheduled my next facial for October 12 which is in the middle of spa week. All facials will be markdown, so I suggest if you'd like to try it on a trial run, this would be a great time to go. Again, thank you Maria you are the best!"
5,"We had reservations last night-New Years Eve to be specific. Every aspect of our experience was 5 star from the moment we walked in. The service was impeccable. I am a stickler for good service and everyone from our bus boys to our waiter was fantastic. I read the reviews before going to the restaurant and to my delight we had Frederick as our waiter. He received a lot of kudos from viewers and must say, when he introduced himself it made my day. Frederick was on top of everything. Our glasses were always full, finished dishes removed IMMEDIATELY and our dishes came out timely. He never missed a beat. Trust me, the food can be great, but when the service is not up to standards it can ruin the experience.

Now for the food. I started off with the escargot. It's not often I find this on menus nowadays and it being one of my favorite appetizers I was pleased to see it on the menu..The escargot was not prepared in the usual butter-garlic-wince sauce. Instead, they added their own twist and the sauce was delicious. It had enough sauce for me to moyo (dip in bread) which I enjoy. Next, I had the She-Clam soup. It was nothing I'd imagine it to be. In fact, it was even better. Not your typical soup you'd find on a menu. This soup was top of the line. I ordered it for myself and know next time to order this for my boyfriend as well as he kept dipping into my bowl. Not that I mind, but this is the sort of soup you want to enjoy for yourself. I was coveting this like a hawk. Finally, the ribeye steak. It was cooked perfect. I like my steak medium rare and arrived just as ordered. It was tender to the touch and in my mouth it melted like butter. The chef knows what he/she is doing. I topped the steak off with scallops. Talk about sexy. Yes, sexy. Coupled with the steak, the scallops was a nice sidekick.

Overall, I give Waverly Steakhouse a shaka from a Hawaiian gal who loves to eat and enjoys eating. I will definitely go back. I live on the North Side of Vegas and wanted to avoid the strip. Boy, am I glad we found this place. We're going to make it a regular stop.

For those who may not have had the same experience, my only suggestion is to try them again. 

Aloha,
Yvette"
5,I go here pretty regularly since this place opened and it's definitely still my favorite lunch food that I get every time I swing into this area of town. I normally stick with just the teriyaki chicken with rice or teriyaki beef lo mein but only because it is so good I have a hard time turning it down to consider the other options although every time I've branched outside of my comfort zone it's been just as tasty. The food is great for the price but the best part is that it's always consistent. Their egg rolls are the best and at .99 for 3 during lunch time you can't beat that price. I will say I wasn't overly impressed with their sushi but I only tried it once a long time ago because I don't come here when I specifically want sushi.
5,"This is a fabulous steak house. The food and service are excellent! Had a Fillet and it was cooked perfect as were the shrooms. Was a very nice end to my birthday.

I recommend Waverly's if you are north of the strip."
5,Don't drive by this local joint!  Visited for lunch from out of town and had the bacon and blue burger with onion rings. BEST rings I have ever had in my life and that burger....omg that burger. Highly recommend.
5,I am never disappointed when I go to Waverly's. The food is delicious and I love the fact that I don't have to go on the strip to get it! The customer service is A+ and then some. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you looking for a place that has an upscale flare without breaking the bank and without having to travel to far.
5,Came here from LA to get my hair cut and styled for a friend's wedding and couldn't be any happier. Elise did a wonderful job. Thank you!!!!
5,Excellent rare beef Pho. Quick service at a good price. Definitely coming back for another one
5,"Once you've reviewed an outback, you've reviewed them all, so I'll keep this review short. The staff here is great, we always get our food quickly, and they're all nice and friendly.The food is incredible, it always is at Outback. You really should try it out if you haven't already done so."
5,"Loved this place.  Great food, their pasta and pizza is fresh, different and good variety."
5,"I recently had to contact my Home Warranty company regarding my older pool equipment. Megan called me back and had Stephanie get me into their busy schedule in a timely manor. Alex came out to my home & diagnosed the problem & returned with the parts the next day. Everyone was kind, helpful & knowledgeable. My pool has never worked better."
5,"Compared to the one in Arlington Heights, IL  all I can say about this location is WOW.  There's covered parking on the 1st floor.  Then you get to ride the enormous elevator making you feel like you are going on a fantasy shopping trip. 

Love TJ."
5,"This is one of my favorite places to dine.  First, the service is excellent.  Frederick is my waiter of choice and he is personable and exceptional in service.  Darryl is also an excellent waiter here.  The food is excellent especially the filet mignon.  There used to be a piano player (Bob Millard) and how I miss him.  Please bring him back!  He added just the right ambiance to the steakhouse."
5,"My favorite steak house!!  Where do I start?  We have eaten at Waverlys many times so it is time to write a review. First - we have never had a bad meal.  The steaks are done perfectly, the mashed potatoes are the best, and the bread basket offerings are wonderful. Second - the atmosphere is perfect.  It is intimate and cozy with the added bonus of piano background music. Third - people like Todd (manager) and Frederick (server), make you feel important and wanted.  Frederick is attentive to your every need and Todd moves around the restaurant greeting his customers which makes all customers feel so welcomed.  I can't tell you the best attribute of Waverlys because the food, atmosphere and people make this a perfect dining experience.  I love you Waverlys!!"
5,"Absolutely great service, I recommend asking for Frederick if you go to the establishment it is very underrated and understandably so seeing as how it is in a Casino but it is well worth the trip and the food is amazing! I was very impressed by the service and personal and individual feeling I received when I went there overall fantastic!"
5,"Only 5 stars, just because I can't give them 7! I went to Yelp initially looking for lasik surgeons, made a list for myself to go interview them. Made an appt with Wellish fist, met with a superstar by the name of Rebecca, who walked me through the procedure, explained the technology, (which by the way is the most advanced in town) and the prices. I as pretty sold at the moment, but told her as a personal rule, I don't make impulse decisions and would have to go meet with at least one other professional to be able to make a sound comparison. Not going to name any names, but I met with a couple other professionals in town, they didn't even come close to the quality of service, and scale that the wellish vision institute has. 
Being a business owner I can appreciate how someone organizes and runs his operation, and my god is this a well oiled machine! Never waited more than 15 minutes, not once was greeted by someone that didn't have a smile on their face. 
It was several days after the procedure that I remembered that I was anxious on surgery day. Procedure lasted not longer than 10 minutes in my opinion, (haven't asked) but I remember asking Dr Wellish, that's it, are you really done? 
Right now I have 20/15 vision, which is better than normal! 
I don't know what else can I say, one of the best investments I have ever made. Oh wait there's more. Went to my regular optometrist for a checkup and he says, you went to the best surgeon in town, good job. In hindsight I probably should have asked him for a referral and not went to Yelp, but I guess I probably would have ended up here anyways. 
So Thank you, E Flamingo Wellish team!
And the Oscar goes to:
Tehani- The Front Desk charm - Superstar
Gabby- Superstar
Dr. McCandless - Superstar
Dr Wellish- Mega Superstar
Please message me if you have questions."
5,"If you are like me and many others, you've probably thought about Lasik surgery for years. Personally I'm the type that does an insane amount of research, especially if I'm  going to have an operation on my eyes. I consulted with my optometrist and friends who had the Lasik procedure done and they all pointed me towards Dr. Wellish. Of course I did more research and decided to schedule a free consultation. So here is a quick rundown of my Lasik journey.

From the moment I stepped in the office the staff was very courteous and professional. I met with Rebecca, a counselor, who informed me about the entire process and answered all my questions and concerns.  Convinced, I then scheduled my PreOp where I did some more testing to see if I was a good candidate for Lasik which ended with a visit from Dr. Wellish and Dr. McCandless. The following week I had the surgery where Dr. Wellish guided me through the whole process. The operation was relatively quick and painless. The next two days I had a follow-up and my vision was already 20/20.

A month later I'm still seeing 20/20 or better and couldn't be any happier. Being able to wake up without reaching for my glasses is one of the few joys in life that I will always cherish!"
5,"Cheap and fast.  This place is brand new.  It's very clean and the workers are super friendly.  Great for times when you don't feel like cooking and just want a quick meal.  $2.99 california roll grand opening special.  You can't beat that.  

I highly recommend the spicy salmon roll.  The spicy mayo sauce is quite tasty.

I didn't care too much for the chicken teriyaki though.  Very large portion but the sauce was bit too sweet for my taste buds.  I would probably ask them to go light on the sauce next time."
5,"We've been going to Waverly's for many, many years and have never had a bad meal. There are tons of steakhouses in Vegas but this place is my favorite. My steak is always cooked perfectly. Our favorite server is Frederick, we love him."
5,"I ate here a couple of times before my diet was restricted for medical reasons, and I thought the food and service both were exceptional. I'm looking forward to having the doctors let me go back in a month or so. In the meantime my son knows their Mentor location well. John A. thought the windows were a bit odd for this kind of place, but it used to be an Eat 'N' Park. Changing the windows would have been a major remodeling expense. The place seemed very kid friendly when I was there both noon and evening."
5,"I can't say how much I love this small sushi and Asian restaurant. They have the best spider roll in town. They also have a great lunch specials which includes a $3.30 chicken teriyaki with steamed cabbage and broccoli which is really, really good. I would highly recommend this place for a quick lunch or a low key
 dinner. I never have to wait they're always fast & friendly. If you call a pick up order in it's ready in 10 minutes"
5,"Amazing service(Erin, Anthony, Krista, Brenda, Jessica, Renée), delicious food, great management (Nacho, Jennifer, and Mike)."
5,Dennys has always been a good breakfast spot for me and the service has always been good..its always busy but it moves fast
5,Our exercise group loves to go to this restaurant. They always make us feel welcome and give us excellent service.  When we do our special monthly birthday celebrations we go to Outback. Good food!  Good service!   Good people!
5,I got the Special Bento box it was very delicious. The staff was very friendly. I was served right away didn't have to wait very long for food to come out. Very peaceful inside as well. Would recommend going again!
5,"The pork bone soup here is always my go to order. You really can't beat the quality, quantity and satisfaction levels you get. As a kicker it's only $9, much less than competitors around the area that aren't as delicious and give you less. 

I also really enjoy their pan fried fish (don't remember what it's called). Just a headsup, it's the entire fish (not a fillet). 

The kbbq is also really good, it's quite authentic, you will definitely end up smelling like korean bbq after a sit in meal. If you're going during mealtimes on friday or weekend, expect to wait for a seat, but with takeout, they're super fast. Sitting in can get quite busy."
5,"We've been here a couple times and tried the pho, banh mi, and banh xeo. All were super good. They have their own particular style of banh xeo that is different than I've had, but extremely good. They have an optional spicy fish sauce with it that totally makes it. Pho and banh mi are what you would hope for and are good with good portions that fill you without giving you broth belly. Staff is super friendly and helpful. I recommend giving it a try."
5,I ate here twice with a group and loved the salad as you choose what you want on it and it it's cut the way you want so you don't end up with lettuce hanging out of your mouth and I added salmon of course. The atmosphere was casual too me like a noisy dorm group room with all the tv's going. Little pricy for every day but worth the money. It is one place for me to consider for Super Bowl Sunday.
5,"Tyler was a true professional and was outstanding.  He was professional, communicated in a great manner, was timely and not only did outstanding work, but provided great counsel.  We look forward to working with Aaron Pool services again."
5,"Wonderful store.  Very friendly personnel!  Actually though, I haven't visited a Trader Joe that wasn't great!"
5,"I had to come to a work site near here and I was driving through the shopping center looking for a place to eat and came here. 

I love eating Vietnamese food and have Vietnamese friends back home who cooked for me growing up, so moving here and not having as much was pretty sad. I try out every place I come across in Phoenix.

This place is legit. People are nice, service is prompt, and the food is great. First visit I got pho, and it was great. Broth was excellent, just everything you want pho to be. Next time I got a vermicelli noodle bowl and it was super good too.

I plan on stopping by here every time I'm nearby for work."
5,"I always find something new and delicious to try while wandering TJ's aisles. Wonderfully curated food selection, great staff, and a nice location in the heart of Monroe street."
5,"I have ate at allot of NY Greek diners and I can honestly say this is the best Greek food I have ever tasted! I ordered the Greek salad and added London broil, minus the croutons, pita, and carrots as I'm limiting my carbs. My boyfriend had the Gyro and she crab soup. I tried his food too and the flavoring was totally hitting it on every taste. The marinade on the London broil was outstanding, my salad dressing rocked, the Tzatziki sauce is absolutely the best I have ever tasted, it was so fresh and cucumbery, the feta was like goat cheese, real Greek olives, and even my peppercinni was uniquely the best, some kind of spice was on it, cucumbers nice chunks with no after burp. The cook even came out to ask if everything was to my liking as I had ordered off menu. The she crab soup, a delicious creamy dream, with a perfectly balanced delicate undertone of Cajun heat! I stumbled on this place by chance and will definitely make the drive into Charlotte deliberately for the French Quarter, as long as there's not a game, lol. My water was never empty, and the service was stellar!!"
5,"Best decision ever!!!!! I recently had Lasik in December and I now see 20/15!!! Dr. Wellish and his staff are amazing! The Lasik counselor Taylor is very knowledgeable, she explained everything in detail at my free consultation and answered all my questions. I was so excited to proceed and could not wait for the day of surgery to come! Did my pre-op with Dr. McCandless and his tech Gaby which are so nice and also explained everything in detail. Finally the day of surgery came and I was so nervous but they give you something to help with that! The surgery was not what I expected, I went in afraid and found out there is nothing to be afraid of!  I should have done this years ago!! Dr. Wellish and staff were so awesome they made sure all my questions were answered and that I was comfortable and completely relaxed before we started. When surgery started everything being done was explained step by step and they even have some music playing in the background which I thought was cool to help you relax some more. This was an amazing experience and I would recommend anyone to go to Dr. Wellish!!"
5,"Good food and good service! The owners were very nice. It is owned by a couple who were from Hawaii, very nice people. The cook everything fresh as you order. The portions are huge! Definitely one of my favorite Hawaiian places!"
5,"The vision you will live with for years is the most important thing to consider when choosing an eye surgeon.  Price, distance and wait times are irrelevant.  Kent Wellish is one of those rare patient-centric docs that puts your final surgical result before his income.
 
Dr W did my lasik 15 yrs ago; I endured contacts and coke-bottle glasses for forty years prior to surgery.  My final surgical result was excellent when settled and I did not need glasses for any activity.  The procedure was quick and relatively painless.  I started as a minus 8 (20/800).  

Fast forward 15 years: my vision now tests at 20/40 because it's time for cataract surgery.  (It was stable at around 20/25-30 for 14 years and Dr W had offered to re-do at no charge if I wanted that 20/15-20 result). Solid long-term stability of my lasik. 20/25-30 compared to 20/800 is a miracle. Great post-surgical result. Nothing but good things to say about this surgery or Dr W.

Dr W is a guy that sees things through to the end.  I live in California and decided to have him do my lasik in Nevada for more than it costs here.  That should tell you something about his quality and well-deserved reputation.   He took care of my post surgical issues without complaining or adding costs.  15 years after surgery his office forwarded my surgical records to my local cataract surgeon at no extra charge. 

Excellent at all times on all issues. Stop reading reviews and go hire him!"
5,"All in all, this place rocks! They have consistently delicious sandwiches, and the portions are HUGE! :]"
5,"Elise is hands down the best stylist I've ever had.  She's so creative with my color and gets it perfect every time.  Same with her haircuts, she really listens to what kind of style I want every time I come in and always makes it look beautiful.  I recommend her to all of my friends. She is also a pro at doing Keratin treatments if you're looking to get one done, and her hair braiding skills are incredible."
5,"I just had LASIK 4 days ago by Dr. Wellish and his team. The entire experience couldn't have gone any better. Everyone on the team was super friendly and knowledgable in their department. I had many opportunities to ask any questions or bring up any concerns I had. They made me feel well taken care of before, during and after the procedure. I never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to be called in from the waiting area. My vision was already 20/20 the night I had my surgery without any pain or complications. 

After surgery I ate a quick lunch while keeping my eyes closed most of the time (they were a little sensative to light and teared when I opened them). Afterwards, I went home and slept for 4 hours and woke up feeling very normal except that I could finally see with my new vision! I was so excited that I walked around outside to look at everything. 

I am still taking my drops as directed and finished two of my follow up appointments with perfect vision and great healing. 

I would reccommend Dr. Wellish and his team to anyone looking to have LASIK."
5,"SURF RIDER AND KAUAI CHICKEN is a must try!!! Now I know what's with all the ""hype""!!! This place is sooo delicious! and the best part is, the service was sooo great! :D Our server, forgot his name, entertained us and told us some pretty cool stories about the island :D which was pretty cool and was very attentive."
5,"Amazing food, we got the tofu pho and it's amazing.  service and priced correctly. I will for sure return."
5,"We have been here three times in the last five months.  My husband loves the ahi tuna appetizer, and I love the shrimp on the barbie.  Our steak and lamb were delicious.  The hostess, manager, and wait staff were efficient and friendly.  We will be back!"
5,"Great for breakfast, accurate every time. 
The service is amazing. We get it to go and it's still good when I get it home. 
Great idea for anyone caring for someone or caregivers. It's a inexpensive switch up and when you order it correctly, it can be healthy! If you dine in ask for Blue, you will be well taken care of!"
5,"I've never really had to wait for a table at this location. I personally come for the baked goat cheese salad... Sometimes I only come for two orders of it. The pasta and pizza are great. But really, if you've never tried the baked goat cheese salad, I urge you to try it at least once. If you don't like it, send it my way :)"
5,Very accommodating i ask for pesto for my bread and the server said he will check with the chef server again ask me if i wanted it hot or cold i told him i wanted it hot...well warm.... couple of minutes later the server came back with my pesto and about a minute the chef came out and check if it was to my liking... GOOD JOB Chef and the whole crew keep up the good work!! I dont know their names but the time is 8:30pm 11/5/17 you know who you are!!
5,"Great, well priced food and service.  Tasty, well prepared, served right. You have got to try this."
5,"Being an eye doctor myself, you can imagine the diligent research I did before deciding which surgeon I would trust with my own eyes. Dr. Kent Wellish is without a doubt, the most reputable and experienced refractive surgeon here in Las Vegas. Since he is an educator of eye care professionals from all over the country, you can imagine the level of competency Dr. Wellish possesses. His attention to the intricate details of the procedure far exceeds any other surgeon I have dealt with in my career as an optometrist. He is constantly learning the newest techniques and procedures in refractive surgery to better customize the procedures he performs for each of his individual patients. Unlike many other refractive surgeons who might rush eligible candidates into the procedure, Dr. Wellish wanted to ensure that my eyes were in optimal condition in order to yield the most successful post operative outcome. Weeks prior to the procedure, he required that I stay out of my contacts, used artificial tears aggressively each day, and even added a unique Bio Tears oral supplement to my regime to ensure that the health of my corneas was optimal for surgery. 

I must also commend Dr. Wellish for the excellent quality care I was given by every single member of his staff. As an eye care provider, I understand the importance of having a strong and efficient staff to best represent my practice. The quality of care that I received throughout my entire experience at Wellish Eye Institute was impeccable. I am beyond elated with my healthy new eyes and 20/15 (better than 20/20) vision. Thank you Dr. Wellish and everyone at Wellish Vision Institute for making my LASIK experience a very seamless and enjoyable one!"
5,Love this place. Food is so good. Drinks are good. To me it's the only good place to eat in the Streetsboro area.
5,"My family and I have been in a few times over the last year and I am always impressed. One evening my two young boys were making a mess and I couldn't eat a bite of food without stopping to clean something up. The young woman who was serving us put her hand on mine as I picked something up and said, ""Don't worry about it. Tonight's your night to not cook or clean. I got it."" That young woman made my day! The food is delicious and always reasonably priced. Love it!"
5,"literally my go-to for traditional, cheap korean eats. my usual is the soondae and the pork bone soup is to die for. i take all my friends here for late night snacks and honestly i haven't met anyone yet that hasn't liked the food here, its just that good !! also, its one of the very few restaurants in Toronto that carries bibimnaengmyun all year round, which is awesome because its delicious no matter the weather and the sauce here is the best (i recommend ordering extra sauce on the side). overall, yes definitely try this place."
5,"This Place is Awesome for its Location, Excellent Food, Great Staff - Our Server Nils was Outstanding, Once you're Inside you'll forget there's a Casino Outside lol - Warm Plates for you to share, Smart Thing to do so your food can stay Hot. Love it.
Very Impressive Place."
5,"Started out at the bar with a martini.  Atmosphere was inviting.  However they need to lose the portraits of fruits & vegetables on the wall.  Piano player was very talented.  Our server, Nils, was a PRO at their menu.  All his suggestions were well advised. He new the menu & product well. Started with the chopped salad and added house vinaigrette which was very fresh and flavorful.  Had the Portobello Frittes with pesto aioli sauce appetizer - all was fantastic!!!  Service was outstanding - manager came by to ask about our meal.  All staff was attentive. 
Had the shrimp & crab type of spicy gumbo over Jasmine Rice and the Macadamia Nut Crusted chicken.  We'd recommend both!!!  We'll be back in."
5,Amazing food! I only wish I was closer :( ... you do have to get their attention a lot to keep your food coming but that is no big deal. They are busy. I get it. It's fun cooking your meat and the prices are not bad at all.
5,Much Aloha To The Owners Originally From The Island Of Kauai. For Bringing The Authenticity Of Hawaiian Food To Us Las Vegans!! Love Love Love This Place...
5,"We recently held a fund raising dinner at my daughter's high school using Dickey's as the caterer.  The theme was Mardi Gras Murder Mystery.  Mitch from Dickey's couldn't have been more supportive and helpful, especially when it was discovered we did not have the proper sized chafing dishes, which he helpfully loaned us.  The food?  Absolutely finger licking good.  The BBQ sauce is perfection, the Mac and Cheese divine.  Both the brisket and the pulled pork were huge hits.  Thank you Mitch and the staff at Dickey's for helping make our evening so successful!"
5,"We stopped here with our little guy after school after wasting money at Starbucks next door. We should have came  here first. Great quality and service! 
We will be back here again for sure!!"
5,"I love this place and the place next to it. A lot of my friends complain about bad service, but I have never had a single bad experience (AND I've been here a lot). I prefer this location to the one on Queen Street simply because it's cleaner and more upscale in appearance. 

Details:

Ambience: Dimly lit, clean stainless steel everywhere, nice, cozy, warm - there's nothing you won't like about the ambience. Although it is located very close to Zanzibar and the sex shops... 

Crowd: Mixed crowd. A lot of Ryerson students and business professionals during lunch. Throngs of friends during dinner. I've also seen dates. Infact, I love going here with my boyfriend. 

Variety: I don't really care about variety at KGH because I go for the beef, pork and chicken and all three come yummily marinated. And the rice. And their diluted version soy sauce for the rice. There are other options - squid, fish, salmon, ox tongue, etc.

Verdict? It's $9.99 for AYCE lunch. You get to cook it and have fun. And it's a meat lover's paradise. This is a STEAL. Take my word for it."
5,"LOVE this place. It is one of our staples for sure - we spend far too much time here! 
All of their services are outstanding. It is clean, luxurious, kind and caring staff, and always an overall wonderful experience."
5,"Great place to take a group. Extremely accommodating. Good food, reasonable prices, cold beer and outstanding service, especially Amanda. It's my go to place when I'm in CLT for business. Thanks all."
5,Aaron Pools was assigned through our warranty company (AHS) to take care of pool motor/pump and overall I am very satisfied with the service they provided. They were prompt in scheduling my appointment and the service tech (Michael) showed up on time. Michael was pretty quick in diagnosing the problem which unfortunately was a melted piece stuck in the motor that was causing the motor not to work. He replaced the motor and the pump was back up and running in less than 30 mins. Overall it was a pretty nice experience unlike some of the horror reviews that I have read. I give both AHS and Aaron pools a 5 star rating.
5,"Not a fan of low-carb, no-carb, smart-carb, whatever-carb? Me either!

My favorites are the honey wheat, blueberry lemon coffee cake, and pumpkin spice with or without chocolate chips... 1 loaf is ~$7. Seems like a lot for 1 loaf, but it is so good!!! The supermarket variety does not cut it!!! 

The sandwiches are good too ($6.55). You build your own sandwich by using a checklist thing. It probably won't seem too spectacular at first, but trust... it aint Subway!"
5,"Love this place - hit it today, quick in and out for lunch and the food is always great! Still my favorite spot in CLT!"
5,"I was craving Asian food and my girlfriend suggested Korean BBQ and brought me here. We came in time for the Owl Special for $11.99 AYCE (All You Can Eat). We were seated right upon walking in with no waiting time and within seconds side dishes were being placed around us. While that went on our waiter turned on the grill and the proteins started to appear faster than we could throw them on to get them cooking. The taste was awesome. 

We stuck with Chicken and Beef. We weren't too crazy on the Pork or Squid. They weren't bad but the clear winners were the Chicken and Beef. The problem with the fish is that it stuck on to the grill and would break apart upon attempting to flip it over.

Side Dishes:
- Kimchi, Spicy Bean Sprouts, Pickled Radish and Tofu 

Protein Sources:
- Chicken, Beef, White Fish, Pork and Squid 

Service is FAST and they come around often to clean and/or replace the grill. They never rushed us and my girlfriend and I were there for nearly 2 hours! We ate, rested a bit and ate again until we were too stuffed to function properly.  I will definitely be coming back. The experience and the food was exceptional."
5,"Stopped in here to find a gem of a restaurant with great food, large portions and fast friendly service. Good wings, great sliders and delicious appetizers. Enjoyed ourselves!"
5,"Why does this Outback get 5 stars? Simply, because after over 15 visits, the food has been consistently good, while overall restaurant service performance has improved time and again. Of course, you sometimes catch them on an off-night, but on those rare instances for us, the manager personally came out to make things right. 

My favorite entrees include:

-8oz Outback Special (sirloin) cooked medium rare. I love their loaded sweet potato, so I order that along with a side salad with honey mustard dressing. 

-12oz Pork Porterhouse - always juicy without any of that ""I'm eating pork"" flavor. I really like this one, and often order it when I'm not feeling red meat. 

Honorable mentions include the steak medallions, which are coated with a sweet glaze, and served with skewered grilled veggies. My mother-in-law favors the salmon and will choose between that or the Outback Special. 

The Bloomin' Onion is their appetizer staple, and rightfully so. It's a battered and deep fried onion able to satisfy 3-4 people. The (not so) spicy signature sauce is really good with it too. 

We've never utilized it, but you can take advantage of their online ordering and curbside pickup. It looks really simple to do and we often see people using the convenient curbside parking spots. 

At the end of the day, Outback is your affordable steakhouse. You can order steak, chicken, and seafood, all for prices that aren't going to break the bank. It's a nice atmosphere with friendly staff and prompt service. So, if you're in the mood for all of the above, then 'let's put another shrimp on the barbie'!"
5,"I have to say after all of the negative reviews I read on here, I was scared for Aaron pools to be the servicing company for my home warranty claim. I had a leaking pool pump, and they were awesome. They came right out and said it would be covered under my home warranty. I asked them about upgrading to a variable speed pump. And they were very accommodating. They took the price of the repair off of the new pump installation price. Very professional and a great company to deal with."
5,one of my my favorite grocery stores! convenient parking especially considering the location. lots of great items you can't find anywhere else and all for great prices! always friendly staff as well.
5,Dr. Wellish did my LASIK about a year ago and I have never been any happier with my vision since. Even though I had very high astigmatism I do not require readers or glasses at night. Dr. Wellish is such a great surgeon and makes you feel comfortable through the whole process. The staff is awesome and make you feel right at home. If you need LASIK Wellish Vision Institute is the place to go .
5,"If you want a very relaxing massage, Red Door is the place to go!  From the time you walk in, the soothing music and the care you get from everyone let's you escape the daily grind.  Highly recommend!"
5,Some great Hawaiian food and friendly staff!
5,"Pleasantly surprised with Waverly's.  The service was impeccable and the food delicious!   A nice variety in the bread basket, and the rib eye melted in your mouth.  Will definitely return."
5,"Ive been a client at this salon for over 10 years. I used to see David but he opened his own business, too far of a commute. I prefer male hair dressers, so the front recommended Rudy. Thankfully I found another male hair dresser to suit my needs. Request Rudy if you want your experience to be...
#friendly #professional #experienced"
5,So good!  I love the generous samples; I've ended up getting things I wouldn't have normally chosen like the cherry white chocolate bread.  I Love the Dakota round loaf-dense & soft with little seeds...yum....love the spinach feta (try it!) It didn't sound good to me but I tried a sample and it is good!  The staff has always been nice too.  The only thing I think is kinda weird...they are a bakery that's closed on Sunday's!   They run out of stuff too...once it's gone...it's gone!
5,"I absolutely love Trader Joe's. We just moved here from out of state and one of the first things I did was visit TJs. This particular location is interesting because it has underground parking (due to its location, I'm sure). The parking is a little tight, but it will be really handy in the winter when there's snow everywhere. I'm hoping for an east side location, and the cashier said it might be a little while before that happens, but if sales are good, there's more of a chance. So please, shop at TJs so I can get an east side one! 

If you're not familiar with Trader Joe's, they sell mostly their own products. Nothing has artificial ingredients, and they stock a lot of organics. However, it's reasonably priced because of the way they buy (which also means they may not stock your favorite thing the next time you go in there). Before I had shopped at a TJs, I thought it would be way overpriced like W.F. Really, it's not. So, you simply can't expect to go into one and find every thing on your list. It just doesn't work that way. If I am working from a recipe, I might find 70% of the products there. But I usually check there first and you get to know what they have and don't have as far as habitual purchases go.

East side! East side! East side!"
5,I've been wearing glasses since I was 9 years old.  I am 36 now and with my wife's convincing finally decided to get Lasik surgery.  I figured life is too short to not be about to wake up in the morning and not have put on contacts or reach for my glasses.  I chose Wellish because my wife and her family has gone to Wellish for their lasik.  And I am happy I did.  I now see 20/15!!! It's amazing! I feel like I am seeing in HD!! The whole process was awesome and Dr. Wellish and his staff were so helpful in making me feel as comfortable as possible!! I highly recommend Wellish if you are considering Lasik eye surgery!
5,"I just had my hair done by Maria Sais de Sicilia and it's amazing! Above and beyond being a lovely person to talk with, she did an amazing job. This is easily the best my hair has looked in years. She did partial highlight, lowlight, cut and style. I have fine thin hair that is hard to make look anything but limp usually....currently I have it at bombshell status. Additionally the price was very reasonable for this area. And fear of cost has kept me from this salon before. However, it was very appropriate for the service and it cost less than 200 even with a 20% tip. Lovely salon. Fabulous Maria. I will be returning to her soon."
5,"Trader Joe's hits the sweet spot between affordability and quality. I have to confess, I shop here mostly for the frozen and longer-term refridgerated items, but I'm always happy. I can fill my whole freezer with reasonably healthy, well portioned meals that last almost a month for less than $100. Wine selection is great too."
5,"OMG!!!! The Monte Cristo is out of this world!!!! The ingredients do not sound like they fit together but the flavor explodes in your mouth!! If you have a chance to visit, do it!!!"
5,"Writing on my experience for the Laser Eye Surgery portion of the medical office. 
Found them through other Yelp reviewers - thanks guys! Then set up an interest request through their website. The same day that was submitted, I get a call from a representative to talk a bit and schedule a consultation appointment. Pretty efficient. 
I think I was the first appointment of the day, which was like 8AM. The automated e-mail that reminded me of the appointment asked me to be 15 minutes early for paperwork, but they still hadn't opened. I got to wait on the regular optometry side though, and the ladies there were just as nice. I think I ended up going in about 8:15AM to get a consultation done with Taylor. 
Once in, she took a few scans/images of my eyes. Chatted the whole time to make me feel comfortable. 
LMAO. My eye sight is pretty bad, and when Taylor broke the news to me about not being able to go through with LASIK, I was not surprised. She was totally tactful and informative about my other options though, which was PRK (another form of laser eye surgery) or ICL (contact implants), and the different packages available. She was also honest about the pricing and what financing options were available, which is pretty much Care Credit with their promotions. She walked me through the process as well... When to start taking Fish Oil/Omega-3s, what to get in preparation for the eye surgery, length of recovery for the PRK, etc. Taylor also had her business card inserted just in case I needed to contact her for other concerns/questions. 
By the end of the consultation, we figured out when Pre-Op was and what to plan for in regards to that portion (ex. 2-3 hour process and having someone be able to drive me to and from). As far as finances go, I think I spent $150 as a kinda deposit for the procedure. 
Will write follow-ups after Pre-Op and once the procedure gets done some time in July. Hahaha... I have to get both eyes fixed after the second session of summer school and still be respectful to work availability."
5,"All I can say is I got my wife a massage package for Christmas last year and she hasn't stopped talking about it. She was glowing for weeks. The staff was awesome about helping me pick out a package in my price range without trying to upsell me. I would highly recommend giving a package as a gift, my wife LOVED it."
5,"This update is waayyy overdue...
It's about 3 months since I had laser eye surgery here. Friendly reminder that it was not LASIK, but the alternative PRK 'cause of really bad eyesight and astigmatism. My last vision assessment was 25-30, but my eye sight is still improving, and I'm still waiting on my updated driver's license. LOL. 
The day of the procedure that was in July, we arrived about 15 minutes prior. It was a good thing too 'cause I missed out on some paperwork. So... Don't forget to double-check your packets/folders and fill that stuff out! Taylor had me complete everything before going down though X_x Once me and about 3 other patients went down to the 1st floor where we had our procedures, Taylor gave us post-op information before Louis prepped us one by one. Got to also meet Dr. Wellish before he proceeded with the surgery. Nice guy by the way - he talks to you during the procedure. 
The procedure itself only took about 15 minutes, so I was only there for about 1 hour max with all the paperwork, prep, surgery, post-op conversation, and waiting for the fiance to pick me up. Recovery for me, personally, took about 3 weeks to really recover. It wasn't a painful recovery. Just really uncomfortable, which is a nice way of me telling everyone that it was irritating. LOL. Had to wear goggles to bed for about 1 week straight, my eyes were totally sensitive to everything that lit up, had to time all my 3 eye drops out on a regular basis. I'm currently down to 2 eye drops though, which consists of 1 prescription and 1 store-bought. Anyway...
For every follow-up appointment that I've gone to, everyone is always courteous and extremely friendly. Tehani (sp.) was still working the front desk, but even talking to her trainee/replacement was cool. Dr. McCandless (sp.) is always nice. As for wait time, I'm going to admit that it can take a while sometimes, but I've got no gripe 'cause of how nice and informative the staff is. Okay, so let's talk money...
PRK (alternative laser eye surgery) cost me about $4300, and I got to finance it through Care Credit. At the time, the establishment also had this promotion: 0% interest if you pay it off within 24 months, but would start charging contracted interest if you miss or late with one payment. I'd also like to point out that without insurance, the eye drops add up to the expense. With my insurance for one prescription adds up to around $64 for every bottle I refill, and I usually spend $18 for the store-bought lubricating eye drops (2 in 1 pack). There's also Vitamin C and Omega 3-Fish Oil (or other dry eye vitamin) you have to take on regular basis. The doctors give you a list of options, and you and your pharmacy/pharmacists can make the final decisions."
5,Chef Ben is a great little place to enjoy some awesome sushi and food at a very reasonable price. A good amount of rolls average $3.50 and are very well prepared. This place was so good we went back the next day.
5,"The Pho is lights out. I've never been disappointed. Best Pho I've had in Phoenix so far.

I have a decent appetite and typically pay $2 to get extra noodles. Price is still more than fair."
5,"Amazing food, great ambiance and reasonable price. This place is great for family or for a date night.
The thin crust pizza is amazing and the assisi was delicious! Nice waiters too!"
5,"Unlike most of the contractors that AHS Warranty sends. Aaron Pools did a nice job. Now I know who to ask to service my pool when AHS assigns a technician. If AHS assigns Sunbright, do yourself a favor and tell them to change it to Aaron Pools instead. Sunbright is awful."
5,2nd time here.  Certainly not healthy eating but OH SO GOOD.  Had the Italian steak sandwich which was awesome.  Bread to guts was perfect ratio.  Side salad was a good size dinner salad.  Service by Brittany was top notch.
5,"I had an issue with my pump motor not starting after a rain storm several weeks ago. Home warranty assigned the ticket to Aaron Pools.  I was contacted  immediately, described the issue, they scheduled a time that worked for me, confirmed the day before, and Mike showed up on time, and quickly replaced the bad capacitor.  He took the time to go above and beyond to answer questions about the pool, and repaired a couple of things that I pointed out that weren't in the original ticket, in a couple of minutes....
Fast forward two weeks - pump stopped working entirely, called home warranty back, who got ahold of Aaron Pools, who again, contacted me immediately, and scheduled a time that was convenient for me.  The technician (Mikey) called ahead of time, diagnosed the issue, and returned later that day and replaced the pump motor.  He followed up the next day with a part that he needed to complete the job, and everything is working great.  
I don't understand some of the other reviews - perhaps they should review their customers?  Everyone I've dealt with has been extremely pleasant and professional, helpful and knowledgeable.  I'd recommend Aaron Pools to anyone!  Thanks guys!"
5,"Went in for my yearly visit with Dr. Ortiz. Appointment went smoothly, he made feel at ease. Recommended for all who need professional eye care. Love and will be back."
5,"I haven't been to EARDS in probably about 10 years since a need to correct a terrible pixie cut. Time passed and grew my hair long (1st time) and mostly just trimmed. I've made bold choices in the past (some mistakes) and owned them.

This time I wanted to keep the long locks but make a big change. 2 appointments 2 weeks apart. Tons of beautiful layers, some bangs, and some subtle color to lighten and brighten my day! Thank you Matthew!"
5,"This place is one of the few options you have in the neighborhood?, but luckily it would be great even on the busy restaurant street. The staff is always friendly, the food is very good and the bar has so many drink options?s you can get anything you need. They? have? ?a place for private events, tvs and game area and the sapece is open and airy. On top of all,? they have an outside seating area which is cute and so many specials during the week, you'll never get bored :)"
5,"The is hands down the best Italian food that I have had. Let's break it down shall we: 

Service : 4 out of 5. Since the place is always packed they only have a limited number of servers juggling the orders. So get ready to wait a little before they come take your order. 

Food: 5 out of 5. This is our go to place for calamari. The portion size is enormous. The squid and octopus are perfectly battered (not too much) and not overly salty. The sea food is fresh and never rubbery. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce had flavour in every bite. 

Price: 5 out of 5 for the quality and the appropriate portion size so you get what you pay for. 

We always come back to this place to enjoy authentic Italian food and are never disappointed."
5,"My expectations weren't very high when I tried this place what with it being in The Cannery (a casino way off the strip), but to say I was surprised is a huge understatement!  The decor and presentation were on par with Flemmings Steakhouse without the cost being so insane that it's all you can think about while you're eating.  The waiter and manager were both very attentive without being intrusive but the main thing was the ribeye and cheddar bacon potatoes were awesome! I had a piece of the Mississippi Mud Pie for desert which was also worth a repeat. If I had to find any fault I'd say the coffee could have been a touch stronger.   I'll definitely make sure to stop in again the next time I'm in town."
5,"i love that this place is 24h!!!! i always get their porkbone soup, whch is allllllllways on point! soft potatoe, very tender, fall off the bone pork bones, and a rich flavourful broth! cant ever go wrong w.some pbs on a cold day or to cure a hangover!"
5,"Called them Friday for an appointment, they could send someone out on Monday. The guy showed up on time, looked professional and said it was a small part. Went back and got the part, came back and fixed the pool. I had been trying to fix the pool by myself for about 10 days, with no luck. I was really impressed that its an older pool and he didn't try to upsell me, or make it a bigger deal that it was. I trust this company as I was referred to them by a friend who also uses them. I am not a big review writer, but I was impressed by the service and the honesty in fixing my pool for under $100! 
Thank you Aaron pools!"
5,"I did a lot of research before selecting a place for my LASIK. I ended up choosing Wellish Vision Institute not only because of a recommendation from my optometrist, but also because everything I could find on the Internet indicated that this place was the best in Vegas. Price wasn't a concern; I wanted top quality. I feel like I got it. The consultation process was great and there was no crazy sales push. Pre- and post-op visits have been timely and thorough, and I definitely feel taken care of. The surgery experience itself was pretty crazy to think about, but Dr. Wellish talked me through the whole thing and kept me from being too nervous. A few days after surgery I could officially see 20/20 and a week later I can tell that everything is healing bit by bit every day. Based on my experience so far, I will highly recommend Wellish Vision Institute to anyone looking to have laser eye surgery."
5,"My optometrist recommended Dr. Wellish and his team. There's a reason why I'd been going to my optometrist for 12 years.

I just recently got my LASIK surgery done on both eyes and am extremely happy. Dr Wellish and his staff were courteous. Beginning from my first consultation appointment, I was given all the information I needed and was made aware of what was to follow. I have already recommended Dr. Wellish to my friends thinking about LASIK, as with his experience and the detail to making sure your questions are answered all through the process is amazing.

THANK YOU REBECCA, TAHANI, DR. WELLISH AND McCANDLESS!"
5,"The Wellish Vision Institute has far exceeded my expectations. 

My first experience with them was with my LASIK Consult; several optometrists in Las Vegas referred me to Dr. Wellish. It has taken me six years to finally get LASIK because I wanted to make sure that I found a surgeon that would not take any risks with my vision.  I also researched the technology to make sure it is safe. The Wellish Vision Institute has the latest technology to give me the safest surgery possible and the clearest vision I could have.

During my pre-operation procedure that staff was very friendly and professional. They were very approachable and were more than glad to answer all my questions.  They took their time to explaining the procedure and made me feel comfortable. 

On the day of my surgery, I was very nervous but I knew I was in good hands because Dr. Wellish performed the surgery.   The surgery was fast, painless and best of all-I immediately saw an improvement in my vision. 

The day after surgery the doctor checked my vision and I was already at 20/15!  I see even better than I ever did with glasses or contact lenses! The vision gets better as my eyes heal and I was back to work right away and enjoying the benefits of having great vision.

I strongly recommend the Wellish Vision Institute."
5,"Love this place! It's my go to for Vietnamese food. The price isn't bad in my mind we order the grill pork bahn mi sandwich, the egg rolls, and chicken pho all the time and it's affordable.

Also now that my husband and I have gone low carb we can still have Pho they just replace the noodles with cabbage. Which I was hesitant to try but it's incredible. The chicken broth is what really makes any Pho and this one is exceptional the flavor is so good."
5,"In the Yonge/Finch area, there is an amassment of Korean restaurants and a good chunk of them probably serve Korean BBQ. 

Huh Ga Ne is one of two that I recommend going to - the other one is In Ga Ne, funny enough (from what I hear, Huh Ga Ne and In Ga Ne owners used to work together, and then split off to do their own thing).

There is bonchon-a-plenty here: seaweed salad, two types of Kimchi, dried fish and peanuts to name a few.

We ordered the Ju Mul Luck - thinly sliced Sirloin beef in their special sauce. Very tender meat, wrapped in a lettuce leaf with garlic and onion. The quality of meat is a lot better than many KBBQ places. None of the pieces were unpleasantly chewy.

An order of meat to grill comes with a choice of two soups: Seafood Soon Tofu or Fermented Bean Soup. We got the soon tofu, packed with large pieces of tofu and seafood. It was a nice change of pace from the mounds of meat we ate.

For what you get (it was around $40, before tax), you definitely get what you pay for."
5,"Pho broth was delicious. You can taste the love that went into making the broth. Spring rolls were also very tasty. Will definitely return, possibly tomorrow!"
5,"I'm so excited to have found such yummy pho. The broth was perfect. The noodles were just right (not hard or mushy) my husband had rare beef and tea. I had the seafood pho and jasmine tea. It had lots of seafood and the little seafood meatballs were extra good. The side veggies and herbs were fresh. There was also a good variety of sauces and oils at the table. When I asked for iced tea, I was offered regular, green, or jasmine.
Our server was fast and very nice. She took time to get to know us a little. I noticed that she knew what the regulars next to us were likely to order.
It's a cute little place. I'd absolutely go again."
5,"Super small and quiet, decent service but the food is DELICIOUS. My husband and I really enjoy the sushi! They have some very unique rolls and damn good prices!"
5,"This year for Valentine's Day my fiancé booked me a 50 minute massage at The Red Door. It was the first massage I've gotten in like five years, and it was amazing! I wish I could remember my massage therapist's name (I'm terrible), because she was wonderful! 

When I checked in for my massage, I was immediately taken back to the changing room, where I was able to change it to a really comfy robe and slippers, and put my things in a locker. I then waited in their cozy waiting area until it was time for my massage. 

My massage therapist was super friendly when she came and got me, and I really liked that she asked me what areas I wanted to work on before getting started; she was able to spend a lot of time on my upper back and shoulders, which I reeealllly needed. 

Throughout my massage, my therapist was very kind and made polite conversation, which I didn't mind. Eventually I did start talking less so I could relax a little bit more, and she followed my lead :) I thought this was really nice because I was somewhat worried she'd keep talking, and I'm not the type of person to ask someone to stop lol.

At the end, she gave me some advice for how to take care of my shoulders going forward, and I thought that was great! It didn't involve coming to get more massages from here, and I never felt any pressure from anyone to buy a package or something. 

Overall this was an amazing experience! I would definitely recommend Red Door to my friends :) I left super relaxed, happy, and oily (lol)."
5,"We were greeted with island hospitality !   We had the special plate w/ Lomi Lomi salmon, chicken long rice, laulau, squid , Mac salad rice and haupia. Delicious !
We live adjacent to the strip mall and will be frequenting Kauai cafe on a regular basis"
5,"This place rocks the food is great best burgers in the world and the first time for me to have a fried pickle the bomb and the dipping sauce is fab.
Sandi Jordan"
5,"Fun, neat and friendly grocer with deals and delicious foods available. Madison's best bet for an inexpensive alternative to Copps and Woodman's. It is conveniently located and won't burn a whole in your pocket like many of the over-pricey and inconsistent co-ops. We have frequented this grocer for more than a month and have always found satisfaction."
5,"This is probably one of few places where you can get an authentic Korean taste in Toronto. The service is superb and friendly.  It is opened 24/7 for those with midnight cravings or those who just want to get over a hangover with a nice soup early in the morning. You know you can judge a Korean restaurant by the quality and quantity of their side dishes, and this restaurant definitely meets expectations; not to mention,  their Kimchi Jjigae is the best in town. The prices are very modest, you can't go wrong here."
5,"Being a snowbird from AK & not having any knowledge of which doctors are the best...I made an appt w/ Wellish Vision Institute to look into my options to update my Lasik.   The staff is all very professional, knowledgeable, honest, accommodating & very caring.   I have felt very confident in them from the beginning.  If u are looking for an honest & very knowledgeable and professional team, I suggest that u give them a call."
5,This place is awesome. The baked goods are fresh. The samples are amazing. And the atmosphere is nice. Love it!!!!!
5,"We have been to this Outback at least a half dozen times in the past 8 months.  It is always very good and consistent.  The service has been the same as well.  

We've been to Fleming's, DC steakhouse and a few other higher end steakhouses in the area and IMO Outback, dollar for dollar, is by far the best value in town.  Period."
5,"I'm more than satisfied.  The pool pump was fixed the next day.  Mike showed up promptly , on time and had the problem diagnosed in no time, and he even had the part in his tool bag.  I couldn't be happier."
5,This is the best Denny's I have ever been too. It is very clean and the service is excellent. The manager and waitresses are always very warm and friendly. My boyfriend and I go there just for the great service.
5,"Whoa....Ono!!!!!
We ordered Lanimaka Mix: Teri pork, char siu chicken and kal bi this place you can order fried noodles as a starch no extra charge! Chili dog for my son that came with these chips that were soooo tasty!  We also ordered side musubi (comes with mayo inside....extra yum)!  Total came to $33 and change. Place was comfortable to eat and clean. We will def be back maybe next time we gonna try hawaiian plate....they have it all weekend until they run out. Very good!!!"
5,This is my second time here and I will definitely be coming back regularly! Had the chicken katsu and my bf had the kalua poor boy and we each had spam musubi and a malasada....sooooo Ono! Always great service! Refilled drinks without having to ask!  Can't wait to come back!
5,"The staff here went above and beyond this morning. My 2 yr. old daughter was pushing the mini cart and managed to tip it over and bump her eye in the process. As you might imagine, there were many tears that followed, but I think more than anything she scared herself. It was then, as I scooped the groceries back into the cart that an employee came over to offer her a foot of stickers. Another came with an offering of string cheese. And finally, a beautiful bouquet of flowers. What a way to make a girl(s) feel good! Thank you Trader Joes employees! You have outdone yourself."
5,Amazing food and the service was spectacular. It was so authentic. Thanks for the great service.
5,"Great place to grab a burger and a brew while staying off of I-80 in Streetsboro.  Tonight the  hubby had a great rack of ribs for $12.99.  My southwest salad was fresh and flavorful.  We've also had their burgers on a previous trip and they were huge, cooked just right and served on delicious bakery quality buns.  Big screen TV's and friendly staff round out this great little place off the Ohio Turnpike."
5,"Super good food. I had the #10 (Pho Dac Biet)in a spicy broth. The noodles were cooked at a perfect consistency. It had tripe, rare steak, brisket and meatballs. All protein was tender. Even the tribe which can sometimes be too chewy. I would definitely come back. 
My daughter had the Cornish hen with fried rice. She said the rice was really good but the Cornish hen was dry."
5,"Big problem.  They opened this close to home and I need to control my AYCE urges.  This place is always busy so make reservations if you can but this location is bigger than the others as it has 2 levels plus if you are not having the AYCE, they can sit you in the adjacent restaurant they own too (called Made in China).  Line ups are not as long here except during the busy dining hours so do expect to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated during the busy periods.  That's not very good if you're hungry and they don't have a place for you to sit and the line up is at the door and spills onto the street.  The bibimbap here is kick ass.  Sometimes we choose it over the AYCE when we're not so hungry cos they offer a terrific combo that includes shrimp, beef, chicken and veggies in a large stone pot with an egg and veggies plus hot sauce.

The bad: you gotta like to cook yourself.  You gotta cook BBQ style so don't wear your good clothes but do wear clothes :)  You would want to wash them too cos everything (hair, skin, clothes) are all destined for the wash after you eat here.  Seating is a bit tight as the cooking grills have limitations.  The wait for seating can be long.  Easy to put on weight here.  Too much red meat... keep it to a limit and go for more chicken, etc.  

The good: AYCE... All you can eat!!! You have a time limit (though it's rather loosely enforced) but the food just keeps coming.  Chicken, BBQ ribs, pork, beef, fish, squid and a whole ton of veggies (both spicy and not).  Free hot tea is needed to wash down the nitrates (love BBQ's but gotta keep an eye on over consumption).  Great value if you like this kind of experience.  Aside from the long waits (not their fault), everything including the service is pretty good value.  5 stars."
5,"I actually wrote a pretty good review about how excited I was about Kauai Cafe but it got corrupted in MS Word. So I've decided to write another one.

When I first heard of Kauai Cafe opening up it was kind of like all of my emotions were going all over the place.  You better be good if you're going to throw KAUAI in the name, you already forgot to include the okina but a lot of people do, I do all the time.  I was excited that Kauaians were finally stepping up and setting up shop in Vegas, besides having Lappert's you don't really see any other Kauai food representation here (nevermind this Lappert's isn't Kauai technically).  I am from Kauai, born and raised; I love the island, proud of everything Kauai related.  But I am also a Yelper; love Yelp (more like really really like yelp not love haha), proud of everything Yelp related (more like hey look yelp when I see yelp things).  I really enjoyed the food here and I didn't want to sound bias or anything like that so after bookmarking and visiting I kind of waited before finishing up my review and waited to see how others felt about Kauai Cafe.  I'm sure every Kauaian in Vegas has already stopped by but if they haven't they should.  Maybe they've even jokingly asked for the kama'aina discount.  Everyone should try Kauai Cafe.  Their food is so delicious that if I didn't already live conveniently near Island Flavor, I'd go here often enough to be the duke.  I'm so lucky I have options.

If you come here on Fridays' or weekends they offer their LAU LAU FEAST, this is my new favorite special plate lunch, think about Island Flavor's Friday special with a lot more. It includes lau lau, kalua pig, rice, mac salad, lomi lomi salmon, chicken long rice, squid luau, ahi poke, poi, and haupia.  The mac salad was OK but everything else was good.  Order one of these bad boys and eat it all, you might was well pick a spot and go nai nai.  Luckily I always know to take my food home when I know I'm going to hit that food comma, kanack attack state after eating. Here's everything we ordered http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kauai-cafe-las-vegas?select=cAdIEqy7JsR1CzjQIdrosA#qnZrmi1TZf_bc4ig4a0WAQ  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kauai-cafe-las-vegas?select=cAdIEqy7JsR1CzjQIdrosA#DY8LRpnEWNpjIn0gL9e_dw 2 lau lau feast, oxtail soup, and Kauai chicken.

They also serve up some bomb OXTAIL SOUP.  If you enjoy the one at Cal Hotel, you're going to LOVE this one.  Everything about it was delicious.  In my opinion the meat is a lot more tender and higher quality, just look at the picture.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kauai-cafe-las-vegas?select=cAdIEqy7JsR1CzjQIdrosA#wVSyL1mhSrQQlL8PcNjpag FYI this is only maybe more than half of the portions, it was to-go and I don't have a larger bowl.  And it comes with rice and mac salad.  There's a lot of meat and gelatinous around the bones, suck on the bone and give me just rice I'd make it a meal.  

The KAUAI CHICKEN was the last dish on our menu.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kauai-cafe-las-vegas?select=cAdIEqy7JsR1CzjQIdrosA#FHnK6GFTU_6iahVQkotK0Q It's the entire leg quarter of a chicken in a Heineken beer batter deep fried until golden crispiness.  The meat was juicy and the skin was flavorful.  I liked it not blown away but it was good enough to satisfy, it was good.

Kauai Cafe has probably one of the worst locations currently being on the far west edge of town in a center at Hualapai Way and Tropicana Ave.  There aren't a lot of businesses around and there's still a lot of developing going around the area so maybe they can have as much success as Island Flavor.  Don't get me wrong Island Flavor is #1 by a far margin but Kauai Cafe, for being still new, has some solid Hawaiian eats.  The interior is nice, clean, and welcoming.  There are plenty of booths and regular seatings but there weren't much people there when we were there.  Friendly staff with an open view of the kitchen.

The only knock I have on them is considering that Island Flavor is #1 in my books and it's isn't that far from Kauai Cafe is the pricing.   I have both menus side by side with me and I do see that Kauai Cafe has items that are about $1 higher.  It doesn't bother me much but it could bother others.  Some I'd pay for the higher price, likebthe oxtail, but some I scratch my head about, like the Kauai Chicken.  Anyways do come here cause you wont be disappointed.  I would like to see where they're at in a few years from now.  I want to try that teri beef and char siu chicken plate next, I grew up that stuff.

I guess my 5 star sounds like being bias. I'm safe to go back home.  LOL"
5,"Our experience tonight was well above expectation! Our server, Michael, was outstanding and even went the extra mile to shake our hands at the end of the meal, perfect touch! Our orders were made correctly, the atmosphere was perfect. I will definitely make this one of my more visited destinations in the area!"
5,I've come to Grazie 3x and my experience has always been amazing. You are greeted and welcomed as soon as you walk in the door. I brought my mom here for early dinner. Serving was very big - I got the meat sauce pasta...so DELICIOUS! Staff are very friendly and would highly recommend this place! Pizza is amazing too!
5,"Love love love Great Grains. Always so fresh & tasty. (My personal fave is the veggie on wheat with sundried hummus) Restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and clean, staff is very friendly,  samples of daily bread are ridiculously terrific. I only have one request: PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING A LOCATION CLOSER TO LAKE LAS VEGAS! There are NO good sandwhich restaurants over here. Subway is the only game in town as I am certainly not a fan of Capriotti's...(hint: The new Cadence shopping center going in where flagship Smith's is being built would be ideal!!)."
5,Amazing food and the service was spectacular. It was so authentic. Thanks for the great service.
5,Our first time here.  Food is good.   Service was slow. Only one server/cashier.  12 tables seating 4 per table.  Very clean.
5,"Happy Moose is consistently delicious. Their food ALWAYS comes out piping hot and is served with a smile. They have a great beer selection too!

I'd recommend their soft pretzels, any burger on the menu, and their French fries!  They don't salt them, but add a little malt vinegar and a shake of salt and you won't regret it!!  

If you're looking for great pub type food, eat here!  You'll be Happy (Moose) you did!"
5,grand opening!
5,I was seen at the Flamingo office by Dr. Ortiz first time getting dilated  and first eye exam! I didn't know what to expect!! My experience  there was phenomenal...everyone was kind and very helpful! Dr. Ortiz and his student explained everything very Thoroughly and great bed side manners!! His assistant Gladys and technician Celia we're both very sweet! Highly recommend Wellish Vision institute to all my friends and family oh and not to mention Dr Ortiz and his staff are bilingual a huge plus!
5,"I was unable to schedule my massage online when trying to use a gift card but I called the front desk and they were wonderful and helped me get that scheduled very quickly. 

Upon arriving everyone was very welcoming and quick to take me back. Rachel took care of me during my massage appointment and she was amazing. She was very attentive and made sure I was comfortable at all times. 

After the massage was over I was able to take my time winding down and was never rushed to pay and leave. 

This was my second time visiting this location and I will definitely visit again and would recommend to anyone."
5,"Ok folks let's talk about the Henderson Marks St. Site.........lets just say.......DA FREAKING BOMB SANDWICH AND BREAD! It's weird that the same company can be different from site to site. I am so sorry I cheated on you with a summerlin great harvest. I will never do that again. Everything is better at this store. Bread, sandwiches and service!! All was top of the line. GOOD FREAKING JOB!!! WOOOOOOOHOOOOOO!!! Had the chicken salad sandwich and sampled the cinnamon bread. OMG GOOD! I'm craving it again. It's like crack!!!"
5,"Excellent experience! Got a massage, mani and pedi. John was great for massage. Had Sharron for mani/pedi -- equally great."
5,Wellish basically saved my vision. I had a crosslinking procedure done here on both eyes. It's been over a year now and my symptoms have remained stable.
5,"Got the beef stew special. Was very good especially when you put Hawaiian chili pepper water all ova. Broke da mouth!! My sis had the teriyaki chicken & it was sweet tender & tasty :-)

Thanks Steven & Dawn for a good dinner :-)"
5,"called wellish vision yesterday 10/17/18  to schedule an eye appt.   as  a new patient  i had many questions regarding locations, doctors, insurance, referrals, etc.  had the great good fortune to speak to ""nicole"" at the call center.   she has worked at wellish for some time so she had a wealth of knowledge and info on everything and answered all my questions and resolved issues in very short order.   nicole was so pleasant to speak to i'm a little surprised she didn't offer to come and pick me up and drive me to the appointment!   my eyes already feel better and i'm not really sure i even need the appointment now.   if you are in need of eye care i suggest you call wellish vision institute and make sure you ask for nicole - you won't regret it."
5,"Definitely one of the better Korean restaurants in the area, and you can tell by the number of Koreans that eat here. We ordered the LA kalbi ($20), pork bone soup ($10) and soon tofu. Everything was delicious and we always appreciate the little sides that come with the meal and the purple rice! I thought the kalbi was a bit expensive for the portion, but I have to admit that it was very tasty. Everything was served very quickly which was great since we could hardly stop ourselves from salivating from the smell. 

The seating was divided into two sections, one side with tables and the other where you remove your shoes and sit on pillows. Our legs were sore by the end, but we hardly noticed while eating. Taller people might find it harder to stretch their legs. 

Another point is that they are open 24hrs, but it does get busy during dinner even on weeknights. There is free parking on the small streets in front and at the back/side of the restaurant after 6pm if you can find it. We came here to eat and it was easy to find a bubble tea or dessert cafe in the same area afterwards."
5,"Today was my first time at Happy Moose. Upon entering I was greeted with a friendly smile and then choose to sit at the bar. The bar is very spacious, made of granite, with plenty of seating. There are a lot of big screen monitors every where. So, getting a good view is no issue. The beer prices were good and even better once the baseball game started. This time I choose an appetizer, buffalo chicken dip with tortilla chips, that was so addictive I can't wait for more. I enjoyed my first experience and will be going back very soon"
5,EASILY the best Hawaiian food in town. My wife and I shared Da Surf Rider and the Mixed Grill and were blown away!!
5,"Absolutely amazing Pho!! This little gem originally showed up on my yelp app as a ""hot and new"" place to try out last year...I can't believe I've waited this long to review them. They are family run and very nice and clean. Always welcoming and inviting. Food is to die for!! I've tried other places and they don't compare at all. We are regulars and will continue to go back!! It's my son's favorite!! Thanks Pho KC!!"
5,"Great place for quick fast cheap sushi, I Love getting the bento box for 10 bucks you get a lot of food. and every 10 box your 11th one is free. Clean friendly staff. They also have a check in system where you can get free food after so many check in. Try spicy crunch roll really good."
5,Food and services are super friendly. Saimin is tasty. Malasada is yummy. Highly recommend for Hawaii local style cooking.
5,"I have to say that I was blown away with Aaron Pools.  When using our warranty company, I've grown accustomed to having mediocre contractors show up...not these guys!  The office called to confirm the appointments, the guys called each time to let me know that they were on their way and their friendly, professional and knowledgeable service was a home run for me!  I'm glad that I have a pool service that I can call on again when I need it."
5,Best burgers and fries!! Ate there twice while in town. It was right next to our hotel. Server we had the one night was amazing. Very very impressed with the food.
5,"Fresh tasty food, clean and great service! We ordered 3 rolls, bento box, crab ragoons, dumplings and salad. I can't find anything to complain about except the crab ragoons were small compared to what I'm use too. But still tasty."
5,"Didn't really want to cook dinner myself on Christmas Day, and most other restaurants were closed early in the afternoon (if they even opened at all). Despite the high volume of customers and the long wait times (which is kind of expected when most other places are closed for the holiday), the service was friendly. The food was still hot when I got it. The price was reasonable.

The breakfast combo I got was delicious. The hash browns were cooked well. Oh, and the toast was perfect! I cannot count how many other breakfast joints that I have been to that cannot properly toast bread; really, it's not that hard! So many restaurants either burn the toast or under-cook it, or apply either way too much or way too little butter.

Given that I'll probably be just as lazy next Christmas, I would probably come here again next year."
5,The customer service was great! We ordered takeout and the service was fast. We enjoyed our orders and were very satisfied with the tasty and quality.
5,"We went for Lunch after my son's hockey game at a nearby arena.  

I can strongly recommend the following pasta dishes:
Bologna - Rigatoni in a hearty meat sauce
Gnocchi - Gnocchi in a tomato sauce topped with ricotta
Prato - Fettuccine with grilled chicken & green onions
Amalia - Spinach filled ravioli with prosciutto (cured ham), green onions & asparagus

The whole experience was a treat."
5,"I wish this place was closer to home!! On the other hand, I'm glad it's not, otherwise I'd be eating here all the time. I've been on this Hawaiian food craving for about 2 weeks now. I saw this place driving to my dad's place and saw all the good ratings and pictures and had to try it out. 

I walk in and it's pretty empty, yay not wait. I wanted to try ""da surf rider"" which had coconut shrimp, macadamia scallops and teriyaki beef. However, they said that they were out of scallops. No worries, my go-to dish always is the Kalbi ribs with a side of Kim chee. While I waited for my food, I was reading the menu and it had the story of how the restaurant is commemorative of the owner's mother. I support family owned spots and you know they put a lot of love into their cooking. About 10 minutes later, I was on my way home to enjoy my food. 

I lifted the container out of the plastic bag and it was so heavy. Mind you my Kim chee and macaroni salad were in smaller separate containers. So much freaking food. The meat was cut up into smaller pieces for easier eating, but if they were in bigger pieces, I would have had 4 large pieces of Kalbi. Places usually only give you 3. The meat had a good proportion of fat and meat. The marinade was good and not too sweet. The macaroni salad didn't have too much mayo which I like. And it was really peppery and garlicky, which is also a good thing. I wish the Kim chee was a bit spicier but I still ate it. All this food for $15 and I didn't even finish it. Now I have lunch for tomorrow.

I will definitely be back when I am in the area!"
5,"Not too shabby! Had spring rolls and chicken pho. Both were very good. Service was fast, soup was hot, spring rolls were........um....springy. I will definitely be back."
5,First time was so delicious and we really enjoyed it.  The young lady there was so nice and friendly! We'll be back for sure!
5,"Customer service, like it should be. Mike, my apologies we all can get a little heavy handed with these posts, and not give you a fair chance to start with. 

Mike heard my voice message and called me right away and though it's been awhile since he's been here for this issue, he scheduled to come out and fix it. But during that time we had already made a decision about the company in our minds and it wasn't fair.

My apologies to you Mike and Arron Pools."
5,"I had such a relaxing massage here after work one day. They are in a new location on the second floor with a coffee shop on the first floor. Everyone was incredibly attentive and kind. The décor and overall feel is very high-end and very beautiful and clean. Definitely a great place to go if you want to feel like a princess. Oh so very Scottsdale ;)) Definitely not a bargain, though."
5,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience for my family.  Anyone who has had to make this terribly difficult decision knows the heartbreak and stress.  My experience started with making the most difficult phone call which was answered by Kelly who had such an empathetic soul which brought tears and confidence that I had called the right team to help my Dudley.  Through my tears, she was patient and kind and helped me make the appointment.  When the team arrived, they were also fantastic and full of empathy for our family who was losing a very loving member.  They handled the situation with such care and tenderness that left me able to cherish those last precious moments with my big boy, Dudley.  Even after the services the care and respect that they showed was so outstanding.  Dr. Fixler and Jennifer were like angels!  Thank you for the wonderful service during such a heartbreaking time.  I would recommend Happy Endings over and over again!"
5,This was our first time here and very pleasantly surprised. My husband ordered ribs and sides which he loved. I had the shrimp tacos and fries and they were cooked to perfection. I asked for a spicy margarita and the bar tender created a good one on the spur. We sat on the patio and the service was fantastic. Very fast and we plan to eat there again.
5,"This place has very high quality flowers. All florists are pretty dang expensive, so you have to expect that going in. But the $180 bouquet lasted at least 10 days looking amazing and another 5 looking decent.

The owner was very pleasant and answered my questions.

I will definitely use this florist every time in the future."
5,Thank you!!! Greg. For making up for the last batch of bad roses. These look 10 times healthier. I really appreciate it. I'll definitely be a regular customer.
5,Classic place. Been around for 60+ years. Best Bologna sandwich there is. Eat with mustard only and sit at the bar.
5,"I went on to Yelp to find a local florist in Las Vegas.  I live in Northern California and wanted to send flowers to a friend that just had surgery.  I did not realize that my friend was in ICU and couldn't receive the flowers.  Greg, who delivered the flowers was great and helped me get the flowers to my friends husband.  I highly recommend using this flower shop!!!  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!"
5,"As the simple sandwich and egg creme soda goes. I really don't think its going to be surpassed..especially for the price.  The place is all counter space and thebpersonalith poses out from the seems.  It's Small, simple and unpretentious and just a few doors down from of the best bagels in the city :)  I had mine with Swiss cheese and tried the root beer egg creme soda  delish.  Half sour picked come 4 or 5 spears to an order so keep that in mind in ordering.  Had a chopped egg salad with Swiss in an onion roll which was actually satisfying as well but the original with mustard was definitely worth the tripntobthe neighbourhood."
5,"This place is Kinda pricey but overall worth the money 
Food is awesome and always fresh 
My favourite is juicy Lucy on fire and the utility"
5,Damn this place is so great. The decor is very friendly? and you can't? beat those prices! Definitely coming back.
5,"These people were the nicest people. I had a lovely experience here. I came here because I saw them featured on Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations. If you haven't seen his episode on Montreal, do yourself a favor and check it out, it's a classic. I came in right before closing but they accommodated me kindly. The sandwich itself was amazing. I ordered a classic with Swiss and an egg creme. Both tasted so classic and delicious. Overall, it just feels like you're in a classic neighborhood place. They've been doing it the same way for this long for a reason."
5,"This is my go too late night Mexican food place, it can not be beat. I discovered it for the first time buying beer with one of my friends before a party and have been back probably a dozen time in the pst 3 or 4 months. I would highly recommend their tacos as you can get 4 for the price of a burrito, but they are much more food. The burritos are huge however, and the quesadillas are def larger than I was expecting. Happy eating"
5,"My wife and I celebrated our renewal of vows in Las Vegas and hosted guests in a Bellagio suite. We found Dancing Dandelion and discussed what we wanted for arrangements, we actually supplied a picture of an arrangement and they matched it wonderfully. Our ten arrangements we delivered as scheduled and our guests complimented us on their beauty. I would definitely recommend The Dancing Dandelion Flower Shop to everyone in need of floral service in Las Vegas. Customer service was exemplary!"
5,"I've been to Vietnam many times, and have had Vietnamese food from Los Angeles California for the last 30 years and I have to say this place is really great!  went for the do it yourself spring rolls.  The meat and veggies are great!  Will post pictures soon!  I will definitely be back here for more food in the future.  Thank you chef."
5,"I could not have asked for a more peaceful passing for my 15 year old dog, Daisey.  After assessing her overall condition, Dr. Fixler assured us that we were making the right decision.  He explained the entire process to us, in an empathetic manner.  He then gave us time to say our final good-byes in private before returning to begin the process.  Once she had passed, he gently wrapped her and allowed my husband to carry her out so that they could take her away.  
Daisey really did not like to leave the house over the last year or so. If I had to take her somewhere to have this done, it would have stressed her greatly and made the entire situation much more unbearable.  I am SO appreciative to have had such gentle, caring people make this transition for her in the comfort of our own home.
Thank you, Happy Endings Pet Euthanasia! I am grateful for your service."
5,"Everything about Comedy Bar is great; the people, the food, the drinks and especially the jokes."
5,Excellent late night mexican food at a really good price! Especially the flaming hot cheeto burrito!!
5,"After 14 years of an amazing relationship my 19 year old daughter was going to have to let her best friend move on without her.   Buddy had been her dog.   She picked her out herself and raised and loved her.   Buddy was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer that had spread to her lymphatic system and we knew when the quality of her life was waning we would allow her peaceful passage.   The time came and we flew my daughter back from Vermont, where she is attending college, allowing her 3 days to spend with Buddy and arranged for service in our home as Buddy did NOT like the doctor's office.   The staff and Dr. Fixler were respectful and beyond wonderful.    Not only was Buddy never fearful, the family was together and he even brought the other two dogs out to say good bye after Buddy passed and the transition for them was never stressful.   This is the finest way to say good bye we have ever experienced!  Thank you Happy Endings!"
5,"This was such a heart wrenching decision to make for our boy, Chance, who had been a part of our lives for over 12 years but Dr Michael, Alicia and everyone at Happy Endings helped us know that it was time to say goodbye. They were able to come out the same day we called and even though traffic threw their schedule off and they were here after 10 pm they showed so much compassion and gave us time to say good bye. I can't say enough about this amazing service and I am grateful that they provide this service. Chance was not a fan of going to our vets office anymore and being able to keep him calm at home meant the world to us. Thank you!"
5,"I have had to go to this ER twice over the last few years. I have also had surgery and stayed overnight. The staff everyone from the people who check you in, to the registration staff to the actual medical staff treat you with kindness and respect. And honestly I can't say this about other hospitals in the valley. Arrowhead is my go to hospital in the valley. As far as Hospital goes to me they are one of the best. And I've never had a bad experience with them as of yet. But I have A huge amount of respect for the ER department. Thank you for making my experience as comfortable as one can having to be at the ER."
5,"Yum. Read everyone's reviews and follow their advice. 
Cherry coke is tasty and old school and reminds me of the classic drug store soda counter of my youth. 
Their signature sandwich is fairly straightforward and delicious. 
Friendly staff to boot."
5,"This lovely shop is a small family run business and their customer service was amazing. I went in two days before my wedding to order a bouquet in peach roses. They were out of stock that day but confirmed a new delivery the next. Friday afternoon I received a call that my order was ready to be picked up on Saturday. It was beautifully arranged and hand wrapped in a white ribbon, which was placed in a glass cylinder vase and white box for easy transportation. I couldn't be happier or excited for my big day with this gorgeous bouquet. I want to thank everyone at Dancing Dandelion for all of their help and the work that they do."
5,"This is a great little spot for a quick light lunch. It's totally hyped - and not glamorous in person, but I truly enjoyed my Wilensky Special + swiss cheese, and a side of pickle and beef karnatzl. They make their own flavoured soda on the spot which is kind of neat. I had the cherry coke and was happy with it. my bill came to 8.05 with tax. Not too shabby!"
5,"We moved to Lake Las Vegas two months ago, and our options were either Centurylink or stick with DISH. DISH's billing/customer service was so inept that we gave Centrurylink a shot, despite seeing nothing but horrible reviews. So far, so good. Installation guy was prompt, friendly, and professional. Internet works great. Cable TV is flawless. Fees charged were as advertised."
5,Loved the BBQ. Excellent service. Wonderful environment. The brisket was excellent. The price is very reasonable. Child friendly. I recommend!
5,My bothers and I live in CA and we ordered flowers online since my mother was hospitalized during her mini vacation in Vegas. It was super easy ordering online and their selection of flowers/arrangements were so beautiful! My family and I are very pleased with the speedy delivery as well as how beautiful the arrangement was!  Another pleased customer!  Would definitely recommend!
5,"I will never use any other method again but in home euthanasia.  Dr Fixler and his staff were compassionate and highly skilled.  We said goodbye to our dog in the backyard, the sun keeping him warm and the birds chirping.  He died peacefully with his head in my hand.  Afterwards they wrapped him in a fleece blanket and took him to be cremated.  I received a poem from them with his paw print on it. I whole heartedly recommended Dr Fixler"
5,"We have never been in this area before. The hotel staff suggested Q's. We were very pleased with the decor, menus and service. The server was charming and made us feel she enjoyed our company. It was taco night. We ordered two kinds, pork and beef. They were delicious. Spicy but not over whelming. For dessert the chocolate ice cream brownie was perfect for sharing. We intend to return soon. We unhesitatingly recommend this restaurant."
5,"This Freddy's is great. The manager there (tall gentleman, he told me his name but I can't remember it unfortunately) is really friendly and courteous. Always asks me how I am and if there is anything else I need from him. I appreciate the friendly atmosphere. It's all about attitude, and this team here has a great attitude. I feel comfortable eating here and always have a great meal. The fry sauce is the bomb dot com. I love it! 5/5"
5,"One of the newest places in Toronto to go see comedy, this place lives up to both ends of its handle.  It is a beautiful bar, and a great place to see comedy.  Found in the up and coming neighbourhood of Ossington and Bloor, Comedy Bar is a below street level lounge, restaurant, and place where comedy and improv abound.

Began as a brainchild of the team that brought Toronto ""Sunday Night Live"", Comedy Bar was erected to provide a dedicated performance space to sketch, improv, and sometimes stand-up in the same vein as Second City (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-second-city-mainstage-theatre-toronto) and the Bad Dog (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bad-dog-theatre-toronto), providing comedy seven days a week.  The comedy theatre itself is a small long room akin to many improv rooms designed to pack people close together and close to the stage to engage in an intimate setting.  It totally works.

Comedy Bar also provides a sit-down bar and a lounge as well with dark tones, leather couches, and a fireplace (remote controlled, but a fire place nonetheless).  A fantastic place to sit down and enjoy a drink before or after a performance.  The menu is fantastic as well with surprisingly tasty food for a comedy shop.  Normally comedy food is not funny but laughable.  This is not the case here.  You'll have as much fun as a team of monkeys performing ""Spamalot!"""
5,We tried Freddy's on vacation and were so delighted. The fried pickles are the best I've had. They are crunchy and still taste like pickles. The burgers are so yummy and have that great little fried edge.
5,"Just being there is part of the experience. It's a light lunch, no frills. Simply order the iconic and signature Wilensky special, no cheese, and cherry cola. What you see is what you get, no more, no less. Going back in time is good for the soul."
5,"A friend and I had passed by about a month ago and made a note to go for lunch one day because of their Buy One Get One Deal. Out of all the days, Monday's Canada Eh! sounded the best to me so finally the right Monday came and we got to try it. For the price of $7.99 for one Canada Eh! burger, we got two. With tax it was $9.05 so really it only cost us $4.50 each. At that price for a premium burger, you really can't go wrong. We got them on whole wheat buns and they were delicious! You can definitely taste the quality of their free range beef. I would 100% get this burger again and next on the list to try is Thursday's Burgerrito. After reading some of the other reviews I think I might try their fries next time too."
5,Dr. Fixler and his assistant are wonderful people and have one of the hardest jobs in the world.  They are extremely caring and understanding in every way.  It was one of the hardest decisions I've made in my life.  I put my loving pitt bull of 14 years a sleep.  His quality of life was not much after he went blind two years ago.  He was friendly and sweet up until the end.  Thank you Dr.  for making it painless.  I will miss him forever!!
5,"Letting our sweet boy go was a difficult and tragic decision. He had been sick for months.  We had been advised that he would let us know when it was time, and he did.  We watched him get skinny, weak and slow but he continued to have a smile on his face and a sparkle in his eye.  When those disappeared, we knew we were doing him a disservice by not helping him pass peacefully.  We knew it would be hard on him to be loaded into the car and driven to a vet office. Plus, who wants to wait in the reception area waiting to be called back when you know what is going to happen next?  So, we called Dr. Fixler's office and made an appointment for that afternoon.  He and his assistant came to our house  and were so sweet and kind to our boy, and to us.  They reassured us that we were making the right decision and that ""Tex"" was ready to go.  They made the process as seamless and compassionate as possible  They also made sure that our other dog had an opportunity to say his good bye's.
After being through this at home and comparing it to when we had to do it at the vet's office with a prior pet years ago - this was the ideal way to say good bye and the ideal way for our boy to head off to the Rainbow Bridge.  
We very much appreciate Dr. Fixler and are happy to recommend him to anyone facing this situation."
5,The deserts are delicious. This is my second time here in two days. Nothing skimpy about it. For the money compared to the other custard places I think this is my new favorite.
5,"This is an outstanding hospital. The employees all seem to love working here which is reflective in the care of my mother..from the ER staff and doctor, to the unbelievable care in the ICU to general hospitalization. The RNs were attentive and always on their game. The physicians were abundant and extremely proactive in the care of my mother. I cannot say enough of how well she was treated. Now she is coming home. Thank you Abrazo!"
5,"Catering!! We had ordered the beef brisket for our annual summer party. Amazing! The beef had a good char on the outside and soooooo tender on the inside.  Delicious!! We ran out well before the night was over, even though I also served my own chicken. Everyone loved the beef!  Next party I will order both from Smokin' Q's. Thanks!!"
5,"Had the most wonderful experience with this quaint and classy flower boutique. The arrangements within the display cases provided a variety of options to impact the  buyer's experience. Upon choosing my preferred arrangement as a gift for a friend, the florist ensured the arrangement's  longevity by substituting pieces as needed.

I love shopping with local businesses and can confidently endorse this shop as honest, creative, affordable, and charming. I appreciate their kindness and will definitely shop with them going forward. 

If you are looking for a creative local business with wonderful service and great quality, please be sure to visit this florist."
5,"My husband received excellent care during an ER visit recently and we both have had great experiences having outpatient tests there. We highly recommend it! The nurses, physicians and volunteers are the best! (Full disclosure: I am an Abrazo Community Health Network employee. My comments are based on my personal experience with my husband's care.)"
5,Damn delicious! My grandfather went here. My dad went here. We all tried to recreate it at home. It's never the same. I hope this place stays open forever. It's an absolute classic and much a part of Jewish Canadian heritage as anywhere else in MTL. I contemplate driving from Toronto to Montreal often just for a wilensky.
5,"The best place for amazing and cheap indie comedy in Toronto. Improv, sketch, stand-up, this place does it all. Awesome bartenders, friendly service at the box office. An amazing hang-out for fans of comedy in the city."
5,"Great website, great customer service and the most beautiful, creative and innovative flower arrangements.  Personal follow up on the phone after placing the order online was a big plus, and the suggestions made by the customer service rep made the arrangement even more impressive. Great to work with!"
5,"Comedy Bar is one of those neighbourhood gems that makes Bloorcourt such a charming and dynamic place to live. Simultaneously, it's one of Canada's best indie comedy clubs and hosts unbelievable star-powered events. 

I've seen some great local comics here, and events like Catch-23 Improv and Gilmore Girlprov are delightful and affordable. The pro-am night is great. The stuff happening in the Cabaret space is always weird and wonderful. 

I've also seen some crazy things here. There was the night that Greg Proops captivated us for what seemed like hours - how does that man just keep talking? What must the inside of his head be like? 

There was the semi-secret Eddie Izzard show, where he tested out his new material on a riveted crowd. 

Then there was the time we went to a taping of The Nerdist podcast during JFL42 at the Princess Elizabeth Theatre, and Chris Hardwick & co. were dying to leave their own podcast because they'd heard that Louie CK was doing a spontaneous show at Comedy Bar. Legendary. 

I like comedy, but I'm not a scene insider and I don't know anyone who works or performs at Comedy Bar personally. It's just one of those places that always makes me feel like I'm part of something great. 

The staff is attentive. The beer selection and the menu are solid pub comfort food. Blanche de Chambly on tap! 

Go to C-Bar. Laugh your head off. Buy a beer. Support it forever."
5,"Maternity experience was great! Dr.Folkestad and  nurse Christine were wonderful! They accomodated all my requests, even though they were not the       "" Norm"". They made sure everyone knew them, understood and executed those requests! The nurses were great and helpful in after care! Thank You!"
5,I visited this campus & could not have been more pleased! I was seen right away no wait. I have to mention Tara. She was extremely caring about my wellbeing & went out of her way to help me the next day to make an appointment at a Dr.s office. The whole staff was amazing! I hope I don't have to come back but if I'm ever in need I will come back to this campus!
5,"I ate here after seeing multiple segments on local TV.   Amazing barbecue.    Great smell.  Great taste.   Perfect service.   

So glad i went here.  The corn side is over the top with flavor.   Also. The brisket is most and Smokey.  The three  sauces are diverse.   Mild , a bit spicy and then a thin light sauce that has a bite.     

Please try this restaurant.  I had the ""little bear"" at lunch.  See photo."
5,"This was my first time ordering from this place.  I wanted something quick, and honestly all the photos I've seen looked so good, so I decided to give it a shot. I was NOT let down. 

I ordered a cheesey lucy, and honestly if you're a fan of cheese, do yourself a favor and try this burger. It had cheese injected into the patty. Amaaaaazing. The fries are thick cut fries and they were delicious (I got a poutine). 

All in all I was not disappointed, and I don't think you will be either."
5,"A family member had to visit Abrazo's ER a few days ago. Out of respect for their privacy, I won't post any details of their condition, but we were greeted promptly, immediately triaged, and placed in a room.  We were there for about 3 hours while multiple tests were run. We saw two nurses and a PA-C. Everyone was very friendly and put us at ease with jokes and small talk. 

I was especially impressed by the person sent to talk to us about insurance and billing. My previous experience with such individuals is that they were unhelpful and unfriendly - definitely the worst part of a non-life-threatening ER visit. But this person was polite and caring. She helped us understand the insurance forms and walked us through our payment options.

Thank you, Abrazo, for making a terrifying day a little easier!!

Edit: Fair warning, avoid the soup in the cafeteria. I have eaten it multiple times and it always upsets my stomach :("
5,Great burgers. Huge portion of fries. Don't order a large unless you a total fat bastard.
5,"Freddy's Custard is fantastic. For fast food, it's very good at fair price. At every store I've been to there is always some confusion on timing the custard and the meal... but it always seems to work out.  They serve Pepsi, that's the only down side."
5,I have been to smokin'q's at least six times and have never been disappointed. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. They have daily specials and a nice beverage list. Hoping to make it to taco Tuesday sometime soon to take advantage of the great deal and the chance to sample a variety of flavors. They also have an outdoor patio for warm weather dining.
5,"I get drunk here and they let me play Night Moves by Bob Seger whenever I'm there. The staff is the absolute best for that reason.

The owner tells long stories sometimes. He's the sort guy who wears hats.

One time I saw a dog inside."
5,"I've seen many great acts here. Tickets for shows have never been more than funeral dollars. Also, the beers yet have on tap are a great deal which is always a nice surprise is some  comsdy shows tend to jack up alcohol costs. Favourite show is catch 23. Hilarious and frequent. Every first fri of month. Atmosphere is small and intimate. Type of place where comedians interact w audience which I love. Worth it every show!"
5,"If u r drunk on lemon st., because let's face it who isn't, you must slop into El P for that monstrous caifornia burrito. Your drunk self will thank you for that."
5,Good people! Very compassionate & understanding during a difficult time. Thank you Dr. Fixler & Grace.
5,"Fantastic vietnamese res. The pho taste like home made goodness that is 10 times better than pho hung's watered down broth. Their rolls are delicious and fresh. 

Everything on the menu is of quality and made from wholesome ingredients. 
Definitely worth the visit.

It is run by one viet couple, the wife cooks, and the husband handles the front.

They are closed on wednesday."
5,"Not a fancy place, but so good! We actually ate here twice while in Montreal. During our first visit, we ordered the Wilensky Special - one with swiss and another with cheddar - and a cherry soda (loved that they use old school syrup). Would personally give the slight edge to the Special with cheddar, but both were tasty and satisfying. 

Service was efficient and I enjoyed the original decor. As mentioned, we came back the next day for another Special after an underwhelming experience at Fairmount Bagel."
5,Atmosphere and music is wonderful! Service fast and prompt. Food excellent! I had the Birdie without the taco. Very tasty with just the right amount of heat.  Will definitely be back!
5,"The beef & veggie plate is nostalgic for me...

When I was going to OCC I lived off of this stuff. I would buy a large beef bowl & make three meals out of it because I was broke. Every time I have Yoshinoya it takes me back to that time & I think of how far I've come so it's not just about the food but it's also about the memories. 

This stuff has such a distinct taste & it hasn't changed in years which I love. It's cheap, filling & delicious. The beef is extra thin & I love the flavor! The veggies are a must for me because they are always perfectly cooked & I pour some soy sauce over everything & it doesn't get any better :)

There's one location in town which sucks & I'm waiting for the day it comes to the west side :)

Worth driving across town for this stuff? My answer is absolutely!"
5,"Great tasting burgers and the poutine is pretty good too. Wish the fries were better, but overall 5*"
5,I called in to order flowers from out of state and Rosie was so friendly & helpful. She patiently answered all my questions and gave helpful suggestions. They delivered the beautiful bouquet within a couple of hours of me placing my order. The bouquet was exactly what I asked for!! Definitely will be using this flower shop again. They have  reasonable prices also. Thank you Rosie!!
5,"DAMNNNNN SKIPPY.
This is one good burger. Peanut butter and jam on a burger sounds kind of gross at first, but it is actually delicious. It is one of those brilliant combinations of sweet and salty, like maple candied bacon. By recommendation of the staff, I also added bacon to the burger. The flavours all work surprisingly well together.

I came around noon on a Sunday with a group. There were no other customers when we got there so we were served relatively quickly. 

Overall, I'm impressed the by the uniqueness of this burger and how surprisingly good it tasted. I haven't tried the other burgers so I can't comment. But, service was good and staff were friendly. No complaints. 10/10 would recommend the Damn Skippy burger."
5,"The food is down right delicious - especially their specialty, nem nhuong. HOWEVER, the customer service is atrocious. The male owner seems like he hates life. But I keep coming back because of the food. Good price, good portion, amazing quality."
5,"Stopped by for the Wilensky's Special, loved it and almost shed a tear after taking my last bite. Delicious, reasonably priced and simple. I can't wait to go back again and again. The staff are no nonsense, genuine and the decor is very charming. Would highly recommend!"
5,"I love it. 
Specially the burgerziki burger. fries are delicious as well."
5,If you're looking for some tacos come here. I always get the 4 pack of tacos with everything on it. The tacos taste perfect by themselves but with add some alcohol and it takes them to another level. I literally moved to Tempe to be closer to these tacos. Every single time I have ordered them I've come here I've always left happy and with a full stomach. Plus their service is top of the line. They've got every single alcohol you could think of plus more. Every flavor you want plus a ton of drinks on ice. Come here and you won't be let down
5,"Not the cheapest but beautiful arrangements, reliable delivery.  Flowers lasting is a function of room temperature as much as anything, not easy here in Vegas.  The only place I will order flowers from for Vegas delivery."
5,"They have the BEST "" Fish & Chips'  I have found in Tempe and surrounding areas.  Always hot and fresh!"
5,Repeat customer due to always great service.  The arrangements they make are GREAT!  Visited easily a dozen times.
5,"I am not sure where to even start.

Dr. Fixler and his assistant showed up at our home with the utmost compassion and understanding of what we were about to face. Our lab, Cody, was so excited to see them and they made him so feel comfortable by petting and talking to him. They gave us all the time we needed to say goodbye and when it was time the passing was so peaceful. 
If I could give 100 stars I would! I highly recommend in home pet euthanasia by Happy Endings when you are ready to send your fur baby to the Rainbow Bridge. 

Thank you so much for all you did for us this evening. You have an extremely tough job and I give you so much credit.
RIP Cody!"
5,"I'm Vietnamese and I have always been looking for authentic Viet dishes (something else rather than Pho) here in Toronto. Finally, I found Anh Dao and I think this is my new favourite spot!
I had the S8 combo of 3 beef skewers with different flavours - they are to be wrapped in rice paper. Came with the skewers were a whole bunch of fresh herbs which most restaurants don't offer. The combo is $30 which I think reasonable. 
I'll update once I try other dishes, there are many more special dishes the restaurant offers."
5,I found this place while I was at the Laundromat down the street. I had never heard of it (I am from out of town). I thought it looked pretty cool. It is cool. The special is fried bologna and salami with mustard and cheese (optional). What could be better.
5,"Delicious!! Nice, small intimate local place. Very nice staff. Has a large outdoor patio with fireplace. Hard sweet tea is potent and delish!!"
5,"In what was a very difficult time (the end of life of a furry family member), Dr. Fixler and Nurse Alicia allowed my last moments with my beloved cat, Jack, to be as peaceful as possible, and I 'm very grateful for the gentleness of their care and demeanor. 

After a month's battle of illness (and many trips to the vet's office, medications, procedures, etc.), we realized that there was not going to be a turnaround in Jack's health, and he had stopped eating and drinking altogether. I didn't want to put him through another trip to the vet's office and have him be anxious/scared (as many cats are when not in their own environment) or in pain (from transportation) in his final hours. And I couldn't even imagine driving home with his empty pet carrier. My veterinarian and staff are AMAZING, but unfortunately they don't perform house calls, and I'm very grateful to them for recommending Happy Endings.

I wrote Dr. Fixler an email in the evening, and he responded that same night with his concern and also letting me know that their office would contact me in the morning. And they did, and handled everything with grace. We scheduled for them to come to my home the following day, and the office kept me updated the day of the appointment on arrival time. Nurse Alicia also explained everything about the procedure over the phone, and answered the few questions I had. 

They called before arrival, and spent time with me beforehand (we all sat on the floor with Jack) talking about the medical issues that Jack had, and discussing again the simple steps that they would be going through to assist Jack in peacefully leaving this world. And I shared some wonderful memories of my much loved 4-legged companion of many years. They allowed me as much time as I needed with him, both before and after. And handled his body with just as much care that I would have.

For any other loving owners who, as we all do at one point, need to make that hard decision for our pets, I can't say enough good things about Happy Endings. Thank you!"
5,"Friendly employees, wide selection of essentials, best beer prices anywhere, and that hometown Mom & Pop feel (regardless of your race/ethnicity). Best bodega EVER!"
5,This place is quaint and homie. Staff is very chill and everything is done before your eyes. Canadian eh is where the money is!
5,Dr Fixler was amazing. He came into our house and made us and more importantly our Duke feel comfortable and relaxed.
5,"I'm giving this place 5 stars because Anthony Bourdain is a genius and told me to come here. Not because it's the best breakfast sandwich ever made. But because this place is a time capsule stuck in history. As soon as you walk in, you've instantly warped back to 1928. 

The woman behind the counter didn't say hi or hello. She said, how many? Lol I loved it. My first ever chocolate egg cream soda brought me back to my Jewish roots. And yes the sandwich was most definitely perfect with a squirt of mustard. Less than 7 bucks spent, I was more than satisfied. In fact if I lived here, I'd probably have a sandwich everyday."
5,"El Paisano's food is great! Would highly recommend the Fiji burrito, it has fresh avocado and pineapple in it! The staff is a great and they know everyone in the neighborhood."
5,I went through the drive-thru and ordered dinner for my family. Including my elderly grandmother who has a very strict no salt diet. I asked them to make a burger with no salt. When I got home they had made her burger patty with salt. So I was really upset and I called. I spoke to the manager and he apologized and said that he would drive the new order to my house!!!!! I said that wasn't required but he insisted! He was at my house in ten minutes with the freshly made order and coupons for free Freddy's!!! There is still customer service left in this world! This place deserves 10 stars! Not to mention the food is good too.
5,"Comedy Bar is one of Toronto's hidden gems.  Pretty much every night there are at least a couple of shows on, and if you check the schedule, they often host fairly big name US headliners and the top of Canadian comedy.  Bar staff are friendly and efficient, and the menu is interesting and reasonable for snacks.  Not a fancy place, but very fun and usually an eclectic crowd. Very pleasant night out .. laughter is good for the soul so go check it out and have some fun.  My only minor quibbles ... the bar area could use some hooks along the bar and the wall rail so you could hang your purse or coat.  And it would be nice to have a more robust offering of beverages for those that do not drink alcohol ... only options are really soda pop and cranberry juice and if you're watching your diet, those aren't great or healthy options ... maybe some tomato juice or a non-sugary option like Vitamin Water Zero?"
5,"God I love meat. I'm a terrible Indian man as I eat all meats. Pig, cow, chicken, alligator, fox - you name it, I eat it. Needless to say, there was a sweaty tenderness in my loins that developed when I heard of a new BBQ joint opening up around Cleveland.

I took a seat at the bar. Solid craft beer list that included a couple offerings from Double Wing Brewing that is underrepresented in downtown Cleveland. I asked the bartender what to order and she recommended the sporaccii sandwich. 

The sandwich had jalapeno cheddar sausage, loads of pulled pork and slaw on soft butter rolls and came with a side of their housemade bbq sauce - vinegar based with a little tang and a little spice. The first bite was magic - my mouth grabbed hold of a piece of pulled pork and the pulled pork just kept going and going and going. BOOM SHAKALAKA. During subsequent bites, I had several sandwich droppings which I expediently scooped up and devoured.

Tasty, meaty addition to Cleveland!"
5,Needed flowers to go to hospital same day. All flower sites online couldn't do it. Called and Greg texted me pictures of 3 beautiful arrangements and hand delivered on his way home. Good customer service is so rare I give them an A+++
5,"Wilenski's is an important reminder of Montreal heritage. The Wilenski Special is the type of sandwich your parents would make you after school. It's simple and taste great. When I ate here, there were plenty of kids at the counter so popular with the youngsters for sure. While the decor is minimalist, the place is an iconic image of Montreal and the people who have frequented this place since the 30's."
5,"I have been wanting to go here since they opened last year but the mixed reviews had kept me away. I finally decided to give it a try this past Friday. I had heard good things about the panko/frosted flake battered fish. Needless to say I should have gone here much sooner. I had a 2 meat combo, fish and brisket and the boyfriend had a 3-meat combo, pulled pork, ribs and sausage. Everything was great! The fried corn and sausage was a bit to spicy for me but everything else was wonderful! The mac and cheese is some of the best i have ever had. Don't let the reviews keep you away. I think there was some growing pains in the very beginning but they must have turned things around. Service was great, food was great and it was served hot and pretty quick. We will be going back."
5,"The food here is not only insanely delicious, but you'll also definitely get your bang for your buck. I order the Philly steak and fries pretty often, and most of the time I can't even get the lid closed because of how much food is in the box. Also, the Trumparito is a hefty bomb of food that'll definitely keep you full, probably for the whole day. They're super fast with the food prep too! I can't recommend this place highly enough."
5,"Great Cleveland BBQ place. There is a ton of menu variety, even vegetarian choices. I highly recommend getting the ""El Jefe style"" for your meat, it's a nice change from the usual BBQ sides. The meat on the baby-back ribs was delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I look forward to going back and trying other menu items."
5,"It was purely by accident that i found this place! Especially the fact it is a mile from home! I had never heard of the chain but decided to try it!  I like this place tons more than their local competition!!!  The burgers, fry sauce and frozen yogurts are perfect!!!! Thank you for my new addiction!"
5,"I had a stomach virus and I went to urgent care, They told me I needed an IV and that I would have to go to an ER. I was only in the waiting room at Abrazo for about 15 minutes before I was taken back and they got my vitals. Then I was led to a bed and the doctor came in shortly after that. He told me that I was going to get an IV and have a urine test and some blood work done. While I was getting my IV, my partner Jim went down to the cafeteria for some food. He absolutely raved about how good the food was and wanted to come again sometime just to have lunch! When my IV was done, the doctor came back and gave me some instructions about how to treat the virus and we left. Everybody I dealt with there was efficient and professional. I would definitely go to Abrazo again, even though another ER is closer to where I live."
5,"This is a warm and friendly run business. The owners are very personable and you can tell they enjoy what they do. The flowers are fresh, I know this through our conversation and saw them bringing in flowers from the flower market a minute after our discussion..lol and the best reason you should visit them is the great pricing! I found my go to florist, definitely will be back!"
5,Must have come on an off night because these burgers are seriously off the chain!!
5,"Dr. Fixler came out on a holiday weekend night when we were at wits end.

After two previous in-home euthanasias, We had prepared ourselves for the day our 14yr. old Dachsund would need rest from his pain and discomfort.  I didn't plan on the panic when the service we had used the two times before didn't respond.  He not only came to us that night, but juggled priorities, based upon Alicias's assesment of our need and arrived earlier than scheduled.  He explained his on-site diagnosis so that we understood what was likely going on.  I'm grateful that he took the time to make us aware of what options existed, although we already understood what was the best for our beloved pet.

His bedside manner is wonderful, and you'll sense that he cares about what he does.
He does this personally, without staffed techs, so understand that it is just solely him when you may need to share his services with others in need.

I wish that you all never ever have to meet him, but this is a fellow who is truly devoted to caring for the needs of the pets we love."
5,We have been there 3x now and hae never been disappointed. Beef patties and great buns are fresh and the daily specials are made right from scratch. Service is excellent and you wil not be disappointed.
5,"Generous portions, low prices, great food. The market is clean and the staff is friendly. Food is made quick no matter how busy they are. Definitely a new regular spot for me."
5,I love this Montreal staple... It appears to be preserved and unchanged for over 80 years.  And it's still family owned. I was served by the original owners grand daughter.
5,"Anytime I can find a Yoshinoya I am there!! I am kind of a proponent for this place.. I don't know exactly why i love it so much, but I seek them out when I can find them. We don't have them in AZ, so I usually go out of my way when I am out of state to find one. You have to get the chicken and beef combo bowl. So good.. I am hungry for it right now!"
5,"So grateful we called them. Professional and compassionate. After the 16 years of devotion and love we received from our dog, Sadie, we are so glad that we had Dr Fixler help her transition over to a restful eternity.Thank you Happy Endings our family is very grateful."
5,"The best service of any convenience store. This one is on par, for me, with Carleton Ave Grocery (Georgetown, WA). (Check my other reviews)"
5,The burritos are huge AND amazing. One of the owners came out and gave us waters free of charge when we sat outside to eat at night. The service is fast and friendly. I recommend El P's to everyone
5,"best service for the very worst situation. I am so grateful to Dr. Fixler and staff for helping my beautiful, Bailey, cross the bridge in the comfort of our home surrounded by love. Thank you so much for your compassion and for caring for our pets enough to offer such a meaningful service."
5,I ordered a rose gift box for someone to show my appreciation for all she has done for me at work as well as for my family and added chocolates and the next day by noon they delivered a beautifully done arrangement with delectable chocolates. She was so appreciative and so happy I chose the pink roses. I'll definitely use them again in the future.
5,"I've been on the receiving end of Dancing Dandelion's beautiful floral arrangements.  My husband has used them exclusively for the past 1 1/2 years for Birthday, Anniversary or special occasions.  Each arrangement is unique and beautiful.  The arrangement I recently received for my Birthday is especially nice.  Lots of bright vibrant flowers that are just stunning.  In the past we used Tiger Lily but became increasingly frustrated at what we received for the price. Often the arrangements were very small with very few flowers and lots of filler.  Since we found Dancing Dandelion we couldn't be happier!"
5,"Got the El Paisarito with everything except beans. It's huge (like 2 pounds), and it's only $7.99. The ingredients are good quality, too. Definitely give this place a try."
5,Quite simply the best customer service I've ever experienced. And their floral arrangements are out of this world. Truly spectacular people to do business with!
5,"I am so so sad it look me this long to discover this place. Burger factory is definitely the best burger place in sauga town! Before I get into talking about their delicious burger, let me just say their mouth watering big fat juicy fries are just the best! Don't forget to get their factory sauce on the side, its a match made in heaven! 

So last but not least, their juicy Lucy on fire is foodgasmic. The meat is nice and tender, their huge selection of sauces and toppings make the experience unforgettable. The only thing that can make this burger perfect is if they use cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. 

Overall, its my new favourite burger place, halal never tasted so good!"
5,"I have finally found my place for amazing late night Mexican food! Move over Fillie-B's, I no longer have to tolerate your bland excuse of a burrito. 

El Paisano has a good variety of food from fish & chips to burgers to quesadillas. My favorite item on the menu so far is the California burrito, which is up to par with some of the spots in San Diego I used to frequent. These guys know how to serve quality food at affordable prices and even late at night to serve all your hunger needs at any time."
5,"I left for work at 5 AM on Friday, Feb. 3rd 2017 and noticed Meadow was under the table and not eating his Orijen Six Fish food he loved since 2006. Understanding the average life span for a Lab/Shepherd Mix is 11 years I was concerned. When I came home he was on his therapeutic pet bed and not eaten. He finally did slowly finish it late that night. Saturday the 4th at 2 AM I heard him yell out. I comforted him and he went back to sleep. He rolled off his bed at around noon Saturday and did not move after that. If I said  ""I gotta Vacuum "" he immediately went into the yard and waited. For the first time in his life he not only could not get up , he could not move his rear legs. Meadow contracted SARDS in Jan. 2012 and went blind in a week and was never active after that. I knew it was time. The dreaded moment had arrived. I had heard about a great place called Happy Endings from a co worker. Dr. Fixler arrived with  his Technician arrived at 6:45PM. I was given a very good explanation of what to expect. I felt comfortable having such a competent , experienced and sympathetic crew in my living room during a very difficult time. Meadow was no longer in pain. I received his ashes the following Friday and he will be with me for the rest of my days. If you own a dog , the day may come you see your beloved dog suffering. I will always be grateful my coworker told me about Happy Endings. Thank you for what you do."
5,Local florist with beautiful flowers and friendly helpful staff. I won't go anywhere else!
5,I've drove past this place a thousand times and finally decided to stop. Did not disappoint!! Burger was hot and juicy! Fries were delicious! Drive thru was very polite and super fast! I'll be back and will bring my family with me!
5,I've ordered flowers from them twice and both times they have been professional and a pleasure to work with. the flowers are beautiful and my wife has loved them. Greg had said they probably wouldn't be able to deliver them since my wife works at the airport and they had hundreds of deliveries that day but they were able to walk them to her at her desk. They exceed expectations and I will always buy my flowers from them.
5,"The five stars are because they've been doing their thing, the same way, without any f**s given to changing trends and tastes, since 1932!!

Travel and Leisure magazine has called this one of the world's best sandwiches, Anthony Bourdain has been here and Mordecai Richler wrote about it in the Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz. 

They have a simple menu and rules. Yes, don't forget the rules! 1) they don't cut the sandwich in half, 2) they won't add or remove any ingredient in the sandwich, except cheese. 3) there is no tipping...but if you insist, the money is donated to the heart and stroke foundation.  

I asked the waitress what to order, she was friendly to this outsider and patient with me while I was soaking up 80+ years of history.  I ordered what you should too, the Wilensky special, no cheese (it's the right thing to do) and house made cherry cola. 

The $4.99 iconic sandwich consists of one slice of baloney and four or five slices of salami heated on what seems to be vintage panini grills behind the counter. It's finished with a squeeze of mustard on unique bread, best described as what you get when an english muffin and kaiser have a baby dusted in cornmeal. 

While they do have a couple other menu items, this is what to order when you drop by. I had a second to go, they're small, but flavourful!"
5,"We can't thank Happy Endings enough for taking a miserable situation and making it bearable.  We had known for a while the day was coming when we would have to say goodbye to our sweet Maggie.  The thought of taking her to a cold vet's office and saying our farewells basically in public was awful.  Finding Dr. Fixler was our answer.  Everything was handled gently, sweetly and we felt like he and his assistant truly understood this was a family member, not just a dog.  They were compassionate with her and with us.  We sat on the floor and said our goodbyes as a family. We were able to give Maggie the respect and love she deserved. I can't imagine ever doing this any other way again."
5,"It's 2 a.m. and you've been partying all night, really just going crazy, and now the party is winding down and people are crashing all over your house, which is all fine and dandy, but you realize one thing--you're super hungry. But what's open at this hour? You don't want to go to Denny's or Waffle House, or Jack-in-the-Box, you want something GOOD.
This is the place to be. And not just for those late night munchies--El P's has the best carne asada I've ever had. It's where I go for good Mexican food. Sure, they sell bongs and beer and corner store items, but I'm not about that life--for me it's all about the amazing food in the back."
5,"For years i was paying $109.99 to cox for the highest speed service, than one day a couple of  CenturyLink representatives knock at my door. I talk to them and I decided to give it a try regardless my hesitation. Best move I have made in a long time. My bill now is $33 a month for the same and even better speeds service i was getting from COX. The installer was courteous and in and out my home at a no time. I use the services now for 4 months on my desktop, 5 laptops 5 smartphones, 2 tablets and 2 smart TV's with no problems and only $33 a month. Thank you CenturyLink."
5,Mmmmmmmm goodness gracious! It's ALL delicious What CANT you buy there? Wings......delicious! Burger.....yaaaaaasss! Burrito.......good Lawd
5,"Best store that has ever existed within a 1 mile radius of ASU. They've sold me enough alcohol to intoxicate the entire student population twice by now. Not only that, these guys also have a street-style Mexicali take-out restaurant built-in to the store. That shizz is BOMB and it's not expensive. Nothing here is. They even have good prices on their 420 waterpipes ;) 

Go here."
5,"best pho in chinatown!!! they also have some specialities that are hard to find in other pho places like the omelette and the skewer platter. i'm never disappointed when i get to eat here however............they're closed on wednesdays and ....... sometimes they've been randomly closed on other days too, seemingly without warning!!!!!!! just imagine the crushing sadness when you've been looking forward to a hot bowl of delicious soupyness to find it closed! so i would recommend calling ahead to check they are open."
5,"Love this place!!! Never let's me down. From CA residing in Vegas.. Grew up on this stuff. so having one out here is so great. Food is awesome, fast service!"
5,"Don't let the appearances dissuade - the food is quick, cheap and tasty.  After our ASU tour we were pretty hungry. This is near-ish to the Moxy for take out.  A chimichanga, four tacos and two drinks can be had for under $20.  The food is plentiful too."
5,Another 5 stars for Dancing Dandelion for their excellent service yesterday.  I had to change delivery instructions at the last minute (I felt bad about this but I had no choice).  The lady I was talking to on the phone was very calm and patient.  She told me thay can make changes to my order if I was ok with them substituting pink lillies with white ones.  The arrangement looked fantastic!
5,"This is clearly my most favourite chain franchised burger. The Elm Street restaurant is on a nice quiet, down town street which allows me to enjoy my lunch. Excellent specialty, grass fed, international, beef burgers with a variety of fresh toppings and fresh cut specialty fries that will surely satisfy your hunger. Excellent, knowledgeable and friendly service allows you to continue on with your great day or will put a smile on your face if it's started out less than perfect. Excellent job Jackson's Burger. Keep it up."
5,"They are The Best!!! I rushed over to a different flower place that was closer to me yesterday before the posted closing time on Yelp (6pm), the Flower Garden, and the place was totally empty and obviously out of business. So I rushed over to the next closest place , the Dancing Dandelion, and got there 5 minutes after the same closing time and the woman was just finishing up with a customer and told me not to worry about the closing time. She was super friendly and helpful and I got a beautiful arrangement at a great price. . So go here for flowers and home made chocolates and other gifts."
5,I can't say enough positive things about my experience with Happy Endings.  Dr Fixler made this rough experience as easy as possible. He and his wife are very caring- you can tell this is what they were born to do!
5,I love this place. Open late which is great for late night munchies. The California burrito is FIREEE
5,"Fun place.  
Good comedians (Superstars of Comedy, the show I saw, was hilarious).  
Decently priced drinks.  
Friendly bartenders.  
Get there early so you don't have to stand around while you wait."
5,They had the freshest flowers and were very classy in the creativity and the delivery was quick.
5,Im OBSESSED with the concretes!!!!!!!!! It doesn't get any better!
5,"during my visit the gentleman on grill made my patty very flat, and dry. when i brought this up to the manager Paul he did nothing and when the manager Micayla came up she fixed the problem in a speddy manner. during the time i was forced to go staving and cold becuase the lobby is like -13 degress c
 overall: food 5/10 spicy thang
staff 7.3/10 spicy thang
tv screens 10/10
will happly come again"
5,On the way to see my mom at hospital and stopped to ask for a wrap for a pot and the gentleman at this flower shop was so gracious and helped me out. Will definitely send business this way!
5,"I fell in love with this restaurant after my Vietnamese friends first took me there. This becomes my regular stop whenever I crave nem nuong (sweet pork wrap with vermicelli). It's simply amazing with their seafood dipping sauce mixed with peanut. I don't have high expectation on service at any Asian places, so I'm pretty happy with their not too pro service."
5,"Happy Endings is a wonderful, wonderful service. From the moment I made that phone call and talked to Alicia I knew I was making the right decision and had to use Dr. Fixler . Dr. Fixler and his technician Briana (?) were professional, compassionate, and understanding. He was loving, kind and gentle with my sweet, sweet Kelcie. I would never want my animal to go any other way and I have to thank Happy Endings from the bottom of my heart. Kelcie was surrounded by people that loved her in an environment she was comfortable in. Thank you."
5,"This team was amazing.  They were professional and very compassionate.  They really seem to care for both the animal and the grieving owners.  They explain very thoroughly and my beloved dog passed quickly and painlessly.  Though the worst day of my life, they made the terrible day, bearable.  Though it was the hardest decision to make, it was the right one, and Happy Endings was the right choice."
5,Those guys there are so friendly and they have great food! Huge contrast from Maryland.
5,"Get the special with swiss along with a chocolate egg cream. Very tasty! 

Super friendly staff, as well."
5,I really don't understand these terrible reviews.  I've had a couple of disappointments with Centurylink...but they've always fixed them right away.  They've pulled through for me every time and right away.  Their customer service has been polite and efficient.  Installation was quick and professional.  Billing has not been a problem for me and the internet is unbelievable!  It's lightening fast!!!  No problems here for me at all.  I've got nothing bad to say about them.
5,"I love this place so much. It really does feel like going back in time. There aren't many places that can do just one thing, and do that thing well. 

The service is friendly but to the point. This isn't a place you spend hours at. Just walk in, take a seat at the bar, and order a special, a milk cream (cola is delicious!) and some pickles. Be sure to add a little extra mustard if that's your kind of thing. 

Don't ask for your special to be cut in half, or for any special requests. Just accept that this place has been around almost 85 years, making the same specials, and maybe the way they do things is for a reason."
5,This was our second visit to The Comedy Bar to see Catch 23. It was another great show; without a doubt the best improv we've seen. We were laughing to stitches again. The show is only $10 which is a bargain! The bar prices are also very good and you can get food there too. The online booking is very easy to use and the staff are efficient and friendly. This is some of the best value entertainment you can get!
5,"This flower shop is the place to go if you need anything floral.  The owner Greg has been amazing the past few years, and those who work for him are knowledgeable, kind, and very helpful."
5,I love their party melts and be sure to get heir fry sauce with their classic shoestring fries
5,"So glad I came here for lunch while in town. I ran the gamut on pickles, hand crafted cream soda, karnatzels, and a couple of Wilensky Specials with cheese. I think the only thing on the menu I didn't eat is a hot dog. The staff and even the patrons were all very friendly and welcoming. Nothing special but done perfectly which is what has made them great for so many years. I might have to try and recreate some specials back home in the states."
5,"First time visiting this place. I loved it! The cheeseburgers were delicious and my fries were perfectly fried. I hope it's always that way! The girl who waited on me at the window was very nice and welcoming. I will certainly be returning, I'll have to add a shake next time!"
5,"Space:

I love it.  While I agree with the reviews that it is confusing and exclusive to newcomers, once I figured out the layout I realized it's pretty intuitive. 

To the right, there are couches and a few tables, it's a very ""hangout"" oriented atmosphere.  You get the feeling that the people here are almost always here.

In the centre is the bar -- the way it's located allows for a lot of bar space.  Lots of stools and places to eat the pub food.

To the left there is a narrow hallway, leading to a curtain and the theatre.  This is great, in my opinion; the show goes on nearly unbeknownst to the happenings in the bar.  The theatre is small, cozy.  The seats are all on the same incline, and the stage is ever-so-slightly raised, so it can be a little hard to see.  Harder to see are the chairs themselves if pass through the curtain once the show has started.

Despite any shortcomings, it is a very cozy, intimate and awesome place.  I feel that a lot of the biggest detractors of this venue may not see it for what it is -- a kind of alt-comedy stomping grounds.  It isn't the polished club they were expecting, but it doesn't want to be.

Shows:

One of my favourite things about Comedy Bar is the semi-regular schedule, especially the  Harold Tuesday 5$, House Wednesday 10$.  I frequent both, and both are great (Wednesday's better).  The closing team on Wednesday nights, Standards and Practices, are amazing.

Food:

Drinks are reasonably priced (protip: KLB Raspberry Wheat on tap).  The pub food is better than your average pub-food.  In fact, it borders on real food.  Tuesday is wing night.  I have not tried any of the flat bread pizzas, but I overheard other frequenters raving about them.  That seems like a good sign?

Rating:

5 Stars.  I love this joint.  I'm going tonight."
5,Came with friends that had burgers and Philly cheese steak. They enjoyed it. I had a poutine which was seriously good. You have to try that. Too much gravy though lol. Cheese is good and fries are too. The seating isn't bad but the restaurant itself isn't in the best shape. They are busy most of the time. It feels like a hygienic place and I liked my first experience.
5,"that's my second time here watching Catch23 improv show. 
It's amazingly funny and witty show with new teams all the time. totally worth coming for that. 
the location of the bar is great - close to many bars and restaurants."
5,"Family owned & operated. Wonderful people, offering a spectacular sandwich. Crusty bread lathered with mustard, expertly seasoned salami & bologna and oozy Swiss cheese all pressed flat. (Can be ordered with cheddar or without cheese.)

The storefront & interior capture a style and warmth that is hard to find these days. You feel like you've stepped back in time and it feels great."
5,"Received an arrangement from them for my birthday, it was gorgeous! Susie was really helpful in making it exactly what I would want...so I just wanted to say thank you, and I absolutely loved it!"
5,"El Paisanos is the definition college town convenient store.  El Paisanos has everything you can possibly need in college from drinks, alcohol, munchies, and burritos!  The burritos are AMAZING!  They are huge, taste so fresh and are made fresh right in front of you. 

If I had one concern about El Paisanos it's that sometimes I feel they just make up the price of items.  There has been many times where I'll buy the same thing but pay a different amount then I usually do.  But hey, this is a sketchy little store right next to ASU so you can't expect perfection!  

Try them out!  

Return factor- 100%"
5,"I called in today to have a last minute delivery sent for a special occasion. They were so sweet and happily prepared my order and had it delivered within a couple of hours. The arrangement was stunning and exactly as pictured. I'll definitely order from here again. 
Great customer service and fast delivery! Worth the price!"
5,They did an amazing job!! Far better than I expected. I was obsessed with my flower arrangement. I ordered the dog in a basket! It was so beautiful!!
5,Absolutely love this place! I went in for dinner and the whole entire staff complimented my hair. I felt so welcome and at home at this store. Whoever is the manager should give the employees a pat on the back. Food is delicious as well
5,The tacos here are excellent also the chimichanga Gotta Have It excellent this is not a sit-down type of restaurant is the little store with the Mexican food stand in the back of it
5,"Oh this shop is an absolute dream to work with. I had Dancing Dandelion do the flowers for my wedding. I really didn't have much of a vision, so I told Dan a little of what I wanted and gave him creative license. I'm so happy I did! My flowers turned out absolutely gorgeous and just added beautifully to my special day. 

The prices are reasonable and everyone I worked with at the shop was wonderful to work with. I would definitely use them again for any occasion that required flowers."
5,"The food here is the bomb. Freshly prepared, huge portions, and delicious, and always served with a big smile. The store itself has a lot stuff available, and the guys who run it are really friendly."
5,"Great little spot. Free range beef, with an awesome variety of toppings. Get the special which is a daily burger. You Tegucigalpa two for the price of one. Taste wise it's right up there top 5 in Toronto. I got the Burrogi, which has a potato thing in it. Can't wait to go back."
5,Greg and his team prepared such beautiful and elegant flowers and arrangements for our wedding.  He worked very closely with my wife and everything went off without a hitch! Planning a wedding is such a stressful time and Greg certainly helped us get through it with flying colors!!!  Thank you so much Greg..... you are the best florist ever!!!!
5,"I just had CenturyLink services installed in my Seven Hills/Henderson home and am very, Very happy. (I saw all the bad reviews here and felt I owed it to CenturyLink to share my good experience.)

Earlier this week, a Century Link rep knocked on my door to pitch me on services. After quizzing him about internet speeds and the cost for internet + a good premium channels package, I invited him in. I ended up signing up for bundled services of 10M of internet + Prism Premium TV (includes tons of digital channels + HBO, Showtime, STARZ, Cinemax, Encore, plus all On Demand) with DVR for two TVs, all for $140/month. (If I hadn't wanted Premium, there were three other packages and all were very nicely priced.)

The installation guy made quick work of things today. The whole system is wireless; the guide and remote are easy to use; and the internet is good (14MB -- about the same speed I was from Cox on slow days even though I was *paying* for 25MB). Also, there is no channel-change delay (something that drove me nuts with Cox if I wanted to quickly flip back and forth between two channels). In addition, the CenturyLink DVR boxes let you watch and/or record 4 shows at a time. And with the Prism TV app you can watch TV on any device in your house (laptop, iPad, iPhone, etc.)

My monthly Cox bill was $210 and I was only getting HBO and Showtime -- so bottom line, I'm saving $70/month and getting more premium channels and solid internet service. And I got a $100 Am Ex gift card for signing up (the online registration for that was easy).

I highly recommend CenturyLink and would advise you to call my very nice sales rep -- who is also the area General Manager -- who is with a company called Provision, an authorized CenturyLink reseller. His name is Bobby Lyman and his direct line/cell is 321-265-2004. (He used to live in Orlando, so that's a Florida area code -- but he lives in Vegas now.)

UPDATE ON 4/6/14:  I see that some of the negative reviews/complaints are based on (1) installation fee disputes, (2) issues with prices, and prices going up after a year and (3) customer service issues when canceling. It's certainly possible that some sales reps are not as honest as others, but my sales rep Bobby (1) waived all the installation fees, (2) informed me that service rates were promotional for 1 year and would increase by about $20/month in a year (still cheaper than Cox), and (3) gave me his cell number to make sure I get good customer service (which I assume is good for him as a rep of the company).

UPDATE ON 4/9/14:  Wanted to add a note now that I have had service for four days. The internet is streaming well above 10M most of the time -- averaging 14/15M -- and the TV service has been great including quick download times for On Demand shows. Very happy.

UPDATE ON 8/4/14:  Because I'm now working from home, I went back to Cox for high speed internet service (50MB) for my business as of July -- but I am happily staying with PrismTV. I love having ALL the premium channels in digital. (Also, when I called Century Link to see whether I could pay for faster internet speeds and was pretty disappointed to find out that I couldn't because it's not available in my area, the service rep took another $20/month off my bill through the end of my contract. All in all, while I feel bad for those who say they have gotten poor customer service from Century Link, I myself have gotten very good service.)"
5,This place is amazing. They serve food until 4am Thursday-Saturday and 3am Sunday-Wednesday. These tacos are amazing. And you get SO MUCH in them! My friend also got the veggie burrito and I swear it weighed over a pound! I will definitely be back!
5,"I have to admit I paused for a minute.  I was in search of a good lunch and was looking for a fish and chips place.  Instead I found this place located in a strip mall.  What gave me pause was a man of middle eastern descent was yelling at two ladies with covered faces to stay in the van.  You go inside and most of the patrons are clearly Muslim.   You look at the menu and the food here is Halal, so the customer base begins to make sense.  

They didn't seem disturbed by this Roman Catholic coming in for some chow so it was cool.  Never thought I would see a Halal burger joint but here it is.  I ordered a Juicy Lucy with fries.  Ground beef is fresh and is pressed on the griddle, fries are hand cut.  So when you get your meal, the fries are hot and somewhat limp the way hand cut fries should be, burger takes a while to make but when you get it, hot and juicy.  They also sell funnel cakes which I passed on.  To be honest, this is among the best burger and fries I've ever eaten.  Allah has certainly blessed my plate the day I ate here and I can't wait to come back and have more.

It's true, the best way to build a community is through food."
5,"They were open late on the evening before Valentine's Day, and had plenty of beautiful product to pick up. Great Flowers! Great service!"
5,"Totally sensitive to the circumstances involved with letting a pet go, Dr. Fixler and his wife were the epitome of compassion.   Very calming and painless for our German Shepherd Niko who was suffering from DM. It is so difficult to decide to stop the suffering and choosing Happy Endings made it more peaceful and removed the stress of in clinic care.  We love our pets and they do too and it shows.  Thank you so much."
5,Bigggg f*ing burritos for a very reasonable price.. $6-7$.. best mexican next to ASU.
5,"Awesome spot. I attended an improv show on a Thursday night. It was $5 a person to get in (cheap!) and the show was HILARIOUS. That had a great selection of beers, mixed drinks and some tasty snacks (wings etc). I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours on a ""school night"".  Everyone in attendance was welcoming and friendly and the staff were too!

I no longer live in Toronto and checking out a venue like this really made me miss the great activities Toronto has to offer."
5,Ordered some flowers for a funeral from CA to LV & they arrived in time for the viewing which was the same day.
5,I have been wanting to try this place and it was better than I thought it would be! The Orange chicken and beef plates were so yummy! Definitely coming back here! Everything was fresh
5,Wow!!!!!! Amazing! Burrito is bigger than my head. I can't believe it. This is the best place ever.
5,Excellent food if your seeking Vietnamese food on Spadina. The staff are very friendly and hard working.
5,"Yesterday we had to say goodbye by to our German Sheppard after 14 years.  He was our family dog and grew up with our children who are now in college.  As anyone who has had to do this knows, the experience is painful and difficult.  But having the compassionate and kind Dr. Fixler and  Grace help our beloved dog out of his pain and suffering in the comfort of his home surrounded by the family he loved and trusted is far superior to the cold, sterile and most times scary environment of the Vets office.  Our dog Nero, was completely relaxed. He simply closed his eyes, and drifted off to sleep.  This was the best way we could say goodbye to him. Thank you Dr. Fixler and Grace."
5,"I called Dancing Dandelion with a last minute corsage request.  I needed two, within hours.  Greg (I'm pretty sure that was his name) was very friendly, and talked me through the options while I was on the phone. And within 3 hours, my two BEAUTIFUL corsages were ready and waiting.  They had some arrangements pre-made in their display that were a match in quality and freshness that were also very tempting!  Thanks Dancing Dandelion!!!"
5,"Absolutely Perfect!!! I lived in Japan for several years and this easily became one of my favorite restaurants. When I found out they had one here in Las Vegas I had to try it out. When I had my first bowl, I could swear I was back in Japan. I taste just like it does over there. So they don't make it the way most Americans would like it! Good! I like it better that way. Sure they have some different things one the menu here that they would never eat in Japan, but the important thing is that it is just as good as the GYUDON in good ole Japan."
5,Best hole in the wall mexican food in tempe
5,Still the best. It's amazing how they can make such a simple sandwich taste like the best thing you've ever eaten.
5,Fast and friendly service. Orders are always served correctly. Get phased on the patty melt.
5,"Been to this place a couple fo times and I've yet to be disappointed.  Plenty of parking in the back and it's easy to find from the road.  Great atmosphere, delicious food and the wait-staff has always been friendly.  Highly recommend the BBQ nachos and the House Specialty Cocktails are also very good.  This is a great place for any size group and ideal for splitting lots of different dishes so everyone can try everything!"
5,"Amazing place. The burritos are huge and awesome. I had the steak El Paisano burrito, which includes two thick tortilla shells with cheese in between like a quesodilla. It weighed in at 2 lbs, but could have been heavier had I not deleted the rice. And it was really good.

They sell pretty much everything a college student needs to survive. 

The guys who work there are friendly and seem genuinely appreciative to have you there as a customer. Great business. 

I'll be back tomorrow if I've finished my burrito by then."
5,"My mom was in this hospital for a hip fracture and the staff was amazing. they did everything  they could to make her comfortable. the staff really spent time with her and always had a smile. the director of nursing, Lorna, is incredible. She lead a great staff. I would wholeheartedly recommend this hospital."
5,"Long time patron of CB. This review is a long time coming. It's my go-to for comedy in the city. Cheap and cheerful drinks with a good selection of top shelf vodka and bourbon, great draft selection, good snack menu made fresh w good ingredients not weird fake food or prepackaged garbage. So many amazing festivals, shows and classes. I've done em all. People are casual and friendly and FUNNY. I like."
5,"Would rate higher if we could.  Dr. Fixler and his assistant came highly recommended from a couple of people who had to use his services.  There is no need to go with anyone else.  Dr. Fixler was extremely professional, courteous and genuine.  No need to write anything else that hasn't been written already.  He took a sad moment and made it very.....peaceful.  Do what's right by your fur baby and spend a few extra bucks for the peace of mind and calm that he brings during such a difficult time."
5,Been eating this stuff since I was a lil girl. Love it. This Vegas location has a good crew. Alfonsina is a sweetheart :)
5,"My husband, sister and I LOVE this place! The burgers are delicious and I am pretty much addicted to the fry sauce! The customer service is always amazing as well!"
5,"I could not have imagined a more respectful compassionate, beautiful transition for my cat. There was no anxiety for her, no pain only a sweet release.  Dr. Fixler was awesome."
5,Called them to order flowers for someone staying in their city and they were super helpful and fun to talk to. I will definitely give them more business should the opportunity arise.
5,"Came in and requested a custom arrangement of specific flowers, colors and budget. The finished product delivered was an absolute MASTERPIECE! Thank you guys so much for working very diligently and creating such a beautiful arrangement! Will only be coming to you guys for my flower needs from now!"
5,"I didn't think their would be anything positive to come from this situation, but I can honestly say that the positive part of it all was Happy Endings, from start to finish, they were incredible.  I had to put down my 16 year old dog, Sadie.  I was devastated at the thought of this but knew she was suffering and in incredible pain, and keeping her around was starting to become selfish, knowing how things could turn out very gruesome for her in the final stages of kidney failure.  Before making the call, I was just dealing with it, but once I had to set the appointment, I LOST IT.  Dr Fixler's wife was so comforting to me, and talked me through the process so I knew exactly what was going to happen.  I don't think I stopped crying in the 2 days after that leading up to it.  When the day arrived, I was an emotional WRECK, but Dr. Fixler and his nurse were so comforting and calming, and after examining Sadie, reassured my mom and I that we were doing the right thing for her.  The fact that is was done in home, not on a cold vet table, but where Sadie (AND I) felt most comfortable is so awesome.  I asked the Doctor is I could play music and he of course said yes (i wanted her to fall asleep to a nice peaceful Sam Smith song), and I was able to hold her, hug her, kiss her, right up until the end, and they didn't administer the final medication until I was fully ready.  Sadie didn't feel a thing and was so relaxed and comfortable, thanks to the sedative they administer before the medication that I have heard is not always given in emergency or veterinary office cases.  They were so thorough in their goal of making sure this would be painless for my baby, they even tested the catheter before injecting the medication so they knew it was in her vein.  I had heard HORROR stories about people putting their dogs to sleep, and also about people not doing so and their dogs dying in pain and suffering, and I am so happy I was able to give my dog a final gift of a peaceful and painless sleep.  On top of it all, today I received a heartfelt letter and poem with my dogs print on it that I was promised, and will cherish that forever.  I would recommend Happy Endings to ALL of my friends and family and still cant believe that such a sad negative thing could be such a positive experience.  I really felt at peace after it was over, and I am not sure I would have felt that way had we done with another route.  I just have to say that if you are faced with this decision, and you want to have the best possible experience in this scenario... CALL HAPPY ENDINGS.  It is 120% worth it in the end."
5,"Amazing food, get that bang for your buck. The cooks are super chill, don't let the fact it's a hole in the wall fool you. Everyone knows the hole is wall spots produce some of the best food and this is definetly one of them!"
5,Food was very good. I'm not a big fan of the small frys but that won't stop me from coming back to try the hot dog.
5,"Thinly sliced and seasoned bologna and salami between a perfectly toasted roll with a hint of mustard and melted America. cheese. The Special is one of best sandwiches in Montreal. 

We were served by the current owner Sharon, who clearly has a love of the establishment and chatted with us about its history. Wilensky's is everything you want in no frills dining."
5,Gave birth at this hospital and every nurse in the labor and delivery department was so friendly and caring. My baby was born 6 weeks early and the ladies in the special care nursery have been doing a wonderful job of taking care of him so he can come home with us soon. Very attentive and caring staff.
5,"OMG when you go hunting for that late night burrito look no further. Don't let the convenience store front throw you off, nestled inside alongside the bottles of booze and baseball caps for sale you will find the best little burrito kitchen around campus. Had a California burrito that was amazing!"
5,"This might be my new favorite store in the world.  If I had gone to school at ASU, my financial support alone would have made this place a goldmine for the owner.  They make a really good burrito, and sell everything a college kid could ever crave, without the mark up. So lucky to have stumbled upon this spot. Thanks, Yelp"
5,"I'm hungry even thinking about the food I had. I did wait longer than I thought I should've, probably because the place was packed, but it was well worth it."
5,"I am typing this with tears in my eyes but I couldn't not write something about these amazing people. I can't imagine doing this day after day but the love Dr. Fixler has for animals is so great that he wants each one to experience a peaceful passing without suffering in sickness and/or pain. We had called this company when one of our 4 dogs unexpectedly fell ill on New Year's Eve and Dr. Fixler was so kind and talked us through the entire process as this was the first time I had ever had to go through it. My beloved Patrick went quietly with his whole pack beside him. Our sweet Bella had been battling liver failure for a year and after the loss of her best friend, Patrick, she was rapidly succumbing to the disease. I didn't hesitate for a second when we realized Bella's time was no longer ""quality"" and she seemed to struggling through so much. Dr. Fixler and his assistant, Shelby arrived to our home and once again they showed such compassion and spoke such kind words and put us at peace along with our Bella. Even though losing two of our pets was one of the most difficult things my family and I have had to experience, having someone like Happy Endings with Dr. Fixler and his team to be there to help you through it, is a real blessing. We will be forever grateful for your service in our time of sadness."
5,"The Bacon burger was big and juicy and the fries here are really good. They go great with the shakes/blizzards here which are called concretes. I've only tried one but it was awesome. Last time we went through the drive thru and we thought it was pretty quick but the lady at the register apologized for the ""wait."" That's good customer service in my eyes. I would highly recommend this location to everyone!"
5,"This is a classic for me I grew up in this stuff..ok so I'm thinking the bad reviews are because people don't know how to eat here so here let me help you out..

Large beef bowl 
(Add chilli.powder,ginger, and soy sauce)

Clam chowder is a must 

If you're really hungry get some sesame chicken wings that is all"
5,"My grandfather took my dad when he was a kid, and now he takes us. He tells us that this place hasn't ever changed, and I agree. The walls are filled with magazine articles and pictures, and the stools at the counter look pretty much the same. There's only one thing that people  order, the Special, a salami and bologna sandwich with mustard. Yes, you have to take the mustard, there's even a sign saying that. You can order one of their fountain sodas, and get a side of pickles. This place has a crazy charm to it. The waiters are very friendly, and the food is always very quick and tasty. This place is definitely a Montreal classic."
5,"Officially my favourite Viet spot in Chinatown! This family-run restaurant serves up a mean pho, along with super flavourful meats in their rice and vermicelli dishes. Really hits the spot if you are looking for a filling and relatively ""healthier"" meal on Spadina.

Keep in mind that like many restaurants in Chinatown, this places is closed on Wednesdays."
5,"The food and service is amazing.  The best burritos I've had, with the best prices.   With the addition of alcohol to the available products, it just makes this place even better."
5,"Yesterday we needed the services of Dr. Fixler to put to rest our cat Smokey, as he was terrified to go to the vet. The doctor and his assistant made a very sad and difficult time a lot easier for us and Smokey, who passed away in his favorite napping spot in the house and it was very peaceful and painless for him.
Thank you so much for offering this service Dr Fixler, we have others in our pet family and will be seeing you again, hopefully not for quite a while!"
5,Had a great hamburger there and service was excellent would highly recommend. And be sure to try the ice cream shakes.
5,"I decided to have my 16 year old Heeler cross put down at home.  I cannot imagine euthanizing a dog any other way.  Dr. and Mrs. Fixler could not have been more caring, understanding and professional.  Their service really helped us through a tough time.  When the time comes, do yourself and your pet a favor and call Dr. Fixler."
5,"Alas, it was time for me to say goodbye to my elderly cat Lucy. I was blessed to have her in my life for over 17 years after adopting her via HALO. She had been diagnosed by my wonderful vet a couple of months ago with kidney failure, and had been holding steady on prescription canned food. But then she started throwing up her meals and eventually just stopped eating altogether. I knew it was time to call Dr. Fixler at Happy Endings, as there was no way that I wanted my fur baby's last hours to be made worse by a car ride (she hated those) and in the vet's office (disliked those visits as well, like most cats). I contacted Happy Endings on a Friday eve, and Alicia was great at getting back to me the next morning. Their communication is excellent as they call you the morning of the appointment to confirm, and then again when they are on their way to your home. They were very gently with my old gal, and the calm atmosphere and their respectful demeanor meant a lot. Thank you."
5,"My family and I knew that our Lab mix couldn't make it to the vet & she was always so terrified going anyway even for routine appts. I heard of Happy Endings from a local vet & feel so blessed to have learned of them. Dr. Michael and his staff were 100% compassionate, professional & they provided such a warm environment for us and Mandy. Thank you Happy Endings from the bottom of our hearts!"
5,"Sending your pet to the Rainbow Bridge is never an easy decision let alone task, but Dr. Fixler and his team will get you through it--one step at a time.  The entire service is top notch and professional. The initial phone call,  the house visit, the package in the mail--they truly take care of everything.  Dr. Fixler and his team arrived and explained the entire process, what to expect, and next steps.  He was very accommodating-- allowing me to hold my fur baby until his last breath.  He and his assistant stepped outside, giving us some final moments with our beloved cat. We let our dogs come in and sniff Tiger, so they knew he was no longer part of their pack (recommended by Dr. Fixler).  After we said goodbye, we received his paw print in the mail shortly thereafter. (there is also an option to keep the cremation remains).

This service is just wonderful.  Because they come to you, you have the comforts of your home which is less stressful for you and your pet.  I highly recommend Dr. Fixler and his team.

RIP Tiger, 1/2/2018"
5,"This is no light lunch especially if you take down three of their special salami sandwiches.  Absolutely to die for pressed sandwich with mustard was mouth watering.  I could go back every day.  After you are through there, walk a block up the street to Fairmont Bagel for one of the best bagels you will ever have.  You may need a three hour walk after leaving that block but a can't miss in Montreal.  And don't forget to order one of their custom sodas, cherry coke, Creme soda, etc..to wash down your salami."
5,"The Thursday Burgerrito is everything. 

Beef patty, avocado explosion, salsa, sour cream, lettuce, and dusted onions make for an amazing burger. $10 for two is a great deal, considering the burgers usually cost $10 each and the avocado explosion as a separate add-on is $5 on its own. (I know, I know. Things are priced a certain way to make deals more compelling. Consider me compelled.) On top of the specials, you can add however many of their free toppings: tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, relish, spinach, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, and cucumber. The burgers are already quite tall, but I like to add spinach and tomatoes.

I will not refute what others have said about the small buns. This is true. They are kind of pathetic relative to the rest of the burger. A bigger, crispier, toasted bun would do wonders. 

And yes, the layout of the store is appalling. It's one of those setups where you pay and then don't really know where to stand. No one knows whether you're in line or waiting for your burger. And service is slow, even when I'm the only one there. It's also small enough that I wouldn't want to eat-in. It'd be too noisy and cramped, and I don't like the feeling of people hovering over me as I eat.

However, I maintain, the burgers taste great. I don't know that I would ever buy their burgers at full price, but that's what makes their varied deals so great. 

Aside from the Burgerrito, I've tried Monday's Canada, Eh (beef, fried egg, bacon, fried cheese, mayo) and Saturday's Burogie (beef, potato latke, coleslaw, sour cream, lettuce) and was impressed by both, but more so by the Burogie. The crispy deep fried latke added an amazing crunch to the burger that I didn't know I wanted. 

Their fries are their biggest weakness as both times I've gotten them, they were soggy. The onion rings were better, but I feel like you don't get enough.

The Nutella Heaven Shake (Nutella, banana, frozen yogurt & coconut milk) is great if you like Nutella because I watched them scoop giant spoons of Nutella out of a bucket into the blender, so don't worry; you get plenty of Nutella. 

I'd definitely recommend getting burgers here. For a complete meal, I'd grab my burger and walk to the McDonald's down the street for fries and a drink."
5,Great lunch break and easy to take out. Eat while you walk and so much better than a hot dog or hamburger.
5,Been back numerous times now. Still great brisket. Added a great fried chicken. Love it!
5,"I ordered a spray for my wife on our anniversary......I was not sure what to expect since I did not see samples in person; so, I just went with the recommendations and hoped for the very best.

OMG!!!  The BEST was certainly delivered....my wife is beyond thrilled and all at her office are envious.....as the receptionist said, ""all the other men look bad now and need to step up their game"".....haha!!!

Thank you to everybody at Dancing Dandelion...you were beyond belief and I will never hesitate to use the shop again and recommend it to anybody in need of florals.....amazing!!!"
5,We went for happy hour and had the fabulous pork nachos and garlic wings and Masthead drafts. Austin was a terrific bartender - the best we've had there. Five star experience all around!
5,"We cannot say enough about the wonder service Happy Endings provided our family.  We struggled to make our decision and from the moment we called the entire staff was so supportive and understanding.  Having them come to our home made all the difference for us and our dog.  She layed right by the front door, her favorite spot and was no longer in pain.  They were compassionate and took time to explain every process.  They were so gentle with her and they helped reassure us that we were making the right decision.  I used to work at a hospice and the service this group provides is just like that.  Thank you all for your help with Marley."
5,Super awesome place! Bouquet I ordered was exactly like the picture BOTH times and prices are not to high. Delivery was done first thing in morning. I highly recommend this place.
5,"Still my favourite place for authentic Vietnamese noodles. I absolutely love this place because the moment you walk inside, you smell the herbs and spices that are brewed in the beef broth and the delicious meat. 

We always have ordered the usual. Fresh rolls, and Tai Pho. Raw beef pho with extra noodles ! They use a different shape rice noodle compared to the usual flat type a lot of places use. The broth has a fresh, healthy and crisp taste. It isn't over powering and isn't too fatty or rich. 

Make sure to have a Vietnamese coffee as well. This will keep you ready to go all day/ night haha. Strong and aromatic flavour. 

We have tried their ""do it yourself "" fresh rolls platters too, that are skewers of various kinds of meat. Our favourite is the beef wrapped in exotic leaves. That has an amazing flavour explosion, the platter comes with fresh bean sprouts, basil, mint, chilli peppers, rice wrappers , noodles and of course the meat.

The family owned business is friendly and great service, perfect place! Could seriously eat here everyday . 

Anytime your on Spadina stop by, and don't forget they aren't open Wednesday's. but rest of the days are good to go! And have CASH!!!"
5,"I had the perch dinner. Was excellent with mango Tatar sauce. Macaroni and Cheese unbelievable.  Peggy was our server.  She couldn't have been nicer, patient, efficient and absolutely delightful.  Love this place!"
5,"If I died this may be heaven. Burritos, bongs, beers. What's not to like? I had the California burrito. It was the size of a large indoor cactus or a very small outdoor cactus. I enjoyed it greatly. The fries fit perfectly. Only thing that would make it better was guac. Otherwise, perfect experience."
5,"You would never know that there is an amazing Mexican restaurant inside of this store! It looks like a little market with miscellaneous items, but it turns out there is everything inside. I love to get a burrito and my friends love the quesadillas. Such good food along with an awesome cultural experience! :)"
5,"One of the things I miss most about Montreal.

Does one thing, and does it well, without any pretense to being anything else.

They also serve a mean egg cream soda (n.b. contains no actual egg or cream)."
5,"If you are looking for flowers in Vegas, this is the place to go. I had a complete disaster on my hands with 1-800-FLOWERS and these guys rescued me. The staff I spoke to on the phone was awesome and very helpful. Not to mention the fact that they had my Valentine's Day order delivered before 9am on Valentine's Day! Thank you so much again and you'll be getting my business again in the future."
5,"I had heard about Wilensky's LIght Lunch for quite awhile before stopping by on a recent trip. Friends had suggested that Moishe's and Schwartz's are the typical go-to spots, but that Wilensky's does something completely different. Upon completing my first trip, I couldn't agree more. 

This is a small restaurant, a shop made up of only ten stools, four to five people working the counter doing their respective job, and that's it. Since it has been open for eighty years, you can see signs all over the wall for what their signature salami sandwich has cost over the years. 

The owner suggested the salami sandwich with swiss over the one with cheddar, but I tried both (and confirmed her suggestion). It's a thick-cut salami that reminded me more of bologna and it's served on a cornmeal based bread with a tiny dab of yellow mustard on it. The sandwiches are small, but given their price of $4, it's a fair deal and two made for a full meal for me. I washed it down with a chocolate egg cream, a true delight not nearly served enough these days. 

It's a cheap, solid lunch that hit the spot and would my go to suggestion for Montreal visitors looking for a lunch-time taste of the city."
5,"A simple sandwich at its best! Definitely get it with a side of pickles, and add a fresh mixed soda if you're looking for a real throwback to childhood."
5,I grew up on this place and love this food. Straight up large beef bowl or large combo to go. Im there!
5,"Came by for Sunday Night Live. Talented cast and pretty decent material considering they do this thing once a week. Happy at the length of the show. Clocked in at under 1.5 hours. That's a nice chunk of time for whatever the paltry ticket price was ($8?).
Was every sketch funny? No, of course not. But the team worked well together, the passion was there, and I appreciated the show. Would come back again."
5,Awesome food!  Everything is seasoned great. Skinny cut French fries. Good price. Just be prepared to wait a little longer for your food because they cook it to order. Worth the wait for sure!
5,I stopped in at 9am this morning (opens at 10) and peeked in and met the owner. I desperately needed a last minute corsage and no one could do it. I spoke with Greg and he was so incredibly kind. He made me a corsage with roses and orchids right on the spot! Great customer service and I highly recommend this flower shop. They are a great local business.
5,"Probably The Best drunk/hangover burrito in Tempe! Only have ever ordered delivery but given that, everything has been perfectly delivered. Wish I could get a beverage delivered though"
5,"On October 30th 2017 we had to make the right decision for our beloved pitbull Oreo due to aggressive  cancer . Dr Fixler and his assistant came out quickly and they were amazing. They took great care of her and us.. they let us spend as much time as we wanted to say good bye to our baby. They even didn't mind our other pets around to say  good bye to their sister.. They are amazing. I will recommend them to everyone.

Thank you so much Dr. Fixler

 ( I already did that same week for a friend of mine where her dog too had stomach cancer)"
5,"It was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. I was a little confused about the toppings so I had a plain cheese burger, but my first mouthful was AMAZING! The meat was juicy and you could taste the quality of the meat and the cheese blended in for that perfect.. it was just amazing.

I got a small fry and when it came to the table it was way bigger than I expected and they were cooked to that perfect chip stand brown and lightly salted! It was pretty amazing.

I don't know if it was because I was starving or because I really wanted a burger but it was definitely better than I expected from such a small space."
5,"Best burrito in Tempe. If you are wondering what to order, it is all great. I love the torta and fries, the california burrito, the carne asada fries! If you are near campus and want to get some good mexican food for cheap, El Paisano is the place. This place is way better than Filiberto's"
5,"Oooooh! My dad just ordered a bouquet to be sent to me this morning and it's already here, an hour later. I love stargazers and even though the arrangement didn't come with them, they added a few anyway :) yayyyy! Thank you! 

And the quality of the flowers is perfect and fresh and beautiful. 

Loves!"
5,"Wilensky's is Montreal nostalgia and heritage at its finest. It has been in business since 1932 and is very much a family run business. If you have ever read Mordecai Richler's ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"" then you will relate to this lunch counter from a bygone era. It is a relic from the days when the Main was the area where Jewish families settled, lived and ran businesses. Most have moved on, however, Wilensky's remains.

The menu is simple and straight forward. The special is an all-beef salami/bologna sandwich with light mustard served on a bun, on top of a single napkin (no plate) price $4.70, no tipping. All specials contain mustard. They also serve cokes, cherry colas and cream sodas made from syrup, old fashioned style, mixed in front of you, at the counter. There are pickles and assorted sausages available as well. The sign says light lunch and this is precisely what it is, more or less an excellent snack, and no frills. 

The ambiance is definitely unique. There are about 6-8 stools at a lunch counter. The walls are plastered with newspaper clippings and articles from decades passed. There are photos of famous people who have stopped in. My eye caught one with Anthony Bourdain from CNN. There is also a book shelf that sells second hand books and CD's for a buck.  I actually found some incredible CD's here. Anytime that I am in the Plateau/Mile End district I stop by Wilensky's for a special and nostalgic blast from the past of a Montreal I remember not so long ago. Classic experience!"
5,"On the morning of July 11, 2018, I took my husband to the ER at Abrazo Arrowhead Campus because he was having severe abdominal pains related to his Stave IV metastatic pancreatic cancer. We sincerely appreciate what Dr. Kevin Haselhorst and the staff did for us that day. The quality of care and the attention my husband received were excellent.

There was no wait time. We were attended to immediately. Then after my husband was treated and given something for the pain, Dr. Haselhorst sat by his side and spoke calmly and straightforward about the options available going forward, and assured my husband that he's the one in charge of making any decisions. He can continue with the various treatments and procedures or he can decide to stop. My husband said he's definitely ready to be done with this, and has felt that way for a while. The Doctor assured him there is courage in letting go, and gave him some contact information and a prescription for evaluation for home-based comfort care.

Doctor Haselhorst and his staff were very caring and compassionate. We can't thank them enough."
5,"This is one of my favorite places in the city! My boyfriend and I moved to TO in October and one Sunday night we had nothing to do and I have always wanted to go to a comedy show but never had the opportunity. We had no idea what to expect but we decided to go for it! 
We arrived about a half hour early, grabbed our tickets at the ticket stand which were super cheap! $8 and then we got a pitcher of beer and chilled out in the lounge area before going into the theatre. I have read people complaining about the layout but I think it's perfect! There are signs clearly stating ""theatre"" and ""bathroom"". If people were confused that was their fault, not the bar. 
I think the staff is super nice and I like how the performers just hangout and I think some of them even work there. It really seems like a family working together to provide a good entertainment experience. 
Now, as for the show- it was hilarious! If you want to try it, Sunday is a great night! It is called Sunday Night Live complete with a host, a musical guest and really funny sketches! We have gone back over 5 times bringing family and friends. Everyone has loved it! It's a great date night as well. A good alternative to going to the movies and spending $50 on tickets and popcorn! I can't say enough good things about The comedy Bar! I am glad a place like this exists."
5,"Hands down one of the best, most juicy burgers I've ever had.

This Jackson guy does it right. I love coming to a different city and seeing burger joints that know how to feed people. Just because it's fast food, doesn't mean it has to be cheap food. I mean these burgers are 5 bucks and could probably sell for closer to 8 cause they're so good for you. Usually healthy means expensive, but Jacksons gives you a great meal for a really good price.

Where else can you get a hormone free, anti-biotic free, free range burger for under 7 bucks in Toronto?? 

Whenever I'm in town, I'm planning a trip to Jacksons. Why go anywhere else when you can get an incredible mean for under 10 bucks.

Thank you Jacksons for added some quality food to this city that doesn't break the bank.

ps - reading some of the other reviews makes me wonder what wrong with some people. you're complaining about the bun, really?!? I mean seriously, do you go to a burger joint for the bun? I happened to have the gluten free bun and it was perfect. I guess some people like to bitch about the little things. Don't sweat the small stuff people, try to enjoy the quality that Jacksons offers."
5,"At 4 years young, this is something I thought I would not have to do for my Old English Sheepdog Bentley. Diagnosed with lymphoma we knew his time was near. I called Dr. Fixler's office and was fortunate that he was available that afternoon. The person that answered the phone was very patient with me and was able to answer all my questions. Dr. Fixler and his assistant arrived as scheduled. They were extremely compassionate and gentle with Bentley. They examined him and explained the procedure to us. Bentley crossed the rainbow bridge peacefully. They gave us time to say goodbye to our precious furry boy. 
I highly recommend Happy Endings."
5,"Been eating Yoshinoya since I was little, Im originally from CA and I was stoked to see that one was finally opened here in Vegas! Despite the tricky location and somewhat raised prices, the food is still great (with a slight different taste) but I LOVE this place! Nothing beats a good beef bowl.. :)"
5,"I brought my littest Little here for a special treat after her recent doctor visit; she had to get immunizations in order to get ready for Kindergarten, and in my family shots *always* require post appointment ice cream....STAT. 

I ordered a chicken sandwich, fries, lemonade, and a 'Dirt Cup' for us to share.  The chicken sandwich was hot, juicy and delicious.  The fries and their special fry sauce was really unique and yummy.  (We didn't leave a single fry survivor, we killed them all.)  And her frozen 'Dirt Cup' vanilla custard with gummy worms and chunks or Oreo cookie was creamy, smooth and perfect for curing post-shot frowns.

The restaurant was spotless and the employees that served us all displayed a high level of customer service and were extremely friendly and efficient.  We left there very impressed an will definitely return again soon!"
5,"Amazing pho and spring rolls at an amazing price, my go to! A family run business so its kind of lowkey, but the food is just hands down the best pho I have ever had."
5,"I had adopted Hank, my Golden mix when he was 2 years old when my also 2 year old Shepherd mix, Bindy was chewing furniture to let me know she was bored.  They bonded immediately, could not be separated and did everything together.  I came to find out that we were his 5th family and that his first 2 years were not happy ones.  After a year of work to get him healthy from his previous abuse he became the most forgiving, protective and loving dog.  So when Hank was diagnosed at barely 7 years old with Lymphoma I was referred to Happy Endings.  I wanted to be sure that Bindy was with him the whole time and that neither of the dogs were stressed by a car ride to the vet.  I include information about Bindy because I feel it is important for anyone with a surviving pet to know what to expect and that they too are a part of this transition.

I checked the Yelp reviews for Happy Endings and they were amazing.  I spoke with Alicia who was not only very informative but was extremely compassionate about what to look for when it was time to call them and that they could be at my house very quickly if we needed.  She made me feel at ease knowing I had a plan for Hank's end of life care and I had the remaining time with him to just enjoy and spoil him.  Those two months flew by so fast and within days at the end, so did his condition.  The day they came out I received a ""we're on our way"" call.  When Dr. Fixler and his assistant Briana(?) arrived Bindy, who had been frantic over Hank's condition, smelled them and Dr. Fixler's bag and seemed to be begging them to do something.  Unfortunately we did have to separate her from us but she was still very close to us and could see Hank.  Dr. Fixler and Briana were happy to be where ever Hank was happy which was outside on his pillow.

Dr. Fixler examined Hank and confirmed that yes, it was his time and also told us that how we had taken care of him the last two months was the best course of action.  I felt I had made the right decision from the beginning but when you're at the end you're always looking at the beginning and that made me feel better.  He was very gentle with Hank and had his comfort as first priority.  As we all sat around Hank he gave him an injection of a sedative so he would be asleep and comfortable.  While waiting for the sedation to take effect we completed the paperwork and took care of the cost of the services we had decided on which went smoothly and quickly so we could return our attention back to Hank.  Dr. Fixler kept checking Hank to see if the sedative had taken effect.  Once Hank started to relax Bindy became absolutely silent.

Dr. Fixler inserted the catheter after Hank was under sedation so he would not feel a thing.  We were given some privacy to pet him one last time and say goodbye before coming back out to administer the final injection.  He told us everything we may see so we were prepared for what would happen next.  Hank very peacefully passed in the comfort of his favorite spot, surrounded by his family.  This is exactly what I wanted him to have.  His life had started out so hard that I wanted him to have a very peaceful and well, happy ending.  He was surrounded by love, respect and gentle hands.  We once again had more time with him and despite the tears and runny noses we were given hugs and condolences.  It was at this time that we let Bindy in to see Hank and she only made a few sniffs around him and that was it; exactly what Dr. Fixler told us she would do.  When we had said our final goodbyes Hank was very carefully wrapped up and taken away.

After Hank was cremated he was couriered to me which the date and time was scheduled in advance.  Inside the box, Hanks remains were very carefully packaged to ensure safe delivery, a letter from Happy Endings again expressing their condolences and an envelope containing the ""Rainbow Bridge"" poem with Hank's paw print next to it.

Despite this very sad time for us, Dr. Fixler, Alicia and Briana gave us and most importantly Hank the most peaceful and respectful experience I could have hoped for.  I didn't have to worry about anything.  Having Bindy there with us was also important because if we had taken Hank away in the condition he was in and not returned with him, Bindy would have searched and searched for him.  When it's Bindy's time to meet up with Hank it will be through the gentle hands of Dr. Fixler.

I highly recommend that you visit their website.  There is a wealth of information on grief, surviving pets, etc.  Also know that your surviving pet will go through a grief period of their own.  They will do things out of habit and you'll see them remember that their friend is not there to do those things with them.  Be patient and don't force them into having a new friend too soon.  They will be okay but they need you to guide them through their grief and they will help you through yours."
5,"Had the Sunday special: chicken stuffed burger with spinach and cream cheese on toasted white bread with lettuce, tomato, pickles and banana peppers. $6.77 for 2 burgers! Such an excellent deal but the burger itself is even better. Amazing taste, and customer service. The chef was funny and very nice, someone you'd wanna be friends with! 

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great burger, especially chicken! Went beyond my expectations and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. 

Try out their burgers and it's all halal too!"
5,Abrazo save my life I had a life-threatening deep vein thrombosis they immediately took care me with great care outstanding experience I would absolutely recommend this hospital anybody doctors are great nurses were awesome can't say enough good things about him and I'm alive today because the doctors and nurses at abrazo
5,"Thank you so much for treating our little Bear with compassion, empathy and caring hands.  Dr. Fixler and his assistant were respectful and gave us the time we needed to say goodbye to our handsome little man.  He made our choice to have this done in our home the best decision we could ever make for our little man.  Thank you thank you thank you and God bless you!!!"
5,"Our first time there, and I have to say that I was very impressed, the food was great and they had vegan options for my wife, I thought the prices were reasonable as well. We will definitely be going back."
5,Great staff and high quality flowers!  Thank for the service and the pink rose petals.
5,"I am a driver and I consistently pick up people from here.....They are always raving about the burritos and how awesome they are......This particular day I picked up a guy who had a burrito the size of a small football.....it's looked and smelled so good...I asked what kind .....he said it was a California Burrito....it's the best....i asked what was in it....he said Carne asada, french fries, pico, sourcream, cheese, and green sauce......IT WAS HUGE~!   Mind you I would of never bought a burrito with French fries in it but I decided to go in the next night and buy one.....I took it home....IT WAS HUGE~!   I split it in half and hubby and I shared for dinner~!    We were stuffed~!    IT WAS SOOOOOOO FLIPPIN' GOOD~!   I went back 2 more times during this week and it was just as Consistant and as GOOD as the first time....Now I will say I would NEVER have gone in this place if not for the referral.....it's a small store and I didn't even know they made burritos and sold hot food till I went in......This is a definite well kept hole in the wall secret....nothing fancy...very low key....very casual.....BUT DAMN GOOD~!    AND FURTHERMORE I WILL CONTINUE TO EAT MY FRENCH FRIES IN MY CALIFORNIA BURRITO......PURE AWESOMENESS~!   ;)"
5,"Dr. Michael and Alicia Fixler at Happy Endings In-Home Pet Euthanasia made a very painful situation a lot less stressful for both my pet and family.  Our beloved dog, Andie, had been a part of our family for 10 years.  Having leukemia, she took a turn for the worse and we knew it was time to say goodbye.  

She hated going to the vet's office.  Not wanting to stress her out in her last few hours with us, I did an online search for vets who will provide in-home services and I found Dr. Fixler.  He and Alicia were able to come to our home within 2 hours of our calling them.  The procedure was very calm.  Dr. Fixler made sure we knew what was happening at every step and what we could expect.  Andie wasn't stressed and the family felt comfortable at home.  Dr. Fixler also provided the service of taking Andie's body for cremation.  Alicia helped us pick out an urn.  Within 2 weeks, via special delivery,  Andie's ashes were returned to us in a beautiful urn.

I can't sing enough praises for Dr. Fixler and Alicia.  They were respectful, caring, and extremely sensitive to both Andie's and our feelings and needs.   I've never used an in-home pet euthanasia service before this.   Being a pet lover, I have had to take my departing pets to the vet's office in their last hours.  Saying goodbye is never easy, but  Dr. Fixler's in-home service made a huge difference.  If I can avoid it, I will never again say goodbye to one of my pets while they are scared and stressed on a cold metal table in the vet's office.  

Andie's departure was calm and peaceful as she lie in her favorite spot looking out the screen door to the backyard.  It was a beautiful day outside and the birds were singing as Andie departed.

Thank you Dr. Michael and Alicia!!! Your big hearts make such a wonderful difference in the lives of pets and their families."
5,Please consider using this service when the time comes to say goodbye to your pet.  They are compassionate and professional.  They went out of their way to alleviate Gabby's stress and help her to feel comfortable.
5,"I always go this place for bun (cold noodle salad) with bbq pork.  For less than $6, you get a huge bowl of tasty noodles, fresh herbs, veggies, and beautifully grilled meat.  It's quite possibly the best bun I've ever had.  The services is a little indifferent but it doesn't detract from the food at all (for me anyways)."
5,"A Montreal legend which has been there FOREVER. Very colourful staff full of stories if you can get them talking. 

Try the Wilensky's Special with swiss cheese, sour pickle, and one of their sodas. I recommend the cherry cola."
5,Best restaurant hands down. They are on top of there shot best price best location. I love all the staff. I recommend this place to the whole wide world!!!
5,This burrito was so good I wish there was cloning so we can clone the chef and bring him/her to Los Angeles. I know we have a lot of Mexican spots but this was so legit!
5,Visiting from California saw all the great reviews place didn't disappoint fantastic!!! If you take to go ask for extra hot sauce and forks
5,This company couldn't be better to help ur animal pass. They came to our home explained everything. What to expect and gave us  choices. Everyone from the original phone call to the time they euthanized my dog was empathetic and professional. They hacked him with extreme care even after he was gone. No one wants to say goodbye to a pet but when u have to this is the way to do it
5,"Wilensky's. Montréal institution. If it ever shots down, Montréal will mourn its passing. An old cigar shop from the 1920s (I think) that offered some light lunches. Now it's all they do. They serve fried baloney sammiches, old syrup and fountain pop and homemade pickels. The place seats 8, standing room available by they freezer. Deal with it. This place is awesome."
5,"Today, we had to put our 17-year-old miracle cat, Oscar, to sleep.  He thrived with a ""laundry list"" of health conditions during his lifetime, including  FIV, asthma, a heart murmur, and a single working kidney since birth.  Only 5 days ago, he was given a preliminary diagnosis of carcinomatosis.  It was confirmed the next day.  By the time this type of cancer is discovered, it's already in the late stages.  There was nothing we could do except love him and keep him comfortable until the end.

He went down over the weekend.  We presumed we'd go to the vet, but then I thought that the idea of driving to and from the office and having him put to sleep on a cold steel table was not what we wanted for our special friend or for us.  I was touched greatly by Dr. Fixler's video on his website and decided to contact them.  

From the time I tearfully spoke with the receptionist Monday morning for a same-day appointment.  I was touched by her compassion.  We received a call when he was 20 minutes out, so we could take Oscar for one last romp outdoors.  Once Dr. Fixler was there, he and the tech spoke gently to us and most importantly, let us tell him about this incredibly smart, intuitive cat.  Our dog was able to say goodbye before being put in the bedroom.  Then as we held Oscar, he gave him a shot to make him sleepy.  Then they inserted the catheter.  He carried him and his bed outside into the yard and the sun, which Oscar loved.  When we were ready, his heart was stopped.  He passed very gently.  

This is the fourth pet we've had put to sleep, and a far better experience than all of the others at the vets.'  I cannot recommend Happy Endings enough.  (BTW: A friend at a rescue asked who we used, and when I told her, she said Dr. Fixler had put her cat, Roscoe, to sleep, and he was ""awesome"".  Absolutely true.)"
5,"Thank you so much for making the saddest day of my life a little easier. You came to my house and were so peaceful. Giving us the time to stop and appreciate our beloved dog, carefully explaining the process, and making sure we were ok. If I could go back in time, i probably would've spent more time my girl....lots of things I forgot to tell her. Thank you."
5,"Dr. Fixler and his staff was there for us in a very hard time.  We had to have our beloved Bogart put down.  They expedited their schedule because he was suffering so much.  They came to our home and helped Bogart over the bridge.  He was a very tough little dog and did not want to give in but Dr. Fixler was so kind and took his time.  We were all able to tell our little guy good bye and that we loved him.  Our gratitude to these wonderful people, they have the hardest job on earth, but do it with love and understanding.  God Bless you."
5,"They did a beautiful job on my wedding flowers, Greg was great to work with and clearly they care about their clients!"
5,"It's our first time trying Jackson's Burger and it was great. We were pleasantly surprised. We ordered a beef burger with bacon and a bacon cheeseburger along with onion rings and fries. The buns, beef and bacon were not greasy and heavy at all. The veggies were fresh and the onion rings and fries were so good! 
We would definitely order again. 
I'm already thinking what I want to try next. Lol. 
Give it a try folks!"
5,"Fish tacos are AWESOME you need to try them. Everyone is friendly.  Ate at the bar, service was excellent."
5,This place has great food for a great price. The servers are always friendly although brisk.
5,AMAZING FOOD. Being from Denver its not something we get to enjoy. Yoshinoya was a must go when i would visit California as a child and now on my trip to Vegas seeing one I needed to go. Had a Large Angus Beef and it was delicious. Price is very reasonable... under $10 including drink.
5,This place.. no joke has the best tacos I've had since moving to Arizona! We ordered our dinner through Postmates I got the 4 chicken tacos and he got the California burrito with steak. Both were amazing!
5,Ordered online before they opened as I live on the east coast.  Flowers were delivered with so much care and such a genuine spirit.  Will never use any other florist in Vegas to send gifts to my family - AMAZING!
5,I had the chicken burger and it was definitely gourmet. The chicken is free range from Paradise Farms in Ontario and keeping with the Corporate Social Responsibility! Great Job!
5,"Dr. Fixler, his wife Alicia, and assistant were so kind and helpful to me when it was time for my sweet dog, Gretchen, to go to heaven.  Gretchen was 16-1/2, blind, had ulcers on eyes, and little response.  I thank them  for a peaceful passing."
5,"Love their service I browsed through many other shops and none could compare.
I had many questions and Greg was so QUICK and straight forward replying to me by e-Mail

I purchased:
The 4 Dozen Red Roses Ultimate Elegance Premium Long Stem with a Medium size Teddy Bear.

And she loved them 
I couldn't be happier 

I would recommend anyone to do business with them.

Also the delivery person was quiet polite and nice."
5,"Food was great!
First time trying this place out for lunch and definitely won't be my last. 
Service was friendly. 
Will recommend this place to friends and family. 
I had the chicken teriyaki plate I believe.
Great job"
5,"Does anybody know why this place closed? This was the last Yoshinoya in Nevada. Now I have to drive down to California.The food was quite declious, but not sure why it closed?"
5,"The 4-pack of tacos was a great deal for the money. The steak was the best I've ever had at a local Mexican joint. The cook called it carne asada but it was more of a marinated, shredded beef that they throw on the flat top to get crispy when you order. I was curious about the chicken but I can't ever not get the beef. Flavorful, tender, juicy, crispy, not too salty or greasy. It's perfect. Then it's topped with mounds of toppings, to your heart's desire. Fantastic, filling street tacos. 

The burritos and chimichangas are so massive and intense that I can't ever even eat half. And for the price they're cheaper than half their burritos with half the flavor around these parts. Hot Cheetoh burrito recommended if you're in to that type of thing. The Cheetohs get soggy obviously but it's still a delicious spicy nacho-cheesy mess (and don't get lettuce in it either that's weird). I've also had the Hot Cheetoh Nachos which were both amazing and disgusting. It's just like diving into the condiment bar with a fork and a bunch of nacho cheese and stale, spicy corn chips floating around. It's a ridiculous amount of food and it's only $6.99 (or 5.99 if you order off Yelp). 

The dudes who work here are super chill and super fast. Given the neighborhood, there's always tons of college kids inside the cramped store and eating outside at all hours of the day, and they keep the crowd moving. They have everything here, including giant baskets of shooters at the counter, so it is definitely a favorite late-night stop."
5,"I highly recommend Dr. Fixler. He is such a compassionate man and really empathized with us. What I liked most, Dr. Fixler told us we were making the right decision. I struggled with the decision earlier that day, but once he did his assessment and told me I was doing the right thing, I was able to let my girl go. The entire experience was the best we could hope for. Our baby girl was able to pass in her bed and in our arms. Dr. Fixler and his assistant took care of everything. Originally, he didn't have an opening for 2 days, but then immediately worked us in. I believe he really understands that pets are part of the family. Thank you all for helping us through this time."
5,"Amazing Authentic Vietnamese food! I love their rolls.  The chao Tom (shrimp wrapped on sugar cane) is especially delicious.  What adds to the experience is the exceptional customer service.  They were very attentive to all of my needs and accommodating to my child.  
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Vietnamese comfort food.!"
5,"i have been using The Dancing Dandelion for the last two years to order flowers for different school events.  in the past, they have made me what I call ""podium arrangements"".  Today, they made me some beautiful hand-opened roses with succulents ( I will post pictures).  The arrangements were beautiful and everyone kept asking me who my florist was.  The shop has always been very helpful and I am able to easily communicate with the owner via email.  I highly recommend this shop."
5,"Delicious nachos and 4-pack of tacos. I also picked up the California Burrito for later. 

Fair prices and they're open late (2am on a weekday).

Thanks, guys!"
5,"Great staff, the good is always made fresh. Busy, but in a good way. Cool vibe, extremely fair prices. The Fiji burrito is huuuge and delicious."
5,"why the eff did this place close?!! and of course thats the only one in vegas....i gotra move back to la to get this deliciousness in my life 
d':"
5,"I am always in search of authentic Mexican fare in particular tacos and burritos. 
At Paisano's I hit the trifecta. 
For starters the tacos were exceptional. 
Secondly, the prices are very attractive. 
And finally, this is a combo market and Taco place. So if one is looking for Mexican provisions this may be the place to check it out. 
But I digress. Back to the food. I ordered 3 steak tacos and watched the cook assemble them. The steak was perfectly cooked on the flat top: tasty and tender. 
Based on your preference you can choose from a plethora of toppings and condiments. 
The amount of meat in each of the open-faced tacos was another great attribute. 
They do a lot of takeout business although I chose to utilize one of two picnic tables outside. 
I plan to come back to checkout their burritos and other menu items.

5,try their sinh to sau rieng!!! i still remember after over a decade!!!!
5,"Dr. Fixler could not have been more kind. He was wonderful with our sweet old man Border Collie, Buddy. Dr. Fixler was also so kind with our three teenagers who are obviously very sad and grieving. He offered us great suggestions on how to keep Buddy comfortable and improve his quality of life - doggie hospice. The price was, I am certain, much less than had we taken him to the vet office, plus saved Buddy the anguish of getting in and out of a car. Buddy has always hated the vet office but he loved Dr. Fixler. Buddy kept trying to crawl closer to him to be petted which he never does with the vet.  We are so glad we were referred. This was definitely the best decision for us."
5,"I don't live in the area, but ordered some flowers and balloons for my uncle who just got surgery through their online portal and everything was executed perfectly. Same day delivery!!  Greg is definitely the man who you want to talk to.  He was so easy going and even called to let me know that delivery was successful. Exceptional customer service and willing to go the extra mile. If you're reading this Greg, THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart, you really made my day!!"
5,"Wilensky's is fucking glorious.  There's no other way to describe it.

Yes, I realize it's touristy (now) and it's riding on the whole nostalgia factor and the stern rules gives it a unique charm.

But seriously, the Wilensky's Special is probably the best $3.90 you can spend on food.  The skill is in the simplicity - grilled beef salami and bologna with mustard on a flat-grilled kaiser roll with your choice of cheddar or swiss.

I rolled by for lunch and grabbed a Special with some pickles and one of their house-made sodas.  Then I went patio drinking at Dieu Du Ciel down the street.... then I came back to grab  another Special while drunk.  And it was damned good on both counts.

It's impossible to not like this place."
5,My baby girl was delivering at this hospital..love the staffs.  The place is clean and the nurse were really helpful...the dr. That gave me the epirdural r super smooth ...the only problem is the food is bad but owell wont matter that much...
5,"It is truly a crime that I've never been here until now. They are ALWAYS closed when I want to go. Adam and I take lots of late night walks and this place closes at 4pm and isn't open on Sunday AND it's cash only! A recipe for me never being able to go basically. 

But one day I was like enough! Go to the bank, get the money, eat there!!! And I did. And I loved it! It's simple, delicious food. 

I got the kernatzel, the chocolate milkshake, the special with cheese, AND the hot dog and yuuuuummm. I think it's the meat that gets me. It's so tasty and salty and then they add a light dab of mustard with some cheddar cheese and boom = happiness. 

It may be cash only but it's also ridiculously cheap."
5,"I am so very grateful to and for Happy Endings. Saying goodbye to Sinatra was hard and something we struggled with. Dr. Fixler and his staff were wonderful. Kind, gracious, comforting.... We knew we made the right decision."
5,"Wow, what a team. I am so sincerely thankful and grateful for everyone at happy endings.

Our pup was such a huge part of our family, and i couldn't bring myself to drive him to the vet to have him cross the rainbow bridge, and return home with nothing. This in home service allowed my family time, comfort and the beautiful memory of our pup calmly at peace in his favorite spot. The hardest part-for us-is having to constantly be reminded of his passing. It is a little tough to see the place he was put to rest daily, but it was the right decision for us. 

The Dr. and tech were so professional, and did not rush us. Super accomodating and overall wonderful! I never wanted to have to search in home euthenasia, but im glad yelp steered me in the best direction yet again."
5,"This is for the ER at Arrowhead Hospital. So in my experience, visiting the ER is right up there with cleaning out my cat's litter boxes! Recently my son was experiencing abdominal pain,on New Years Day of all days! No other place could take him, called the walk-in places 3 hour waiting list. We took him to the ER and wow! Very clean, friendly, and quick! From time he got there to back home 3 hours not bad at all! They offered warm blankets as well, in the waiting room.  He is fine, not appendix which we were  worried about,(kidney stone, ouch!) But honestly, if you have insurance coverage, don't waste your time with the walk in clinics, they would not have been able to do ct scan, or proper testing anyhow. This ER was the best experience of all ER's.!!!"
5,"That was probably the fastest and biggest burrito I have ever had. I would say more authentic than mainstream and that's a good thing. The flavor was good and piled high with meat. I asked for all of the extras and the guy making it gave me a ton of everything, could barely stuff it all in there, but rolls it up and gives me a wink. He knows how good he is. This was all in like 30 seconds of being there and I had a burrito in my hand, weighing down the right side of my body like an extra limb. Went there last night for the first time, going back tonight. Rock on guys"
5,"This place looks uninviting from the outside but changes your mind as soon as you walk in. Stocked to the max on all kinds of everything. cheap alcohol, awesome food. great prices. friendly service. 

This place is the shit. I work at a job right behind it and was hooked after the first trip."
5,I ordered Uber eats and whoever is working tonight deserves a raise. A promotion. Maybe even a gold medal. I love them. I ordered 4 tacos and carne fries... with extra super sour cream... and they delivered hard. I love them and if someone can give them a kiss on the lips for me I would be ecstatic. I'll be ordering again ASAP. I love you.
5,My new favorite burger joint!! Great burgers and service!! I ordered a single patty with cheese and bacon and some fries.  Both were cooked perfectly and very quickly.  I will however order a double patty next time since they are very thin. Their fry sauce is a must!!  Had to order there custard for dessert and I wasn't disappointed there either! Very impressed with the quality of food and service!! I will most definitely be back for more :)
5,"This place is pretty good! Came here yesterday and had the Bugerritto. Buy one get one free. 11.30 for both, so comes to 5.65 a burger. Beef patty, avocado explosion, salsa, sour cream, lettuce and dusted onions. Delicious! I ate both and was satisfied. I actually don't mind the wonder bread bun.  I like their bread.  I wouldnt order anything else besides the daily special where it is buy one get one free.  The regular burger at 4.99 is still reasonable in my perspective, considering it is certified localy grown free range beef that is hormone and antibiotic free. If you go to mcdonalds guess how much a big mac costs?  There is a buy one get one free for every day of the week.  If you can't finish both, go find a friend."
5,"Absolutely the best flower shop in Las Vegas. Great customer service, beautiful arrangements, and friendly local shop owners. I've sent at least ten different arrangements over the last year and every one has been received fresh and as ordered. Their web site is very representative of the flowers and arrangements that arrive at your destination. The same stellar service on shop pickup and delivery. The various arrangements featuring the cute little pooch are some of my favorites."
5,"Third time we've enjoyed dining here - this time with guests. Each time we were fortunate enough to be able to order the New England Clam Chowder - the best I've ever had! Short wait for seating and great service every time. Love the Poutine & corn bread! Also am relieved to know that I can order the smoked meat offerings without any kind of sauces, since I prefer to let the smoked aspect be the dominant flavor. The perch was fresh and sweet - like fresh perch should be. There are a nice variety of entrees to choose from - some have spicy heat - some don't. The choice is yours. I don't drink beer, but noticed the nice variety of offerings. I was bummed when Fisher's Tavern closed, but am thrilled to enjoy a consistently good dining experience here!"
5,Thank you for the repeat great service! I recently ordered flowers and they were delivered fast and as the picture shows on the website.
5,Honestly one of the best places to go for food late at night in tempe great food here
5,"I've used Dancing Dandelion many times and they always do a great job, but this time they even exceeded their previously stellar deliveries and execution  I ordered flowers for my daughter's birthday, to be delivered to her work, but I what I didn't know is that she wasn't working that day. The delivery person attempted delivery, found she was not at work, called her, found that she was at UNLV (she's a student there), tracked her down on campus and hand delivered them to her.  The business is the most well run and disciplined floral business I've ever used.  They instill and reinforce a work ethic that provides employees with the motivation to go,above and beyond, as they did with this delivery. And the employees must really enjoy working there to go above and beyond as they do, which also says a lot. Simply the best floral business in Vegas."
5,"5 piasses pour un sandwich magique. Il est tellement simple que ça en est désarmant, mais il n'en demeure pas moins excellent. Justement, puisqu'il n'a que quelques ingrédients, il n'y a pas de ""camouflage"" possible, il faut qu'ils soient tous au top. Et c'est le cas! Je mange de la charcuterie 1 fois au 10 ans mais je vais m'assurer désormais que ce soit toujours un rendez-vous chez Wilensky. 

Si vous n'aimez pas la moutarde, c'est un deal-breaker. Le sandwich vient avec, et c'est non-négociable. J'aime ça, ils assument leur formule (gagnante) jusqu'au bout!

À mon lunch de bonne heure (11h30), l'accueil chaleureux des madames et mon petit sac en papier brun m'ont donné un feeling de prolétariat. C'est une visite culturelle dans un établissement historique, en quelque sorte.

J'espère qu'ils seront en affaires pour l'éternité. Après 86 ans déjà, ils sont bien partis pour ça ;)"
5,"This was never something I wanted to write a review about, but D. Fixler and his wife were so incredible that I wanted to not only thank them, but also make sure others knew that they could be comfortable with them when the time comes to make the gut-wrenching decision to put your pet to sleep. Dr. Fixler came out after hours for an emergency visit for our dog Moose, who had a tumor that was in danger of rupturing. He was sympathetic, kind, and compassionate with not only my husband and I but Moose and our other dog, Dolce, as well.  He walked us through the procedure, letting us know exactly what he would be doing and when, and what would we could expect to see/experience.  He didn't do ANYTHING without telling us first. He even took the time to look at Moose's last vet records, and his X-Rays, and spoke with us about his condition. After Moose had slipped away Dr. Fixler spoke with us about how to handle his death with our other dog -- recommending letting her see and sniff Moose before he was removed. Afterward they sent us a paw print of Moose on a very sweet poem.  We are so very grateful to Happy Endings - thank you for helping make this hard time a bit easier."
5,"My sister-in-law told me that Freddy's Oreo ice cream Sandwich was amazing so I had to try it.  She was right!  

Please note that I later tried it pre-made and it wasn't nearly as good.  It was hard as a rock.  Moving forward, I'll only ask for it to be freshly made.

Freddy's custard is awesome.  It's as close to real gelato that I've tried in AZ.  This rating is ONLY for the custard and not the food."
5,By far the vest hospital I've ever been to! Spent about an hour in a half there with back pain. They immediately took care of me and everyone was so passionate and sweet to me! I recommend this place to anyone! I hate hospitals and try avoiding them at all cost but they sure changed my perspective!
5,"I got a Wilensky Special All Beef Salami and Bologna sandwich with Swiss cheese and mustard, pickles on the side and their homemade cherry coke. Everything worked together perfectly.
The sandwich is simple yet so damn good. 
Reminded me of the Mortadella Sandwich I had at the Municipal Market in São Paulo, Brazil.
For $3.90 a sandwich it's definitely worth dropping by!!"
5,"My fifteen year old Tonkinese cat, Truffles was suffering from chronic kidney disease, and suspected lymphoma.  Her quality of life had gone downhill...she was vomiting a lot, and could not drink enough water.  She also hid under my bed frequently, which was not her style.  She was on two medications daily, and I could not continue to do this to her, and the various vet visits for the follow-ups/check-ups...it did not seem fair to her.  She hated going in the car, and to the vet's.  I made the decision to say goodbye to her with the help of Dr. Fixler, and his assistant Eric.  They were wonderful!  They allowed me to spend as much time as I needed before the procedure, and it gave me a piece of mind to have her pass in her home environment, in her cat bed with her favorite toys, rather than a cold vet's office.  Dr. Fixler, and Eric were so caring, and gentle with her...I could not have asked for more.  The Happy Endings In-Home procedure is comforting from the scheduling with Alicia; to the goodbye visit with Dr. Fixler.  Thank you so much Alicia, Dr. Fixler, and Eric for assisting me in Truffles travel to the ""Rainbow Bridge""!  You are amazing!"
5,"I have had Prism for 2 months and could not be happier. There is a ton of HD channels and the On Demand speed is like light speed compared to Cox.
Also, the wireless router has worked perfectly for 2 months with no resets. 
I hope to see a more expansive free On Demand section as the service grows."
5,"A college student's dream of convenience is here! This hidden gem has everything that you are looking for: Gatorade, Chex Mix, Recreational things college kids do but are frowned upon things, and tacos. Seriously everything.
The staff is always friendly and love getting to know everyone.
Just don't go alone, it's kind of scary."
5,"My pup Ranger ended up dying before Doc could get here, but Alicia was so helpful and supportive on the phone during Ranger's last few breaths. I had contacted Dr Fixler a couple weeks prior and he was so kind in his email reply. I definitely recommend this route if euthanasia is needed and these 2 people really do care for all pets and their grieving owners. Thank You both."
5,"Ghetto? Yes. But they have all your convenient liquor store/'had a little too much to drink' night needs. Found this place on Yelp when I was looking for tacos. When I first started going to El Paisano, their kitchen/cook area was half the size it is now. Seems like they're doing pretty well for themselves for being located by ASU & in a not so pretty area. Carne asada tacos, breakfast burrito, & wings are my usual items of order. El P has been my stop many times after a night out at the bars or in the morning to cure the hangovers. All their toppings look freshly cut & chopped up every time I go and for being in a liquor store, it's a clean kitchen as you can see as they prepare your food.

Just finished a steak breakfast burrito from this spot and had to tell the rest of the Yelp community that this place is legit!

They're also on Postmates so I've ordered in a few times through the app.

Note: Spicy Guacamole salsa is SO good but SUPER spicy so for the weak....ask for it on the side."
5,"A must-try place if visiting from out of town!

The typical order is the ""Wilensky's Special"". It's an all-beef salami and all-beef Bologna, grilled, in a roll with mustard.  You may ask to have it with Kraft singles cheese or Swiss.   (You cannot ask to have it cut in half, or without mustard).

The decor is nostalgic; photos of loyal customers since its opening in 1932.  Seating is only at the counter, thus, limited seats.  But don't worry, you can take it to go. It's a fast eat.  If you really need seats, then know that the turnaround time is quick; nobody lingers.

The food is made upon ordering.  It arrives quickly and hot - the sandwiches are served on a napkin.  Tip: order each sandwich as you go, no need to order all 2 or 3 for yourself at once!  The soda fountain is real old-school!  Syrup form!  Many flavours to choose from!  You can separately order pickles - sour or half sour.  The karnatzels are very fresh too.

Overall, the staff is warm and friendly.  This place is highly recommended for a quick bite to eat.  The sandwiches are done just right."
5,"Wow. How have I not gone to this place sooner?!?! My favorite fast food place in the midwest was/is Steak N Shake and this tastes pretty darn similar. The burgers are thin, but cooked to a crispy perfection & the fries are thin and awesome as well. On my first trip, I had the patty melt, which was awesome. On my second trip, I had a burger and it was amazing. And on my third trip, I went for the hot dog and it was outstanding :) Have yet to be disappointed by the food at Freddy's. 

Next, we have the customer service here, which is top notch. There are a bunch of young kids behind the counter, but they all seem to have an impeccable work ethic and great manners. I don't know how the managers go about their hiring process, but they're doing a great job. 

Lastly, frozen custard... just do it. You won't regret it :)"
5,"The burgers are probably the best burgers in Toronto. I come here all the time, their food is fresh and tasty. I love their daily specials, I recommend the Bugerito (Thursday). The Thursday special is probably the best on their menu. Price wise it's similar to five guys. This place is worth every penny."
5,Ordered takeout. So good! Been looking for a reliable local bbq joint for some time. This is my new go-to. It's a serious bang for your buck and the quality and quantity are both superb.
5,"Man oh man! This place is a must go to place in Tempe, Arizona. I loved this place, what a hole in the wall area, but a secret treasure. The Food here was off the charts, and it has brought me back time and time again. Upon arrival, I already knew this place would be amazing judging by the wait. There was a line going out the door, in a place you would never even check twice. The moment one receives a burrito, it's like being handed a baby. Not only is the burrito a humongous in size, but it has a warm comfort to the touch. It is freshly cooked before your eyes and then carefully wrapped in tin foil. The food isn't scolding hot, but at the perfect temperature where the ingredients cool it off for a nice refreshing bite that keeps you chowing down and asking for more. I personally got the California Burrito with Beef. The beef was well seasoned and so were the rest of the ingredients
     This fantastic experience only costed 7 dollars without tax, which was relatively cheap for the amount and the ingredients put within it. Comparing this price to Chipotle, this is amazing. I felt that the quality of meat was much better than that of chipotle, along with the amount that was given. Chipotle may give a great tasting bowl, but they charge extra for guacamole, even alone the bowls are less expensive than that of Chipotle. Here they do not charge for the guacamole, it is actually included in the California Burrito.
      The place does not look like it would be serving this high quality and tasting food from the street view. Looking at the market from the outside, it looks like a regular bodega convenient store, which is average. I guarantee that once you go inside you see the lines of people waiting at 1-2 a.m. The store has a very city feel to it and reminds me of Chicago places that are very popular such as Maxwell street hot dogs. The Ambience screams quality. It seems that these people are very focused on giving quality food and running the general store. The whole environment is unique, and I have seen nothing like it in Arizona. I feel the only thing that could add to the ambience to make it better would be some speakers with popular hip hop music. This would totally fit the style of service and make the experience even one notch better. Adding the music would make the wait and shopping experience a lot more fun, and I could definitely see individuals dancing to the music while in line because that is just the vibe the place gives. The place does not have any sitting area within the convenient store, but outside there is an area where one can sit and eat, but the food is so good that I usually walk and eat it. 
    The chefs definitely looked not only like they enjoyed their job, but the hustle life style that the shop provided them. I loved their fast and friendly service. One thing I noticed about everyone working there was that each individual had an extremely nice hair cut and style. These guys looked very professional and kept themselves well maintained, and with that in mind, I completely trusted them to make my food. The service was extremely fast for the amount of people in line, and surprisingly organized. I love this place and definitely make it a spot to visit every time I go out or stay in Tempe."
5,"When you need this service, these lovely people are the ones to call.   Dr. Fixler make it as good as it can be.   They are a  lovely, kind, caring couple who guide you gently through the process.   We just (minutes ago) had to have our very old cat put to,sleep.   I can write this review only because I think, it is so  important for people to know about people who can and do ease the pain associated with losing a cherished member of your family."
5,"This is pretty much the place I hangout. So I'm pretty biased now. But the only reason I go at least once a week is because ever since I first wandered through those doors the staff at the very least was super nice, so confused about where everything was and I got a full rundown...[which pretty much amounted to where the stage and washrooms were].
The beer is decently priced, a pint of Mill St. Organic is like..$6, if the bar isn't busy I'll happily get a cocktail [pretty much whatever the bartender wants to try, why not eh?] and I've never had bad food. The veg pizza is so good I would wear it as a hat, only had the mac and cheese once, but I nearly fell into a tasty, melty cheese based coma."
5,On Mother's Day at noon is not the time to shop for flowers. After a quick check on Yelp I saw this place close by and rated VERY well. My daughter walked in and they were pretty much picked clean. Even though there were only a couple arrangements left they were flawless and we came out of the predicament looking like rockstars. Now if wife never sees this review I'm home free.
5,"Fantastic 80 year old sandwich shop (see Risa D's review for more history) - If a place has been doing the same thing for that long, they're probably doing it right!

Drop by when you're in the neighbourhood, find a seat at the bar (if there's none free, it won't take long for one to free-up), and order a ""special with cheese"" and some pickles. There're not big - hey, the place is called ""Light Lunch"" - but after two I'm usually good.

While you're at it get yourself a soda - it's made with the syrup right at the bar there in front of you. I like the cherry or root beer flavours, but there are plenty of old-school options to choose from."
5,"I was a patient 2/9-2/11.  Every step of my encounter was better than I anticipated.  Admitting was very helpful, the surgery staff made me feel safe, my surgeon checked on me routinely and the surgical floor gave me and my family an exceptional experience.  Thank you!"
5,"Tired of overpriced, mediocre burgers? Jacksons Burger served me one of the best burgers I've had. Hands down. The patties are hand made fresh. They have a deal every day of the week (buy a certain burger, get another free), but the standard prices are cheaper than what you'll pay at many other restaurants for an inferior product. I love the food, and recommend giving Jacksons Burger a try."
5,"Great programming, great food - a great venue for comedians whether rookie or celebrity. Can't wait to try the new menu - those perogies last menu were fab. 

The bathroom graffiti is hilarious as well."
5,"Incredible customer service and the end result went beyond my expectations!

I met with Greg two months ago to discuss my wedding flower arrangements.  I had an idea of what I wanted, but couldn't exactly put it into words.  Greg (the owner) was amazing to work with.  I scheduled a consultation and met with Greg for about 45 minutes to discuss.  He actually steered me into my inevitable direction and created a bouquet that even my crazy imagination couldn't brew up.  

I week prior to my wedding, Greg met with me again so that we could ensure everything was good to go.  He was amazing and completely understanding of my little Bridezilla moment.  

My flowers were ready first thing in the morning for the day of my wedding.  They were gorgeous!  I received so many compliments and also personally loved my flowers.  I even received compliments from men and random men hanging around our reception area.  Hell, even the servers at my ceremony were picking them up and complimenting them.  I had random girls asking to take photos with them, as well.  

Overall, I love this flower shop and they did an incredible job with my flowers.  And, let me tell you, my expectations were really high.  A week has now passed since my wedding day and my flowers are still sitting in the giant vase that they were delivered in and they still look amazing!  I will be back due to the exceptional end result, the fabulous customer service and the reasonable prices.

Thank you, Greg and the entire staff!"
5,"Had an amazing experience starting yesterday (5/31/17) and ending with a release today in the Surgical unit for a total hip replacement.  We arrived at 5:30 am for a 7:30 am surgery.  My wife and I were greeted by the most pleasant lady I have ever seen at 5:30 AM!!  The  pre-op area where I was prepped by two efficient nurses who were also very upbeat and friendly.  My surgeon and  anesthesiologist  then checked in with me and were super professional and explained the procedure expertly.  Everything went very smoothly (and I have to say I was very nervous and apprehensive having never been in a hospital for anything at 75 years old!).  I must have had contact with at least 20 people in the short time I was there from the various 'paper' staff to the Physical Therapist to both shifts of primary nursing staff, to the auxiliary staff (such as Blanca) and to a one, ALL super pleasant and efficient.  I could name them all but am afraid I would leave someone out and that would be a disservice since EVERYONE was really great. I will say I was on the third floor 
Rm. 3410 so the powers that be can readily see all the people I interacted with.  I will add that when people have issues, many (most) are caused by a person's attitude going in (again perhaps from  tension and apprehension) but I decided that I was going in, while scared, to  put the best attitude I could and it was returned 10 fold.  I simply could not have had a more incredible experience.   Thanks to everyone there at Abrazo Arrowhead for being such upbeat people in an atmosphere that might be hard to stay that way each day.  Lastly, also kudo's to the main lobby volunteers as well as the admitting personnel who also did a great job.  Sorry, one more, the food service and staff were also great and put out an excellent product."
5,"This past Friday my wife and I had to put down one of our doggies.  He was given 3 months but turned south in 3 weeks.  Everything that is listed about how wonderful Dr. Fixler is and his wife are the absolute truth.  Their response was incredible and the Dr. was at our home within 45 mins.  I just wish they had a means to make the pain less in my heart, the way they allowed our Scout to pass so peacefully.  If you have a pet and have to say goodbye, please call this firm.  You and your pet will blessed by them."
5,"I'd been using Dancing Dandelion for roughly a year or so for my every occasional needs, as well as the bi-monthly single lily, so it was a no brainer to use their services when the time came to wed my lovely fiancé. Greg and his team came through, as they always do, and set the tone for our wedding day. Everything from the corsages, rose petals, to the bouquet were absolutely gorgeous! 
We still receive compliments about the table arrangements and overall beauty of the flowers provided by the Dancing Dandelion Flower Shop! As mentioned in other reviews, and a given, there are so many stressors throughout the coordination process of a wedding... that being said let Greg and his team remove all the stress of your floral needs during your special day.
*the bride bouquet was so beautiful we repurposed it on our table! =)"
5,"This place had excellent food, Austin the bartender was extremely helpful as we were first time visitors. We loved the food and he was very accommodating and friendly. We enjoyed our experience and would come back to see Austin."
5,"No one likes when the decision to let a pet go is placed at their feet. We were just faced with this decision yesterday. After a brave battle against cancer out girl Katie had fought enough. We saw no reason for her to climb this hill any longer. Dr fixler and his staff run an absolutely invaluable service. We have had a lot of dogs. We have Faced the day of letting them rest in many different situations. All are difficult, but the compassion and professionalism of dr fixler and his assistant made this by far the most comfortable. It will never be pleasant but the comfort and care in this situation cannot be expressed in words. If there were 6 stars happy endings would deserve 7."
5,"Burgers, fries, frozen custard - oh my!! Deliciousness!!

Their burgers are fresh and yummy! Always made just the way you want them! 

The fries? To die for!! I'm not really a big french-fry person, but the shoestring fries here are too good to resist!

My kids got the t-shirts and get free frozen custard every visit now.. Kat, who's the manager there, is kind enough to remember us and told us we didn't need to drag the shirts in each time. We are so spoiled by the wonderful service and warm hospitality. 

You can't go wrong here. We go almost weekly (even getting lettuce wrapped burgers on my healthier visits ;))."
5,Always consistent and so yummy ! My husband and I love this place and the regular staff are so amazing.. Super friendly and they remember us every time we come in. I hope they keep everything the same. It's so simple and so good ! Cheeseburger with double cheese is the best.
5,"The best place to see comedy. The gritty experience of seeing cutting edge comedy in a small basement theatre is matched with friendly staff, clean taps and good food. A+"
5,"We had the pleasure working with Greg for our wedding held last 11-8-2014. Greg was so accommodating and very honest with what to expect, ideas and suggestions. 

The day of the wedding when he delivered the flowers, I was speechless. The flowers were so simple yet elegant and just what I was going for. The colors matched our motif perfectly.
The centerpieces were a beauty. It wasn't too busy looking. A lot of the guests took the centerpieces home with them.

Greg, we thank you for your help. Words can not express how happy we were. Hope to do business with you again.

PS... thanks for Jazmin discount :)"
5,"My heart is heavy but I have to thank an amazing vet, Dr. Fixler and his assistant Jasmine. They assisted my beloved beagle Stella at the end of life and made her transition peaceful and painless. I can't say enough about these wonderful people! Five stars isn't enough."
5,"Great corner market. Wide selection of beers and cigarettes, amazing Mexican food with fresh ingredients."
5,"As you enter Wilensky's you're transported to a bygone era.  Fading photos smile at you from the walls.  A cash register from the late 1800's, built to last a millenia sits quietly beside the entrance.  If it rang more than its $1.95 maximum, I could imagine it still in use.

The staff behind the counter are welcoming, friendly and are happy to discuss the occasional question about the shop and its history.  But, some things won't happen, at any price. Cutting your sandwich in half, exchanging bun types: forget about it.  Just sit, order, eat, drink, chat and enjoy.

Service is exceptionally quick.  You'll have your Wilensky special sandwich with or without Kraft or swiss slice, always with mustard, by about the time you finishing uttering your order.

Sodas are hand made with syrups from behind the counter, ladled and stirred in front of you.

Any tipping goes straight into a donation jar for charity, not to the house.

Hours are 9-4pm if I remember correctly.

The nostalgia of this shop is unmatched and worth a stop for any visitor or resident of Montreal."
5,"Knowing in your heart of hearts, that it's time to put your best friend and confidant to rest, is one thing... Choosing the time to do this... heart-wrenching and difficult to say the least.  My Mom and our family pet, Leevi, have been staying with me for over a week.  We have had short discussions in the past few months, that some day soon, we would need to make, ""A decision"" due to her arthritis, age and other health issues.  Today, Dr. Fixler and Sara came to our house to help us make Leevi's last moments in our lives as peaceful, loving and stress free as possible.  Happy Endings came very highly recommended from my Mother's vet who was just too far to travel... understandingly go.. and fortunately for us... The Happy Endings experience from the first phone call, to Dr. Fixler and his assistant Sara's arrival (and gentle knock on the door... ... to gently wrapping Leevi in a sweet blanket,  and respectfully carrying her body to their beautiful van.   I highly recommend Happy Endings ~ I have had to put several of my family pets to rest and I will say their team deserves, ""A Heart of Gold Award"".   Gentle, Kind and Caring... For anyone having to make the heart breaking decision... I highly recommend Dr. Fixler and his compassionate team.  To know Leevi passed over the Rainbow surrounded by love... Priceless."
5,"Best burger I've had in a long time, it was fresh and made from real beef and cooked in front of me, the poutine was great too. 
Definitely coming back!"
5,"We just lost a very good friend of ours and wanted to send flowers to her family.  Their website isn't the best and the options they had on display were pretty limited and pink due to valentine's being next week BUT i called them and was able to figure something out that was more appropriate. I was very very impressed with them for calling me and sending me a picture PRIOR to delivering them so i could tell them to change it or whatever but i ended up loving them and didn't change a thing.  
Thanks for making such a beautiful arrangement. That pink lily in front is Tina all the way."
5,"As its name suggests, Wilensky's is a lunch counter--one that's only open until 4:00, weekdays and Saturdays.  It's now celebrating its 80th anniversary (going on 81), and with few exceptions it looks like its been preserved in amber since the '40s. 

One of Montreal's few truly great sandwiches, and a certified original, the Wilensky Special is still priced under $5. So what if it's simply a pressed hot bologna and salami sandwich with mustard? Some days nothing else comes close. I recommend ordering yours with Kraft cheese and a side order of half-sours to get the full experience.  And don't forget to order a fountain drink.  

An institution (sometimes in more than one sense), and not just because of The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.  Beware of imitators--this is the real deal."
5,"I have, for the second time, used Dr. Fixler's services.  It's never a good thing to have to put a beloved pet to sleep, but Dr. Fixler and his staff are as compassionate and caring as anyone could hope for.  Moreso, actually.  In addition, he walks you through the entire process so you know exactly what is happening and will be happening.  He is patient and kind and will take as long as you or your pet may need.  I am so thankful that I found Happy Endings Euthanasia and will use their services for as long as I have pets.  Really, I cannot say enough good things about this practice.  I hate having to have to call him, but know that when the time comes for any pet of mine to pass on, he is the one who I want to be there.  Thank you, again, Dr. Fixler, Reanna and Alicia.  You've made a very difficult decision much easier to handle."
5,"Smokin' Q's is hands down our favorite neighborhood spot! My husband loves the brisket, and I am totally a sucker for the fried perch. The cocktails are also inventive, fresh, and delicious!"
5,Ordered my flowers long distance for my upcoming nuptials.  Spoke with Greg who was very patient and accommodating. I called and told him what I wanted and the flowers came out exactly as I pictured them. Days later they are still alive. I highly recommend a this florist for any future bouquet orders. Flowers were delivered on time. Thanks!!
5,"This is the original location for Burger Factory and the best location. Every item on their menu is amazing, but they are known for their juicy Lucy  which is a handmade burger patty stuffed with cheese! It is a melt, goody, delicious burger that you will definitely not forget!
By far my favourite burger place......Hands down!"
5,I had the Freddy's Double Steak Burger. AMAZING! Their frozen custard is also amazing. This was my first time here and I am now a fan! This is where I eat every time I come to Arizona.
5,"I love this place! This is one of the very few places I can find a great steakburger. Being from Illinois, this is where I go when I'm craving Steak-n-Shake since there are none in AZ."
5,"Simple but great sandwiches.  If I say that they are made with baloney and mustard, you may not be impressed. Yet, each time I return to Montreal I HAVE to stop here.  Somehow, I think the fact the place has not changed in close to a century makes it very warm and homey.  Please make sure you have one of their old style sodas. Made with sirup and added carbonated water.  I suggest a cherry coke.  The only way I'll stop coming is if they change the menu and provide WIFI."
5,"I can not say enough about Abrazo. My mom spent 2 1/2 weeks here from ICU to Neuro and the 3rd floor crew. The Doctors, the amazing wound care team, the nursing
Staff and case management were amazing. Even the kitchen staff was awesome. They do such a great job, I feel so blessed to have had my mom cared for at Abrazo!"
5,"This is one of the best fast food restaurants around. The food is always fresh and hot. The service is always friendly and helpful. From their burgers to fries to their custard (ice cream), , it's all good!"
5,"My husband and I are so grateful for this service.  Dr. Fixler was exceptionally kind during the process, and his calm, caring nature ensured a peaceful transition for our cat Luxor.  We take solace in knowing that Luxor did not suffer, even a bit, and was spared having to be transported to the veterinarian's office.  End stage kidney failure took him so quickly, we were glad to be able to do this one small thing for him in the end.

A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Fixler and his team."
5,"Went to Sunday Night Live for the first time the night before Vicotria Day. 

Arrived late, and had to stand in the back trying to peak over the heads of long-torsoed women in tall bar chairs, but having a pint in hand--a decently priced $6 Sleeman, if I remember correctly--put me at ease. The show was very funny, the cast was energetic, the bartender was friendly, the crowd was positive, and there were good tunes on after the show to encourage toe-tapping shoulder-shifting mingling. It was a solid 4-Star experience-- what more could I ask for?

That's when someone announced to the packed bar to head out for fireworks, and the bartender offered to watch everyone's drink. SERIOUSLY? Everyone crowded outside onto the tiny side street with a sense of occasion and cameraderie, and a MASSIVELY IMPRESSIVE (and probably illegal--but even the popo let these things slide on holidays) fireworks display erupted just feet from our noses. Hands were clapped, whoops were hollered, and a wicked time was had by all. 

Oh ya, and they handed out coupons to come back for another Sunday Night Live show FO FREE. See ya there?"
5,"5 star customer service! I requested star gazers in an arrangement for a hospital patient. None were available for the arrangement for next day delivery. 2 days later, Dancing delivered them in a second delivery to the hospital in a bud vase. Totally beautiful. Their flowers were posh pedals and top quality."
5,"What a blessing to find Dr. Fixler and his team at such a sorrowful time. Dr. Fixler, you are incredible! You made our final moments with Goldie so peaceful. We will never forget you!"
5,"I don't get it, mang. Why are you people busting on Yoshi? When they finally opened up a Yoshi here back in....idk...late 06???? I was taking some programming courses at LV...and I swear, it was so surreal....""I could have sworn this thing wasn't here this morning when I went parked. Hmm."" But then there it was. Routine would be to slam two Red Bulls, burn a cig, go to class, fuck around at Sam Ash for an hour, get lunch, and go back in. 

Having this on the corner definitely brought back many decadent memories of NoHo food runs at 2am (why do they call it NoHo? There Lotta Ho's, mang.) and buying (Quantity: One [1]) Combo Bowl every other week for the most interesting vagrant who had initiative. I guess y'all are more the Shibuya and Nobu types, huh? Taking that little ""Elite"" badge next to your name to heart, eh? 

It's aight. Bugger oof then, More inedible, disgusting slop for me! Woot!

Love, Randy"
5,"Whoa! This place surprised me. 

First off, bonus points for having what looks like a milkshake(didn't try it)(only one option tho... but it's nutella!), and awesome fries. 

The fries will remind of you of five guy's fries, but thinner, which I love. I wish more places had thin almost shoestring like fries.

Now the burger, the meat is nicely browned, lots of toppings, and the bread is soft but not so thin it will get easily soggy. Very nice burger engineering here. Topping options are awesome! Just the right amount of choices that make constructing a burger fun, and not overwhelming. 

Never tried any of the ""grilled cheese"" bread options that some places have, usually because it looks too crazy, and it really takes it beyond a burger and into frankensandwich territory. 
But this places does grilled cheese right! just regular buns that happen to have a golden crispy layer of grilled cheese on one side of each bun. It's awesome! 

I will definitely come back and highly recommend you try the grilled cheese option! it's so tastefully done."
5,Just as good as I remember from Kansas. The burgers are delicious and so is the custard
5,"Went here while visiting Montreal. It was great! So simple yet delicious. Had the special with cheese and cherry cola. Gotta have the cherry cola.  Also had the half sour pickle, next time trying the sour pickle instead. Only cash."
5,"Wow!  Susie was simply amazing for taking a last minute order over the phone.  My friend had just given birth to a baby girl and I wanted to send over flowers as I was not able to visit her that day.  As I searched for a nearby florist shop, The Dancing Dandelion popped up on my Yelp search with high ratings.  Sometimes you can't always believe the hype until you experience it for yourself...this was legit one of the best experiences ever!  Susie was warm and friendly throughout the whole interaction.  Her phone mannerisms was on point!  The whole process was seamless and she was able to do same day delivery!  I appreciate businesses who get the job done right!  I wish Susie and The Dancing Dandelion continued success!"
5,"This is by far the best BBQ joint in the Greater Cleveland area. I would highly recommend the beef brisket and pork ribs. Both dishes were top notch. Well seasoned, appropriately tender, and full off smoked flavor. Each dish was also served with guacamole and salsa on the side, giving the food a southwestern flair if desired. As a side dish I had the cornbread which was served in a cast iron pan warm out of the oven. Delicious. I topped off my meal with the chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich composed of fresh soft giant cookies around a layer of creamy vanilla ice cream. A+. 

After talking to the manager, Eric, who was extremely friendly and helpful, my wife and I learned the head cook was from Texas. After hearing this fact everything made sense. Good BBQ comes from Texas and now exists in Cleveland with its own twists. I will most definitely be back soon."
5,"This place is in a liquor store. So its food and booze, who know such genius existed. I got the Arizona/California burrito as usual. I got one taste of it and I was hooked. Ok I know its not really mexican food but it's still good. The guy that was there was really cool and the food was ready in less than 5 minutes. You get a choice of what ever toppings and sauces you want.Next time I got back I'll try the other menu items. He keeps the menu simple which is nice. I'm not standing there for 10 mins trying to pick what to eat. It may look sketch from the outside, but this place is legit."
5,I eat here everyday.  Taco and more made fresh daily. Staff is great. Large portions.  You get your moneys worth
5,"Very impressive how authentic the food is. I've lived in New York quite a long time and could not find any good vietnamese place. Came to Toronto and found this hidden gems. I had the papaya salad, spicy beef noodle soup (bun bo hue) and pork sausage (nem nuong). Both my husband and I are so pleased with all the choices. Definitely a go-back place to try everything on their menu"
5,"Their steak burgers never ever disappoint! The fries are delish! I don't always like shoestring fries but theirs are crispy and very flavorful. The fry sauce is also great! Be sure to try a custard concrete (think thick shake) before leaving. 

The cashier today was super friendly and patient while my girls figured out what they wanted to eat. Then when I told her there was a bee in the window near our booth, she caught it with a cup and napkin and released it outside, what a superhero! I don't know her name but she has an accent and deserves accolades. Thanks for the great service as always Freddy's!"
5,"We are from Canada and normally we use the large flower company chains when having flowers delivered for various events or special occasions.
We decided to talk directly with Greg at Dancing Dandelion because it was a family run business.
We placed the order and made a few changes based on Greg's reccomendations  and like everyone else who orders flowers hoped it would be a nice arrangement.
Very happy to say the recipient of the flowers loved the bouquet and after seeing a photo of the arrangement we were more than pleased with the arrangement and we definitely received our money's worth.
In the future we will only use his florist shop and will reccomend Dancing Dandelion to all of our friends.
Thank you Greg for keeping your promise not only on delivery, but for the absolutley amazing arrangement  our friend received!"
5,Awesome place!! I love thier Jucy Lucy and Utility burgers. And thier poutine and funnel cake are must haves!!
5,"I almost wasn't going to eat here cause I *just* had a bagel from Fairmount next door but vacationing is not awesome until you've stuffed yourself to exploding capacity.

My sister and I ran in, ordered a special,  and ran out. I didn't expect much but I took one bite and HOLY MOLY is baloney or whatever is in that sandwich really THAT GOOD? IT was soft and hot and delicious. I really have no idea what I ate, but it was freakin awesome. Prob one of the best things I ate in Montreal. Yup.

The actual place is small with less than 15 counter seats. I didn't really notice too much about the place other than the cup of dried sausage they had next to the register for 50 cents. I should have gotten one."
5,"Founded in the Mile End in 1932, and in the current spot since 1952, Wilensky's Light Lunch is an institution which lots of us Montrealers are deeply fond of. Most read Mordechai Richler's ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"" in high school and since several scenes take place in Wilensky's, and scenes in the 1974 film version starring Richard Dreyfuss were actually shot there, it looms in our nostalgic imaginations. The best part about it is that neither time nor local fame have changed it. You sit at the counter and are welcome. The Wilensky special or the hot dog is quickly pressed for you and slid down the counter with precision on a napkin. The soda is mixed fresh for you right before your eyes, and in quiet friendly contemplation you can read the history taped across the walls."
5,"Dr Fixler and Alicia made our horrible day more comfortable in after talking with Dr Fixler we were making the right decision for our boy Tytus. He was 12 years old and had lymphoma. Dr Fixler explained to my daughter that his quality of life was gone and he was in pain. We never felt rushed during the process at all. Dr Fixler gave our boy a sedative to help him relax while the entire family said our goodbyes. It wasn't easy!
I would highly recommend them to anyone, it's the least we could do for our beloved pet. He was so much more comfortable passing at home on his bed."
5,Xlnt!!! Clean... Tasty.. Lots of love in the place.. The bun was delicous! Fresh ingredients... Nice service.. I'll be back.. One note.. They close On wed.
5,"Tacos and burritos are amazing!!  I usually get the California burrito or 4 tacos, both are awesome.  This is the best and most authentic Mexican food I've found.  I'm lucky that my buddy told me about it, as I usually never would eat at a hole in the wall place(health concerns).  This place however surprised me, it was extremely clean and they have a large selection of beer and smokes. Definitely a go to place for the best Mexican food in town!"
5,"Would highly recommend them. Super empathetic and very kind. With the first phone call, which is very hard to make, Sara was very soft spoken and compassionate. She explained what I was to expect and she scheduled the appointment for me. Dr. Fixler and Grace were very caring and had my kitty best interest at heart. They treated her tenderly and with kindness and were patient with me during the entire procedure to make sure I was ready to say goodbye. It was a blessing to be able to have this done in our home where my kitty felt safe and not a horrible ride in a carrier to a place she didn't like anyway. She went very peacefully. Thank you Dr. Fixler, Grace and Sara."
5,"No frills, none needed! This is a classic all beef joint........paying homage to the Jewish neighborhood. Cherry coke, yes please and pickles.....I'm a happy man. Hipsters beware, nobody here is gonna cater to you. Sit down, shut up, order the special, eat your food and go on about your business. It's a damn landmark already."
5,"Dr. Fixler and his staff are angels on earth for our animals.
Other reviewers have said it better than I can say it.
I would like to add, however, that if you are considering in-home pet euthanasia vs. 
your vet's office - 1) your pet will obviously be more comfortable at home, surrounded by family and other pets 2) YOU will be more comfortable at home where you can hold your animal on the floor, in your favorite chair, on the bed, wherever you are the most comfortable, and which place means the most to you and 3) if you are going to cry (of course you will), you will not have to drive home from the vet's office sobbing and bawling.
We have done it both ways.  I will never go the vet's office again for euthanasia.
My deepest thanks and gratitude to Dr. Fixler and staff.  Truly caring and compassionate."
5,"Saying good-bye to our 19-year-old cat Mittens was so hard, but we were so relieved that her last memories were not of a frightening car ride to a vet's office full of other animal smells.  Dr. Filxer and his assistant came to my home and sat on the floor next to her favorite chair, explained everything that would happen and how it would feel to Mittens, and then let us decide how much time it took.  She went to sleep in her favorite chair, in her favorite sleeping position, in her own home.  Knowing her end was peaceful and calm made all the difference in the world to us, and to Mittens."
5,These guys are always awesome hook up the best burritos on earth don't believe come in and take a look especially when you had a hard night drinking come here and ask for el paisano burritto and they do you a favor! I love the guys here they are nice and take good care of you  keep up the good work
5,The tacos are awesome. The breakfast burrito with nacho cheese is out of control good. The cook is super friendly. Highly recommended.
5,"Wilensky's has been around since '32 and was opened up by Moe Wilensky.  Originally located on St. Urbain and Fairmount, the restaurant has been at its current location since '52.  It's currently run by the wife, Ruth, and her children, Asher and Sharon.  The hubs and I came here and we were surprised at how it seemed as if we traveled back in time.  There was only counter seating, so we just made ourselves comfortable on the stools.  They are famous for their 'Special,' which is grilled beef salami and grilled beef bologna, topped with mustard, all set on a kaiser roll, which is then pressed flat on the grill - you can have a side of sweet or sour pickles (I recommend the sour) - it was a lovely combination!  The sandwich itself isn't greasy at all, but just crispy from being pressed; the beef salami and the bologna were meaty and tasty, and I loved the simplicity of them only being topped with mustard.  I also had to get their hand-mixed soda, so I got their special cherry soda - it was delicious!  Ms. Sharon was super sweet and was super informative, and she had a great sense of humor.  The place has been featured on magazines and on food shows, but the fame doesn't seem to faze them at all (there was even a local newspaper photographer who was there, just taking pictures).  Definitely a cute little gem to check out :D

+the Wilensky 'Special'
+sour pickles
+handmixed cherry soda
+ask for Ms. Sharon :D"
5,"Seated right away on a Saturday evening.  Tasty cheese dip with chips appetizer.  Pulled pork and sausage sandwich on bun,  excellent flavors.  Waitperson friendly, attentive and fun.  Great brownie with ice cream dessert.  Will return."
5,The emergency room staff was fast and efficient.  Yet they took the time to explain the heart and lung issuues clearly and more than once if needed.  They made a good transition to the icu .  I would come here again if God forbid we have another emergency.
5,"Our sweet 9 year old cat, Bailey got sick just days ago.  After a 24 hour stay at an emergency hospital, we just couldn't get her to snap back at home.  She ended up with what the doctors thought was fatty liver disease and simply had no interest in food, treats, tuna fish, or water.  My husband and I tried for over a day to syringe feed/water her and she was simply weak and miserable and we were heartbroken doing that to her.  She was a class act girl and upon waking up today, she seemed just to live for me.  I couldn't be that selfish nor would I put her through the trauma of yet another car ride.  I went online to search and Happy Endings was the first thing that came up.  I watched the testimonial, loved how informative the website was and called.  I left a message and Alicia called me back within 20 minutes and I was lucky enough that they could help us today.  Dr. Fixler and his assistant were very kind and knowledgeable and didn't rush us with the time we needed with our girl.  Don't get me wrong, it's still as painful as can be, but in the comfort of our home without the dreaded drive was worth every penny and then some.  (They're even sending us a paw-print of Miss Bailey, which wasn't expected.)  Thank you Happy Endings, what an amazing service you provide."
5,"We found the Emergency Room of this hospital by accident, because Your Family Physician Urgent Care would not see us and it is around the corner. 

I have been to maybe 10 emergency rooms in my lifetime and this is by far the BEST experience I have ever had. They were amazingly clean, accommodating,  friendly and well trained.  The had a Patient Liaison employee that checked on us every half hour, offering a warm blanket, something to drink, etc. They had cable, with Pirates of The Caribbean playing, a very large, comfortable waiting room with nice bathroom facilities and vending machines. Paperwork was a breeze. All the staff greeted us in a friendly, helpful manner. The nurse at the front desk even clean the pens, clipboards and glass after patient use!


My only complaint is that it was a long wait, but that is par for the course in an ER."
5,"Visited The Dancing Dandelion in search of small peace lily plant to be given to our boss who'd just loss his father.  Immediately when I entered the shop I was greeted by Greg who determined my needs and picked out the perfect plant - but it wasn't in a suitable arrangement for gift giving.  Greg at first thought he didn't have a proper container in which to present so he quickly searched his stock finding one lone wicker basket (which needed some modifications), repotting it, and applying 'leaf shine' spray.   With 2 lilies about to open, the arrangement was beautiful.  The peace lily was presented to our boss last week and he truly appreciated it!

When my husband presents floral arrangements to me, he always uses The Dancing Dandelion.  However, this was the first time I'd ever visited their store.  I can see why he's a repeat customer.  I appreciate how fast Greg was able to troubleshoot the matter while ensuring that I left happy & satisfied. This family run business is top-notch and I would not hesitate to call on them in the future!"
5,"I had to say goodbye to my 14 year old Lab recently. This was one of the saddest days of my life. Dr Fixler and his wife came to my home. They were comforting and understanding. They allowed me to take my time to say goodbye. The process was fast and my Lab was calm the entire time. When the time comes to say goodbye to your beloved pet, I highly recommend using Happy Endings!"
5,What an amazing company. When we had to put our baby down it was a same day decision to ease his suffering. We contacted Happy Endings that afternoon and that evening the vet and his assistant arrived. Every part of the process in dealing with this company was designed to ease our pain and ease our baby's suffering. I will always use happy endings in the future as they have proved themselves extremely reliable and incredibly understanding of our pain
5,"Very simple food served in a cool authentic diner.
There is history here going back to the 1930s, so that says it all. Give the customers what they want and they will keep returning.
Cool to see how sodas were made ""back in the day"". A couple of scoops of syrup and carbonated water and away you go.
$7 well spent."
5,"Great selection and honest service. I had called ahead to see if a particular item was readily available for purchase and the nice gentleman on the phone walked me through descriptions of what he had to offer. Upon entering the sweet smelling little flower shop, I was not disappointed.

I was in and out in under 3 minutes. What more could a guy ask for of a flower shop?"
5,"My favourite place for pho and deep fried spring rolls. Been to all the pho shops on spadina and the supposedly best one near queen and ossington but this one remains my fav.  

The only one wish is the noodle portion could be bigger. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn't.  I guess it depends on who makes the batch that day. 

Tasty soup. Soft meat. I get pho tai. And yummy crunch spring rolls. Not stuffed with soggy veggies like other places.

Good service from the younger guy. I forget his name but I think it's the son of the two older folks."
5,Amazing doctor here delivered my son; nurses have been here a long time and made me so comfortable during my stay. It's not about the interior decorating (which isn't even old....) it's about the quality of care here. Special thanks to Dr.Bass and the nurses in pre/post delivery. I'm not low-maintenance and they went above and beyond. Keep in mind no one likes visiting hospitals alright??? :)
5,"Dr. Fixler and his staff are such a blessing.  Words really can't describe how wonderful they are... The way they handle the process is so gentle, kind and compassionate. Sadly, our 16 year old lab was struggling and her quality of life diminished greatly in the past year to the point where her mobility was comprised. For the first time in my life I was faced with the decision of keeping her alive a bit longer or allowing her to peacefully pass with no pain.  Dr. Fixler did an exam and offered treatment options, but also his honest option of how things would progress if we keep our sweet Daisy alive.  The decision was ours with no pressure just gentle advice and compassion from Dr. Fixler. The process of euthanasia with Dr. Fixler was very gentle, respectful and peaceful for our Daisy. If you are faced with this decision for your pet, first my heart goes to you, but you should 120% chose Dr. Fixler and his team at Happy Endings Euthanasia. Blessings."
5,"I ordered orchids for my Aunts birthday she couldn't believe how beautiful they are, the most beautiful she has ever seen. I was out of town so I phoned in and the process was seamless from start to finish. Thanks you have a returning customer"
5,"Great food. I really like the beef bowl. Lots of siting area. But there is something missing. ""The walls"", there is lots of windows but the walls are missing decorations. It looks like you eating in a box."
5,"I had the pleasure of doing business with Greg for a baby shower I was hosting. He paid close attention to detail, to make sure my vision was created. Greg going above and beyond allowed me to worry about one less thing. Thank you the beautiful arrangements and amazing customer service!"
5,"As Han Solo was wont to say: laugh it up, fuzzball.  For $12, beeef and I got a solid couple of Saturday night hours of genuine jocularity in an intimate venue.  The comedians were all funny with one exception, the pacing was great, and the atmosphere has an authenticity to it: the place is decorated and maintained just well enough to promote health-code-compliance-style ease but avoid pretension.  Feels like the real thing.  

Toronto is lucky to have so much available talent that a place like this can exist and charge such low admission prices--and still not gouge patrons on the beer and food.   I foresee a Comedy Bar excursion at least on a monthly basis."
5,"If you are an East side or don't live within walking, cheap uber, or convenient public transportation distance of Mabel's, you should just check out Smokin' Qs. I was totally impressed and glad I gave it a chance despite the low-ish rating on here. The waitress was a doll, both a manager and the chef stopped by to ask how everything was, and I'd eat the brisket poutine daily if my one super power was to be able to eat whatever I wanted with no consequences. 

Quick, affordable, convenient and most importantly, very tasty bbq with a variety of options on the menu (including a few for your vegetarian friend which is uncommon at bbq joints). 

Looking forward to sampling a few types of tacos at the next taco Tuesday we can make. 

If you're on the fence, give it a chance. It's worth it."
5,"Was brought with the entire family to this location, and it was a pleasant surprise.  The food is great, patties are delicous, and the custard options are fun.

The staff was very courteous and said nothing when I did something quite inappropriate at the time.  I am sorry to say I passed gas repeatedly in their establishment.  I could tell that one of the employees could smell a more serious one by the look on her face (it was silent but violent and it was just the two of us standing near the soda machine.) I thought that the amazing smell of the food would win out, but somehow it didn't.  It surprised me then, and it still does.  The way the worker handled it has made this a lot easier for me.

This employee stayed there in the offensive conditions I'd just created, and somehow managed to complete her tasks without bringing further attention to what I'd done.  She handled the experience very professionally, and even though I was nervous I was also really impressed.  I would have thanked her and told her manager that she was a good employee, but I didn't want to bring shame to myself and my family.  I didn't even see the name on her tag, just got my refill and sort of scurried off in what I thought was considerate respect.  Now I see that it was shameful, running from my responsibilities like that.  If I could go back and apologize,  I would. I guess I could, but I know that I won't.   I'm just typing it here.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for what I did to you. 

Thank you for your professional discretion and patience, mystery employee.  Would dine here again."
5,"I ordered flowers for a funeral on very short notice to be delivered on their busiest day of the year (Valentines Day). They made it happen and the flowers we're lovely. 
Greg was great, calling the night before to let me know it was ready and would be there in the morning. Thank you Greg and everyone else at the Dancing Dandelion.
I would  recommend them and they will be my first call now on if I need flowers."
5,"Best comedy club in Toronto, hands down.

Great food, great drinks, nice venue, great location. And so many great guests! I've seen Jen Kirkman, Sklar Bros, and Jimmy Pardo, and they all slayed. Opening acts have always been amazing. Hosts are terrible but that's how it goes.

Will be supporting this local institution and you should too!"
5,"The first time we went here we didn't love it, it was when it had recently opened, however, we have been back twice since and have had great experiences, the food is very good, the servers are attentive and the restaurant is great. Really like the cornbread, haven't had a bad side! Portions are generous too!"
5,"Excellent salami/bologna sandwich, pressed warm with a real egg cream soda.  All the soda flavors are unique as they make their own syrups.  Excellent value"
5,Their juicy lucy on fire is really good. It's freshly made and the buns are so soft. Be sure to try their onion rings as well
5,"The history of the Jewish community in Montreal is well documented in the books of  Mordecai Richler, one of the most important Canadian writers. His famous novel ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"" was also a made into a successful film under the same name.  Wilensky's is present in both the book and film. It was founded by Moe Wilensky in 1932. The family says Moe's father opened a hair salon down the street and sold snacks and sandwiches on the side. One day the Moe bought a panini press for $ 68, which is worth about a 1,000$ a day. His father was shocked by his decision to spend so much money on an electric device, but thanks to it Moe invented the Wilensky special"" -  a grilled beef salami and beef bologna sandwich with mustard on a kaiser roll, pressed flat on the grill. The place is a time capsule for diners of the 30's and they keep it the same as a principles: It's impossible to get the toast without mustard, they never cut the toast in half and employees are not willing to accept a tip. Celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain visits the place in almost every documented to Montreal. This will not be a transcendental experience for the taste buds Yet the old deli, the lines of pressed sandwiches on the grill, decorated by very yellow mustard, and the home-made soda drinks makes you feel like in a live food museum- and that's worth every penny."
5,"Thank you Toronto Yelpers for recommending this place to me! 

The food was great. We had the spring rolls and I had beef satay bun (vermicelli). The rolls were fresh and well-rolled. The satay beef was nice and spicy but didn't leave my mouth in pain afterward. So many places with spicy foods just kill you with heat, but this was a perfect balance. 

Service was without a lot of chat. Definitely not a lot of English spoken here, but who cares? They gave us the ticket and we wrote down our own order numbers and everything was perfect. Love it! Highly recommended!"
5,"After 13 yrs. of having my best friend at my side, it was time for me to let my precious dog go to Heaven.  
The services of  Dr. Fixler  are second to none.  The process of having my dog put to sleep in the environment of her own home, without stress was the most comforting experience for my  dog and myself.  
I can't express my thanks enough for the way t Dr. Fixler was so kind and understanding.  
I would suggest this process and this Service to anyone that is struggling with having their best friend put to rest. 
This made it so much easier on both my dog and myself.  
Thank you so much Dr. Fixler."
5,"Though it was the hardest decision I've ever made, to say goodbye to my sweet old man of a dog last month, I am so grateful for Dr. Fixler and his wife at Happy Endings. The experience could not have been more peaceful. They came into my apartment and sat on the floor next to the bed where my dog was sleeping. After an exam, they reassured me I was making the right decision and explained everything they were going to do. I gave my dog plenty of kisses through the whole thing and he passed as easily as if he were drifting asleep. They gave my boyfriend and I as much time as we needed to say goodbye. Though I was super sad that the end had come for my dog to be in my life, I couldn't have imagined a better or more loving exit than that. A few weeks later, a courier delivered his ashes to me and they now sit in a really pretty photo frame box on my shelf. Dr. Fixler and his wife have the hardest job in the world to me, but as they said, it's a labor of love for them, and for that, I am so thankful."
5,They manage to take some of the sting out of a terrible situation. The reduced stress on our poor cat and on us was a relief. The end was quiet and peaceful and worth every penny.
5,"extremely friendly staff! susie, is always the one who answers my calls and always so nice. this was my fifth time ordering from this place and they are very nice every single time.  the mixed assortment that my girlfriend just received described as the ""prettiest bouquet of flowers that she had ever seen in her life"".  i will post a picture, you can judge yourself.  these people never disappoint!"
5,"Dr. Fixler and Grace, helped our Dobie, Ginger, cross the Rainbow Bridge with dignity and peace. When they entered the house, Ginger went to them immediately and they established a bond of trust. Their calm demeanor and voices reassured us that Ginger's death meant something to them. We were given ample time to say goodbye, offering us closure. We could not have been more at ease with the difficult decision. Dorothy and I highly recommend using Happy Endings for home euthanasia of a pet."
5,"I love this place!!! They are like always open and I love their Mexican ice cream pops & the carne asada fries!!! I've also had their chimichanga, which was good too!

This is a great late night spot :)"
5,"I couldn't have wished for a better first visit.  We checked out the menu online after searching for a place to eat nearby.  Going there was the best move we could have made.

We were greeted by Afa...a huge smile and patience beyond anyone I could imagine, he painstakingly went through the entire ordering process and helped guide us through the full menu providing his favs but allowing us to decide our final order ourselves. Dan took to the grill to prepare our order while balancing a few others, presumably online orders and a couple of other walk-ins.  Dan even brought the meals to our table.

My burger, a double cheeseburger on grill cheese buns with a ton of toppings was amazing.  My wife described her single burger as ""delicious"".

The beef was seasoned perfectly, tasted wonderful and was not the least bit heavy.  Dan mentioned to a customer after us that he had ground that particular batch of beef only an hour before.  Trust me, it tasted super fresh and had a firm texture.

The fries, hand-cut were fabulous.  Shoestring fries couldn't have tasted any better.  My side order of gravy topped it off perfectly...thick (but not too thick) and tasty.

Not costing much more than most other gourmet burger joints, I was more than happy to pay the bill knowing I was getting quality angus beef, farm-raised, grain-fed, with no added antibiotics!

Without a doubt, Jackson's exceeded my expectations.  Considering that dinner was at 11pm, I'm more impressed that I won't be going to bed with a heavy, sinking feeling in my stomach.  This meal went down perfectly!

Looking so forward to my next visit...the menu is so extensive, I'm sure I'm in for another epic experience next time.

Thanks Afa & Dan...you guys made my dinner meal awesome."
5,"I wish there was a way to give this place more than 5 stars. Two visits so far and two unbelievable meals. Tremendous value, great service, great bar, great patio."
5,"Best burgers in mississauga. I have tried a lot of burgers in the GTA. With the burger competition heating up in Mississauga, I saw burger factory is still the top place. Now within the GTA, It might just barely make it to the top 5 but that is because toronto downtown itself has so many burger options that are a bit better in taste and also atmosphere"
5,"Yoshinoya, the beef bowl fast food chain from Japan.  It's beef bowl has a unique seasoning which no one can duplicate. Taste preference is up to each individual. 90% of the people I introduced Yoshinoya to have loved their beef bowl. The few who didn't like it is mainly due to the cut of their beef. The stringy and thinly sliced beef, that's most definitely frozen before being distributed to each chain restaurant.  The onions and flavoring added to the broth stock is the other half of the equation. I think its beef bowl is something you love it or hate it.  I'm happy Yoshinoya set up a shop in Vegas, despite Vegas' small city size. There's no Yoshinoya in larger cities such as Chicago or any other Midwestern cities for that matter.  It seems to be a coastal thing in the US. 
Beef bowl is what made Yoshinoya famous. So I won't comment nor do I order other items on the menu. Chicken is not too bad. I heard steak bowl is decent. But it's the beef bowl that stays true to Yoshinoya's name."
5,"I crave this stuff.....

Every time I go to Vegas I eat here as much as I can. That's saying a lot since the casinos are more then happy to comp all my meals.

I always have the beef bowl. No chicken bowl, no vegetable bowl or anything else. Just the beef bowl.

I'm not sure why some people don't like it but I love it. I think about for weeks before I get to Vegas."
5,"I couldn't believe how much I loved this sandwich. Look at that photo. It looks so ordinary, but it's so perfect. 

We walked in right at 9am, and the perfectly grumpy guy behind the counter had to take our order like 5 times before it registered in his brain. For West-coasters who have only seen this behavior in movies, it was so delightfully spot on. The truly hilarious part: there was nothing about our order that was hard to remember. We each got a Wilensky special with Swiss, a pickle, and a cherry cola (that's the order 99% of their clientele always get). It was so funny. The important part is that he got it right, and cooked it right. 

Pastrami, bologna, yellow mustard, all pressed into a roll...thing. Looks like an English muffin. Tastes like...not...that. Whatever. It's good. It's served not on a plate, but on a thin napkin on the counter in front of you. 

The man behind the counter warmed up to us and told us the story behind the place. We chatted about Portland and Montreal for a good 15 minutes as we were the only ones there at 9am (by the way, this sandwich makes a great breakfast). If I sound like I'm complaining about that guy, I'm not. The man is a true gem. 

As others have pointed out, there's no substitutions allowed. None are needed. You just have to trust that they know what they're doing."
5,"Yesterday we had to make one of the most painful decisions ever when we had to put our sweet Mel to rest.   He was with us for sixteen years so we miss him dearly.  But it was the BEST decision ever to have Dr. Fixler and Ryan come to our home.  They we so very compassionate and professional from the minute we met them.  They didn't find it unusual at all as we led them into the closet (of all places) to find our little kitty where he was the most comfortable.   Having to NOT bring our cat to the vet made it 100% better because of how stressed he would get when having to go there.  We didn't want his last memory to be in any way negative.  The calmness and gentleness with which Dr. Fixler handled the whole situation was exceptional.  He explained everything to us beforehand, so we were at peace upon making the right decision.   Although our home now seems so empty without our furry family member, we are at peace knowing that he is now at peace too.  Thank you so much Dr. Fixler from the bottom of our hearts.    And anyone I know that might need this service will always come so highly recommended by us, again and again."
5,"Good food for a late night craving! We had their nachos and we were able to add whatever we wanted on top. Asada was tender and had a good flavor, not to fatty. The salsas were good and were just spicy enough to pack a punch but still allowed us to enjoy our food. They had a lot of other things that looked really good that I wanted to try but the nachos were more than enough. 
If your not super hungry the nachos serve 2 people. I could have def ate them all myself though if I was hungry enough. 
You have a great array of drinks to pick from seeing that its a convenience store. Its worth a try if your in the area, I highly recommend the nachos with asada!"
5,"I really liked the atmosphere, food and don't even get me started on the fry sauce - yum-o!!!!! I ordered a veggie burger which was good but the Freddy sauce really made the difference between a good sandwich and a really good one lol. I want to try the desserts next! Oh, but wait I don't think I can put fry sauce on that LOL!"
5,"Having moved here from the NW and still finding the good burger joints, I can say I can add this to my list of top burgers. Their burger patty's are reminiscent of my childhood growing up in Texas. Thin and crispy. The fries are are fantastic, nice and crispy. 
I will be back as often as possible. Side note. The staff was very friendly and engaging. Our 3 year granddaughter was so happy they complimented on her dress."
5,"My wonderful husband wanted to surprise me with flowers for our 30th wedding anniversary. Our daughter has a corporate account here & talked to Greg, the owner, about putting something special together that incorporated a few of our wedding flowers. It was beautiful! Thank you Greg."
5,"The food was great!  When I go out, I want good food.  Drinks are drinks and service is service, but the food makes all of the difference.  I have heard some people complain about various aspects, but it all comes down to the food.  I have never been a smoked meat guy, mostly because it is so hard to perfect.  There is usually too much smoke and that's all I can taste. However, at Smokin' Q's, it tastes like the smoke was meant to be there and occurred naturally.   I don't know how to describe it any better.  It was fantastic.  I read that someone thought the mac-and-cheese was runny?  They must have brought that in from their home because the mac-and-cheese I got was thick and fantastic!  The brisket cannot be beat.  I recommend this place to everyone that is looking for BBQ or just looking for a cool place to have a drink.  The patio is great, as long as it isn't too humid outside.  I have eaten there and had food to go several times and it has never disappointed!!  Try it, you'll love it!"
5,"Just decided to eat here on a whim and am glad we did! Friendly staff, delicious burgers and fries. Their signature Jack sauce is soooo good. Good quality food. Will definitely come back!"
5,"Do business with a local company. I placed an order for delivery over the phone with Susie. She was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. The price with delivery was the same as the ""sale"" price of the big on-line company we all know. I'll definitely use them again."
5,"We have used Happy Endings services twice now. 
After 16 years and a lot of love, we had to make the tough decision for Oscar. He was struggling due to a heart condition and we knew it was time.  People say your pets are a part of the family, and this is an understatement for Oscar.  He was more like our first kid, and is older than both of my kids.
It was a difficult call to make and to schedule the day and time, but Alicia was really kind.  She was a great listener, and made us feel comfortable with the decision.  They were available to come on short notice, which in our situation was critical.  
The day of was tough, but Dr Fixler made it comfortable for us.  They were so professional and respectful, thinking of things that I wouldn't have to make it more meaningful.
We had sufficient time to say goodbye, other pets to say goodbye, and the process was very comfortable for our old man.  Dr. Fixler made this process as good as it could be given the situation."
5,This place is amazing. I have ordered 3 times from them and everytime the delivery was on time and the flowers were perfect.  I recently ordered out of their range and they still accommodated me.  Highly recommend this place for your flower needs.
5,"Had the compressor and it was pretty good. Bun was not too thick and beef tasted fresh. Burger was actually very hot to eat so had to be careful. Solid flavour. Wish they had malt vinegar. 

Been back a second time. The burger meat is consistently very good. I would go so far as to say this is one of the best burgers in Toronto"
5,"Can Always count on these guys!  Greg was great!  Better than I thought possible.  Not a huge flower person, but now I am a believer.  Thanks."
5,"Awesome place :) i go there bi weekly for either the burgeritto or the lamb burger. Its tasty and the fries are super amazing (really big portions to be labled small fries).
Service is the best. Friendly and able to keep the guest entertained.
Con
Its a small place so it can be crowded."
5,"Abrazo Arrowhead was as amazing as a hospital experience can be. I was in the ER in the morning and was released but my symptoms got worse and worse and went back around 11 pm. I was fortunate as there weren't many people there but they took me back instantly and I quickly received an IV and medication. My symptoms were pretty severe so they decided to admit me. I was there a total of 7 days and the doctors wouldn't release me until I was ready. I received amazing care, the doctor came in and spoke with me each day and my nurses were absolutely incredible! Adam and Courtney were the most AMAZING nurses and people I have ever met. They always tried to keep me comfortable and were incredibly attentive and always such a pleasure to interact with. If I continue to have health issues I will make sure to go back to Abrazo Arrowhead."
5,Literal hole in the wall joint with amazing Mexican street food tucked into a liquor store/convenience  store. California burrito was full of fresh ingredients and tons of flavor. Salsa and guacamole are spicy. Huge portions. Enjoyed finding my favorite peach iced tea!
5,"We had exceptionally good service here when my wife had a recent stay for a few days.  She was transported from one of their mini-ER locations, and it all went well.  The nursing staff was very friendly, helpful, and efficient.  It was rare that we had to ask for something, and everything we asked for, we got.  They were often in the room asking if we needed anything.

The room was clean and in good condition.  Very spacious too.

Nobody wants to be in a hospital, but if I had to be, I'd choose this place."
5,"I was in the area (my old neighborhood) and I had a hankering for subs.  But Freddy's doesn't serve subs, you say.  You would be correct.  I drove to my favorite sub place and it turned out that the power entire shopping center where the sub place was located was out.  So much for feeding that sub craving. 
 I consulted my trusty yelp ap for another option.  This is where Freddy's enters the picture.  I got the California style burger, which basically means it has their special sauce on it.  They grill their burgers really flat at the edges which makes the edges sort of crispy and charred.  It actually added flavor, but I can see how some people wouldn't be a fan of that. 
 It wouldn't be a meal if it didn't end with dessert, so I ordered a mini vanilla custard with cookie dough on top.  The vanilla custard was so creamy and delicious and you could tell that the cookie dough was top quality (and trust me, I know my quality cookie dough!)  I would absolutely go back, especially for a sweet treat fix!"
5,"You guys are excellent. I ordered online for a delivery, i wasn't sure how this would turn out but my expectations were blown. If anyone has any reservations about ordering online, I can say through my experience they delivered exactly and was told these flowers were beautiful. Thank you guys again for a easy transaction. I greatly appreciate it. I feel good knowing when I order in the future, I don't have to worry if they will get delivered correctly or how they will look. Definitely a 5 star review is needed. You definitely got my business in the future."
5,We said goodbye to our sweet Pixie last night. Dr. Fixler and his tech were very respectful of our feelings. Dr. Fixler spent time with aPixie and gave her a quick exam before agreeing that this was the necessary course of action for her comfort. He explained everything and told us what we could expect. He was very gentle when handling Pixie. They were both understanding of the tears and we were able to be right beside her the whole time. I would highly recommend Happy Endings if you are ever unfortunate enough to need their services.
5,"It was the most heart-wrenching decision but I'm so glad I made it for my sweet Honey Bear who was succombing to cancer and I'm so glad I chose Dr. Fixler/Happy Endings to help. As upset as I am about the loss of my beloved pet, I am so thankful kind souls like Dr. Fixler and his team are available to help through this difficult time. Happy Endings made this extremely hard decision slightly easier to bear by being extremely compassionate and professional throughout. My Honey Bear could not have passed any more peacefully and I take comfort in knowing  that."
5,"Don't normally write reviews but this place deserves the 5 stars I gave! Flavorful burger, cooked just right made with perfection. Definitely try it out if you're in the area. You will not regret it. Excellent food."
5,This is by far my favorite place to get something to eat! I live a block away and I go here 3 to 4 times a week for dinner. The food is amazing and the customer service here is awesome. Very good selection of alcohol and anything else you would want. Strongly recommend to anyone even if you don't live in Tempe.
5,"No place quite like this I've ever seen or been to.  Plopped a squat on the bar and ordered me a cream soda and a bologna sandwich.  Tried to act all discreet like we've been here before.  Couldn't help myself and struck up a conversation with what appeared to be the boss, and she could not have been more friendly!

I can see why they call this light lunch, don't come here if you're extremely hungry.  Unless of course you want to eat 3 bologna sandwiches.  But you very well may want to after you've tried these!  Best bologna sandwich I've ever had."
5,"During one of the worst experiences of my life, Happy Endings was passionate and professional, handling the entire situation with the most delicate nature. I didn't have to 'know' anything, as they walked me through the entire process. My children were included that sad day and Happy Endings knew just how to include them so they understood."
5,We can't say enough about the care our sweet Buddy has received. His care has improved the quality of his life and he was able to be with the family through Christmas. We are very grateful.
5,"Recently sent a girlfriend some get well flowers. Unfortunately, I didn't like the first arrangement they sent to her. In my opinion it looked sparse. Although my girlfriend loved them, I wasn't happy and called the florist to complain. No questions asked, they sent her another amazing bouquet and had them delivered within the hour. I would definitely recommend this florist and will use them in the future. Can't pay for better customer service."
5,"We've been here so many times that they actually know us by name. Fantastic staff and even better burgers. The funnel cakes are to die for. I'd recommend getting it with strawberries and ice cream. 

My go-to is he Juicy Lucy combo with fries."
5,"Their special sandwich is simplest sandwich ever and SO good: a roll with bologna, salami, cheese (swiss or cheddar) with mustard on a flat, grilled roll.

I never even loved mustard until I tried it on this sandwich. It really adds so much to the sandwich. 

Line moved quick, sandwiches were cheap, AND I was pretty full.

The sandwich will make you feel nostalgic, and so will the décor. Full of old school CDs and books."
5,Greg is amazing! Beautiful flowers and better than I ordered since they were out of the size vase it needed! If you're worried about ordering from out of town/state like I was (I have horror stories from dot com mass flower companies) this place will ease all your fears! I will use them every time I order flowers for friends in Vegas from now on and will be telling them to do the same!
5,"This place is the best. The comedy and improv is the best. The people are the best. Everything about this place is the best.
I need not say anymore other then just go already. Cus it is the best."
5,"On a campus that prides itself on keeping it's Forks Up, this is the only place that will force you to put then down. You are going to need both hands for these massive burritos. That's right. You will be double fisting your way through the California burrito, the Fiji, the surf and turf... The list goes on and on. I have driven here from the west side many times - passing literally hundreds of other burrito options along the way, mind you - just to indulge on one of these creations. Great people, great prices, great quick service...and don't forget to grab a couple fireball shots for a buck on the way out. I wish there were a 6 star option..."
5,"Sooo delicious! I decided to write this after waking up from a Freddie's Food coma. The remnants of fry sauce and what I believed to be a splotch of chocolate concrete laid smeared on my shirt. 

Now for those of you who really enjoy a burger, good fries, and a chocolate thick shake you will be familiar with this type of food driven debachary. 
Their burgers are not the traditional type. They are a bit heavy tasting for this lady. I am an ""In and Out"" burger fan so this is your heads up. The burgers taste like they are cooked on a grill then flash fried in something that resembles fair food. (You know! You go to the fair and they fry just about everything. Twinkles, corn dogs, and things on sticks) 
The French fries are amazing! I told my son that a rainbow riding unicorn just ran into my mouth as I shoved in a crispy delicious fry. He  just stared at me in stone cold 4 year old flare said,""I don't even know what that tastes like! At that point, his dry humor was oblivious to me because I was gorging myself on the chocolate heaven known as ""the concrete.""
Holy custard chocolate, marshmallows, and whip cream mixed within a thick heavenly delight. BEST SHAKE like desert EVER! My 4 year old entered into a chocolatey dirt and worms trip that must have been good because his face was smeared with chocolate, gummy worms and Oreos. He passed out on the ride home after emptying his bowl.

Don't even get me started on the fry sauce! It's like magical sauce made in a magical place by small little fairy like creatures! I occasionally follow the 5 second rule but not with anything liquid... HOWEVER... I have now made an exception to this policy for Freddie's fry sauce. So yummy!"
5,"It's always fun to write a 5-star review...to share that you found the greatest restaurant or best hotel.  Well I did find the greatest veterinarian under the saddest circumstances, and it warrants a 5-star review even if it's lacking the fun factor.  

Suzi was a scrapper, no doubt about that.  We brought her home from the hospital 3 months ago blind, deaf, and extremely weak following a severe seizure.  As soon as she was home, she knew it.  But would she use the ""handicapped"" litter box I brought for her?  Nope, she made the trek to her box with the big step up without so much as bumping into a wall, though I had to carry her back out of it.  But with minimal medications and more love than she could stand, she quickly recovered, including her eyesight, to everyone's amazement but her own.  We were blessed she had weeks ahead of quality life with us, but are heartbroken she took a turn for the worse on Thanksgiving night with two seizures only two days apart.  At 19+ years, it was obviously her time.  We called Happy Endings.

Dr. Fixler offers 24/7 service and now limits his practice to in-home euthanasia.  With a background in internal medicine and orthopedic surgery, he told me while in general practice, he found a need for this type of service and thought it was always ""the right thing to do,"" but he couldn't always be there for his patients.  Now he can.  Offering valley-wide service, you can schedule a time that's right for you, but he's also available for emergencies.  He and his wife, Alicia, came quickly to Suzi's rescue. They are truly two of the most beautiful people you will meet...caring, thoughtful, and professional at the same time.  He explained each step of the procedure and uses a combination sedative to ensure your pet is completely comfortable.  And she was (although she gave him one good hiss just before the sedative).  Although we handled Suzi's arrangements ourselves, Happy Endings can do it for you.  Lots of information on his website.  Read it before you have to.  Bookmark it before you need it.  

I wish I could say that I had one of those storybook endings where your pet looks lovingly into your eyes and says ""thank you.""  I didn't get that when I lost either of my kitties.  But this one was smoother, and hopefully Little Lu did have a Happy Ending.

We miss you Lu Lu."
5,"These guys are the best. Friendly service and some of the best Mexican food in Tempe. they've got everything too from bongs, to cheap liquor, and cigars. Go here at least once a week for something."
5,"I just can't say enough how amazing this place is!! I have used them a few times, once being for my brother in laws memorial service in August. The flowers were amazing and customer service excellent. I called again when I needed to send flowers to my sister for my brother in law in heaven on their wedding anniversary, once again beautiful flowers and amazing, kind customer service. I would recomment this business to everyone for any floarl needs for any occasion. Thanks Dancing Dandelion!!!!"
5,"I've ordered from many flower shops before and I was not as satisfied as I am with Dancing Dandelion.  Their flower arrangements are just too cute - my favorite one is called Another Year Rover.  It's a basket of flowers that look like a puppy.  A-DOR-A-BLE!!!

You can place your order online or over the phone.  I have an account with them which makes my life so much easier since I send out birthday flowers at least once a month.  They have same day delivery.  They always do a wonderful job."
5,Ordered two of the princess paws. Greg was able to make one a boy for me. They turned out perfect! They delivered when promised as well! The customer service and quality is what makes it 5 star. I live way north west and will still utilize then in the future.
5,Dr. Fixler came to us at nearly 9pm. He could not have been more helpful and kind. He is truly doing noble work and I can only echo the five-star reviews here.
5,"One of my favorite burger places anywhere. The ""Burgerrito"" is my favorite with a really delicious avocado patty deep-fried in addition to a tasty thin beef patty. I've tried a few other burgers including the ""Canada Eh!"", and the ""Burogie"" and they have all been great!  I also love the thin-cut fries either as-is or as Poutine."
5,"Greg was amazing!  He was patient and thoughtful as we discussed how to make a beautiful flower arrangement for my mom's memorial service.  

I found all the traditional arrangements really tacky and boring; with his help we designed a gorgeous arrangement truly reflective of my mom.  It also coordinated well with all of the printed materials and we were able to incorporate my mom's clan scarf.  He also designed corsages (for my mom's sisters and best friends) with my mom's favorite flower (gardenia) that he had to special order, and then wait on me to deliver the specific tartan ribbon to incorporate into the design.  They all loved them and took special pride in wearing them.

They delivered the arrangement (despite it being quite a distance from their shop) and had it set before I even arrived, which was such a stress relief.  

I cannot say enough nice things about them.  Their shop has cute little knick knacks too, and I bought a friend's birthday card and my friend bought herself a handmade art deco vase."
5,"Great service - great looking arrangements. I was just about to drive away because the front doors were locked, when the owner came back from getting a drink at a store in the same parking lot. Suggestion - leave a note on the window saying you will be back in 5 minutes. You almost  lost a sale because I was in the process of driving away when I saw you unlock the front door. Will definitely use again."
5,"My grandma turned 80 years young today and I was not able to get back to Las Vegas to celebrate with my family.  I decided this morning, yes this morning to send her flowers.  I looked at yelp and narrowed it down to three places.  The dancing dandelion had great reviews and l loved that I could see examples and prices on their web page.

I called them first to ask questions and was so excited the buck stopped here.  I decided to do the basket with the carnation dog as my grandma love loves loves dogs!  Susie told me that had one ready that was in reds and yellows.  I explained I really wanted pinks, greens and purples too and I could pay extra.  She said they could do that.

It was only $12 to deliver to summerlin and she said it would get there by 2pm.  I called at 10am!  I asked if there was any watt they could email me a picture.  She actually said yes!  I always get nervous ordering flowers over the phone.. Within 20 minutes she called me at work to ask if liked the picture because she did not want me to be unhappy. I can't access my personal email email and was going to check in a couple of hours on my lunch on my cell which was in my car.  She offered to send it to my work!  It was exactly what I wanted. Susie also emailed me and told me it was out for delivery!  

My grandma had her flowers by noon!  She was so happy and had never seen a carnation dog!  She said it made her birthday!  Thank you Susie and the dancing dandelion for helping me!  I will be coming to you for all my vegas flower needs!"
5,"I've been to this location several times and though I don't typically review fast food joints this one definitely deserves some kudos. The employees are ALWAYS nice and fast/efficient. I typically go here during lunch time when it is fairly busy and have never waited more than a few minutes for my food..pretty impressive considering this isn't like MCD's where everything is already made and sitting under a warmer. 

Even though it isn't on the menu any longer you can get a burger dog - delicious!

cheers!"
5,"Absolutely the best place for comedy anywhere. Fun, casual atmosphere, great food, great staff. They bring in the best talent, local and otherwise. Never have a bad night here."
5,Dr. Fixler came to our house and put down our 13 year old border collie Max today. He could not have been more respectful to our situation.
5,"Do you need to wire money to Nigeria while eating a delicious burrito and shopping for a new bong? This is your dream store! Do you need brass knuckles, a digital scale that looks like an iPhone 3 and Carne asada fries that will knock your socks off? Come on down! This place seriously can do everything you've ever dreamed of. The service is top notch. Dine in, carryout, holidays, mornings and evenings. If I could count how many times I've eaten a 5 dollar double cheeseburger while cashing paycheck here it would be a lot."
5,"My golden was very old and towards the end immobie. I called Happy Endings on the day and they fit me in to their schedule immediately. Dr Fixler and his assistant Jasmine were very compassionate to our needs. They moved the process along when it needed to be and gave us the time we needed. Our dog passed without any discomfort and very peaceably. Having this service is pricey but so worth what we would have had to go through trying to get our pet to the vet and all that would have been associated with that. Thank you so much, Dr. Fixler and Jasmine."
5,I needed a same day delivery and they came through with flying colors!  I would definitely order from them again!!
5,My Sonny sent me flowers and They absolutely took my breath away!! Fabulous awesome!!!
5,"This place is legitimately a diamond in the rough for me. 

My fiancee's cousin is in a comedy troupe that performs here regularly and I love it to bits (the troupe and the bar). 

Near Bloor and Ossington this bar offers a lot in its' charm and variety of entertainment. I've had the Baked Mac and Cheese and the make a mean Gin and Tonic. It's a great way to wind down before having a laugh or two with some of the shows that they run regularly."
5,Wilensky.  Kind of like a museum and kind of like a restaurant.  Really great service.  Really cool space.  Special is special.  Great history and great food.
5,"There is really nothing more I can say that hasn't already been said by most every reviewer here. I have no doubt that contacting Happy Endings was the best decision for my furry friend, and myself.   All the staff I had contact with at Happy Endings, from the initial phone call to the Dr.'s arrival, were caring, polite, and professional.  For me, having this done by Dr. Fixler in my home, made the grieving process a little easier.  I think that's because my little girl was sent off peacefully in a place she felt most comfortable, and I felt no guilt or doubt, wondering if I did the right thing at the right time.  I feel so fortunate to have stumbled upon Happy Endings online, purely by chance."
5,"After 14 years of unconditional love from our Rosie she and my wife and I knew the time had arrived. Rosie was a great dog who only asked for our love in return for her's. When I was home Rosie was my shadow that followed me from room to room, slept at my bedside, and cried at the garage door until I returned home. While watching TV she would lay on the floor with her head on my feet to make sure Daddy didn't ""escape"". She never liked her trips to the Vet so as the day grew closer I searched and found Happy Endings. It was indeed a blessing.

Dr. Fixler and Ryan showed up on time and showed so much compassion not only to Rosie, but to my wife and I. There was no rush and he wanted us to also be ready. Rosie meanwhile had laid down with her head on my feet, her favorite spot. She did not move as they prepared her and when the final seconds come I could feel the weight lifting off my feet as her sole left her body.

I think when the time comes we all owe it to our pets and their humans to call Happy Endings. They sure made a painful experience less painful for us."
5,My friend is turning 50 in a few days and turned to Yelp to find the best florist for a special flower arrangement for her.  She lives in Las Vegas and I live in Honolulu so Yelp is a great tool to find the best business for our buck.  The great thing is you can go to the web to further research the best product for your needs.
5,"If I was rating the online promises and promotions that come from whichever state answers your call, I would probably give them a 1.  But if you contact or go to the office in Henderson and deal with Justina, you will not be able to get better service from any provider.  She is honest, professional, and most of all understanding when you have issues or problems getting your system connected.  I ordered the internet service and had problems getting my modem and router to connect.  She never gave up on me and made sure I got the tech support I needed to get online.  

No matter if you deal with Cox, Time Warner, or Century Link, it is the customer service that makes the company who they are.  If Century Link could clone Justina to be the standard of excellence whenever we called in, life would be so much more simple!"
5,"I sent a cute basket of flowers with a ""dog"" made of carnations to a friend's sister who is terminal with cancer and they delivered quickly to the hospital with a nice basket as requested."
5,Nurse Britni S. was my nurse in the ED at Abrazo and I cannot thank her enough for helping me as much as she did. She helped me to feel at ease when I was freaking out and was so great about telling me EVERYTHING that was going on or about to happen. Absolutely loved her & the hospital.
5,"There are a lot of burger joints in downtown Toronto, but this one stands above them all. If you want a diet-friendly hamburger, you want a salad. If you want a burger that's as cheap as possible, get McD. If you want to fall head-over-heels-in-love-with-you with a hamburger, look no further. The Triple Threat burger will make you will wonder why you ever loved anything else."
5,"*The shop was featured on Mind of a Chef with Anthony Bourdain and David Chang of Momofuku
*Note that if you don't like mustard, do not come to this place. They will not take out the mustard or cut the sandwich in half for you, that's just how they have been serving since 1932! 
*this is more of a grab-and-go place. 
*The staff behind the counter were friendly and happy to discuss about the shop and its history. 
*there aren't any fancy plates utensils here. All the sandwiches were served on a napkin or in a brown bag.

-Wilensky's special (made with all-beef bologna and salami and swiss cheese) - $5
The sandwich was GLORIOUS. So simple yet so good. If you don't know what kind of cheese to choose, I would recommend the swiss cheese over the cheddar as the former is a bit milder, which would enhances the flavor of the sandwich. I regret not ordering the pickles and their soda as I heard Wilensky has syrups in house that they mix with soda, and there are so many flavors to choose from!"
5,"I was quite ill with the flu when it was rampant during flu season and I went to Arrowhead Hospital for treatment because I was having a difficult time managing my symptoms...The Emergency Department staff was fabulous!  They treatment me like a member of their own family...After IV fluids, anti-nausea, anti-vomiting medication I felt so much better! 

I sincerely thank Arrowhead Hospital for the best service I ever received in a hospital!  Caring, committed staff that goes the extra distance for excellence in customer service!"
5,Excellent place to enjoy traditional vietnamese food i  highly recommend the bo la lot and nem nuong wraps. Rice dishes are also delicious and a must try
5,"This place is so underrated! I loved everything from the moment I walked in to the moment I finished my burger! workers are great, helpful and fast. Service is excellent and most importantly, their burgers are amazing. You can add whatever you want to the burgers, there's so much options (for an extra charge obviously) but i think all the sauces are free and they bless you. Their jackson sauce is a must have! Definitely recommend this place"
5,"Wilensky's.. en un mot: Institution. 

La recette magique du parfait sandwich, simple et délicieux, c'est eux qui l'ont. Bon je suis un peu biaisé, puisque Wilensky et moi retournons à mon enfance. Eh oui, je mange le même sandwich depuis plus de 25 ans. Par contre eux, la font depuis genre 85 ans.

Ma commande:
- Un spécial Wilensky avec fromage (des fois 2)
- 1 cornichon à l'aneth
- un pepperoni

Ils font de délicieux sodas maison, mais j'essaie de me tenir loin des boissons gazeuses.

L'endroit a, jusqu'à mon plus lointain souvenir, toujours eu le même décor. Vient de là une grande partie de son charme.

Je donne 6 étoiles à Wilensky bien sûr!"
5,"First time here and I was really impressed. I got the double steakburger California style and it was fantastic. The seasoning was perfect, it was cheesy and the beef was tender. The shoestring fries were crispy and tasty. The chicken tenders had a crispy and peppery crust and were moist.  My wife loved the frozen custard which is basically ice cream. Definitely coming back!"
5,"I cannot even begin to explain how absolutely wonderful the emergency room staff and surgery staff were. I was very emotional about while I was there and then in so much pain because of it... Both staffs were truly beyond what any words can describe. They were helpful, polite, funny, courteous, knowledgeable and comforting. They made a horrible situation a a very comforting experience! It was hard to remember all names  but shout to ER: Emily, Tyler, Donny and Dr.Seth. Surgery staff: Jennifer, Colleen, Dr. Brotsky and many more that I regret not knowing their names. Truly... THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart!"
5,"Honestly, this place made my freshman years. Despite its appearance, Paisano's is one of the best Mexican food places around. They've got a great selection at affordable prices, and have some of the nicest people servicing you. If you're new to Tempe, you have to try this place"
5,"One of the roughest days ever!  Having to say goodbye to one of our babies was so emotional. I was a wreck and so was the rest of my family. We all got to say our goodbyes in private, our dog was in her home with familiar surroundings and those that loved her most. Our other dog got to say his farewell too.  So compassionate and understanding... this doctor and assistant were absolutely wonderful. I have shared my story with family and friends many times about how great this service is during a time that is heart-wrenchingly painful. Thank you for being so caring!"
5,I love the comedy bar.  Every night of the week they have something going on and maintain a high caliber of talent for incredibly reasonable prices.  I also really appreciate that they support local talent and have events like Wheel of Improv that give armatures the opportunity to get up and practice in front of an audience.   I am here at least once an month and really feel that the city would be much poorer for not having this venue.
5,"Comedy Bar is a gift to the Bloorcourt neighborhood.  With comedy shows of all different flavors - improv, stand up, sketch, and more - there's a little something for everyone here at Comedy Bar.

The business has been ""unofficially"" open since the late spring, but only had its official opening in November 2008.  But in the short time it has been open, Comedy Bar has already managed to wriggle its way into the hearts of comedians, comedy lovers and reviewers alike.

With a full stage and versatile performance area that can go from cabaret style to straight seating to open space for dance or Rock Band parties, groups have flocked to book their shows here.  Even while renovations were still going on, the bar had shows nearly every night of the week.  Now that the kitchen is open and the bar stocked, it is set to be a great venue for the long haul.

The kitchen hasn't been open long enough for me to get a full sample of the menu, but I can tell you that it is both ambitious and impressive, and nowhere near your usual ""pub grub"" type offerings.  The staff at the bar are all friendly and funny to boot.  Be sure to ask for the bar's signature drink, the Sexy Hangout.

Not only are troupes performing nightly, but some of the city's best festivals such as the Fringe Festival, the Toronto Improv Festival and the Toronto Sketch Festival all call Comedy Bar home for performances."
5,"Beautiful flowers every time!

My husband loves flowers and for Valentine's Day of 2017 I told The Dancing Dandelion that I needed an arrangement of blue and white flowers with some greengage for my husband. I left everything up to them and told them no Lily's. They came up with the most beautiful arrangement ever! 

So I decided to give them another go. My mother loves sunflowers and this time I picked an arrangement from their website and asked for no Lily's. I could of done with out the autumn leafs but never the less it was gorgeous."
5,"As a native Texan I am always skeptical of new BBQ places, however, Smokin' Q's really surprised me! The brisket was delicious and the service was impeccable! Shout out to Manager Eric for being so present and gracious! My husband and I will definitely be back."
5,"We've used their services twice, and they are absolutely amazing. From the very beginning they were comforting and helpful.  The vet asked us health questions about our dogs to make sure that euthanasia was the best possible choice; I imagine it was more for peace of mind, to help us understand that we were doing the right thing.  They were patient and kind and went through the process with us in detail, and allowed us all the time we needed to say goodbye to our pups.  When it was all over they were professional and gentle as they shrouded the patient and carried him away.  Without hesitation I recommend these people to anyone who has to say goodbye to their pet. Thank you for your wonderful help."
5,"I've used their service 2x in the last 6 months and don't know where I would be without them.

Last October I had an unfortunate decision to make regarding my rescue baby girl Gypsy.  9 Years prior to October he was born feral on the streets of west Phoenix and she found me a year later.  She was a black Chow Chow/Coyote mix according to out vet and she gave me her heart immediately.   She was the best female dog I could have ever asked for.  In October she was diagnosed with incurable pancreatitis and began to suffer.  I called Happy Endings to come to my home and help her move on to a better place. The staff could not have been any more helpful and understanding.  Dr. Fixler is one of the most compassionate people I have ever met and Gypsy was able to let go in a very peaceful and painless way.  They returned her ashes in a timely fashion (about 2 weeks) with the wooden urn I had picked out.

The most unfortunate part of their service is that I had to call them again 2 weeks ago.  My first pet and best friend Undertaker ('Taker for short) had come to the end of his golden years after living an amazingly full life.  I rescued him in 2001 as a 1 year old Border Collie/Lab mix and we never left each other's side.  He travelled with me from Phoenix, to Colorado, to Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and we eventually came back to Phoenix a few years ago.  Dr. Fixler even remembered us when he came back.  'Taker was very old and in tremendous pain and it was extremely difficult to let go but knowing that he was in good hands and would soon see his lost sister Gypsy made it a little easier.

This post serves as a testament to their process and as a thank you to their staff.  I hope I never have to make these decisions in the future, but if I do, I will certainly use Happy Endings again.  I would recommend their services to anyone.  Thank you, Happy Endings Staff, I lost my 2 best friends in the last 6 months and you made the process comfortable and easy.  You are legitimate kind spirits and words cannot express my true gratitude."
5,"The place is clean, you can see the kitchen. The cook is super nice and the guy @ the register too.  We ordered the California burro and 2 tacos 1 carne 1 pollo.  Gluten free friendly - and easy to sub anything you can't or don't want. 

I was iffy about going here because I had only seen ASU  students say they go here on the weekend and they  love filibertos and Taco Bell equally when they're drunk.  Not the same at all there is someone cooking all day and happily doing it."
5,"I am so grateful for this service and I would give 10 stars if I could.  Using Dr. Fixler and Happy Endings was the best decision I could have made for my ailing Labrador.  I called at 9:30am on a Saturday morning and they arrived by 12:30pm.  First we sat on the floor with Sparky and Dr. Fixler asked me about the dog's history, we talked at length and then agreed that Sparky was probably headed for a traumatic event if I waited.  The last thing I wanted was to wait too long and wind up in the ER, which I have done with other dogs.  Dr. Fixler and his assistant explained the process and allowed me all the time I needed and most importantly, Sparky suffered no stress or trauma.   

My regular vet would have come to my house, but I needed to give them several days of advance notice and looking back, I think Happy Endings was a better choice because this is what they do, and they do it with great care and compassion for both the pet and people.

I have told all of my pet loving friends about Happy Endings and I will definitely use them again. It's a very difficult decision to make and this time I got it right.  Thank you Happy Endings!"
5,"Service is genuine and friendly, food is soooo good. It helps that it's close to home. Will definitely go back."
5,"FLOWER POWER!  I don't send flowers very often, but had two clients who lost their husbands in one week, so sad, and I wanted to reach out to them with something cheerful to send my love...  I looked at quite a few florist pages in town and really liked the Dancing Dandelion and ended up sending them each the bouquet LOVELY LILLY AND ROSE FOR FALL because of the beautiful and bright yellow and orange, and what a great combination without tons of cheap little filler like others do!

This was my first time ordering from them, so then I sat back and waited...

I received calls from both women, raving about how beautiful and cheerful the arrangements were! (Sigh of relief!)  One woman even stated that earlier she received an arrangement from a family member that was so hideous in presentation that when DANCING DANDELION brought our bouquet, she took a photo of IT (instead of the hideous one) TO SEND TO HER FAMILY MEMBER to thank them for their thoughtfulness!

Don't let your floral money be a waste, call the Dancing Dandelion like I will again and again!"
5,update: just tried the crispy crepe and i'm in love!! delicious the next day on rice w some lime
5,Best Viet restaurant in TO. Family run. Super friendly. Never had a bad meal.
5,"While planning my wedding from CA, I found this shop on Yelp! So glad I did! Greg is by far the best priced in Vegas, and does superior work! He did 10 centerpieces for us, 8 bridesmaid bouquets and a throw bouquet. I told him my budget and ideas and he made it happen! If you're looking for someone to do your wedding flowers, call Greg! The whole process was so painless and easy! He was on time, and set up and delivered everything for us! Thanks Greg! You're the best."
5,Great service great food ! A repeat customer and it never disappoints !!!! Had the cheeseburger with poutine and it was perfect !!!!!
5,"My husband, son and I went here for lunch today.  It's sort of like In and Out sort of, but  less crowded and more selections.

The food is tasty.  They are friendly.  A person kept coming around to clean up any messes, but not too frequently.  The menu had a good selection of burgers, philly cheesesteak, hot dogs.  They also had ice cream stuff, but I didn't look closely at this.

The fries were like shoestring, which we prefer bigger fries, but they gave a lot (a little too much).  

My husband had a burger.  He liked it.  My son had a chili dog.  He liked it.  I had a philly cheesesteak and I liked it.  Though, I would rather have a better cheese with it as this tasted like Velveeta."
5,"We were so happy with our sympathy flowers for our Dad's service. Greg did an outstanding job of creating a beautiful arrangement. We were thrilled! When I was looking for a flower shop (from out of town) I loved that they were a local, family run business. They answered my questions quickly, cared about my order, were very friendly and had the flowers ready ahead of the pick up time the morning of the service. I really didn't want to work with a chain flower shop that didn't care about the result. The pricing was very reasonable and the layout of their website was great. We love the Dancing Dandelion and we will be back for more!"
5,"I recently had my third c-section at Abrazo Arrowhead. I had a wonderful experience. The nurses, aids and physicians were very attentive, concerned, caring and compassionate. I can't say enough about Dr. Littlejohn and how amazing of a physician he is. He always maintains a calm demeanor even in times I know to be stressful. I am an emergency nurse and understand stress as well as balancing patient demand with needs from a first hand perspective. The whole staff worked so hard and were diligent about not only my comfort but my brand new Son's comfort as well as my family. Everything has been as pleasant as can be expected in surgical recovery. Thank you Arrowhead, that's why I choose you!"
5,"I can't believe this place has only 65 reviews!
As far as I'm concerned, Wilensky's hype is on the same level as Schwartz's - except that the former stayed humble, and the later built a whole empire that boasts worldwide renown and Celine Dion. The Wilensky Special is just a grilled bologna sandwich, plain and simple. It can only be praised so much for its culinary achievements, but can be adored endlessly if you happen to be fond of the diner's cultural significance and nostalgic vibe.

Wilensky is frozen in time, with its funny wall color, cheap prices and casual chit chat. There's no huge lineup out the door, obnoxious service or sense of urgency - althought the hype whipped up by Anthony Bourdain and others has given the place a strange sacred aura. The first time I stepped into the place, I thought it was surprisingly old, like a museum that refuses to modernize. They didn't really ride any wave of the publicity, and you'll never find their bologna sandwich sold anywhere outside of their shop - and I think I like them for that.

It seems that Wilensky is still a well kept secret - one of many hidden around the Plateau and Mile-End. It earned its place by staying consistently delicious, close to its community and true to its origins and family values.

Note: I usually don't like soda, but I actually really enjoyed theirs!"
5,"Recently we had to decide to let our wonderful Dobie, Ginger, cross the Rainbow Bridge.  Dr. Michael Fixler and Grace came to our home during this sad time and brought peace to Ginger.  Their approach to this difficult situation helped us through.  Dr. Mike and Grace continually gave us time to say to goodbye, to assure Ginger that she would be ok.  When the time came, they took her gently away, gave us a hug, and, again, gave us peace with Ginger's passing.  

We were so worried about Ginger having to be put down in a vet office, but with Happy Endings, she was able to pass surrounded in her home, on her own bed.  

Today, we received Ginger's paw print with a lovely poem about the Rainbow Bridge, and we are again with her in spirit.

Thanks Dr. Mike, Alicia, and Grace at Happy Endings In-home Pet Euthanasia."
5,"Great food and service!  Love the burgers, fries, and especially the custard!  The Hawaiian is my favorite.  The service is excellent!  Often they will bring the food out to you and are so kind.  Love it here!"
5,"Look NO further for a ""KNOCKOUT"" flower arrangement for a special occasion....or JUST BECAUSE!!! Greg helped me decide on a gorgeous arrangement for my son and DIL anniversary (via long distance from Houston) that they were celebrating at The Four Seasons in Las Vegas. We're from Houston, so you've heard everything is bigger and better in Texas??? Well, not always!!!! The arrangement was magnificent, very fresh and a stunning addition to their celebration. Oh, and did I tell you, I placed the order noonish on a SATURDAY just when they were about to close for the weekend!! Magician Greg not only made it happen, but spent a long -long - distance phone call with me because I'm a perfectionist and over thinker. With a smile in his voice the entire time. Look no further!!"
5,"Amazing burger and great selection of gourmet toppings. The beef patty is good quality and charred to perfection. I also tried the cod fish burger, it's like no other fish burger. Juicy cod stuffed with shrimp and cream sauce, light and crispy batter on outside...yum! I don't feel guilty coming here as I can see the chef rolling the patties and using fresh ingredients."
5,"Alothough prices rose it's worth it if I want good pho. Other places are so so, this is the best. It's only a few dollars more than other restaurateur pho. $10 will cover tax and tips.


As you can see from my username I hate Liberty Noodles. Please avoid their shit pho. Bad service bad price bad everysing!!!11 doh meh!!!"
5,They stay open in the late nights & the counter guys are always welcoming me whenever I stop by. Fries are bomb
5,"Burgers, Fries, sundaes and ice cream this place has everything that any family needs when you're going out to eat. 

The double cheeseburger is one of the most delicious burgers I've had in a long time and I have sampled everything out there this steakburger is where it's at people you need to order that."
5,This is such a good and affordable burger place! Everything is made fresh and they have halal options.
5,"When you have to let go of your best friend, Dr Fixler is who you would want to be on your and your dog's side.  I have two dogs and he told me exactly how to do this to not cause confusion for the partner of the one leaving, and it worked.  Boomer was sad for awhile but he never searched for his departed mate like some dogs do, because he knew she was gone from our physical world. Dr. Fixler also knew how to support me and my guilt of letter her go (of course we know we shouldn't feel this way, but we all do).  Dr. Fixler and assistant do an examination and give you all options besides euthanasia, but in the end we made our decision to let her go. This is a personal decision and if you want someone guiding you by your side, you are in safe hands with Dr. Fixler.  When it is time for Boomer, I will again go to Dr. Fixler to accompany us.  
Very grateful I found him when I needed him. I live far away but for a small fee he came to our home, which shows he does it from his heart."
5,"Honestly, I'm really surprised about the low reviews.  I will say its probably from people that visited early on...this place was definitely getting into the swing of things and I am happy I held off my review until after a few visits.

I consider myself pretty picky...especially when it comes to bbq.  This place though has been getting better and better every time I visit.  Let me preface by saying, I have been here only for lunches, so keep that in mind...with that said...everything has been amazing.

Let me also say, that I have had the pleasure of talking to the head chef, and after speaking to him, I am even more convinced that he is always on the hunt for the best taste, sourcing the best ingredients, and serving the environment the best way possible.

One example...the fries.  Where most restaurants would probably just cut the fat off the meat, he uses the fat to cook the fries (yes, not vegan friendly, but this is a bbq joint...sorry vegan friends!), he wastes as little as possible.  

Also, he is adamant about ingredient quality...and it shows!  Everything from the port, beef, chicken, veggies and everything in between is locally sourced and fresh!

The mac and cheese is soooo creamy and yummy...he uses my favorite mac and cheese ingredient, sodium citrate (the only way to make mac and cheese IMHO)!!  No Velveeta here!

Seriously...give this place a try...its one of the top spots for BBQ in the greater cleveland area (yes, maybe better than mabels).  Enjoy some yummy BBQ!"
5,"""Juicy Lucy Burger"" and their funnel cake is the only reason why I dine at The burger factory! Whenever I am craving a big juicy burger this place definitely hits the spot every single time. The beef patty is halal which is amazing meat and there is loaded cheddar cheese grilled in the burger. The bun is soft and light which is good because the patty is quite heavy but very filling. As per the funnel cake, there is no other
time than summer to get funnel cake and The burger factory has it all year long. Need I say more? Haha. I've gotten all my friends hooked on this great burger joint in Mississauga!"
5,"This is the only place I run to when I need a burger. Cheeseburgers and juicy lucy being my favorites. The restaurant is decent for sit down. 
The burgers are downright delicious. The meat is juicy and tasteful. The cheese is right. Gives you a melt in your mouth medley along with a beautiful meaty texture. 
If you haven't had enough of the burger. Proceed to order the funnel cake. Should fill you right up to your neck. 
Hands down one of the best halal burger options in town."
5,"This restaurant has friendly and helpful staff. The freshly made food items are unique and delicious. Every time I come, I notice something different to order  and am pleased with the variety of menu options. Very clean and attention paid to detail."
5,"When our young cat, Jilly, was diagnosed with diabetes at the very unusual tender of 3.5 years,  my husband and I suffered a bit of a blow , but we were optimistic that we would get her stable,  and enjoy many more years with her. It was a real kick in the teeth when a few weeks later,  at a follow-up visit to check her blood sugar,  our vet caught an unusual heartbeat.  It was a very quick,  very devastating roll downhill from there.  In the end,  we determined that the treatments needed to keep Jilly alive were not in her best interest, least of all because of the severe stress she suffered on trips to the vet. 

It was here that we called Happy Endings. Dr Fixler and Alicia spent 20mins on the phone with me,  helping me to come to terms with the decision (she was so young!) at no cost to me. Dr. Fixler shared with me a personal story about his own beloved dog's final day,  and Alicia sealed the deal when I asked her how they perform the service they do,  day in, day out,  and I'll never forget,  she said ""Well, we cry a lot. But we take comfort knowing that we help people and pets through a very difficult,  very important moment in their lives"". I scheduled the appointment for a few days later.

Dr. Fixler, a fully qualified veterinarian,  gave Jilly a preliminary exam to confirm the time was right -they do not perform euthanasia when they when the situation does not call for it. They did not mind that we had a chosen a makeshift bed of my fuzzy bathrobe and one of my husband's supremely stinky work shirts (two of Jilly's favorite things to sleep on) and did not laugh when we requested that her favorite lollypop stick be cremated with her. 

She was given a sedative and set up with a catheter which, at a clinic, would be done in the backroom, separating pet and person during what is arguably the most traumatic part of the process and excused themselves from the home, giving us privacy to say goodbye. When we were ready,  they returned and Jilly very quickly and peacefully left us. Here, we were left alone again, this time with our surviving cat included as Dr. Fixler suggested,  for a final goodbye. Dr Fixler then returned and respectfully wrapped Jilly up before taking her away. 

In addition to their main service,  their website is a treasure trove of advice on preparing for and recovering from the loss of a pet.

We are so grateful to have found Happy Endings. The in-home service is more expensive,  but we will never put our pets down any other way again. As another reviewer stated,  Dr Fixler will be seeing us again,  but hopefully not for a long time."
5,"These guys are absolutely great!  They've gone out of their way for last minute deliveries for me,  have excellent customer service and they sure do put together some nice flowers! Thanks again guys!"
5,"The customer service/technical support these folks provide is unbelievably good. I live in an old apartment building, with terrible wiring that is all shorted out. I've had three service tickets, all the repairs were completed in under 24 hours from when the ticket was opened, by good, knowledgeable technicians who gave me excellent advice to help me resolve this problem and/or somehow managed to get me service in spite of the wiring issues. I cannot tell you how good it is to have such excellent service at my disposal, especially since my job depends on having a land line available. I recommend them unconditionally!!"
5,Wow I've never had HD look so good The Prsim TV is just Faboulus. When we had cox it always looked fuzzy and then it would clear up and back and forth. I switched and have been very happy with the service I get 100 meg down load speed.  its unbelievable guys if you live in a neighborhood that has just come up I'm pretty sure you can probably get the same service. Pricing for one year is 69.99 for the 1st 12 months. You can't beat that.
5,"This shop is awesome. They do very high quality work and exceeded the expectations of the gift recipient. Grateful to have found such a quality, high end flower shop to use in Vegas. Thanks to Phil and Susie for the great customer service!"
5,"i went back the other day with some friends of mine and the vegetables were uber fresh.  i think the last time i went, it was close to closing time and the vegetables were sub-par, but this time, it made the nem nuong extra deelish"
5,"For 70 years they have been making the signature sandwich the same way.  Take it as served or not at all.  It is that simple.  If you put aside any food snobbery and just go with it, you will be rewarded with a delicious sandwich that will tickle your taste buds.  Add to it a home made sofa or egg cream and you will be in heaven.  Still owned by the founder's granddaughter, who is gracious and charming, Wilensky's is a total throwback.  Tiny, with only 10 stools, the interior is the same as it was in 1952 when the restaurant moved one block to its present location - well, they have updated the titles in their lending library.  Simply magnificent."
5,"We sadly needed Dr. Fixler's services this morning & I am very happy that I stumbled upon Happy Endings when researching my poor girl's end of life experience. 

I emailed late last night after reviewing their very helpful website about Abby's condition and received a call from Alicia first thing this morning. Even earlier than I had expected. She was very helpful in promptly scheduling our appointment & gave good advice concerning our kids & other dog. 

Dr. Fixler & assistant (in my grief I didn't properly catch her name) arrived when expected & gave me a call 10 minutes prior to arrival. Dr. examined Abby & set our minds at ease regarding our decision. He fully explained everything and gave us the time we needed. 

I am so thankful Abby was able to spend her last moments at home & be comfortable. Everyone at Happy Endings is incredibly compassionate & professional and I highly recommend them. I wish I could give them 10 stars."
5,"I like this place and I hope others have the same experience I did. I am not a BBQ expert, but my food was delicious. My waitress was delightful and funny. I kept her entertained with my inability to choose a drink, app, or meal when she popped over to check on my table. The casual, relaxed environment was comforting after a long workday. The smell of smoked meat permeates through the restaurant. 

I ordered an alcoholic drink that I order everywhere I go. Either the bartender or waitress got it wrong, but it turned out to be the best version of that drink I have ever had. I started with the BBQ Brisket Poutine. Delicious!! It had the right amount of gravy, fries, and oh so tender meat. You could share it with others if you wish, but it could also be for one. There is a choose your own adventure sauce station on each table. You can pick all or one of the sauces at the table to enhance your meal. However, the meat stands on its own here. Flavorful, tender and juicy. My friend ordered chicken wings for a starter. I was told they were tasty as well. Because I already had the brisket. I ordered a pick two with shrimp and ribs. Again, delicious. The shrimp were seasoned and quite tasty. I am not sure of the amount of shrimp I received, but it was plentiful. The ribs were tender and tasty. Sauce was not warranted but I tried all of them. The baked beans delivered bold flavor and large bites of meat. The mac and cheese was a treat of bubbly goodness. 

There is ample parking and seating. I will be going back for both drinks and food regularly. It is a hidden gem on the east side. Enjoy!"
5,"Shout out el paisanos market, the food there as always been good but its still getting better. The employees are extremely nice. I eat there everyday, its the only store I go to now."
5,Best burgers in town. I tried many other places in Mississauga but couldn't find better one. I wish there is better ventilation though.
5,Petite endroit sympathique pour une Pho sur le pouce et malgré qu'il est seul. Le serveur est très efficace et gentil
5,"When I have a guest come to stay with me and they ask what can I walk to that is fun - The Comedy Bar is the only place that comes to mind.  The people are great!  The comedy can be hilarious, and sometimes terrible - but they always try.  And new forms of comedy aren't afraid of this platform either.  Like the improvised re-imagining of John Hughes' Some Kind of Wonderful!

The prices are fair, the beer is cold, and even if you're not going to a show the lounge area is a place to come and relax.  Definitely my favourite place in Dovercourt!"
5,Always consistent and delicious. Very unique burger. Love the crunch. Normally I don't finish fries but so hard to stop. The special sauce is the best. Service is unique. Seems they have a way to find intelligent workers. Rare at most fast food. Will definitely be back.
5,"Without a doubt the most respectful, compassionate experience we could have  hoped for at the end of a long and happy life. Dr Fixler and his team were unfailingly understanding, sympathetic and helpful both on the phone and at the event itself. Thank you for making a much-dreaded experience one that we can look back on not with fear, but with pride that we made the right decision for our beloved little girl."
5,"This place makes the absolute best burritos I've ever had and im from SoCal. Plus they sell booze, bongs, tobacco, beer bongs, condoms, anything you need. Best market in Tempe!"
5,Bought some beautiful flowers online for a friend that looked like a little dog super cute! Great service and product .. will be using them again!
5,"Friends told me about this place so I checked it out absolute best cheeseburger I have ever had so juicy and hot every bite was awesome and the tornado fries were really good crispy and fresh.
Definitely going back!"
5,"They are without a doubt the best gift I ever gave to my beloved dog, Cody. Their compassion and kindness were unbelievable. They made this unbearable time easier for myself and my family and undoubtedly for Cody. I would use them again and again given the circumstances. They are angels and I thank them from the bottom of my heart."
5,"Dear Happy Endings,

I want to thank you for assisting in a task that I knew was coming for 13 years.  Every little puppy we have ever brought into our home was guaranteed to one day break our hearts.

Sadie was a great dog.  I never recall having to scold her.  She was gentle, smart, and appreciated the love we bestowed on her.  She loved us and showed it every day.

Nothing comes free...and last Monday, the 'emotional bill' came due.  Not your bill...but the bill we had to pay with our heavy hearts over her loss.  Nothing as great as a dog's love comes cheap and Monday we had to pay the price in seeing her go.

But:

You took a dreaded situation and made it more than OK.  You and Rayana covered every base and never missed an opportunity to do the process properly.  You were understanding, gentle, confident, and very punctual.  You could not have done it any better.

Regarding your price...It was a honor to pay your fee.  How can anyone put a dollar and cent value on a service such as yours?

Know that I will tell all of my friends that WHEN the time comes, to make sure they use your services.

Bless you.  And may Sadie rest in peace.

Larry Kavich"
5,"Just as others have said here, I am so grateful for Dr. Fixler and Alicia. I called them to come to my home to put down my 13 year old border collie. He has a lovely demeanor - as does Alicia - and right away, Lucas was up and dropped a toy at his feet. Dr. Fixler did an exam and we discussed Lucas' symptoms and care and he told me right away that he didn't think Lucas was presenting like a dog at the end of his life. He had some ideas and the followed up with me the next day - called in prescriptions and referred me to a vet that has managed to stabilize Lucas. With luck, he'll be with me for a few more years. 

I know that Dr. Fixler has followed up with Dr. Newland- his referral - regarding Lucas' care. I love that there is great animal care out there and that there are vets that really care. Dr. Fixler is exceptional. And when the time comes, he will be called to my home again. I can't imagine a kinder, more lovely way for any of my animals to be treated - to be given an easier way onward, in surroundings they know and love."
5,"Food is amazing.  If you love BBQ, this is the spot for you!! Eastsiders rejoice because we finally have great BBQ"
5,Such a kind compassionate doctor and service. I am very thankful we used this service to say goodbye to our sweet friend Mac. Such a hard call to make but so thankful I did. It was time. Thank you Happy Endings
5,"5 stars IMO for a Pho place in Toronto.  My new go to Pho Place.  Fragrant broth, good cut of meat, not too salty.  Now, you don't get a choice of sizes which might be a problem if you are big eater or get full too easily.  But Pho is top notch.  

Even the rice for any of their rice dishes is apparently made in the tradition way (told to me by my Viet wife) which I agree, makes it superior to other places I've tried. 

Decor and size is cozy but updated.  I could see why ppl think service is not as good as it can be, since it seems the sons who are primarily the waiters are just there to do their time for their parents.  

At the end of the day, like most real authentic asian restaurants, its about efficiency and not being that pesky diner.  

If you haven't tried this place, I highly recommend it."
5,Needed them in a pinch and they came through. Great people running a great business!!! Support your local business owners. Also they go the extra mile with high quality flowers.
5,"There aren't enough stars on Yelp to reflect what I feel about Dr. Fixler's service.

This isn't a sob story about the most amazing family dog/cat/gecko/ferret to have graced this planet - God knows there are enough of those tributes to sort thru here.  (Ollie is arguably the best protector and friend our family could have been blessed with, though.. on TOP of being the best dog *of all time*..)  ..Plus I don't need to choke myself up again.. I'm done crying..   For now..

BUT - I want to reach out to that *one* person looking for another reason why he/she is doing the ""right thing"" for their special friend AND family by choosing Dr. Fixler.  Lord knows you, my friend - are under enough stress right meow.   Oops - ""now""...

I have 2 kids that were raised by this amazing mutt.  They love him more than some of our extended family.  (and I concur, for that matter)  He is that important to us.  

Dr Fixler spent the time to educate us about Ollie's medical condition, what it was doing to his body, and how it would affect him in the days to come.  Not a pretty picture.  He educated my kids during the procedure as well - educating them on what he was doing, what was happening to their protector and what he was feeling.  This completely removed the fear my kids had of the vet who was coming to administer ""death"" as they thought it.  They never left Ollie's side.  They were with him every moment until he was gone.  

Dr Fixler also provided some very sage advice on how to cope with Ollie's departure.  What to do for the kids, as well.  Amazing.  What you get vs. what you pay for are inordinately in your favor.

Good luck, my heart is with you."
5,"Quite possibly the best burger I've ever had in my life. The meat was so fresh and made to order, which I love. The service was sweet and kind with an accent from overseas. I love seeing hard working people that come to Canada and try to improve this city.

I had a burger for 5 bucks. The meat was moist and delicious and I could tell the owner takes pride in fresh ingredients. This is really a perfect place for nearby students looking to get a great meal that's actually good for you. 

Down the street at McDonalds you pay the same amount for artificial, garbage that we're told is food. There is more nutritional value in the packaging at McDonalds than there is in their food.

As a resident of Vancouver and visitor of Toronto, Jacksons is exactly what people need to eat. Healthy, hormone free, antibiotic free and free range beef.  AND!! They offer gluten free buns.

NOT FACTORY MADE like some of the other burger joints.

This is an asset to Toronto and will remain as such for years to come."
5,"One of the last remnants of the Jewish area in Mile End. Wilensky's ""light lunch"" isnt...its smooshed beef baloney and cheese on a roll. All of it pressed like a Cuban. The place is more of a museum than a Jewish deli."
5,"Great restaurant addition to the area. The menu is awesome and the food is just as great! The pulled pork, Mac & Cheese and cobbler are some of our favorites. Great selection of beers on tap. This is our new favorite local place!"
5,"Our one and only florist for Las Vegas because of their customer service. 

On a couple of occasions, they helped with custom orders, but the one order I would like to highlight is how they helped with our wedding floral. 

When I called and asked for fresh lavender, they said they would ask their distributor but could not guarantee this as it was not in season. After they spoke with their distributor, they were going to order from out of the country. But being as it was coming from out of the country, they could not guarantee the quality. Long story short, the fresh lavender quality was not top notch. They still made the bouquet but did not charge us full price. 

Our back up plan was using dried lavender stalks to make the bridal bouquet and this worked out perfectly. I actually like idea better because I am now using the dried lavender bouquet as a floral display at home. Every time I see it, it reminds me of our special day. 

If you need a good florist, you should see and talk to the folks at Dancing Dandelion!"
5,Dr. Fixler and his team are top notch professionals. I used their services this evening and could not be more impressed with their care and handling of my dog. They came to my home prepared with solutions to every roadblock we presented.  Thank you for providing such a loving service at a most difficult time.
5,Greg helped me get my dream wedding bouquet in my price range. My best friend sent him emails of what I liked and spoke about what was in season and how we could accomplish the look. Very resonable very professional and nice. Compared to other shops that I called and this one lady even laughed at my budget. Thank you to Greg and his staff.
5,"So i was really skeptical about ordering flowers, but i wanted someplace local for where they were being delivered.  This place had a bunch of great reviews on Yelp so i tried it.  I looked at all of the flowers online.  I though for sure these flowers are not going to look like as they do online.  I had my friend send me a pic of what she received.  And surprisingly, they looked way better than the picture online.  I was so excited.  I ordered at like 5:30 last night for next day delivery and she received around noon on the day of delivery.  They look beautiful and they did an amazing job.  I would highly recommend and will use this company again for future flower deliveries."
5,"One of the toughest and saddest times for our family was saying goodbye to our beloved Golden Retriever, Georgie.  Due to her age and health problems she was struggling just to maintain and she always hated to go to vet offices.

With Happy Endings, Dr. Fixler did an outstanding job taking care of Georgie in her final moments and explaining the procedures to our family even through the wailing. He was very caring, respectful, and understanding, he handled the entire process with great professionalism. 

I would recommend Happy Endings to anyone facing a difficult decision regarding their pet.  They were a God send. I thank them for allowing my family to say good bye to Georgie in the comfort of our home.   

Randy Caves and family"
5,"I had my beautiful Beanie for 3 years, 4 months, 5 days and 20 hours.  It was not enough. He was 16 and though I was not ready, it was time.    Dr. Fixler's  gentle hand and his soft voice were so reassuring.  He was comforting, empathetic and so understanding.  The ceremonial way they wrapped my beautiful Beanie in a blanket like the precious gift he was and carried him to their transport vehicle was such a fitting tribute to my trusted companion.  It truly was a Happy Ending for my Beanie's journey here on earth.    Thank you!"
5,"Super simple place but amazing nonetheless. It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. 

Staff was very helpful and friendly."
5,Awesome customer service! I was in a bind and needed a quick delivery and Gregory made it happen. My husband has sent me flowers from The Dancing Dandelion in the past and I have always been pleased by their gorgeous arrangements. I know today's arrangement for my assistant will not disappoint. Thanks Gregory!
5,Mexican Street Food at is best after a night out. This Place comes in clutch!
5,"I wish I could give The Dancing Dandelion a 10 star rating because 5 stars doesn't cover the unbelievable experience we had with them. My mom and I had a few prior wedding floral meetings before meeting Greg, we were worn out from bad service and lack of organization- holy cow did he turn that around. Greg sat with us and truly cared and respected our wants and needs as well as our budget. We reviewed everything that I was looking for in the arch, the bouquets, the pedals down the aisle, the table displays, the cake, etc. and Greg and his team nailed it. The attention to detail was impeccable,  not one thing was overlooked. Thank you so much for making our vision come to life!!!"
5,"full disclosure: i am an improv performer who has performed at this venue. from that perspective, i will say that comedy bar is providing an incredibly rare service to the city of toronto. with the closing of almost every other small venue for comedy, it is now the sole incubator for new talent at an independent level in the city. for that reason, it is the best place to catch new comedy talent. shows can be hit or miss (given that rentals are open to the whole community) but ticket prices are cheap and it is pretty easy to settle into your favourite shows - stand-up, sketch or improv - with a comparatively minimal investment. yes, a somewhat self-guided discovery process, but that's part of the fun.

i also really like the menu and find the pricing good.

now that the second stage as been added, that back cabaret room is a great place to sneak away from the crowds late at night if you just want to grab some drinks and chat with friends."
5,"The food is awesome, open really late, big alcohol selection and the guys are cool, can't beat this place"
5,Super friendly service!!! there was a good amount of available cheap ($10) flower arrangements to $80+. not a huge selection but enough to fit my needs on short notice.
5,"I might have found a new addiction - Freddy's. Not sure why I have never been here before but I will be from now on!

We drove by this place over the weekend and I didn't know what it was, so I came back in for lunch. Their food is great, service is fantastic and it's very clean.

I had the patty melt, which was a tad too greasy, but it's a patty melt so you're basically asking for grease. It was good though. The fries were awesome - I don't normally like shoestring fries, but these were cooked perfectly. And they have fry sauce. Yes, fry sauce. That I think clinched it for me. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but for a person like me who normally mixes ketchup with ranch dressing for her fries, this stuff was YUMmy.

I was too full from lunch to try any of the frozen custard - sundaes, concrete mixers, or anything else - but next time i will have to plan things out so I can have both. Maybe just a basket of fries (with a ton of sauce) and a sundae."
5,"I went to Mayworth with a neighbor and I truly enjoyed myself. I remember visiting this establishment when it was Center Street Tavern ( probably said the name wrong) years ago. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed Mayworth. From the time we walked in until the time we left,  Dana took care of us. Her hospitality was outstanding. The pub is very inviting and cozy. I really wanted to stay longer, but I had things to do. 
I order the Jamaican jerk wings entree with a side of sweet potato waffle fries. The Jamaican Jerk was not to my liking. I felt it wasn't spicy or seasoned at all. However, the fries were so delicious. Dana suggested mayo with it, and I said no thanks, but do you have something else? She had me to try the chipotle sauce and man was it good. Afterwards, Dana asked me about my wings. I had to be honest, I just told her I didn't like them at all. She immediately said she would get me another flavor wing if I wanted. I said yes, and requested the  hot wings. When the owner found out that I wasn't satisfied he immediately came over to our table to talk with me. Again, I told him about the wings. He assured me that he would take care of me. The wings came out and boy were they good! I really enjoyed them. The owner comes back over and asked if I was pleased with the wings and I said yes and thanked him for taking care of me. This owner went above and beyond what most owners would do. I never got a bill so I had to asked Dana for it. To my surprise there was no billed because the owner took care of it. Most customer would say thank you right off, but not me! I wanted to fuss with the waitress about the owner taking care of my bill! He didn't have to do it, but he did and for that courtesy I'm so grateful. He will have my business from now on. This is the kind of establishment you want to embark on. You know you're going to be cared for here. Thank you for the love shown."
5,"This is surely the most authentic chettinad restaurants I have tried so far. We tried Devils Chicken for starter and mutton sukka biryani. Oh my! They were so delicious. Me and my husband finished every bit of the food 
I am one of those people who stays a meter away when it comes to spicy food. I was sceptical in the beginning to try devils chicken coz it was marked double spicy. But trust me the folks here understand that spicy doesn't necessarily have to be super hot. It was unbelievably flavourful. 
I'm coming back to this place over n over again"
5,"One of my favorite restaurants. I love the blackened chicken pasta most of all, but have never had anything here that I didn't love. They have some of the best waffle fries here."
5,"Best Chinese food in Az! It's not too greasy, too salty, and has the perfect amount of flavor.. AND I don't feel like sh*t after. My favorite dish is the pad thai and kung pao chicken. Their broccoli beef is another one of my favorites. The portion sizes here are perfect and it's moderately priced.. Worth EVERY penny. It's nice because you can order it to go or eat there. The service is great and the servers are very friendly. I highly recommend trying Sesame Inn!"
5,"Time after time, I visit this little gem in the Carefree area, and find that the food is consistent - quantity and quality wise!  I continue to send family and friends to Sesame Inn when I hear they plan visit AZ.

Sure there isn't ""lo mein"" on the menu, but if you actually know your Chinese food like I do, you'll realize that this isn't a Cantonese style restaurant -- where lo mein is usually served.  I'm just sayin'..."
5,"Absolutely delicious food - definitely recommend the devils chicken and mutton sukka biriyani. The ambience is good and the service is prompt. 5 star experience, a must visit restaurant for folks who love spicy Indian flavours."
5,"Wow, food was amazing, and staff was super friendly.  Definitely has a Mom and Pops vibe. 

Highly suggest Almond Chicken, Mongolian Beef (I believe the meat they use is filet mignon), CRAB PUFFS, and Pepper Steak. 

Most people are used to Mandarin style Chinese food (aka Panda Express). If you're not familiar with Hunan or Szechuan style food, you won't understand Sesame Inn."
5,"Grilled potstickers, moo shu pork, cashew chicken. Yum!!"
5,"David Starlin provided an honest, painless car buying experience. I researched a new vehicle for purchase from their website, called to schedule an appointment, and David met me with the car I researched, as well as a few alternatives. The pricing was honest. He explained all the necessary finance terms and conditions. I had no questions or misgivings about his intent and felt he made an honest deal. I would definitely recommend Cardinale Way to friends and family."
5,"I've been here almost 2 years from Los Angeles. I co-own a high-end restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, so I've been struggling to find a place in Madison that combines good food, good service, and upscale ambience - big city style. Julep nailed it. It's the first place that I have even given a review to since being here. The fried chicken and collard greens were amazing. Looking forward to going back soon."
5,"What an amazing woman,  Andi.  She is so awesome and unique!  She even flies planes!  Andi is a great bartender and has such a fun personality!  Good job PT's,  you have a winner in her."
5,"Great meal. Wonderful ""off the menu"" Egg Drop Soup. Quite a wide variety on the menu. Everyone in our party was very pleased. Good service. A nice neighborhood feel."
5,"I came into Cardinale Way Mazda at one of the saddest points in my life about ten days ago. My trade-in was sitting in Denver CO and I wanted to trade it towards a new small car that would be extremely safe and get high mileage, 35 in town and 45 on the road.  The Denver car was only 15 months into a 36 month lease so I knew I would be upside down on the deal, owing lots of money to pay off the lease.  The didn't know me at all, I only moved here to Phoenix in February.  They not only let me drive off with my new sporty red Mazda 3 the next day, they did it without seeing my trade-in and they are patiently waiting for me to get my trade-in turned in to them.

I knew this was the dealership I wanted to work with, because they were so kind and considerate and understanding about my personal situation.  If you want to work with an honest Christian family based business, the kindest salesforce in Phoenix and get the best deal you've ever had, please visit my new friends at Cardinale Way Mazda in Peoria, AZ.  

Tell them Nana B sent you!"
5,"Alright so my friend Ashley L. wanted to go here so the first thing I did was look at the reviews on Yelp.  Mostly good but a few bad ones.  I have to say that usually only read the really bad reviews so I can get a feel for what may be wrong.  I was especially interested in the ones that said the sesame chicken was not good since Ashley L. said that was her favorite.  
So I went and decided to let her lead.  They bring out the hot jasmine tea to poor into these little cups.  I must say that on a cold (well Arizona cold) day this was fantastic.  It was full of flavor and a nice start to the meal.  We both ordered the sesame chicken lunch combo and boy was I in for a treat.  
We started with egg drop soup.  This is not my normal favorite as I do not like tofu and it is usually unpleasant if I get a bite.  It is mostly the texture I don't like but the tofu was smooth and tasted like the broth and so I ate the whole bowl.  Then out came the lunch.  I was not expecting this much food.  I can see why some people were put off by the sesame chicken as it is not prepared the way it is everywhere else.  It felt so much lighter and had more flavor than I could imagine.  It was a piece of breaded chicken with a light sauce and green onions over it.  It was excellent.  Ashley L. is not a fan of chicken but loves this chicken and I can see why.  It was perfectly prepared with no fat globs anywhere.  It was moist and cooked to perfection.  This came with fried rice on the side.  The rice was well cooked with nice crunchy vegetables mixed in.  There were to fried wontons that were perfectly done and not too oily.  I don't like fried wontons usually because they make the mouth feel like is has been greased yuck.  These did not have that horrible side effect.  The egg roll was perfectly crisp without any of the guminess that can occur if not cooked properly.  Fresh delicious vegetable inside.  
Now to the service.  I don't know who our waiter was exactly because it felt like everyone was waiting on us.  It wasn't terribly busy but there was great teamwork.  Our tea never ran out no matter how fast we drank it they always filled it before we could finish it.  Our water glasses always had fresh water and ice and our plates were cleared promptly.  It was almost eerie how things would appear and disappear while we talked.  We never felt rushed to leave and even after the check was on the table we were checked on frequently.  
The price for both of us was $19 and was well worth the food and the service that we received.
I can't wait to become a regular here."
5,"Been going here about once a week.  Yes, the decor is older and the food is 'traditional chinese'!!  If you are in love with PF Changs (which I do like) or some other new fangled version of Chinese food - do not come here.  If you are under 30, you may not like this place because you want hip and excitement and don't even know what Chinese food from 25 years ago is like or should be.  I recommend this place over and over.   For those who say it is expensive, well i would like to know where you are eating that is less expensive in North Scottsdale area.   If you are from out of town, hello, everything is expensive here.  This is a nice family owned restaurant and I've never had ANY rude experiences.  They are very nice !!  Thank you Sesame Inn!!!"
5,"Was told 15 to 25 minutes for a table. Was seated in 5. Our server, Steve, took really good care of us. Always had drink refills before we asked. Portions are huge. Steaks done exactly the way we ordered. Seasoned just right. Mushrooms were more than just others butter and mushrooms. Will definitely come back."
5,"Beer selection fantastic. The wings were cooked to perfection. We had hot and garlic Parmesan mixed with mild. The service was fast. The kids loved and devoured their mini burgers and Mac/cheese. Also, you have to try the sloppy joe waffle fries. Worth the short detour off I-85. You won't regret it."
5,"Had an amazing dinner with friends at Baro. The food is to die for!!! Everything we tried was amazing. The empanadas, chicken wings, duck confit rice, beef tenderloin, and the pancake. The churros are home made with a salted Duce de leche.... great place for 4+ people to share various dishes. Service was amazing and really fun ambiance. Will be back again!"
5,"We drive out to this place when we feel like having some LEGIT  dumplings. We always order the beef roll that comes wrapped in tin foil and the round flat bread. My wife, baby and I are stuffed entry time for 30something dollars. Recommended!!"
5,"Excellent customer service. I broke the clip to my middle console. My visit to go get the part and schedule the appointment was making me cringe at the price, as these items can be costly for something simple,  and essentially prolonging my visit to here. They replaced it for free right on the spot. Thank you! This has always been my experience with Mazada and pleased that this place offers the same service."
5,"This is our absolute favorite place to go for dinner. The sloppy joe waffle fries are my most-craved food EVER! And Brittany at the bar is the most wonderful person to get your drinks from. All the service has been great, and we have zero complaints. Also karaoke night on Saturday is our favorite time to be there for Jimmy J's jams!"
5,"We used to love Valdez and were sad when it closed down. However the chef from Valdez opened up Baro, and we are excited to try it.

The atmosphere is very exciting, this is not a quiet place. We got to our table and the waitress was there in no time telling us about the specials and took our drink order. 

The menu is very similar to the Valdez menu. We ate tostada, chicken wings, empanadas, and of course chrizo. The wait was a little long, but before we complained the hostess gave us ceviche complimentary. For dessert we ate churros. The drink and cocktail menu is very extensive, and the prices were very reasonable. 

Overall the experience was fantastic! We love Mexican and Latin food, and this place did not disappoint. Highly recommend for anyone."
5,"Wow!  Exquisite service and fantastic food! Charming and inviting ambiance. Our party of three made this kind of a ""tasting"" evening and we were so glad we did.  We started with a couple of cocktails...the Julep and Pop's Garden.  Both hit the mark!  Next we moved to some starters and small plates.  A biscuit with maple butter and house-made fig jam, corn bread served in an adorable little colander, divine mac and cheese, and pimiento cheese with house-made crackers.    The side of the evening was a very divine broccolini and cauliflower gratin.  For entrees we chose the chicken thighs with greens, shrimp and grits, and the brisket pot roast, potato puree, and root vegetables.  All outstanding!  Last but not least, the sweet potato pie and pear cobbler served with a cute little milk bottle full of cream.  Can't think of a thing that could have been improved upon.  Thank you Julep!"
5,"BEST PLACE EVAAARRR!!

I come here at least twice a week, not even lying. This place is just perfection. 

The decor isn't exactly fancy shmancy, but the food makes up for it.

I'm not a huge fan of the Korean food, but mainly the Chinese dishes are spot on. I really don't know what else to say about this place, but ... IT'S AMAZING.

If you haven't been here, you gotta go! You're missing out on fresh, delicious dumplings! Gotta give some love to the fried onion pancake as well!!"
5,"This restaurant is very good. I love the service here. They are having morning discount which is very cheap. The beverage here are very delicious espeacially the Arctic Ocean ( Beibingyang)  also the wintermelon tea and Hantian Kiwi, they are having professional servers they are fast and clear. The hosts are beautiful."
5,"I love this place! When you walk in the door, you feel as though you're in a 1960s film. It's old school, not like ""fusion"" places that are rampant as all get out. The service is always wonderful; the chicken curry is wonderful. My husband loved the mayo shrimp. The portions are large too. I loved the mango sorbet--delectable. And my daughter had the coconut sorbet, which is handmade on premises, and it was superb. Very clean, very friendly, and it's geographically desirable.

I'd like to add that I'm from the Detroit area. Really good Chinese there. When I moved here 16 years ago, the Chinese food disappointed me---THEY USED CELERY! Yuck. So now I judge places by that. Sesame Inn does not use celery, as far as I know."
5,"Love the salads here. One of the choices is build your own, picking 7 ingredients from an extensive list. All of the ingredients are very fresh and tasty.

I also like the iced tea here. Good flavor. And they charge a reasonable  $1.95.

There is a nice ""local"" vibe. Kind of like the neighborhood bar/grill that everyone searches for but rarely finds.  Part of the reason that is the friendly service from the servers and the attentiveness of the manager.

This is what a well-run local restaurant looks like!"
5,"This is my favorite restaurant in the greater Charlotte/Gastonia area, hands down! The beer selection is great, the sloppy joe fries should be renamed ""ambrosia"", and the veggie tacos are killer! We've brought our dog along several times when we sit in the outdoor seating area in the back (only downside is the occasional smokers). We live in Charlotte, but the short drive to Cramerton is worth it!!"
5,"I was craving a hoagie so I ordered a cold Italian with hot peppers and pickles for pick up. As I tried to get it, I had no idea this sandwich shop was actually inside Red Rock Casino. When I called, the gentleman that answered was super helpful by telling me where to park and the fastest way to get there. When I heard this was in a casino, I had this thought like ""oh no, a food court sub... this will probably suck."" I was so pleasantly surprised! I haven't had an Italian sub this good since I lived in eastern PA. The meats were good quality and the bread was amazing!! I'd prefer shredded lettuce to chopped but everything else was on point. And I have to say it again... dat bread doe....."
5,"These guys are the best! I had an valet driver scrape my passenger side rear quarter panel causing an obvious 18 inch paint skid. I only had a couple hours to see if they could make it go away before returning the vehicle. Josh jumped right on it taking his lunch hour to get the buffing compounds and start working. Oh, and the owner (sorry forgot his name) gave me a ride back to my hotel. 

90 minutes later they came back to the hotel with the car done. It looked 100% better and no hassle at the rental car agency. They could have up charged me for that legendary service, but the charge was reasonable, and significantly less then the $1,000 deductible. This shop doesn't specialize in auto body work, but they kicked ass for me. Thanks again guys!!"
5,"Like an idiot, I drove my car through really high flood waters during the most recent flooding. I was worried that I ruined my car. I took it over to Kinkade's where TJ told me that they'd take a look at it. TJ personally gave me a ride home while his guys were examining my car. After they were finished, I went to pick it up. I asked one of the guys how much I owed them and he told me that since they didn't find anything wrong with my car, it was on the house. I asked if I could pay something, but they wouldn't accept anything from me. They're super professional and honest and I really appreciated everything they did.

I'll be coming back for any problems with my car in the future."
5,"This place has great food - I heard about LoLo's at the airport but I was never able to go due to the normally tight connections - Well today I had time and LoLo's is in terminal 4 just before security so I popped out and had a great meal - The chicken was hot and crisp - I'm not a waffle fan but it was good too - I definitely went for the chicken and was not disappointed - I had to wait a little bit but fresh, hot fried chicken was worth it"
5,"Now I have happily experienced Julep six times.  Most recently for their brunch on Sunday.  What I love about Julep is that you don't feel rushed. You can take your time and enjoy the experience.  On my most recent visit, with three family members, we started with two of their scrumptious biscuits with maple butter and a blueberry jam....much like a compote.  The warm biscuits we're crunchy on the outside and moist and crumbly on the inside.  We then ordered our main courses...shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, quiche, and corned beef, hash browns and eggs.  Portions were plentiful.  We finished our meal with great coffee and strawberry rhubarb coffeecake that was served with a mint semifreddo which is so creamy and delectable.  So another great dining experience.  Thank you Julep!"
5,"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and WOW. I absolutely LOVED everything about this place. Not only do they have a cocktail lounge on the second floor with trendy wall art, the entire main level of this restaurant makes you feel like you're somewhere down south. I honestly felt that I was dining somewhere in Miami or Mexico. The atmosphere was fun, hip and vibrant. If you like popular latin music then you'll love the music and vibes that Baro offers! Moving on to the food.. we started with the flight of ceviche you can order and let me just say this was the BEST ceviche I've ever had. Just thinking about their ceviche while I write this review makes me want to go back for more! The main dish we got was the duck confit rice.. WE ATE IT ALL. Plenty for two people but SO tasty that you couldn't not finish the entire dish. To top off the amazing dining experience I had here, I told the one server that we wanted churros (one order only has 3) and asked if we could have 4 because it was my birthday. They brought out 4 churros with a candle and gave it to us for free! AMAZING! I recommend Baro for a date, for groups, for friends and family or if you just want a good time and some amazing food!"
5,Best lil sammy shop ever. Great food. Quality ingredients. Good staff. Never too busy. Has catering. Really food place lunch or dinner. Nom nom
5,"I had read a great review and my longtime customer son raved about LoLo's, so it's been on my 'must do' list for a while. Finally made it on my most recent visit to Phoenix and I wasn't disappointed.  
It's extremely popular now but that hasn't spoiled the upbeat and organized service, and, most importantly, the great food. The servings are very generous and very delicious.  The valet parking is a brilliant idea both because of limited parking options and for those nervous about leaving the 'burbs and treading into South Phoenix (am I dating myself?)
Thanks for a great experience.  I look forward to my next visit soon!
Phyllis in Burque"
5,"This was a great experience and I can honestly say this is the first time I'm writing that about anything to do with my car. The whole staff was friendly and explained everything without being patronizing or exploitative. They fixed something on my car that at least three  other people before them had failed to address (and it was a little thing that only cost a couple of bucks to fix.) They went above and beyond with customer service, the prices were fair and while they let me know other things I might want to keep an eye on, there was nothing pushy about this place. Highly recommend."
5,A Merry Christmas Update for the guys at Kinkade's. TJ and Jacob are always ready to help when you have an auto problem. Having used them consistently on all our cars since my first review I am always amazed by their customer service. Especially 4 days before Christmas.
5,"Came here twice, loved the ambience and the food was amazing. 
Juicing chicken I have tried so far in Toronto. 
Duck chaufa and avocado rice with chicken is a must try.
The shrimp tacos are good too!"
5,"Fresh, Yummy, Great Customer Service! There are not many deliver options close to my house in Summerlin but China Tango is across the street and a great choice for the hot nights that you just can't bare to cook! I dine in the restaurant, sometimes get delivery and pick-up.... I'm always greeted with a friendly staff that tries very hard to please... They are very accommodating to my orders with some changes, the food is fresh and delicious! Definitely a must try!!!"
5,"This place is on Roscoe's. Chicken and waffles with smothered Lo Lo gravy...Oh my. Service was great and fast.

Yum yum!"
5,"I came here to get an oil change, and they also cleaned up some dried protein shake that I splattered all of my windshield and speakers. Steve Ross was amazing."
5,"This place is wonderful.  One, Almost anything on the menu can be made gluten free.  Two, They have about 7 different types of loose teas to choose from.  Three, The food is GREAT!

My favorite dishes are the Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice Soup and  the Tofu Lettuce Wraps.  I am not lying when I say that I have NEVER had a dish I didn't like here.  The food is never greasy, never oversauced and never overcooked.  The seafood and veggies always have a really fresh taste... I seriously have no complaints at all.

I miss you."
5,"Best pho place in Downsview! Order 205 is one of my favourites which includes beef balls and think slices of cooked beef! The broth is very fresh and has a nice kick to it. Little or no MSG in my opinion since I don't get thirsty after drink the beef broth. Order 528 rice dish is generously portioned and ideal for food coma afterwards! Order 302 and have it with dry glass noodles on the side. This option is similar to dip ramen in Japan but of course a Vietnamese style! Very tasty indeed! 

Service wise is same across the board on all pho. Don't expect much! Waitresses have basic understanding of English. Eat and go! Not an ideal environment to spend time at!"
5,Service is always top notch and food is second to none. If you have not had the pork chops you don't know what your missing
5,"Very impressed with our experience at Mayworth Public House. Courteous service, delicious food and solid prices. Any place my wife can get fish tacos and I can get a burger is a winner! Everything came just as we ordered it, and we both enjoyed a piece of delicious cheesecake for dessert for $5.99. Cool that they have a brunch menu as well. We'll definitely be back for a second go around!"
5,"First time here tonight! Cute decor and lovely atmosphere, tried the Perlou and it was amazing. Will definitely be back."
5,We had a great experience working with Jason.  He was very knowledgeable with the CX5 and answered all our questions.  We would definitely recommend this dealership.
5,"We read about Julep recently and my husband was looking for some good fried chicken so we went on the early side on Saturday night and sat at the bar.  The decor was simple and warm.  It looks like they are going to have a really nice patio in the summer!  We started with pimiento cheese and oysters and both were very good.  For entrees we had the fried chicken thighs which were very good (he said a bit on the crispy side) and I had a special of chicken and dumplings which was fantastic.  The rue had a lemony dill flavor that complimented the chicken, celery, and carrots so well.  It was a simple dish with excellent nuances. The texture and size of the dumplings were perfect.  And all for $15.  For dessert, we had the sweet potato pie with a hint of cayenne and it was outstanding- the crust was delicious.  

We didn't have any drinks but hope to sample a few next time as we'll definitely be back.  This is one of the better dining experiences we've had since moving to Madison.  Great job, Julep!"
5,"I took my car in for a second opinion after having been told elsewhere, that my car's cooling system was totally doomed.  TJ took my car in (shuttle service home) and several hours later, PROBLEM SOLVED!!! The assessment was free (FREE) of charge and his estimate on the big fix was hundreds less than the other guys and even included other value added services that could easily be tended to while repair was underway!   I was completely impressed with his skill set, work ethic (it was 9am on Memorial Day), his integrity, professionalism and honesty.  He was easy to communicate with and did I mention he fixed my doomed car? I highly recommend the team at Kinkade's Auto Repair.  These guys know what they are doing & do it well!"
5,"What a great place.  Has the warm feel of an old Irish bar but with updated and finished look. Great view of TVs from any seat, solid beer selection and the whole family was very happy with the food. This is what a bar/restaurant should be."
5,"The service received is outstanding hands down. This is my second Mazda and my service advisor is Nick. During the most recent service appointment there was a small leak noticed by the mechanics. The car is still under warranty so it didn't cost anything but there are two things that make me appreciate the service. My wife has a Honda which had a small leak that we were aware of and we took it to San Tan Honda for regular maintenance and they could never find any leak. Within the first 6 months of the warranty ending and the car taken back for regular oil change they amazingly found a leak and it would only cost $710 to fix. I appreciate Mazda noticing the smallest leak that did. It even leave any drops in our garage to notice. 

Secondly, our daughter left her wallet in the vehicle and also $20 cash in the glove box. She called and spoke to Stephanie but she had forgotten about the $20 only asked to hold her wallet. When the car was picked up my daughter got her wallet and remembered she left the money in the glove box. Stephanie let her know when she grabbed her wallet she saw the money and put it in her wallet. 

The mechanic who did the work and reported the leak to Nick should also be thanked but I didn't get his name. I just would like to praise Cardinale Way Mazda for having such an excellent service team!

Sincerely,

The Ishida's"
5,"My car had been neglected for years.  Knowing that I needed to replace my engine mounts, I have had several places look at my car and always gave me an outrageous quote.  Never wanting to spend that much for my car it went untreated for years.  So when I finally decided enough is enough I started looking for places to have my car get a once over.  I came across Kinkade's auto shop and stopped my search. 
TJ took the time to listen to what I thought was wrong and also explained that they provided a free diagnostic without having to agree to repairs if I didn't want any.  A very nice no pressure approach that was very refreshing.  I decided to take my car in on my lunch break. And was pleasantly surprised that they offered a free shuttle service.  Before the end of the day TJ was able to call and tell me what needed done now, what was recommended soon and what could be put off for some time.  I had originally planned on taking my car for a second opinion but after discussing it with TJ I realized this was the shop to use.  
By the end of the next day, my engine mounts were fixed, my oil changed, new brakes and so much more, it's was like I had a new car again.  Once the car was finished they picked me up at my house and took me to my car. 
Throughout the whole process everyone I encountered was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. TJ even took the time to recommend some awesome places to visit downtown since I recently moved to the area.  This is definitely an auto shop that cares about the customers and doing the job right.  I am so happy I found them and will definitely return the next time something is needed as well as recommending them to everyone."
5,Thanks Nick for the best customer service Ive experienced in a while!
5,"Julep is WONDERFUL!  Fantastic Southern food and service.

Don't forget to order a biscuit!

Also - the mint Juleps are tasty."
5,Excellent food service is great also took my wife here for sweetest day  and we had a great experience!
5,"GREAT! Down home southern fried chicken. Just what I needed to remind me of ""mama's cooking"" from my childhood and to top it all off, service with a smile. I'll definitely be back!"
5,"Omg. This may be my new go to gig in town for a girls night out. The food is amazing. The drinks are a bundle of joy. The ambiance, decor, location. The idea just makes me want to go out again! 

The food choice meets many of the criteria I look for in great food. Artistic and color without being afraid to use vibrant colors. Texture that creates a fine balance such as a crunch, topped with a pizazz of fish, finished with a light drizzle. Flavor that mixes well with aroma and keeps things light yet fragrant at the same time. Especially given it was more of a tapas style, it was so fun to gossip with the girls, drink up frothy drinks, and continually reach of food. They do not go light on the alcohol which is nice knowing you get what you pay for. The service was amazing even though it was bustling. The interior was bright, warm, and vibrant and packed with people. Too much fun!  Recommend asking to go to esco-bar through the backroom so you avoid the front lineup. That bar gets packed! Only thing I would say is it could get pricey fast. Three girls with drinks, our bill rocked out to approx $420 for the night.  But hey, worth it. Good food, good drinks, good company is priceless.

Would totally recommend this place and can't wait to go back to it next!"
5,"I was looking for a late model used car for my daughter who lives in California. 
(I visited many dealers over a two month period). From the test drive to completion of the purchase all the staff we encountered were courteous and professional. We spent most of our time dealing with John and Chris. They had the car put on a hoist so I could inspect the underbody. They made multiple calls to California to make sure we would not have any trouble transferring the car to our daughter. 
In summary, it was a great car buying experience !"
5,"I was pleasantly surprised with both the service and the food that I received here. Being new to the area, we looked up ratings to see which place would be the best, and we loved this one. We will definitely be coming back here on a regular basis."
5,We had a wonderful experience! Jeff in the pre owned department was awesome!!!  We will definitely never go anywhere else again!!
5,This is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. The mac and cheese is great (and perfectly portioned). But my love for this place really stems from the biscuits. They are amazing--I cannot recommend them enough!
5,"This place compares to restaurants in Charlotte, fresh ingredients and great flavors!  Atmosphere is inviting and service was great plus the food was delicious!  So far this has been the best place we have eaten in Gaston County.  I had the vegetarian tacos and my husband had a burger.  This will become a regular place for us to visit."
5,Love this place! It's not far from where I work and that's a small problem.  The Capastromi and Grilled Italian are delicious.
5,Their food is great. All stuff are amazing...very nice place for lunch and dinner. My daughter and i love to go there.
5,"This was our first visit. It certainly won't be our last. 

Charming atmosphere, not too noisy. Very friendly service...and quick. 

The food was some of the best Chinese we've had a while. Their version of egg drop soup was outstanding. We combined House Fried Rice with Kung Pao chicken. Delicious!"
5,"Nothing but positivity. Their the angels of machinics honest loyal and caring. They call helped us with a crap car we had and didn't screw us with the prices they were completely honest about everything. They explain what's happening in our car so you can understand. We had a huge 1,500 fix and we couldn't pay it all Tj, the owner, worked out a payment plan. I seriously have love for these guys and all they've done for us I will never go to a different machinic."
5,"For years we been getting take out/delivery from china one but after finding china tango this will be our new place from now on.  Food arrived fast, hot and most importantly was good!  China One VERY Salty food!"
5,Nicest and most knowledgeable dealership I have ever been to. New car sales see Darlene . Dustin Kees is patient and understanding will explain everything with those two you can't go wrong. When your car needs service ask for Nick he makes you feel like one of the family. Best new car buying experience ever. I am one happy repeat customer. I will never go anywhere else
5,I think some of the best Chinese food in Madison.  A little pricey but a few dishes always feeds me for at least two additional meals.
5,"Very large and food, staff are very good.
It all depends on what you order and what you like in order to have a delicious time here.
I personally like the new mixed grill hot pot, it comes sizzling hot while they pour the sauce on! Very filling for a good price. 
Great for large family dinners especially with children. A large comfortable place, definitely started off rocky but it's steady and will reach new heights in the future! Will come again :)"
5,Best airport chicken I've ever had. And the price was fair too. Love the customer service here by cashier Jennifer and Mark the cook. They were very accommodating.
5,Always consistently delicious! Classic preparations of Americanized Chinese. The cashew chicken is great!
5,"Went there for rear struts. I brought my own, and had them install them. Great service, and even cheaper than the quote. A honest repair shop, which in these days is very rare !!. Will definitely will be going back when I need repairs."
5,"I have been coming to this restaurant for the last two years.  Great food- very authentic chinese flavor -outstanding service, very clean and its prices are very reasonable. My favorite dish is the shrimp with snow peas!!....."
5,This is the best hotpot! Corn soup and green spicy soup is a must try! The choices come in a large variety and it's always fresh! Service is better at their Chinatown location but I've never had great service at a hotpot restaurant. The downtown location also has soft serve ice cream cones as opposed to small scoop.
5,"I chose Kinkades because it was close to my work. I brought my car in for an oil leak. They diagnosed it for free and said they could fix it the same day for a reasonable price. I was so impressed with their work and prices, I brought my other car in for an oil change. I will definitely be using them again for my vehicle repairs."
5,"Customer for life! They're fast, efficient, and always able to explain the workings of the car and what exactly they did (which is big for me). Not only that- they're super nice! I always feel valued as a customer and a neighbor. I highly recommend them!"
5,"I came here because it was close to work and had some good yelp reviews. Wonderful customer service from the time I came in until the time I came to pick up my car. TJ was very professional, helpful, and knowledgable. I shall return!"
5,"Anytime I need my car serviced or worked on, Nick is always more than happy to help. Great service!"
5,My last night in Canada and I was super ecstatic to try a Latin restaurant. Walking in immediately I was amazed on how beautiful the restaurant looked. It was rustic with the beautiful greenery around the windows. I opted out and sat at a bar. Normally I'm a table kind of person but I'm glad I chose the bar. The bartender was really friendly and recommended us a few things. I got a campechano ceviche and the OG Duck chaufa. The ceviche was very acidic and subtle. The most favorite part of my meal was the Duck chaufa. It's like a Latin korean bibimbap. The flavors was delicious. The portion is super big enough to feed 2-4 people.
5,"Earlier this week, I was on my lunch break and decided to give this place a try. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered a small Italian sub. Good thing, too. The sandwich was by far the largest ""small"" sub I've ever had! There was a ton of meat and the bread was soft (not like some other places which I won't name). I'll definitely be back..."
5,"I typically don't eat steak, but it's so good here that I get it every time.  I always get chili as a side and it's flavorful.  Obviously, the rolls are to die for as well.  This location has the best service of all the ones I've been to."
5,"We have been eating at Sesame Inn since we moved here six months ago.  We do not eat meat and are so happy with the tofu offerings.  We particularly like the Spicy Thai Basil Tofu.  Hearty, spicy, vegetables that are al dente and the tofu is cooked just right.  The service is always excellent. Food is always hot off the stove and consistent in its preparation.  We are ""regulars"" now."
5,"Great service and delicious food makes this hot spot one I see why people are talking about! I came here to celebrate a girlfriends birthday and we were all impressed. We started with the guc, which was spot on! The best dish was definitely the octopus - even one of my girlfriends who isn't an octopus fan enjoyed it and said she would have it again. We also shared the ceviche and empanadas, beef causa and matambre. The flavour of the dishes were all so different, yet oh so delicious. We also all had the Batanga to drink - it was excellent! The server was helpful and attentive. I will definitely be back and recommend checking it out."
5,TJ was super helpful. Good honest and clean mechanic shop! Will do business here again!
5,This place has great lunch specials. The  kung pao chicken is fantastic but very spicy with jalapenos. The food here is very consistent and is one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area.
5,"Great atmosphere with southern decor. The mint Julep's are to die for. Great restaurant for appetizers and a nice glass of wine or a full dinner. The courtyard is delightful, very relaxing, and perfect for dinner or conversation."
5,"I will always take my car here for repairs. Always. For real. I don't care where I live in the valley, this is my spot. If you're reading this, it should be yours too.

Aside from the fact that TJ is a really nice guy, he runs his business with integrity. I took my car here for repair last year when it started making a noise that freaked me out. When they figured out the problem, he called and gave me two estimates (one being higher than the other). When they finished the work, the cost was the lower of the two estimates. This impressed me because in the many times I've had work done on my cars over the years, that's never happened. He earned my trust then and he earned it again recently when my son pretty much destroyed the engine in his truck. He took the time to find multiple options and estimates for repair/replacement, then took the time to patiently explain the pros and cons of each option to help us make an educated decision.

So long story, clearly not so short... if your car needs some fixin, take it to Kinkades. I don't mind sharing my spot."
5,The atmosphere was unexpectedly nice and the beer garden vibe of the large outdoor seating area is a great plus. I went for brunch and ordered a cappuccino (very well done) a doughnut (delicious) corned beef hash (got what I paid for) and a Bloody Mary
5,"Great place for Sri Lankan/ South Indian food! I have visited so many other places around the Toronto area but this is the best sit down restaurant for Tamil food. We went there as a big group for a friend's birthday and they had delicious food. Their portions are huge and you will have plenty to take home. 

The decor was good and they did a good job with the service. I got paper dosa and it was really huge (So big I had to get my friends to help me finish it). Appertizers were delicious ( Chilli chicken, Tandoori chicken and Chilli Gobi) - my friends got various types of biriyanis and they enjoyed it. We finished the dinner off with some desserts (Carrot halwa) and masala tea. Loved everything!"
5,"I love this place! Dumpling village is my absolute favourite place for dumplings in town! Although the service here is almost non-existent, and the place isn't really nice at all. But I can easily forgive all that for the cheap and yummy comfort food you can get here.

The dumplings here are awesome! I'm always excited when my bamboo basket arrives with 14 delicious and juicy dumplings steamed to order. I've gotten all sorts of dumplings here, usually a mixture of pork and some osrt of veggie (fennel, chives, cabbage, mushrooms and zucchini, etc.) My favourite is a more standard one with pork and chives. The dumpling skin is thin, but holds up well, and the filling is absolutely delectable! 

Another of my favourite is their pan cake with chives and eggs: crispy, pan-fried pockets stuffed with loads of aromatic garlic chives, bits of scrambled eggs and egg noodles. The piping hot filling is addictively delicious. My family always order a batch of these and pack home the leftovers for a tasty lunch the next day. 

The pork pot stickers were comforting and yummy as well. The bottom is pan-fried to a beautiful golden brown and has that wonderful crunch. I particularly enjoy pairing my pot stickers with black vinegar and chili oil. 

I also favour their braised beef and pancake wrapped in foil: marinated slices of beef shank and spring onions rolled up with a piece of green onion pancake. The tenderness of the meat was a good complement with the crispy texture of the pancake. However, I personally prefer the beef roll at Asian Legend more, as their version is more refined. 

Other items that I've had here include shredded meat and cucumber with vermicelli, dressed with a peanut sauce. It was a light and refreshing dish, and the vermicelli was velvety smooth. ""Silver buns"", which are just simple steamed buns, are soft and well-executed. 

For desserts, I've tried their red bean paste cake. The dough is slightly too thick, but there is an abundance of red bean paste to make up for that short fall.  Again, I would say that Asian Legend's version is tastier, but this one is quite satisfying as well. 

Dumpling Village never disappoints me, and I'm usually stuffed silly when I walk out of the restaurant. I agree with other Yelpers to just skip the Korean dishes and go straight for the dumplings!"
5,"great spot for lunch and dinner.  Burger sliders are very good and there are 5 on the plate!  Build your own salad is my favorite, Ive had it 2-3 times and it will NOT disappoint.  I will be back."
5,"I cannot even begin to express my love of this service team! I drive from Phoenix just to have my Mazda serviced here. They are phenomenal and I know I am able to trust them 100%, Steve is who I work with normally and he is not only super helpful but pretty dang hilarious and always has great stories to tell! Recently I was a little late returning the loaner car and picking up my car and Shawna the woman that takes payments stayed late just to make sure I could get my car so I could work that night (I am a rideshare driver), I am so thankful of how amazing this team is and how hard they work to make sure each and every customer is happy! If you need service for your Mazda this is hands down the place to go!"
5,"I owe TJ and the whole crew at Kinkade's a huge thank you. I brought my truck to them because it was leaking coolant and had never run quite right. They quickly replaced my radiator and retuned my carburetor so that my truck is running better than it ever has before. On top of all of this, the price they charged was very, very fair and less than I expected to pay for all that was done. 

I couldn't be a happier customer; I wouldn't hesitate to bring your car or truck to Kinkades."
5,"Not too many Latin restaurants in the city, but this is one of them that does it great. 

We started off with a couple orders of ceviche and they were great. From there, it just got better and better. The empanadas come out steaming hot, but when you wait for them to cool down, each bite has really good flavour of meat and potatoes and spices. The chips and guac/salsa were an interesting twist, as they use root vegetables for the chips. 

The true stars of the show were the mains. We got the arroz con pollo, fried whole fish, beef tenderloin, and the duck chaufa. They all were excellent. The duck chaufa is immaculate and this resto is worth 5 stars based on that alone. 

Customer service was top notch. Great place for a friends' night out."
5,"This place is awesome! I have been a regular at this restaurant for almost 2 years and it has never let me down. This restaurant specializes in Korean and Northern Chinese cuisine. As the name would suggest this place makes a killer dumpling. My favorite variety of dumpling is the lamb. The dumplings are steamed, the skin is not too thick and the lamb filling comes out perfectly juicy. The juices that are rendered down into the dumpling from the filling are simply to die for and the filling itself is quite good. Other than the lamb I also enjoy the pork and shrimp dumplings. The best part about the dumplings is that an order of 14 will cost $5-$7 depending on the variety. 
My other favorite dish has to be their spicy pork bone soup. This consists of large pieces of pork on the bone (from the spine of the pig) in a spicy broth served with some greens, bean sprouts a potato and comes with a side of rice. The Pork bones are meaty and oh so tender, I love their broth because it is one of the spicier broths I've had in a pork bone soup.  This is one of the few dishes that I crave and must have on a regular basis, a healthy portion is about $6. 
Other great dishes include the spicy fried chicken, this is chicken legs cut up (on the bone) breaded and fried with red chillies. These are crunchy on the outside and very juicy on the inside with just enough kick from the chillies. The only thing missing from this dish is an ice cold beer! They also have a sizzling rice bowl (bibimap i believe its called) which I've had once and is quite good. Dishes that I have had and was not a fan of include the kimchi fried rice, and beef roll in foil (which was bland and a little greasy). 
When at this established don't expect a high level of service, you will be seated given a menu to mark what you want and then your food is brought to you. It is run by 2-3 Chinese women who get pretty busy so don't expect them to ask how the food was or anything. If you require napkins just go up and grab them from behind the counter they won't really mind. The restaurant itself is not the cleanest and is located in a strip-mall off Shepperd ave. 
Overall come to dumpling restaurant if you are looking for an amazing home-made meal for under $10 dollars. It can get busy so be sure you have enough time to enjoy your dinner. Also I believe they make their dumplings fresh to order and dumplings usually take a little longer than other dishes to arrive. This place is truly a hidden gem!"
5,"This is one of the best hotpot place I have ever been.  The setting and decoration is very beautiful and the servers are very friendly and helpful. My girlfriend is not usually a hot pot lover,  but with the great vareity of selection of food and hotpot base this place offered,  she is loving it.  Definately a 5 star!"
5,"It was my first chance to give Julep a try and I loved it! I enjoy a citrus style cocktail and the Watercolor Water Buffalo was perfect for me. Great price point too. So far hey are serving light snacks and I tried the special- fried green tomatoes with an egg salad and sauce gribiche. Omg, it was delicious. The pimento goat cheese was so tasty and the homemade crackers were killer. I can't wait to see what Julep's dinner menu will reveal. I'll be back soon."
5,"I try to reserve my 5 star ratings for places I would go the very next day and eat again, and Julep makes the grade.  There were 7 of us that ventured out on a Saturday night and I use one word to describe the meal: DELISH!  Everyone was super happy with the meal, the craft cocktails, the ambiance, just everything about this place.  Their fried chicken was simply amazing.  The appetizers were amazing too.  Do not waste any time getting over to Julep."
5,"This is THE best Capriotti's location!  Friendly staff, and the subs are just amazing here.  The best cheesesteak subs and the meatball subs are my other favorite.  Homemade meatballs!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place and great prices!"
5,"Awsome facilities !! Pool hall, study room, gym, computer lab, pool and spa with a huge flat screen!! Also an amazing view of the strip!!"
5,"We found the food to be exceptional for
A three generation group. We tried a number of courses and found each to be tasty and unique. We used the recommendations of prior reviewers and found them to be great choices! Attentive, pleasant waitstaff. A great addition to Madison's culinary choices."
5,"pho here so delicious compared to others.  they aren't stingy on the meat, etc. and the broth isn't full of oil/fat.  price is cheap too."
5,"Love their phill steak sandwich , the way you want it , i always ask with mushrooms , yummyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy and delicious we buy the 20 inch and its good for 3 of us, the employee are nice and friendly , they make the food the way you want it ,not the way they want it if you never go just order its best ."
5,"Last night was my third time to Julep (fourth to the Robinia trio overall) so I should probably write something positive.
The design and atmosphere is THE BEST IN THE CITY, no contest. I'm not sure how it took this city so long to get it right, but... thank god for Julep, Borollo, and A-OK. We sat outside in the courtyard for dinner, which is just fantastic and is one of the few places where I feel like I could truly be in NYC or Portland or Miami.
The cocktails and the food are great but what I love so much is the restaurants' sharing of space and menu. I had a mint julep from the bar at Julep and our dinner outside of fried chicken, mint pea salad, and blue crab cakes came from Julep, but we got a bottle of wine brought over from the experts at Borollo.
The fried chicken was some of the best I've had in my entire life. So... I guess this city can do fried chicken now."
5,An obligated stop everytime I'm in Phoenix. Since the first time.i went 2 years ago they're pimping the place which is nice but hope they don't over do the place. Great food and music the best blue kool-aid
5,"I am so glad that I have found a reliable and honest car repair shop in Phoenix.  Kinkade's offers fair and competitive pricing as well as quality service in a short amount of time.  Everyone should bring their car to Kinkade's if you want reasonable prices, dependable workmanship, and excellent service."
5,"Brought my car in because check engine light was on. They were honest and upfront about the issues it could be. They explained all my options and even said they'd give me references because it was outside of the scope of work that they offer. Being a woman, it's refreshing to go to a place that isn't going to try and take advantage. They were all very knowledgeable and educated me on the issue with my car."
5,The Julep is a great place to check out some craft cocktails. Very classy and casual place to get a great tasting julep. It is VERY hard to limit yourself to just one. Fun to sit at the bar and watch the bartender do their thing. Way better to hang out in the Robinia Courtyard!
5,"This is definitely the best Capriottis I've been to in Vegas thus far. Maybe because its in a casino environment so you can grab a brew or take your sandwich on the go to the blackjack tables. The staff was very friendly to my guest and I when taking our orders. Everyone had a jolly smile and seemed like they were enjoying their work. I had the Bobbie and it was heaven! Cranberry sauce, stuffing, turkey, and Mayo on a hoagie roll. My second favorite is the Capastrami. Pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing on a hoagie roll. They have small, medium, and large (9in., 12in., and 20in.) sized sandwiches. Capriottis is a bit on the pricey side but its worth every penny."
5,"Straight forward guys, don't try to nickel and dime you. Probably not the fastest service shop around but they do great work, especially for the cost. They do repairs, maintenance, oil services and tires. Also have a free shuttle to get you home or to work if you can't stick around.

The only downside would be the wait. When you first walk in there may not be anyone there to greet you, so it can take them several minutes to notice you're there. It's not enough to keep me away, however."
5,"Favorite Brunch place in Madison. I am biased being from the South. Seriously a really great brunch that seems to be a hidden gem on East Washington. I have yet to have the pleasure of eating here for dinner, however been here for brunch at least ten times so far. Hash browns are great, Kentucky Sunrise is a great drink. My favorite is the shrimp and grits, however the table favorite is biscuits and gravy. Atmosphere is great. We sometimes have friends with small kids, no issues. On beautiful days the outside patio area is just amazing. Recommended this place to everyone."
5,"I come here very often because of  the delicious Butter Chicken and Fresh Naan, and the normally great service. 

Recently the dinner service here is a bit slow and disorganized. Seems a bit understaffed on the floor, but a couple newer servers are disorganized and perhaps better suited in non customer facing jobs. At least not the service field. 

I came for dinner with a friend...twice... Praising this place on great food and service. But was disappointed he didn't get to witness that.  Our entrées were brought to the table 20 mins apart - so he ate cold food once mine finally arrived. Both times lol (not funny tho)
An item we ordered never arrived at all, but wasn't billed so we didn't bother mentioning when we paid. 

New server squirted water on our food while spraying an empty table beside ours. And each time we inquired on our missing food items - she would ask ""oh did you order it"".   Ummm NO, we sent telepathic messages to the food and hoped it would come on its own!!! REALLY? But she never offered TO CHECK ON THE ITEM FOR US  ...hellloooooo geeez

Finally mentioned to a manager (owner?) who was going to check, until the cashier said she would...but then she never did. [Scratches head!]

I still love this place and hope they work out the training issues with floor staff. They do have a couple really terrific servers - who work their butts off, try to spot them and sit in their area if u eat here in the near future 
Hope mgt reads this and improves the weak areas. 
Because I love the food.  

Update: Went for lunch buffet today with colleagues and the service was so much faster. I wish it were as quick for dinner, and that the buffet were available evenings. 
Our group of 10+ colleagues vote for buffet at dinner service too"
5,"Decided to come here on whim when me and my family realized our regular dumpling spot was closed. Dumplings are one of my favorite foods so I'm very particular about my dumplings and I was actually very pleasantly surprised. The dumplings here are fresh, juicy and tasty. You know a dumpling is good when you bite into it and the juices from the steamed filling squirts out. We also ordered the Wonton Soup and it was different from most places make and serve it. Usually wonton soup is basic and only served in 
clear broth. However, their Wonton Soup had additional ingredients such as baby shrimp, flour boiled dumpling slices, and baby bok choy with pork and shrimp wontons. The place is underrated and is easy to miss because it's located in a small strip plaza. The establishment is nice and clean. Atmosphere is quiet and doesn't seem to get to busy. The price range is also very reasonable and I do plan to come back."
5,"I was there for opening night but with all excitement forgot to check-in. Then I did a pick-up order and noticed they weren't on Yelp, so I added them. I have been a few times now. 

The food is amazing! Fresh and flavourful. The menu has been scaled back a bit and the prices have increased a bit, not really surprising with the new building and make-over, I'll get to that in a minute. 

My faves:
Coctel ceviche is going to have sex in your mouth and make you feel all tingly inside! Holy mother of God I was not expecting the burst of flavour that came from this dish! Shrimp, avocado, tomato, lime and cilantro is orgasmic! 

Chori Papa is still on the menu, thank goodness because it is absolute goodness! Love this dish. 

New item - Bar Snack with the option of adding crickets for $1. Do it.

Tostada is yummy! 

Noquis is a great vegetarian option for someone. Gnocchi with a cream sauce, Gorgonzola cheese and peas, very delicious.

Chaufa - Chef Steve has upped his game! The combination of flavours in this one is outstanding! Duck confit, rice, edamame, egg, chili, papi Kung fu and tobiko (fancy name for fish eggs); your tastebuds will thank you. For one person $35 is a lot but for two I think that's reasonable. 

Chocolate - again, another orgasmic experience! Just get it! You will thank me. (I brought this to my chef friend and he had the orgasmic experience too!) 

Churros - yummilicious! Get it! 

Now about the building. Kudos to Baro for the absolutely amazing job on making it wheelchair accessible! I was blown away. The bathroom on the main floor blends right into the wall and the size is very generous. I work with people who have disabilities and it's so hard to find a venue that is accessible. The entertainment district doesn't think people with disabilities get out much. There is an elevator to access all four levels. 

The staff are phenomenal! From the minute you walk in and the ladies at the front desk greet you, to the servers, the bar, to the kitchen. My favourite seat is at the kitchen. I love watching them prep and plate the food. I'm a little sad that I can't see as much now because the counter wall is a bit higher and I'm short! Ha! 

So get up and go right now! You're welcome!"
5,"Oh. My. God. It's now my favourite (Asian/non buffet) restaurant in Toronto. I've been there 3 times now. 
I'm northeastern chinese and the food in this restaurant really suits my family's taste! Apparently the boss lady is a korean chef who went to china to learn about chinese cuisine, and combined the two flavour profiles together. Anyway... good portions and really tasty food! I would go back if I am near the location!"
5,Great pho. Giving it 5 stars to bump up its rating after going to some high rated pho places that were horrible.
5,"I have never, NEVER, been to a place like this.  I am an artist, on the road doing shows and I called them today because I felt the tires feel like they were slipping and am getting ready to head on down the highway.  Because I am just passing through they made time for me today.  I sat there for over an hour while they went over everything, I was nervous it was gonna be pricey, my van is old.  The owener came out and told me it was fine, the slipping is from getting new tires.  He told me some minor issues, but said if it were him he wouldn't bother with them.  They topped off my fluids, and said your all set.  I asked how much, and he said No Charge!  

Super Honest Folks here!"
5,"I like them very much. Decent Northern Chinese type of food.  Dumpings, pan cakes, buns, etc.. as well as some Korean dishes. 
Cheap and good dumplings. Leeks and Porks ones are my favourite there.  The Korean pork stew dish is quite good too, although wouldn't be a dish you'd eat in front of a date as it can be kind of messy."
5,"DELICIOUS SANDWICHES - CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK AND HAVE ANOTHER.

So I'm not from Vegas but my bf currently lives there. I have a favorite sandwich shop back at home, Little Luca's in the Bay Area (pastrami with cheese on Dutch crunch roll mmmmmm), and I have to say that this place is a new favorite. 

1) Food: I've only tried the Capastrami and Cheese Steak hot subs. Both sandwiches were MOIST, but not drenched with sauce. The pastrami meat was soft and not stringy like how it can be elsewhere. The cheese steak meat was also soft and gawd so yummy.  HOW DOES THE SANDWICH STAY WARM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME I AM EATING IT???  That's what I distinctly remember. The sandwich is ~$10... and like 20 inches long or something. I may be over-exaggerating that part but alls I remember is that it was a LARGE SANDWICH and I DEVOURED THAT THING, no problem.  And I'm a petite female if I may add that.

2) Dining & Take out: Plenty of tables to sit at and eat the sandwich.  No qualms about the to-go sandwich. Tasted just as warm and fresh as if I were eating it there, but then again I only had to drive a few blocks to get home. 

3) Parking: Went here for lunch - no problem finding parking. More trouble finding parking at night when I ordered it to go. 

Bottom line: If you're looking for a DELICIOUS, mouth-watering, WARM, MOIST sandwich, then I most-def RECOMMEND this place. Don't go to Vegas and not try it!"
5,"This is my family's absolute favourite Vietnamese restaurant in the city. The family's from Vietnam and have a very particular sense of taste when it comes down to their familiar cuisine, so we have had to try many many places over the years to come to this conclusion. On average, we come here about 2-3 times a month. There are also 1-2 other good Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga but we don't like trekking that far for a casual dinner. 

The broth for the pho is always very tasty, not watered down or filled with MSG like a lot of other restaurants. The owner is authentic Vietnamese, along with the other servers - it just feels nice to be able to converse in Vietnamese when you're actually in a Vietnamese restaurant. The owner isn't too chatty/friendly but the service is ok.

There is not much to do in the area of Wilson/Keele so definitely have a car if you'd like to head out afterwards. It's right next to a Beer Store and Value Village. The restaurant is always quite busy but you never have to really wait for a table unless you have a large group. 

Nothing upscale or fancy about the decor or service, but it's the food that's good. The Chinese items on the menu are not something to recommend though! Prices are reasonable, nothing is overpriced. For a dinner with 4 people it usually comes up to $35 at most with tips and taxes."
5,"I wish there were more stars to give these guys. I just moved to Phoenix when my pickup decided to die. I saw these guys had a great rating on here so I gave them a shot. They are awesome and deserve every good review they have. Tj is super cool, very helpful and honest. Their prices were very fair as well. I hate getting ripped off but I didn't feel that at all working with these guys. My truck now runs better than it has in a long while. I will definitely go back whenever I have anything that needs done on any of my vehicles. Overall a great experience doing business here."
5,"Just had the best service ever by Dimary (I think that's her name). Food was great. We got the fried pickles and onion app. Anything fried is going to be good. Margs are strong too! Steak is nice and tender if you know how to get it cooked!

And if you're lucky, you might see the regular who brings his lovely unicorn with him for dinner. (He actually was a super nice guy)."
5,"Seriously the best shop around. I had a complicated issue with my jeep that no mechanic could seem to figure out. Kinkades replaced a part for $200 (and called me first to assure I was okay with the replacement). This didn't work, but they spent days trying to figure out what else it could be. It ended up being a wiring issue that they fixed for free since their first guess was incorrect! I know wiring problems are not cheap. Very thankful to find a shop like this. Very honest, friendly and experts in diagnostics! Id recommend to everyone."
5,"We ordered delivery once again from here and we just can't seem to get enough of it!   The General's Chicken mild is better than PF Chang's.  That's saying a lot for me because I've been a BIG fan of PF's for years.  We also had the Orange Chicken and equally yummy.

Sides:  Chicken Fried Rice (best I've had)
               Chow Mein (good)

They do not add salt or MSG to their food like others in the Summerlin area.  So this is a plus for me as I do not like a ton of salt.

I say TRY this place!"
5,"Very friendly, quick service and was able to use a Yelp deal for a discount. Went in for an oil change!"
5,"This place has been in my neighborhood for quite some time and it wasnt until late last year I decided to try it for breakfast with my daughter. Good tasting food, reasonably priced and wait time is usually not long. My Cantonese isn't that good but they tolerate it lol. The pork and preserved egg congee with the turnip cake combo is very tasty and cant be beat for $6!"
5,Our waitress was hilarious and knew the menu very well! Food was superb. Definitely a must-try.
5,"American style Chinese, casual sit down joint, that offers up fresh-to-order, humungous portions at an extremely honest price. This is one of our favorite Chinese spots, on rotation. 

These people could fry a boot and it would be delicious! I'm also happy to report that the service here has been on their best behavior ever since we've been dining here. Very prompt, polite, plus the food is always whipped up super fast! They have been consistent and we haven't been let down yet. Plus, they don't rush you out close to closing! We arrived 15 minutes to closing and they welcomed us with no problems or attitude, I love that kind of customer service!

I don't know how they get away with charging so cheap! All of their dishes have very honest pricing, in Summerlin too, of all places! What makes me want to tilt my head with confusion - is the extremely generous portions they serve up. These plates are packed with lots of shrimp, beef, chicken and wings, without much filler. A great place for family style dining, or you be like us and take the large boxes (yup plural) of leftovers for an indulgent lunch the next day. 

Favorites:
Honey Walnut Shrimp $12 - plate full of glazed, plump, jumbo succulent shrimp & crispy sweet caramelized walnuts - for that portion size? you can't go wrong.

Sweet & Sour Pork $10 - they're super generous with the crispy pork morsels and the batter, although thick, is extremely fluffy and crispy!

Mongolian Beef $11 - very bold flavor and the beef is super tender. This is a little spicy from the fresh Serrano chilies so be careful if you're not a fan of spice - we loved it though!

Egg Fried Rice (upgrade) $2.50 - always upgrade! They give so much fried rice with lots of fluffy egg bits and it's not too oily.

Salt & Pepper Wings $6 - this takes about 10 minutes longer to prepare but it's worth the wait. I'm shocked by how many wings they give you for $6! The batter is light and extremely crispy and flavorful - sooo good!

Corn Egg Drop Soup $1 - a comforting classic egg drop soup and the bits of corn adds surprise texture.

Crab Rangoon (cream cheese wontons) $5 - classic crowd pleaser. Simple but generously stuffed with cream cheese and fried perfectly crispy.

I also always ask for their hot chili in oil, it's flavorful and adds nice spiciness to all of the dishes.

Pro tip: Don't complain if you're ordering sweet & sour pork or honey walnut shrimp and you're on a diet - you shouldn't be ordering that in the first place! Diet free zone!"
5,"Oh Julep, where have you been all my life?!? I've wanted a restaurant like this is Madison for so long, and it's finally here. It's incredibly well decorated, down to earth, and has a small menu that's both fun and packs a punch.  It's also part of the ROBINIA COURTYARD!  I can imagine hopping to Barolo and/or A-OK while waiting for a table at Julep on a busy night, which is so cool.  I'm really into that concept, it makes coming to E Wash worth it.

I had the perlou as a main, it was amazing!  The smokiness from the fish, the refreshing bite from the salty briny oysters, and the crisp rice grits combine for sheer joy.  My friend who's veg had the farro risotto, it was rich and delish.  We also split the crabcakes, cornbread,  pimento, and mac for the table. The small plates were great for sharing and all super good.  I also stole many bites of collard greens from my friend, while he was in the bathroom.  I highly recommend doing this because those collards kick butt!

I'll definitely be back to try some of the other options!"
5,We ate here for the first time the other night.  We were at a friends house up the street and decided to go have some dinner.  It was pretty late and close to closing time.  When we walked in we were greeted by the staff who was very friendly.  I really enjoyed having the tea at our table.  When our food arrived I was quite suprised.  It was great!  Decent portions and very deliscious.  I live in central Phoenix but I will make the drive to eat here again.  It was a little pricey but the quailty of the food was worth it.  Yummy!
5,"Well we just found another spot to add to our favorites list! 
The beer and drink list is incredible and is sure to satisfy any craving. The food was delicious, service was courteous, friendly, and efficient. We will most definitely be coming back and recommending"
5,"maaaan don't know where else you could find authentic spicy hot pot. 

granted it's on the expensive side--maybe $40+ per person with drinks, it's worth checking out. the service is very good, they're always very attentive. 

if you are able to, avoid the peak times since it's possible to wait several hours =|"
5,Best place in the GTA for Vietnamese food. Pho dac biet is definitely a staple for when you don't know what to get. Everything ranging from bun cha gio to bun no hue is great. One of my go to places for Vietnamese food! It'll be hard to find a similar Vietnamese restaurant after visiting Pho Mi Asia.
5,"My wife and I have been taking our cars to Kinkade's for the past couple of years and could not speak highly enough of the shop. I have encountered my fair share of condescending and dishonest mechanics, so I was relieved from the beginning to only receive helpful suggestions and honest work."
5,"Beautiful restaurant and the food was delicious!  Presentation was nice and the portions generous.  I ate here for brunch and they even went out for almond milk for my latte (they only had regular milk).  The ambiance was perfect - inviting, hip, chill.  The decor is culturally eclectic, really LOVE THIS PLACE. (I had the Florentine, Pancakes & Parfait - all so delicious)."
5,"I loveeeeee the service center here! They are always quick and effecient. They always send me a reminder email of my service appointments, along with call me to make sure I am happy with the service and to remind me of my next check up. Customer service is fantastic, no complaints here at all."
5,"TJ & his team are amazing! My fiancé and I have been coming here for a couple years and I couldn't recommend them higher. Great experience, honest feedback, and fair pricing - what's not to love :) Keep up the great work TJ!"
5,This is my favorite restaurant to go to period.. the food is always amazing but I'm writing this review because our waiter tonight was seriously awesome!! I overheard him say his manager wouldn't allow him to pick up anymore tables because he already had so many and even so he was so polite and attentive to us. Never an empty drink or dirty plate on our table.. as soon as our rolls or drinks were gone he brought more without us even asking. Great friendly service.. thank you Anthony :)
5,Awesome food and service everytime I've been here. Always hot bread and cinnamon honey butter at our table. I've noticed this location gets very busy around 5pm during the weekend.
5,mostly i get Boneless chicken and Chicken kothu ...loved it ..Cant go regularly  a bit expensive..
5,"Great southern food. Cornbread cooked like it should be. Brisket was fantastic, brussel sprout squash risotto was perfect. Drinks super tasty. 

On a weekend night the line can be a bit longer, but with the wine bar next door the wait goes by in no time!"
5,I can appreciate a sandwich shop that has vegan options. Best tofurkey sandwiches. It packs a punch + service is awesome. They gave me a free foot long upgrade for returning. A+ service!
5,"Just ordered carryout but the staff was still friendly and professional, and the MR porterhouse I got was cooked perfect and everything else was fabulous. Highly recommended."
5,"I have truly enjoyed my experience at this dealership. All the way from my British sales guy...to my service advisor Nick. They are so nice and are willing to joke around, while still providing great customer service. And I love my CX5 Touring Edition Mazda."
5,"My girlfriend and I came here on a Thursday around 5pm and had no trouble getting a table. We decided to dine at Pablos since they had happy hour specials. We ordered the fish tacos, mac and cheese, pulpo (charred octopus), and 15 oysters (it was $1 each)!! We also got a large pitcher of red sangria for only $20 which was amazing. 

Our server Rosa was super attentive! She had a very likable personality and made our dining experience that much more enjoyable. :)"
5,"Love the turkey dinner on a roll! Always friendly staff, very clean and the subs are huge! A++++"
5,"Very authentic Viet food! 

Other than pho,  my personal favorite is filtered coffee with condensed milk. The only con is that not all servers speak English and service can be a little slow.  Nevertheless,  the price and food quality make up for it."
5,"Wow, this was the most foodie restaurant I've been to in Toronto in a long time.  The food is incredibly tasty and amazingly presented.  The cocktails are to die for!   Plus they have a great wine list.  They are very popular so you have to make reservations in advance.  Great service, great atmosphere, totally brilliant food."
5,Went here for lunch one day and ordered the pastrami sandwich. I think this was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The staff was friendly and I will be definitely coming back. If you're in the area and craving a sandwich definitely come here!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,I was visiting from out of town.  I was worried my rotors were bad because of the shimmy on my car.  This placed check out my car for FREE and let me know there was no safety issue.  There honesty is rare and appreciated.
5,"Hit the Red Rock food court for a late night munchie fest after the Rock N Roll wine event and had to have a philly cheese steak.

Capriotti's has THE best Philly cheese steaks in all of Vegas!

Oh yea!"
5,"My parents and I used to eat here when I was a little girl. I grew up (a little bit :)), moved away from Arizona for 6 years, and recently visited Sesame Inn for the first time since, oh, 2010. Everything is so familiar and comforting!  Same quirky decor. Same delicious food.  Different pretty high-schooler acting as hostess, but I wonder if she goes to the same high school that I did. 

Overall, this is good solid Chinese food - the best (Americanized) Chinese I've found in 3 states. Go, you won't regret it!"
5,Happy Hour is awesome the hot wings and onion ring are the best I've had in Henderson got to say better than California! On business and for a quick bite I highly recommend it !!
5,"Great place, best steak for a chain restaurant that i ever had. Very flavorful. Great prices too. Always so busy but they turn tables so fast. If they're on a wait i never have waited longer then 5 mins Deff recommended trying."
5,"We have been trapped in Henderson for two weeks while dealing with our rental home here.  Joy, Lisa, Christy, Mike and Brittany have been a wonderful escape for us!  The food is good and the service even better.  Sports on every TV and an outdoor area for the sunshine.  We will always come back and visit our home away from home!   Thanks guys!"
5,My family and I ate here yesterday and everything was perfect! When we showed up we were worried with the packed parking lot but to our amazement we were seated immediately. Our server Anthony was extremely attentive and we were so thankful! He brought us drinks super fast and was helpful with menu choices. Our food was fabulous! My Dallas filet was perfect. It was done correctly a medium. The flavor was great and it was super tender and juicy. My husbands ribs were fall off the bone! Kids were happy with their choices and sat happily. They throughly enjoyed all the peanuts. Rolls galore! Great meal in a great atmosphere! We will be back positive
5,"4 picky, retired folks came for a late lunch and had so much good food and fun we stayed for 2 hours!!  The staff was welcoming, sincere and down right fun!  Every single thing was fresh, tasty and had a creative twist. This restaurant may be a little out of your way, but if you take the time to seek it out you will not be disappointed!

Meatloaf snuggled in a blanket of bacon! Sloppy Joe served on a brioche bun.  Roast beef piled high on a special Weck roll, and Buffalo chicken tacos with a tasty sauce for dipping.  I don't want to test your patience by going on and on about the sides, but I should.... pasta salad, sweet potato waffle fries, and OH the mac and cheese. Nothing ordinary here.  Really, each item was planned and executed with thought and attention.  
And then there was dessert!!   Cakes from Queen's Bakery in Charlotte... need I say more???  All were over the top good, big slices, and exceeded expectations.  
We finally departed with leftovers in hand, not wanting to leave one tasty bite on the plate. 

So...what is most important--food or service?  We've been to places where the food was special, but the service so bad it ruined the meal. It is really hard to beat a place that serves tasty food with a sincere smile, sense of humor in a welcoming atmosphere. Kudos to the staff!! That combo makes this place a special gem you shouldn't miss.  

We are only in town for 2 weeks and plan to go back before we leave  -- there are other things on the menu we still have to try.... and yes, more dessert please!"
5,Probably the best customer service I have ever gotten at a pub. Recommend the sweet potato waffle fries! Just moved the area and I'll definitely be back.
5,"I have eaten here a few times now and the food is really good. I recommend coming here for the lunch prices, it is $7 and you get an entree, soup, and fried rice or chow mein. For dinner, the prices are average for a chinese restaurant."
5,"Located a little bit off my usual beaten path, this restaurant on the north east side sits in a nook and cranny strip plaza in Scarborough. It's Chinese owned and run, doesn't have the usual flashy or modern signs that most people are accustomed to. Seeing it from the road may be a problem but if you're patient and drive slow, you surely will be able to find it. 

Not able to read a word of Chinese, I let my friends order on my visit here over the holidays.

As you can imagine from the name, this place specializes in Chinese dumplings of the steamed variety.

I do not recall the specifics of what was ordered but I do recall it was the tastiest dumplings I ever had. It arrived to our table in a bamboo steamer, filled with dumplings (I think a dozen or so each tray). Upon opening it, the dumplings were steaming hot and looked very fresh.  Waiting for it to cool down for our first bite, we were not disappointed.

The dumplings here are great, comes in various varieties like chicken, pork, vegetables, fish.  Ample sauces like soy sauce, hot sauce, vinegar with ginger was provided.  We also ordered a spicy squid salad drenched in a red spicy sauce that was delicious!  I have never ever had something like this everywhere but man oh man was it good!

Definitely come here for the best steamed dumplings in town!

What about the decor or ambiance you ask? Who the hell cares?  As Anthony Bourdain once said, ""Forget the decor, it's all about the food.""

And this place definitely is all about the food.  It's a little off the beaten path especially if you do not live in the area, but I would definitely come back again!"
5,This is by far best place have ever gone w my car. I know several mechanics and this place looks out for you and your car. Was waiting for upsel and was jus opposite. Got over heating problem solved at right price. Beyound happy and would recamend this spot to anyone!! Thanks
5,"Home to my favourite cocktail (Five Flower) and absolute favourite bar (Escobar) in the city, this unique venue deserve a 5/5. 

The main floor offers a full dining experience, specializing in Latin cuisine. There aren't many other Latin restaurants in Toronto, let alone one with the ambiance like Baro. The restaurant features an open kitchen, and sitting by the bar gave me a glimpse of the action - I am sucker for open kitchens. The restaurant decor was also meticulously designed. 

Upstairs you will find Pablo's Snack House, which offers tapas and shareable plates. I have yet to eat here, but enjoyed the drinks. 

Finally, hidden away on the second floor is Escobar, a speakeasy hip-hop bar. This is my go-to place on the weekends...great music, friendly/attentive bartenders and a trendy, easygoing ambiance. Management is honest, very accommodating and makes me feel like a valued customer. If you can get your hands on the password, definitely check it out."
5,"My favourite place for pho! My mom is friends with the owner, so I've been going here since this place was opened (maybe for 13 years?) Besides the occasional line out the door and long waits during peak times, service is quick and the food is great. I'm really picky when it comes to pho, but I think this pho is one of the best ones I've had so far."
5,Lemme just say this is an adorable and friendly little pub. Never went to the old place. I highly recommend what it is now though. Diverse menu and pretty appropriate pricing. Good regional beer selection as well as some regular cheap standby beers. I would come here super often if I lived nearby.
5,"The TRUCHA (trout cievche)  was mouthwateringly perfect, so refreshing! I wish I didn't agree to share it lol

EL TIPICO 22  such an interesting combo of flavours, lights but perfect to share with 2/3 ppl so everyone can have a little taste.

Always a great start to snack on and share with the table: house-made chips + guacamole + salsa

SEARED SCALLOPS my favourite item on the menu, cooked to perfection, full of flavour and I'd highly recommend!

I don't typically go for duck with the Chaufa was a generous portion served in a hot stone bowl and full of flavour (highly recommend to share 3/4 people) 

LOMO SALTADO the beef tenderloin is melt in your mouth and served with surprisingly crunchy veggies. It's good for that person who is apprehensive about Latin foods or not a huge fan of unique combinations of flavour.

CHORI PAPA 16 although this was a great taster for me, I personally am not a huge potato fan. I think as the manager suggested take it home for leftovers and fry an egg on top for breaky. 

The atmosphere is great for a date night, going out w a few friends or out to celebrate. Extensive cocktail list and upbeat music. 
I'd share everything on the menu, this is the spot to run down the menu and have your fill!

Exceptionally Friendly service. 

CGS 15 house-made chips + guacamole + salsa

TRUCHA 21 trout + pineapple agua chile + lemon + fresh cucumber + avocado + cilantro

EL TIPICO 22 ocean perch + tomato aqua chile + avocado +
jicama + sweet potato + citrus + chulpes

SEARED SCALLOPS 25 tamal de olla + crispy maitaki mushrooms + maduro +
olive + chia seeds + cherry tomato

CHAUFA 35 duck confit + rice + edamame + egg + papi kung fu + chile + tobiko veg and vegan available 25

CHORI PAPA 16 chorizo + potato + peppers + chipotle golf +
goat cheese + 4  our tortillas

LOMO SALTADO 36 beef tenderloin + pomme anna + seasonal veggies +
tomato + soy & ginger jus"
5,This place was awesome.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The price was right and I will be using this place from now on for auto repair.
5,"I loved this place... I went with a group of five people where we were able to create our own sharing menu (aside from the pre-composed tasting menu they supply). This afforded us the opportunity to try a wide section of menu items that appealed to us. I can't really choose which dish I liked best, they all had great qualities and flavour - it just kept getting better and better as the food came out!

We decided on the following:
- CEVIVHE TIRADITO (albacore tuna + passion fruit & lulo + squash + chile + cilantro + sesame seeds)
- SHRIMP TACO (argentine white shrimp + salsa golf + horseradish + tomato + avocado + taro shells + mustard greens)
- SEARED SCALLOPS (tamal de olla + crispy maitaki mushrooms + maduro + olive + chia seeds + cherry tomato)
- PULPO (charred octopus + chorizo + potato + fennel + tomatillo & poblano + cilantro)
- OG DUCK CHAUFA (duck confit + rice + edamame + papi kung fu + chile + tobiko)
- LOMO SALTADO (beef tenderloin + pomme anna + seasonal veggies + tomato + soy & ginger jus)

The staff were very helpful and on top of their game considering it was a full house that night. I will definitely be going back to Baro - most likely sooner rather than later...

Side note: The only chink in their armour were the beer options. My friends stuck to the wine & cocktail offerings and they seemed please with their choices..."
5,"I didn't know it was even possible to have such a positive car buying experience! It truly was one like no other. Corrie was friendly and warm, and an excellent communicator. From when our communications began by phone and by email, she was terrific with follow up and thoroughness. She was also extremely knowledgeable about the ins and outs of the Mazda 6 and educating us on the features.  My husband and I felt taken care of the whole time. Both Corrie and CJ were straightforward and concise, and we didn't feel dirty after talking money because we didn't feel we were being played. 

Every person we met delighted us and made us feel we were dealing with family. Brian, another salesperson completely unrelated to this sale, gave me a book that they had studied in their book club - The Compound Effect - when it came up in conversation. I was happy to learn of the efforts made to give to the community as a portion of the sale of our car went directly to the Phoenix Children's Hospital in our name. Thank you, Corrie, and thank you everyone at Cardinale Way for changing the way we view car buying... we will be back!"
5,Moved here not to long ago from Huntington Beach CA and found this great bar. Happy hours are awesome and food is amazing. I recommend the spicy chicken salad.  Chris the manager is on it when the crew is busy so you never wait for anything. My favorite bartender Dawn it amazing.  Always greeted when you walk in like an old Cheers episode.
5,"I wish I could give this place a hundred stars! The owner TJ is one of the most genuine and nicest people I have ever met! I flew in from California to buy a car and brought it to him to do an inspection. He was very honest with me and showed me all the defects in the car and didn't even charge me because he felt bad that the car was in such bad shape and we flew all the way for it. It didn't stop there he helped us look for another car and even a hotel! He offered to give us a ride to the airport, etc. There aren't many people out there that are good people like this. He did all of this just to help us and didn't charge a dime! Ultimately we ended up buying a car from one of his longtime friends who was just as helpful and honest as he was at a reputable dealership. A wonderful owner and wonderful service. Everyone should come here without a doubt! He reminds me of why I hate LA sometimes because you don't get people like TJ there!"
5,"Always great sandwiches and service no matter what time of day or evening.No matter which sandwich you choose, it is made fresh to order as you watch."
5,"Consistently excellent food. My entire family loves this place. Every sandwich on the menu is amazing and you have to try the house special ""Sloppy Joseph"" (don't pass up on the jalapeños and queso)."
5,Fantastic! We are here on a whim one night and everyone loved their entrees. I recommend the pork chops for sure.
5,"This place has the best breakfast special I come here every weekend morning that I can!! It runs from 9-11am on Fridays to Sundays (9:30-11:30 Mon-Thurs) and you can match 2 items on their breakfast combo menu + drink for $5.95. The portions are a great size and you leave feeling full! 

The service is super fast. We ordered and received our meals in 10 mins. I got the two eggs and sausage with butter toast with the ham macaroni and everything was delicious. A very clean breakfast since nothing was too oily or fried and still super flavourful. We arrived pretty early at 9:30 so there was no wait at all but I've been here before around 10:30 and it could get crowded from all the people trying to make that 11am breakfast special cut-off.

What's a plus as well is that they give complementary Chinese newspapers that you can take with you for someone who reads them (if you don't yourself)."
5,"Capriotti's is a chain, but don't let that stop you if you want one of the best Italian subs in town, as well as cheesesteaks that rival what you'd find in my hometown Philadelphia.  AND they sell Tastykakes!

I live in the neighborhood and often pop into this location (in Red Rock Resort's food court) to pick up a sandwich for lunch (tip: park in the parking structure or parking lot closest to the highway so you don't have to walk clear across the casino floor to get to the food court).

Unfortunately, Capriotti's doesn't serve french fries, so they are unable to complete the Holy Trinity of Unhealthy Philadelphia Fast Food which I love so much - 1) cheesesteaks, 2) cheese fries, and then 3) Tastykakes for dessert.  But I can't knock them for what they do serve at all, so thumbs up."
5,"I usually don't do reviews but this place is worth it.
I was having issues with my VW dealership and was spending a lot of money causing concerns for me.

I took an appointment, missed it but they still took my car in. Not only that when I was trying to pull in, since it was a busy day for them, there were some parked cars blocking the entry, after calling in they immediately helped me park.
Now that's customer service !!

I was offered a shuttle both the times. They did a free evaluation of the problem too.

The usual time they close is 5:30 but that day they were working even at 6:30.
So, overall great working ethics, great people, super detailed explanation of the issue and exceptionally technical.
I will no doubt replace my dealership visits and start coming here for servicing too."
5,"This place was awesome! It is easy to get to, but tucked out of he way a bit, so it wasn't packed even though we went the night of the UW Homecoming. The atmosphere was spectacular - cozy and romantic. We each had the Julep which comes served over shaved ice. It was delicious! Both our meals were great too. I had the Perlou, which someone had previously described as ""southern bibimbap"" and they were dead on. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits, which had the perfect amount of spice to it. We both left stuffed! The pricing is pretty on par with some of the trendier restaurants in Madison. The only down side is that parking is tough, especially with all the construction on nearby streets. We can't wait to go again!"
5,"TJ is the man, just sayin'! I always try to support local business's but it was difficult to find a local auto repair shop I actually trust and feel comfortable recommending to a friend. 
Kinkade's is fast, friendly, fair, honest & reliable. 
I've had my truck serviced here r multiple times, and was wildly SUPRISED to see my bill actually match or be slightly lower that the estimated quote. TJ is very straightforward about the work he will be doing on your vehicle and is never pushy or misleading. Just a straight up honest dude! His team gets the work done!
They also had a very fast turnaround during my experiences, so I was only car-less for a day or two max.  The customer service is unsurpassed. Highly recommended. Also forgot to mention that TJ  was nice enough to drive me to and from work, quality dude!"
5,"Get the wings and a giant beer.  Perfect.  Seriously though, the wings are awesome.  There's also pool, golf machines and video poker plus a bunch of TV's with sports on.  The staff are friendly and it's not too expensive.  I love it."
5,"I have dinner at Mayworth about once a week with my friends, and we have never had a bad experience.The staff is always cheerful and timely when taking an order, and the managers really go out of their way to make sure your dining experience is everything you would want it to be. Excellent food, great beer selection, and all at very affordable prices. 
If you're looking for a good appetizer to feed a larger group, definitely order the sloppy joe waffle fries. You won't be disappointed. 

Need a place to take your furry friend? They even have a patio section out back where they allow customers to bring their dogs! With the Goat Island park right across the street, I can think of no better way to spend a Saturday than taking my dog for a walk in the park and then hitting the pub for a cold one."
5,"Jonathan was extremely professional, courteous and easy to work with. Purchased a vehicle tonight with no BS. Vehicle was available when they said it was and pricing was straight to-the-point. No add-ons that you don't ask for, no bait-and-switch internet pricing, no beating you down for hours to get you to take their lousy rip off price. No pressure to finance just to get another ""discount."" Just a straight forward honest deal. Exactly the way it should be."
5,The food here is really good. Every time I'm flying out of Skyharbor terminal 4. They have more locations across the valley.
5,"Scarborough's hidden jewel!! I must mention that this isn't 100% korean restaurant and you'll find a difference in some dishes they prepare. To me, it rather reminded me of Chinese-Korean restaurant when I lived in China long ago. Bringing back all the nostalgic memory with quality food with the such humble service at under $8.00!?!? I was confused if I was in dream land! Pork bone soup is simply the must and Fresh Cold Noodle is surreal! Dumpling is just fantastic!! Just go, don't ask, and don't tell anyone :p"
5,"Yum!  Party of 7, everyone ordered their own dish and then shared with all.  Started with pot stickers and shrimp ragoon.  Grilled pot stickers were really good, could have just eaten those and been happy.  Appetizers came with a variety of dipping sauces.  Best dishes sampled were crispy orange beef, almond chicken and generals lamb.  Lamb was way tender, excellent choice.  Service was prompt and friendly, great atmosphere.  Ended meal with delicious mango ice cream.  Left happy and very full!"
5,"Family style portions and delicious food. The House Fried Rice is the best, great portions of chicken, shrimp and beef. It sometimes gets a little too busy, but during the summer months it's great for locals, since the tourists leave."
5,"This place was fabulous! Atmosphere is wonderful. Tastefully decorated. Ample space between tables. Booths are private. They have an outside covered patio. The food was excellent! NOT typical bar food. I had fish tacos that were absolutely delicious. My husband had the Korean bbq chicken sandwich. There was so much more I wanted to try! Our server was prompt, attentive and friendly! We will definitely be back soon!!"
5,"I have been craving dosa for a few days, and finally got my husband to take me to Karaikudi. We were seated promptly, but it took a whole before we could get the attention of a waiter. We got masala dosa and mutton biryani; dosa was good, but if you are really hungry, the dosa itself may not satisfy. I really loved the sambar, and made sure every last drop got inside my belly! 
But let's talk about the mutton biryani. I, myself, barely ever eat mutton because of its distinct smell. This biryani had no smell whatsoever; it was light and fluffy and simply delicious! It was served with an egg, onion raita and sambar (i think) - both my husband and I had smiles on our faces while devouring it. Yum!!!
We were asked if we were collecting points (at a restaurant??), which we had no idea about - but if the food is so good, getting a loyalty card would definitely be a wise decision!"
5,Great tasting food and great value - the lunch special of $5.95 can't be beat.  We dined in and had the Chicken in hot garlic sauce and the Pork in garlic sauce.  Both were fantastic and came piping hot just out of the wok!  The portion was enough for two meals and that was what we did - doggy bagged to take home.  Place is clean and service is prompt and friendly.  Will be back many times.
5,"Recently, I received an estimate for a small repair from my Toyota dealership.  Luckily, I decided to get a second opinion and have the repair done somewhere else.  I had a great experience working with PJ at Kincaids.  They were fast, friendly and efficient.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in the downtown area."
5,"Fun place, trivia night is a blast.  Food is very good with nice variety.  Full bar and nice beer selection.  They have a nice back patio as well."
5,Favorite place ever! So many options to try new things and everything is so good! Would totally recommend coming here. The service is great and the food is even better. The almond chicken with white rice is one of my favorites.
5,"The wings were really good. I took my girlfriend out on a date here. We only met an hour ago. I used this dating website called Craigslist. She was really nice and I made her get just the salad cause I was cheap. Ok enough about myself, the food was absolutely amazing. I would recommend this place to anybody who is bringing a blind date. 


PS just kidding my 3 year relationship girlfriend would kill me if she found out that I posted this review lol"
5,"I can't compare this location to any other Texas Roadhouse, but this is my boyfriend and my go to weekend dinner spot right now. I've ate at many fancy steak houses--some that were phenomenal and others just *meh*--but there is just absolutely nothing wrong with this place and it's much more relaxed and affordable. We like to sit at the bar and the service is great. My filet has been cooked perfectly every time and thus far they have never been out of my boyfriend's prime rib. The loaded baked potato and the sangria margarita swirl are both so delicious here. I've never had a bad experience here, very consistent food and service.

Not losing a star because I'm not petty and I think a big part of the problem is due to bad customers, but the women's bathroom is really, really bad. It's always wet and in need of cleaning. The last time I was here I had to turn the sink off after a customer just up and left with the water running."
5,"Yummy Bobbie sub, its Thanksgiving on a roll. Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce with a bit of mayonnaise.   Ask for extra cranberry sauce though!"
5,Maywood burger was excellent!  The sweet potato waffle fries were also great! Had 2 different beers not normally seen on menus here. Service was wonderful too!  Highly recommend you visit this small eatery. I see they have karaoke starring at 10 tonight.
5,Dont be fooled by the other steak houses this place has always been consistent great service great food and its affordable for a family to experience a nice steak house. Ive been eating here at least 10 years great place.
5,"A great little restaurant in a quaint southern town. My wife and I decided to stop in on a Sunday. It was busy but we were seated quickly. I ordered the fish tacos and a side salad with homemade Bleu cheese dressing, and my wife had the breakfast burger with the hashbrown caserole off of the brunch menu and both meals were great! Our server was awesome!  We'll definitely be back!"
5,"Kinkade, Kinkade, yep he's the man.  If he can't fix it, No one can. 

Now that I got that out my system.  Kinkade's is very professional, upfront, fair in pricing and just all around a wonderful business.  My daughter was having an issue with a car she purchased that broke down 30 minutes after she purchased it.  I had the car taken to Kinkade's, where they did a bumper to bumper inspection.  TJ was very upfront about the pricing, how long it may take and is the car was worth the time.  His pricing was very fair and I was very pleased with the service provided.  I was so pleased that I took my daughters other car to him and had it looked at and TJ was able to fix it even though it's a Volvo which most mechanics are not that eager to work on.  Thank you very much for all the work you did as well as giving my daughter some very much need advice."
5,"A spark plug broke in my Miata out in the middle of nowhere. Took it to Cardinale the next day and they got right on it and had it up and running in no time. Really took time to go over the engine and check everything out. It sounds great - runs smoother than it has in a long time. I now realize that the spark plug had probably been going bad for a long time - but I didn't know it. I just thought the rough idling was a normal part of a 7 year old Miata. So why didn't the other dealer nearby ever catch it? The car has been there twice in the last year for oil changes and they never said anything. But they couldn't identify a road noise as being a bad wheel bearing either. But Cardinale did and I'm switching to them permanently for Miata maintenance and repairs. Very nice, friendly people there, too."
5,Husband took me there for our Anniversary dinner and the steak were very delicious. Would definitely recommend
5,"Like how they give you tea when sitting down to eat here. Love the bowls that the rice comes in and love how there is a lot of rice for the entrees here. The miso soup is very good and I definitely recommend getting it. I got the chicken with string beans and it remind me of the meal similar to that at P.F. Changs, very delicious and everyone should try it!"
5,"These guys are the bomb diggity! Thorough, reliable and trustworthy.  I am a customer for life! They checked my vehicle out for free and did a few things to troubleshoot and didn't charge me. I love these guys!!! They really want to fix vehicles, keep people safe and save people money. That is how it should be. Way to be an asset to the community, T.J. Your business is a blessing"
5,"This was an overall delightful experience, and exactly what I was looking for when it comes to pub food.

We came on a cool Friday night, around 8:30pm.  It wasn't terribly crowded, nor loud.  We were promptly seated and our server came by quickly for our drink order.  Alas, they were out of the one beer on tap I wanted, Bell's Two Hearted Ale, but they did have Hop Drop & Roll in the bottle so that minor misstep was overlooked.

As an app, we got the pretzels.  Two large, soft pretzels come with a pot of queso and a pot of mustard.  These pretzels were delicious; chewy, salty, and brushed with enough butter to make them glisten.  The queso and mustard were excellent complements.

For my entrée, I got the classic burger with some sriracha mayo.  My wife got the spinach and goat cheese black bean burger.  I got the standard waffle fries, while she got the sweet potato waffle fries.

My burger was cooked about as well as a burger can be.  I asked for it medium, and while it was a tad medium-well on the edges, overall it was great.  What made this burger special was the seasoning.  It was PERFECTLY seasoned.  A round of applause to the line cook and his judicious use of the salt shaker.  The bacon on the burger was also perfectly cooked, the sriracha mayo I got on the side was par for the course, and of course what tied it all together was the Martin's potato roll, literally the best bun you can use.  I savored every bite.

My wife enjoyed her burger.

Both the regular and the sweet potato waffle fries were great as well.  Crispy, hot, and well-seasoned.  Exactly what you're looking for in a french fry.

Prices were exceedingly reasonable, the quality was high, and service was excellent.  I'd consider Mayworth Public House to be a higher-quality, more reasonably priced alternative to some place like The Liberty in Charlotte."
5,"Just over a year ago, my wife and I were shopping for a car. We did our due diligence and prepared. Credit was good, had a down payment, knew what cars we wanted to look at and compare, and knew exactly what our budget was. Over the course of a week, we sat in and drove every car on our list except for one, the Mazda6. We stopped in at More Mazda in Tempe and were met in the parking lot by a salesperson. We explained that we were shopping and comparing and what we wanted to look at. He led us to a 6. When we told him our budget his tone became abrupt and somewhat annoyed, this after telling us that ""it's not going to happen, maybe a 3, not a 6"". Ok, we shook hands and left. A week later we met Darlene L. at Cardinale Way. She got us into a one year old 6 ITouring sedan with tech package for exactly what we wanted to spend. Fast forward to last weekend. Our other car took a very unexpected dump. Off to Cardinale Way we go. Dealt with Darlene, once again, and left with a beautiful white CX9 ITouring. A bit over budget, but given the no hassle experience, this was not a problem. We highly recommend the entire team at Cardinale. And we highly recommend that you ask for Darlene, you won't regret it."
5,We had dinner here again tonight! Can't say enough about the quality of the food!  Dining room is clean and new!  Had the generals chicken med. spice and was great.  Also had the sweet and sour chicken which was not overly sweet like most place I've had.
5,This was a fabulous place for lunch - we got the warm pimento cheese spread for an appetizer - YUM!  The create your own salad was perfect and something I wish more restaurants offered.  Wish we lived closer but we will be back when we are in the area again!
5,"I'm a fan of Julep, it is my favorite restaurant in Madison at the moment. After dinner there with a friend, I was quick to recommend it to my friends and coworkers. The fried chicken is very good. Crispy, tasty skin, with flavorful, moist thigh boneless meat- this combination is hard to come by. The shrimp and grits were delicious too- large shrimp cooked just right, and the grits were creamy and well-seasoned. I wasn't a big fan of the peppers in this dish, but it didn't detract from the dish. The shrimp fritters were unexpected, I was expecting whole shrimp but it was more like a shrimp paste.. I enjoyed it though, as well as the okra that came with this appetizer. My friend had a few cocktails and was happy with the quality of them. I also appreciated the ambience and decor of the restaurant.. the salt and pepper shakers are adorable and what an interesting idea to hang the antique headboard on the wall. Overall, Julep gets 5 stars because the service, ambience, decor, food, drinks, and location are all very good."
5,"I am so happy I found this mechanic shop.

Every employee I've had an interaction with is the nicest person ever, which is refreshing considering how clearly busy they all are.

Recently I had some computer issues with my 2008 Prius. I had thought it was the battery but was still unsure of what to do. I called Kinkade's to ask about testing my 12v, and TJ was so nice about getting to the bottom of the issue. He talked me through the entire scenario, suggested free ways of testing the battery, and then spent an extra 15 minutes looking up common issues with my gen Prius to inform me what the issue might look like when I got it tested for free at ORiely's. He ended the phone call with ""Call me back with the results and we can figure out what your best option is.""

Not once did he try to have me bring in my car for expensive testing. I had never felt more confident in a diagnosis and never felt like I was being overcharged.

TJ always takes the time to literately draw a diagram of my car and explain what an issue - or potential issue  - is. He shows me exactly how he calculates labour and is very considerate to my financial situations.

The only downside to this shop is the horrendous parking sitatuion. But even with that, the employees are nice enough to reverse park into thier spots so that I don't struggle exiting onto 7th ave."
5,"Fired chicken was crispy and delicious! Mac and cheese was good and creamy! Waffles were cooked to a perfect golden Brown! Plus you gotta love a restaurant with kool-aid, it takes me back"
5,"Great food and service! I got the 
shrimp tacos with sweet potato waffle fries and my husband got the mac and cheese with bacon and jalapenos. Both were very good and the rum runner drink was very strong! Will definitely be back with family in tow..."
5,"Given that I'm from Kentucky, having a place in Madison that serves southern fare is a great new addition to our food scene. They have mint juleps of course--to good old fried chicken and collard greens. Then there's the huge list of KY bourbon and whisky, which is fantastic as well. I loved all of our dishes and the look of the bar especially. The small Kentucky signs and maps made me feel at home. Thank you! The outside dining area was very cool. Highly recommend the place. One bummer is they don't have Hot Brown on the menu..."
5,We go at least twice a week when we can afford to replace is awesome. Their manager Brian is the best. We started going there years ago when Brian was just a waiter now he's a manager way to go brian you're doing a great job. The food is always great.
5,"I went to Baro on multiple occasions and always had a good experience. The food is great, the vibe is great, and the service is wonderful."
5,"Had the best experience with Nick in the service department. Coming from a horrible experience at Berge to a wonderful experience at CardinaleWay was so refreshing! I got the help I needed, with the promise that the price would be upfront (I ended up not having to pay for anything), and didn't feel taken advantage of. Thanks Nick! You're officially my new service guy forever!"
5,"My new Go-To car repair business! I thought I was in need of new brakes because of the squealing my wheels do, but after asking TJ to check them out for me AND to give this new-to-me a once over for all the other items (oil, spark plugs, belts, etc) to make sure they are also in peak working order, the only item he could find which needed attention was one of my back lights was out. I asked him to replace it and assumed my total would be $150 (diagnostic fee) PLUS the $6.51 for the bulb. I asked to make sure they accept VISA (they do!) and waited for them to call when they were ready to pick me up. At the counter, with my VISA card ready, the grand total for all they had done, checked and replaced for me that day was $6.51. My brakes squeal because of brake dust and they do not need to be replaced at this time. I was NOT taken advantage of and I was not ripped off!! This shop and owner are completely and truly HONEST!! Really!! I will never take my car anywhere else and I will tell every single person I know who drives a car to bring their car here for work. Excellent first impression and I am THRILLED with this experience!! Thank you, TJ!! I am too grateful for words and I am so glad to be adding my five stars to your already five star rating!! I will be back!! awesome, Awesome, AWESOME!!!"
5,"I am amazed at the service I just had from Kinkades.  I work downtown and am within walking distance, so they are perfect for me.  Not only was the repair to my driver side mirror reasonably priced, but it was done quickly and efficiently.  I am very pleased with the recent service and actually look forward to having my window motor and instrument cluster repaired in the near future with Kinkades.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone I care about.  Thank you!"
5,"I'm 20 years old, my car is my lifeline, and I'm 2,000+ miles from home and TJ is the only person I trust with my car out here!"
5,"This is our pho place.  It's almost a second home, although we get their take-out almost exclusively.  We have an extensive garden that demands a lot of hard work, so on busy work days, we get their take-out to last our weekend.  I think you might get a better response from the very busy tireless owners if you caught their eye and spoke to them.  All I did was donate a couple of sunflowers once and I've got a Vietnamese auntie for life.  It's a small thing to touch someone's heart and they certainly have touched mine with nourishing, extremely healthy soup. I also turn to this amazing broth when I'm feeling like I might be coming down with something. Often that's all I need to turn something from a cold or flu into a one-day thing.

One bonus for us at least, the sturdy plastic take-out tubs make amazing small greenhouses for seeds started early. ;o)"
5,"Hands down the best Chinese food in Madison. The chicken chow mein has been a favorite since I was a child. Try the egg rolls and the jasmine or chrysanthemum tea. You really can never go wrong here! The decor is beautiful, and makes you almost feel like you could be in a restaurant in China."
5,"Imperial garden is imperial!  The food is very good and service is professional. 
I love the white table clothes and napkins. Makes me feel special and yet casual dressing is acceptable. 
I had a chicken egg roll that was very good although i really prefer the vegetable. I had sweet and sour shrimp. Best I've had in a long time!!  The portion was large and had many pieces of pineapple, onion, cherries, green pepper and tomato!!! Your lucky if you get one little piece of each at most places. 
My friend had combination chop suey. It looked delicious. Chuck full of meat and vegetables. Very large portion. 
They were busy but we were seated right away in a comfortable roomy booth. 
Their prices are reasonable."
5,Nice quiet atmosphere for lunch. The turkey club was excellent and the sweet potato fries are perfectly crispy and salted. My server Serena was very attentive and efficient. I'll definitely be back
5,"Love their Pad Thai! !  They consistently serve "" scrumptious"" food!  They have reasonable prices for the quality."
5,Our favorite local Asian style food!  We have huge battles over the leftover Chow Mai Gun/ Singapore noodles.  Not cheap but a good value at lunch.   No delivery :(
5,"our first time there and it was a wed. night and super busy but had wonderful service and very tasty meal, baked potaote was very hot and soft just the way I like it, steak tender and cooked perfect....keep up the good work!!"
5,I love this place so much!!! Excellent service every time and the sandwiches are amazing!!! Love the tuna... Which is amazing because I normally cannot stand Tuna. They have so many yummy choices can't wait to try them all!!!
5,"Is the place to be. I went there on a sunday expecting it to be calm and mellow instead the place was a full house,I end up waiting 15 mins to be seated assuming it was gonna take for ever jus to order and eat but i was wrong. Our Server was ""FANTASTIC"" never once i had to ask for a refill. My new york steak strip was right on the money and my salad was fresh. Love this place good atmosphere great service and good beer."
5,"I am just now writing this review in response to seeing all of the negative reviews (which seem to be much older).  My experience was great, and unlike any other car buying experience.  I have absolutely no regrets, and would recommend CardinaleWay Mazda, and Madison Spaid especially, to any one that knows what they want (and is willing to wait, if necessary) and wants a positive car buying experience.  They won me over!  

Here is the long version of my story:

This past July, I bought a new Toyota Corolla using a broker, a choice I regretted immediately and will never ever repeat.  Within a month, I was rear ended on the freeway (traffic was stopped, but the person behind me met my bumper at 50+ mph) and my beautiful black beauty was totaled.  I was still recovering from the last car buying experience (as well as having 2-3 doctor's appointments a week to recover from the accident), so I waited until September to try buying another car.  I was in a rather unique situation (credit report still showed I had a loan for the Corolla, but, of course, I didn't physically have the car), I had little to nothing for a downpayment (since I had just bought a new car less than 2 months prior), and the trade in I had available was upside down about $3,000.  I decided to create a form email to send to different dealerships to explain my situation, provide as much information as possible, and make it very clear I wasn't going to play the ""Come on down and we'll waste your time for 4 hours"" game.  After all, they send out form emails all day long.  I thought it would help me weed out the really bad ones - and it did!  

I discovered the Mazda5 (we call it a ""microvan"") and wanted to see if my 6'5"" husband, 4 kids, and dog (whom I'm convinced is part horse) would be able to fit in it comfortably.  I found pricing on TrueCar.com and was contacted by Madison Spaid at CardinaleWay Mazda.  I sent her my form email, and she actually read it (unlike 98% of the other dealerships)!  She thanked me for providing so much information and offered to answer any questions and help me through the process.  After getting nowhere with other dealerships that promised everything under the sun, I stopped by CardinaleWay Mazda on my way home from work to take a look at the Mazda5.  I explained I didn't have much time, and would not be purchasing any vehicle that night.  I was there a little over an hour, in which time my trade in was appraised (giving me $1,000 more than the other dealerships), I did a test drive, completed a financing application and had offers on the table.  I didn't have to retell my story, re-explain the situation, or re-provide any information.  Madison was extremely detail-oriented, personable, professional, and responsive.  I told her that I wouldn't be able to do any of the deals they had proposed at that time, but that I wasn't in a hurry either, and asked about some other financing options.  She said she would look into them, and I asked if she could just text me updates.  She happily agreed, and over the course of the next week, I received text message updates every 1-2 days when she had a question or a new deal.  After about a week and a half, they were able to assemble a package which worked for me (and was already pre-approved by their bank/financer/lender).  With each communication, Madison was always positive, never ever pressured me, and was extremely respectful of my goals and preferences.  Each text message started with something along the lines of, ""Great news!"" yet she accepted every time I said, ""No, that's not going to work,"" with grace and newfound determination.

When I went in to the dealership to seal the deal, the preliminary paperwork was awaiting my signature and my beautiful new Mazda5 was parked right in front of the dealership, ready to go.  The final financing paperwork had to be drafted separately (after knowing what my elections for GAP, extended warranty, etc. were), but I was there less than 2 hours altogether.  

After buying my new Mazda5, I received several follow-up inquiries, and I'm a little ashamed that it's taken me this long to write a review of the best car buying experience ever, but, hopefully that will lend credence to how great it truly was - that I still feel this way 3 months later.  I was very impressed by the combination of (good) attitude and resourcefulness that this dealership displayed.  To me, it did feel like I had a friend on the inside advocating for me - instead of someone just looking to close a sale.  Every dealership says they want to make customers for life, but this is the first one that successfully accomplished it with me."
5,"Was staying at the Red Rock last week and ate here twice, alongside recommending it to quite a few other people who enjoyed it as well.

The 5-star rating is for the cheesesteak I had with hot and sweet peppers, which was just about perfect. Pillowy bread, tender steak, and melty cheese served so fresh and hot I had to be careful not to burn myself with how much I wanted to keep taking more bites.

My wife had a Bobbie and I also tried the meatball sub, both of which were good but no where near how good that cheesesteak was."
5,"Came here on a Wednesday night, luckily it wasn't very busy because we were able to be seated right away. Very friendly service, and even better food. We good the mild spicy base and it was already super spicy. Food came quick and was plentiful. Some notable items: lamb, spicy fish, tofu skin, handmade noodles, etc.. They also give free ice cream at the end of the meal to cool you down. Would recommend you try this place out, it's worth a visit!"
5,Amazing dumplings . Thin chewy dough and juicy filling. All made to order that is fresh and hot!! You can get 14 dumplings for cheap as $4.99. I love the hot and sour soup too. not too spicy and not too sour.
5,"Great food and fabulous service. The food was hot and delicious. They were busy, but my server kept the drinks full and made sure that we were taken care of. We tipped 25% and wished that I could have given more!"
5,"I went to this place yesterday.  I had reserved 3 course Peking duck.  My family is 3 people.  The duck dishes were really good.  Not over spiced and greesy.  Apparently menu says it is for 2 people, but we boxed almost half of the third course duck dish.

The service was fantastic.  I think by far this is the best chinese restaurant overall."
5,Best steak ever! Service was awesome! Wish there was one in the west side burbs...solo good!
5,"Julep is very successful in capturing the spirit of Southern comfort food and hospitality.  The space is beautiful and looks out into a courtyard that makes you feel like you've left Madison behind and entered a much slower pace of life.  

I've gone three times so far and had the risotto and mac and cheese the first time and the black eyed pea salad and corn bread the other two times.  All delicious, but that black eyed pea salad was to die for! It may not be the obvious mouth-watering choice, but the flavors are so good together.  If you are looking for something meatier, my boyfriend is a sucker for the fried chicken--he raved about it! Definitely give this place a try.  

Like others have said, it shares a hallway with Barolo and A-OK, which are both great places to get a before or after drink!"
5,"This is a wonderful neighborhood bar. It's the perfect place to watch a Las Vegas Knights hockey game Or any other sporting event. When it is busy, it is sometimes difficult to get your waitresses attention, but it's all worth it because the food is absolutely outstanding. I think their nachos are some of the best in town. The bar is a little bit smoky so if you just want to enjoy a meal I suggest sitting up in the booths at the top of the restaurant. The staff is always very friendly and they have a good beer selection."
5,"The owner TJ was great. There was great communication throughout the day after I dropped off my car about what was going on with the car and what needed and didn't need to be done.

Great guys and convenient location for those who work downtown."
5,"Just had Cashew Chicken delivered for the 4th time--it's our absolute favorite!  To be fair to the rest of the menu it's the only thing we've tried, but it's delicious and the portions are huge.  We get 2-3 meals out of a serving.  Delivery every time has been 15 minutes--can you beat that?  There has been an issue with the cashews missing a couple of times, but we called and they ran them right over.  Now I just remind them.  Nice too that they throw in freebies if your order is over a certain amount.  Their spring rolls are wonderful too.  Thank you China Tango Bistro!"
5,Well I searching for a dumpling place and this place had some awesome vegetable dumpling. Truly enjoyed it !!
5,"This is by far my favorite new restaurant in Madison. The space is trendy without being pretentious. I love the decor. The staff were friendly and the service was quick. I went with the shrimp and grits which were flavorful and filling. Big prawns smothered in a pork gravy. Authentic southern cooking. I recommend the mint julep made with four roses. I didn't have a chance to sit at the bar, but next time for sure. Just wish they were open during lunch. Can't wait to come back."
5,1st time visit tonight.  Service was great food was great.  I would definitely recommend to friends.
5,"This is one of my favourite South Indian restaurants in Toronto. The food is always good and fast but not hurried competent service as well. 

Must try the dragon (or is it Devil) chicken to start. The have the mutton kotu roti as main. Channa batura is also soooo good."
5,"Seriously, these guys are the best. The last time I went to Kinkade's I had just moved to Phoenix and needed my A/C checked out and they just happened to be conveniently located near where I live so I gave it a shot. Because it ended up being a bigger issue than anticipated, they didn't charge me at all for the work they did and gave me a fair quote for a full A/C replacement. Of course, they were the first people I thought of to call today when my car wouldn't start because the ignition was jammed. I knew that they were closed for the night, but planned to just leave a voicemail letting them know that I'd be having my car towed to them first thing in the morning. To my surprise, they answered the phone even though it was after hours and then to my even bigger surprise, the man I talked to on the phone actually came out to SEE what was going on with my car and although wasn't able to fix it immediately because a part needs to be ordered for it, he gave me great advice in the meantime completely free of charge. These guys go ABOVE AND BEYOND and I'm so thankful for the time he took to come check out my vehicle when he could have been at home already after a long day at work.
Will continue to go to Kinkade's. I couldn't ask for anyone more knowledgable or helpful at what they do, and they really put me at ease about my car which is probably the most helpful thing in a situation where something is wrong with your car, because we all know it's a crappy feeling!!!"
5,"This shop is amazing. Working with Ben their catering manager they have assisted us in a couple of events at our organization. They are responsive, timely and so accommodating. They were asked to deliver food four 4 days with special orders and we were very specific about time for delivery. Not only did they get every delivery correct they were ontime. The food quality was awesome. Recently I forgot to order a few items for a delivery and in 10 mins they came back with the product we needed. I am super impressed with this shops thoroughness and customer service. This owner also has a shop on Boulder Hwy and they assisted us with delivery to our Henderson Location and were super! They are great representatives of this brand and we will work with them again. Thank you!."
5,"My truck is 16 years old, with a couple hundred thousand highway miles on it. Last time I drove cross country, I noticed my headlights were barely helping me see the road at night. I kept turning on the brights at every opportunity. I've had someone sand them before and that helped a little for a little while, but last week I finally decided I had to get new headlights. I called several places on Yelp to get a quote for installing the new lights. Based on catalog estimates, Kinkade's quoted me their rate for one hour ($40 less than another highly rated place), but said they were pretty sure they could do it in less than an hour. True to their word, it only took them 1/2 an hour so they only charged me 1/2 of the hourly rate. Plus, they were all very gracious. The waiting room is exceptionally clean too, as other reviewers have noted."
5,"Fantastic service from Kristy, Chris, Britney, and others.  They remember names, drinks, and other little, often overlooked things.  Breakfast is half off, drinks are half off from 5-7, and the pool tables are pretty good.  My favorite, go-to place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just drinks and video poker."
5,Awesome!  Grilled Italian is my #1 choice here but the capistromi (sp?) Is good as well.  Love the grease that drips off onto the wax paper.  I'm craving it again...
5,"Excellent service. Made my experience hassle free and I was in and out with my dream car in no time at all! They were all incredibly helpful and kind the entire time. 

Because it was my first time leasing a car, I had many questions and they were very patient and professional while taking the time to explain the details to me. I was very well educated about my options and couldn't be more happy with my decision to do business with them! I didn't once feel pressured which is very uncommon when looking for a car. I will surely recommend! Dave was my consultant and he was the best!!"
5,By far the best Texas Roadhouse I have ever eaten at! Excellent service by all staff we encountered from the hostess all the way to the manger Carly on duty. Our server Ashley was amazing! Definitely will recommend to family and friends traveling this way! If my travels bring me back this way I will definitely stop by again! Nothing but deliciousness from the meal that I ate!
5,"I came here for the first time with my friend's family tonight.  Although parking is limited, I strongly advise you to come when it's not common lunch / dinner time.  We ordered many items: Chives and Pork Steamed Dumplings ??????, Napa Cabbage Steamed Dumplings ??????, Dill and Pork Steamed Dumplings ??????Potstickers ????, Preserved Vegetable and Shredded Pork Noodles ????????, Gumjatang ??????? and Sugar Pancake ????.

Chives and Pork Steamed Dumplings ??????
The chives and pork fillings are firm and juicy, the peel is nice and thin with a little tug when you bite into it.  Be really careful as the juice will burn you tongue.

Napa Cabbage and Pork Steamed Dumplings ??????
The Napa Cabbage has a little crunch to it, this filling definitely has ginger in it.  I'm not a fan of ginger and is quite sensitive to the smell and taste of it.

Dill and Pork Steamed Dumplings ??????
I love the aroma of dill so anything with dill tastes good to me.  For people can't handle the smell of heavy herb or spices I wouldn't suggest this to them.

Potstickers ????
The filling is onion and Pork.  Again, very hot and juicy.  The crunchy wrap with the steamy hot filling counts my favourite out of all the dishes.  A must order!  But one order only has 5 potstickers.

Preserved Vegetables and Shredded Pork Noodles ???????? 
The noodles are cooked al dante.  They are thick noodles like the ones pulled by hand.  The soup base is really rich in flavour.  It is a high quality noodles dish.

Gumjatang ???????
I didn't get to try it myself.  It is the normal Pork bone with potato soup but there are soybean sprouts in it as well.  This dish includes a bowl of rice.  It is more than enough for one person.  A good choice for a single lunch.

Sugar Pancake ????
For those who has eaten the green onion pancakes, instead of the green onions it contains the granulated sugar filling.  It is crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  The filling is half melted so it's a syrupy, grainy texture.  Great for dessert to putting an end to a meal.

All the Steamed Dumplings are 14 in a steamer compared to the usual 8-10 in other similar restaurants.  The portion of the dishes is pretty generous.  In total it's a little over $50 tax included.  This is a combined Northern Chinese and Korean restaurant, so for people who liked both types of cuisine, you'll get the best of both.

Don't expect this place to be fancy and don't expect the service to be superb.  This is a casual restaurant / diner that only focuses on good quality artisan dishes.  Although it's quite a distance from where I live but I'm sure I'll come back for more if I happen to be in the area."
5,"I have purchased two Mazda vehicles from this dealership. 

I feel that many Mazda models are the best vehicle for the money on the market. I urge you to check out other car manufacturers - to compare. So, if a person likes a Mazda vehicle, the issue is ---- who to purchase a Mazda from?

In the past, I had horrible experiences purchasing vehicles from other Mazda dealerships. I found that they will often match other dealership offers; however, at the end they charge you for unnecessary add-ons and extraneous fees. Thus, you pay more. In the past, I didn't know I was ripped-off, because I was tired when I closed the deal. Now, I am prepared to walk out of a dealerships because of a inflated final price that was not exposed (this is common). CardinaleWay does NOT do this; the price they quote is what you pay and their quotes have always beaten other Mazda dealerships. They want your return business and referral. 

So, I travel over 30 miles across Phoenix to visit CardinaleWay in Mesa when I want to purchase a Mazda. I worked with Wayne DeLeo (highly recommend him) at this dealership. My Mazda CX-5-touring is a great vehicle and my experience at CardinaleWay Mazda was superb!"
5,"From 5pm to 7pm weekdays you get to enjoy $1 raw oysters and $5 wine upstairs from Baro's called Pablo's Snack House.  The oysters are fresh.  Definitely will go back for more oysters.
What i really enjoyed about my time at Pablo's is that the ambience is very relaxing.  There are a combination of tables and chairs, as well as sofas where you can just hang out with your friends.  On top of that,  the associates working there are so nice and personable.  
Can't wait to go back there again."
5,Been here twice. Today was my second time and I took my colleague along with me. She is not indian so this was her first experience. We ordered dosas and she loved it. I've had dosas at quite a few places but I've got to say the service and the taste of the dosas here is amazing. I also highly recommend their masala chai. It has such great flavour of cardamom and ginger. Will definitely return again.
5,"Had dinner here for the first time. I got the country friend steak and my girlfriend got the country fried chicken. Both were the size of the plate. Tons of gravy and a scoop of mashed potatoes for both. Which was awesome. This is a noisy restaurant. It would be perfect for kids, parents and the like. The food was good and the service(provided by Jason) was top notch. Thanks for a great first experience. We'll be back. Wicked cinnamon butter btw."
5,"I had one bad experience at Mayworth, but it appears that it was just a bad night.  I have been back three times since the last review and the food and service was perfect."
5,"Great price for great food! We're from Ncal and looked for a place similar to China Paradise back home and found it. This is as close as we're gonna get and let's face it Vegas does not have good Chinese food. Give it a try. The owner is a really a nice guy if you can just have some patience and also be friendly, you'll see it :). He's a Fremont native, and his food is fresh and good flavpr, give it a try! Typically we eat shrimp tempura at a Japanese restaurant but try it here, it's just as good! Tempura batter on point! I just tried this place and went back again!"
5,"I actually was looking to purchase a Jeep in a specific model and color. Much to my surprise I found it online at Cardinale Mazda. I drove over 800 miles one way from Northern Nevada near Reno to purchase this Jeep. I told the salesman if I drive 14 hours one way and this Jeep is not in the condition he has described I would be beyond mad. He assured me it was in new condition. Much to my surprise when I got there the just was exactly as described. The entire staff was very friendly and very helpful. Being a retired business owner related to the auto industry I understand that some people may think they are a bit aggressive but my personally feeling is they where very eager to please and to do what ever it takes to make a deal. The entire staff from the salesman, sales manager to the finance manager where very professional. The competition is so great in the Phoenix area it's a buyers market. So I think in order to keep your doors open you have to offer outstanding customer service, a quality selection of inventory and of course good pricing. I think Cardinale Mazda did just that."
5,"I didn't think an honest repair shop was around any more in the Phoenix metro area.  I passed this shop daily on my way to and from work.  Once I found a coolant leak, I scheduled a free estimate with TJ.  The morning of the estimate, my car was not turning over for about 10 minutes.  Once I got it started, I dropped it off and described the new issue.  TJ took the time to describe what the probable issue was, further stating it was quite common.  I asked him if common meant cheap.  He responded, ""Oh no, its not cheap"".  Even though the thought of pouring money into a car is like nails on a chalkboard, I appreciated his honesty.  I returned to work and searched the repair and the average was around $1000.  After looking at the car, TJ called back and stated the price for the coolant leak which was reasonable.  He further stated that they could not replicate the other issue and he, ""Did not feel comfortable replacing a part for the sake of replacing it.""  I couldn't believe the integrity of this auto shop and felt like I just found $1000 in an old pair of jeans.  I have used Kinkade's again this past week on my wife's car after finding oil leaks during an oil change.  These guys came in at about half the price, to do more work, than the quoted amount of the oil change business.  These guys are great and warranty all of their work for a year.  Thank you Kinkade's.  I hope you continue with this fantastic business model as I will continue to service my cars with you as long as you do."
5,"I love this place. I have had just about everything on the menu from the fish, to prime rib, to roadkill. Always delicious. The rolls and green beans are amazing and u can usually get a free appetizer. Prices good too"
5,"Being newly arrived in Phoenix, I feared getting ripped off at an unscrupulous auto shop when I realized I desperately needed new tires. The reviews on Yelp on Kinkade's Auto Repair were good and it was located nearby so I took a chance.  I don't regret it. In fact, I'll be going back for most of my car repair needs.

Their prices were exceptionally fair. The owner showed me what he was paying for each tire and his mark-up.  I checked the internet and confirmed his purchase price was within the norm and his price to me (with the mark-up) was cheaper than any other I could find.  The attendant offered to drive me to a nearby coffee shop (or home) while they installed the tires and called me ahead of schedule.  

The owner explained to me his philosophy on business and why he got into the car repair business.  Overall, it was a friendly, professional and positive experience. I left trusting that Kinkade's is one of those rare, transparent, and professional auto places.  I'd highly recommend them to anyone."
5,"We've been to Julep twice now and both visits were great.  I love what they've done with the space most of all, which is a wonderful and artistic reuse of many reclaimed pieces such as lathe, which beautifully covers an entire wall, a fantastic antique bedframe hung on another wall, and incredible vintage light fixtures throughout.  I can't wait to eat there this summer so we can sit in what looks like a terrific outdoor courtyard.  

Now on to the food. The first time we went I had to order their signature drink, a mint julep. It was my first one and I don't know if all juleps are as potent as this one, but it really packed a punch.  They also have a nice wide range of other cocktails, cordials, and specialty drinks.  ""Snacks"" and ""Little Plates"" are priced so you can try several and that we did.  On our first visit we ordered the Cast Iron Cornbread (I've never eaten corn bread so moist and flavorful) and Pimento Cheese (charred onion, pecans, crackers). The latter was good but not a standout. From the little plate category, we had the Blue Crab Jasmine Rice Cake, the Field Pea Salad, and the Mississippi Delta Tamales which were intriguing for their chocolate mole sauce. None of these was particularly special either.  For our entrees, I had the Brisket Pot Roast with root vegetables and potato purée on both visits and I don't know if I'll ever order anything else.  The roast is fall-apart tender and very rich combined with the root veggies and potatoes, all covered in a dark gravy.  My husband ordered the Charleston Shrimp & Grits and he liked it well enough.  

The service is good and we got a table pretty quickly in spite of how busy the restaurant was. It's wonderful to have another great restaurant in this area of the city."
5,"Great dealership! We just bought a new CX-5 and had a great experience. This is actually the third new CX-5 we have bought from CardinaleWay. Our sales experience was great, both Mike and Dustin were fun to work with. Their service department has always been one of the best as well. In the past we have worked with Steve and Nick. 

I highly recommend CardinaleWay Mazda to anyone looking for a new car. Plus, I definitely recommend the 2018 CX-5 - it's a nice vehicle, that rides quite and smooth and is fun to drive. I'm really happy with my purchase.

Only two minor negatives on the CX-5:

Window Tint. The front driver and passenger windows have barely any tint, which does not block out the sun enough (glare and heat). Also the front windshield does not have any on the very top. I immediately noticed how much sunlight was glaring in. Not too happy about that in the summer because that means using more AC to stay cooler feeling. The only reason I bring this up, is there's a built-in charge to the vehicle showing the dealership tinted the windows, and it wasn't inexpensive, so it should be much better. 

No Apple CarPlay (I'm hoping for a display update in the future)"
5,"delicious, grubby, chinese food in generous portions and always great service.

their szchewaun chicken is THE BOMB. so spicy it makes me sweat."
5,"All aspects of the experience exuded high quality and care.  The food, service and atmosphere were unique, thoughtful and added to the great dinner I had.  Great addition to Madison!"
5,Hands down my favorite Indian/Sri Lankan restaurant in Scar. Been there like 5-6 times already and enjoy the garlic and butter naans with butter chicken and chicken biryani is delish. Bit pricy but worth the price. Rasmali is great dessert.
5,"HOLY COW! If you haven't been to Julep, get there fast! My husband and I decided to go there for a drink before heading to dinner elsewhere...well, we never left! The service is great, the bartenders are funny, and everyone is knowledgable and attentive. The restaurant has a nice ""spin"" on Kentucky fare, and as someone from Kentucky, I give it an A+! I would highly recommend the Mendoza, Mac and Cheese Gratin, and Sweet Potato Pie. The bartender even made pecancello that was our aperitif. Give this new restaurant a shot! It will amaze you!"
5,"We were visiting the Daniel Stowe Gardens and decided to go local food for lunch, checked yelp and decided to give this place a visit.. They had a lunch special of the day so we chose it.  Ordered the Buffalo chicken tacos and sweet potato waffle chips.  Both were very good and with a very reasonable price! The staff was excellent. Highly recommended to give it a try if you are in the area.. ."
5,Love this local spot! Food is fantastic. Get the sloppy Joe fries - you will not be disappointed!
5,"I've been to Julep 12-15 times and it's always exceptional!  The corn bread is delicious, the oysters are excellent, and the Mac N cheese is so good my of of town customer keeps asking me to steal the recipe."
5,"Stopped here for some appetizers on the way home to Granite Falls.  We had the lettuce wraps and pimento cheese dip. Both were excellent!  The lettuce wraps could easily be an entree for one person or share with 4 people. The cheese dip is made fresh on-site and had a nice little bite with mild spices.  Our sever, Jay, was very knowledgeable of the entire menu and very attentive. They do have draft beer and a wide selection of bottles/cans.  Certainly would like to go back again to try dinner.  Well worth the visit!"
5,"Have been twice with friends for cocktails and appetizers.  First time, we sat outside in the gorgeous, relaxing courtyard.  The atmosphere was calm and refined.  It was a sublime departure from most any other outdoor seating option in Madison (no bustling sidewalk traffic/loud cars driving by) and the cocktail I tried was quite good though I can't remember exactly what it was!  Our service was swift, and the prices were really reasonable.

The second time, we were seated at a table in the restaurant.  Same type of atmosphere- they did a great job with designing a space that's cozy yet airy. We ordered the pimiento cheese and chicken liver mousse.  Both were A+ !!   I am still salivating over the chicken liver mousse with onion marmalade.  Unbelievable combo- and a great deal for $6 or $7- plenty to share among 4 people.  I had a rye on the rocks but tried several sips from around the table- loved the Watercolor Water Buffalo and the julep.  

The owner, Sarah, stopped by our table and was gracious and lovely.  She told us a little bit about their soon-to-come dinner menu.  Sounds amazing- can't wait to spend many nights dining and drinking there."
5,"This place has become one of my favorites. Thursday and Sunday beer specials and outstanding food. The staff is quite regular, as in they appear to be staying with the business. Has turned out to be much better than my first assessment. So far, I have nothing but kudos for this restaurant."
5,The service here was great. We had Matt as our server and they transitioned smooth into a new server with Jeremy. Both were on their game and Tiffany was a fantastic bartender who served us before we sat ourselves out on their back patio.  We came on a Saturday night and they had karaoke.  It was a fun night with great service!
5,Very good ^^ loved their bread and steaks. Recommend their Bone-in Ribeye median cooked :). Service is good too!
5,"So, I'll start this off by saying that no one ever likes to get their car repaired...especially in Arizona...and certainly when that repair is associated with the AC. Knowing full well the potential cost of the repairs, I approached my search for a repair shop with caution. 

TJ and the guys at Kinkade's were super awesome. TJ shot me a quote within the hour with two possible costs depending on how bad the ac was. Come to find out, it was the dreaded compressor that had gone out. TJ gave me options, letting me know what he recommended, but not pushing needless repairs on an already expensive situation. He was straight up and forward, and I am glad he was. My wife and two boys are now riding in a nice refrigerated chariot, facing these nasty summer temps. 

I will certainly be going back if I need anything else repaired. They made a painful situation very bearable."
5,How can you go wrong with Capriottis? My main problem is what to order -- the pastrami? The cheesesteak with hot peppers and onions? They now have 20 inch sandwiches at this location. I guess you should bring a friend and so you can split 2 different kinds sandwiches
5,"this place is my go to place (and pho linh). 

The food comes out within 10 minute of ordering and it's probably as authentic as it can get. Being raised by a vietnamese mother, i've had good, authentic food my entire life, but when she doesn't feel like cooking something that I'm craving or when I want comfort food this place is where I go. 

Service is as expected for an asian place, not very personal, the servers are just focused on bringing you your food and then you eat and you're out. When I want a milkshake or the durian or avocado shakes this is the place I go to as well."
5,"I moved to Arizona a year before TJ opened up, I looked desperately for a decent mechanic. Scene from a family of mechanics I had high expectations. TJ exceeded every single one. Him and his team take exceptional care of me and my vehicles explaining everything in detail and set themselves for a standard of care the most mechanics do not. Extremely happy to be a concave loyal my vehicles will always go there and I will never worry"
5,I'm the type of person that doesn't eat out a lot and we find this place pretty good compare to congee queen just down the street. This place has a lot less MSG than any HK cafe or congee place. Service was decent but what matters the most is the food taste. I would recommend this place over other congee places
5,"Love this place! I really do believe that this restaurant deserves more than its current rating. Service is average but this restaurant has solid food at fair and affordable prices, with generous portions. I always come for the pork bone soup, kimchi fried rice, dumplings, and red bean paste cake. 

Their pork bone soup is possibly the best I've tried despite the fact that it's not entirely a Korean restaurant, they do however offer many Korean dishes in addition to the Chinese menu. But since they specialize in Northern Chinese cuisine, it's not a surprise that there's an overlap in the tastes and similarities between Northern China and Korean cuisine. The pork bones are always tender and the taste is always on point. Portions were more than enough, that I always end up taking home the rest. I pay my visits to Korean restaurants quite often but when it comes to pork bone soup, I will always end up at this place! Kimchi fried rice is delicious as well!"
5,We were looking for a nice restaurant and were tired of the same thing. Found it on yelp and were very impressed. The burger meat was so good you didn't need mustard or ketchup. The Cajun Catfish was very good. Waffle fries were good with a crispy cheese sprinkle. Also have a nice selection of beer. D9 on tap. Would go there again and recommend it to others. Good to see a nice end restaurant/bar in the gastonia area.
5,Try the buffalo chicken tacos. They're great! I can also forgive them for having so many IPAs because they have plenty of other great beers!
5,This place is AWESOME! I had a mechanical issue with my Chevy Cobalt. They were able to fix the problem within 24 hours and they charged me very fairly. You can definitely trust these guys to get the job done right the first time and charge you a good price!! Thank you guys!!
5,"I invited my nearest and dearest friends to join me for a birthday dinner at Julep this past  Saturday.  If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.  We ordered nearly everything on the menu and rave reviews were the result, all around the table.  Standouts: the Perlou- crispy rice and seafood so tasty that my boyfriend cleaned his plate even after he'd filled up on apps (I should mention that even for a large group, we were able to share most of the apps, which was great because we couldn't get enough of all the different flavors- oops, except the biscuits, pretty much everyone wanted to get their own- love at first bite)- the collard greens that came with the subtly spicy fried chicken- full of shaved fresh garlic and sweet/spicy with a silky vinegary finish, not your average bland collard greens- and the shrimp and grits, which were the best I've tasted in this city.  But I cannot stop thinking about the sweet potato pie- it's what sent me back here to write a new review- somehow managing to be light and fluffy yet sumptuously rich all at once.... mmmmm.... went perfectly with their bourbon milk punch!

Service at Julep is truly standout and must be mentioned.  Our server handled our table of 10+ graciously and efficiently, and there was no waiting for water, table clearing, fresh drinks, new utensils, etc. which is a feat for a huge table on a Saturday night.  The owner, Sarah, stopped by our table to chat at the end of the meal which was a lovely touch. After our meal was over,and we were all in a pleasant food coma, we realized nobody took any pictures of the exquisitely presented oysters or adorable vintage salt and pepper shakers or the bourbon chocolate cake in a julep cup running over with mint semifreddo- we were all enjoying our food too much- truly the highest praise in this day and age. All in all, Julep is my new favorite."
5,"It's so easy for mechanics to scam people. I have not had a bad experience yet! Trustworthy, and do a good job."
5,Who thought buying a car would be so painless and easy. Zach and the sales manager were extremely friendly and professional. Would recommend to anyone looking for a high quality car for a low price!
5,"Julep was fantastic tonight!  I had the chili and corn bread
The chili kicked my socks off, it was so good! The corn bread was made to perfection!  The serve was excellent"
5,"A mechanic who is honest, treats his customers superb, and provides excellent workmanship! TJ and his team of professionals have serviced both of our cars, and have provided an excellent service every time, including times when one car was towed there for unscheduled maintenance. TJ goes far beyond the standard definition of customer service, including providing transportation from their location back to the Deer Valley area when the car was in for extended work. I can't say enough about them. The most recent fix was a reconditioning of my headlights, which were so hazy that another body shop didn't even want to work on them. The other alternative would have been new headlight assemblies, and at 1800 installed, the service that TJ and Randy performed was worth twice that, and the cost significantly less."
5,"I was looking forward to trying this, and it did not disappoint.  This review is only for the Capastrami, which was heavenly and ideal.  Meat was not too salty, portions are huge, and the mix of slaw, meat, dressing and bread were perfect.  This is in the food court so it's easily accessible if you're inside the Red Rock casino.  Service was quick and friendly."
5,I absolutely love CardinaleWay Mazda in mesa! They were all super helpful & super nice. They focused on helping me not their commission. They found everything perfect for where I am in my credit currently. Which is none for the moment. It took me 3 tries to find a car & I was fortunate enough to find one through them. The man who helped me Austin Owens is by far the best employee there! I highly recommend this place & if you do go ask for him! He doesn't sugar code anything & is the best! I can't even begin to explain how amazing he is! I am for sure going back here when I am in need a new car!
5,"My Service Engine Light came on, and new to the area. I resorted to Yelp to look for a dependable mechanic.

Their business was busy for today, being Thursday. But TJ (the owner) was happy to a diagnostic when I walked into the shop. I like the idea of small-business mechanics, that work their own front desk. I've been to plenty of other shops, that have a receptionist at front, while the mechanic is in the back working on your car.

Turns out it was a sensor underneath the engine block. TJ explained that the part itself wasn't costly, it's the labor. So seeing that it wasn't a simple repair, he was nice enough to clear out the service light for me, and that if it goes on again, and the same diagnostic test comes out, then it's time to do the repair.

I like the idea that the mechanic is able to work with you. Usually, mechanics will pressure you to do the work therein, bcuz it brings in business for them.

But for the meantime, I'll be saving for that repair money for that rainy day. And for any future car repairs, it's nice to have peace of mind knowing that I'm not getting ripped off at the car shop."
5,"Every time I visit Baro I always have the best service, food always taste yummy! The consistency of this place makes me always come back since it's such a great spot to catch up with friends.  They have a good selection of cocktails too. 

Some of the food I recommend trying out when you visit:
Seared Scallops $23
There's about 3-4 scallops and they cook perfectly! This dish is a must try. 

Empanadas $7
Comes in 4, one of the best I had try in the city. The sauce that pairs with is soo good I always ask for extra. 

Yuca fries $7
Cook perfectly and has a nice soft crunch 

OG duck Chaufa $35
This is a dish I always get when I'm here. It's a very filing dish."
5,"I'm 20 years old started building by getting a car from Drive Time, a year ago I got the Mazda 3 2011, now I want into Cardinale Way not knowing what I was doing all on my own, but thank god for Jason and CJ for making everything work out for me, dropped my interest rate when Drive Time had fucked me over. Walking out of Cardinale Way today with a brand new 2017 Mazda 3. They worked so hard to get it in my budget and went the extra mile, it took an extra day but it was worth it. I am sooooo happy I came here. They just want to meet the needs."
5,"Excellent lunch spot!  

Went for the first time today and had a great experience. Waitress was very helpful with her suggestions. 
We started with the Sliders Appetizer, which we delicious and plenty for a full meal.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Tacos, which were delicious. Tons of flavor and very fresh. 
Sweet Potato Fries were also amazing!  

Overall, we had a great experience with great service, great food and a few great drinks!"
5,"Everything I've had here is delicious! Last time I was in I had the southern burger, it was great!  Chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonable prices."
5,"This place is really good. We went with a group of people- around 20 people. I find that usually with large groups, the quality of the food goes down. Maybe because preparation is a lot faster than with smaller groups?  Anyways, at Baro the food was still so good so I can't imagine how much better it would be with a smaller group"
5,"Can't think of a better steakhouse and value for your money. Steaks have a great flavor, you can taste the freshness. Love the free peanuts! Great atmosphere. Quick and friendly service"
5,Went back to Kinkades for some much needed brake pad/rotor replacements and was met with unmatched customer service by TJ and his crew once again. The wheel key was damaged during the repair process and the crew was kind enough to replace the wheel set - free of charge! This is the kind of service that makes this place a step above other auto repair shops. I cannot be happier with the replacements that were made to my vehicle - every penny is worth it when you are customer at Kinkades. Highly highly recommend!
5,I think it's the best hot pot in this area. Love the hot soup base and lamb/ beef rolls here! Watermelon juice was yummy
5,"Célebre mi cumpleaños este pasado sábado.
Wow me encanto el restaurante y la atencion al cliente
El pastel de tres leches no lo recomiendo mucho. 
Pero los churros están increíbles.
De preferencia los patos principales están mucho mejor 
Que las tapas. 
Aunque muy recomendable los ceviches"
5,"Imperial Garden is a Madison treasure. It is one of my favorite places to go celebrate or maybe have a date night with my honey. My favorite dish is the crispy duck, We also often order their appetizers which are both yummy and more than we can ever finish. I have never had bad service and we have been there many many times. It is beautiful inside and a very relaxing place to share a meal. I always have enough for another meal the next day!"
5,"My husband and I have been taking our three vehicles to Kincaid's almost since they first opened a few years ago because of the excellent work, fair and reasonable prices and the outstanding customer service provided by TJ and his crew!  I've recommended them many times to friends and family that are looking for a great mechanic that are also hard working, decent, honest human beings. They've earned their excellent reputation."
5,Real authentic pho!! I love it so much so affordable and fast no having to wait long for you food its worth every penny
5,"TJ and the entire crew have been fast, friendly, and honest every single time I have visited. As a single 22 year old female with no automotive repair experience whatsoever, he could have easily tried to be deceptive. What would have been something wrong with the throttle body (at LEAST $1000) at the dealership ended up only being a new battery for my car! They also spent a good hour and a half ""diagnosing"" the car until they found out what was really wrong. He took his time drawing pictures and explaining to me what was wrong with my car. They have wifi and a nice, clean waiting room. I have recently moved to North Phoenix, but I refuse to go anywhere else besides Kinkade's, it is forever my go-to auto shop!"
5,"We visit family in Madison at least twice a year and always make sure to have dinner here.  The shrimp sizzling rice soup is absolutely to die for, and every entree I've had has been fabulous.  Hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had."
5,Come here at least 2x a month. Get the same thing. NY strip steak with sweet potato and veggies! Always comes hot and cook to perfect order. It's always chaos in there but the servers never mess up and never long wait on food. Appreciate the call ahead seating! Always a joy to go in n sit down with in 15 mins MAX! Thanks for awesome food and service!
5,"Love this place! My family has been coming here for yeeeeeaaars. I usually try to go for the lunch specials. The service is always quick and friendly, and the food is delicious. My favorites are the general chu chicken, house fried rice, and they have these chocolate cream cheese wontons for dessert that are delicious."
5,"This place deserves the rating it has on Yelp! I just went there for an oil change and I wasn't pressured or sold on other things, which is nice! I appreciate a place like this. They were easy to work with, I just had to drop my car off in the morning and I picked it up after work. If you are ever scared of getting ripped off by an auto shop, try this place!!!"
5,"Came in to check on my AC to see why it wasn't blowing very cold. They did it for free and topped it off. Also, fixed my tail light. All for free! :]"
5,"Great service and food. Went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Judging by the number of kids it's family friendly but I wouldn't take small kids. Sliders were perfect, fish taco and shrimp tacos were so good. Extensive beer and wine selection. Definitely a diamond in the ruff."
5,"A good, honest, Auto Repair guaranteed. After reading several Yelp reports I chose to give these guys a try and I have been very satisfied ever since. I had a wiggy fan clutch that had been needing some attention so I switched cars on them at the last minute for my daughter's Froday morning appointment. 

Several days after the repair on my fan, the engine started to overheat so I filled it up with coolant the next morning and dropped it off to have them check it out. 

A few hours later T.J. called me and explained that when I had the car in to get my fan clutch replaced they had accidentally tightened a screw into my radiator causing the leak.  He told me they had a new radiator ordered and I could pick it up later in the day no charge.

You can't buy this kind of honesty anywhere in this town, let alone, from an auto repair shop. They have us as customers for life. They should be nominated for business of the year."
5,"Unique location with excellent offerings. Located right in downtown Cramerton's town square. One of the South's historic mill villages, we had a great time waking around the neighborhood and Goat Island park before dinner. Great beer lineup and food offerings, we particularly enjoyed the build your own salad option and the beef on weck."
5,Very  busy  spot  reservation  is  recommended  the  briyani  is really good  try  the    chicken 65 and cauliflower  65 as well  great  place  for  vegetarians.  Full of  flavour  and  spice
5,"Great restaurant. First - enter from East Washington. The place is at the end of the hallway. 

Interesting fact, I believe that Julep, A-OK, and the wine bar actually all share the same kitchen, which is an independent LLC. Cool idea. 

Now, the food. Julep is a high-artistry take on southern cuisine, a d they kill it. I had the cast-iron cornbread appetizer, a drink their strip and grits Entree. Both were amazing. 

I saw them making the cornbread as I walked past the kitchen, and the do use little cast iron skillets. The cornbread was light a it's crust was slightly caramelized and I think the butter they serve is made in house, and is excellent. Enough for two to split. 

The shrimp and grits were out of this world. Three large strip, spicy but not oppressive. Julienned peppers and onions sautéed in the cream sauce, a d the best Godin grits I've had outside of the South. Filling, surprising, and delicious.

Dessert was a bourbon cake served with mint Icecream. What more could you want? 

Cocktails are also dynamite here. ""In Your Head"" is light and fruity with a refreshing zing, and a gin punch to your mind. The ""Pecan Milk Punch"" was creamy and had warm flavors with nutmeg and their homemade Pecan-cello. 

Pricepoint is a little higher here - splitting the bill down the middle with a friend, pre tip was $46.00. This covers half the appetizer, my entree, two cocktails and half of the bourbon cake. 

Atmosphere is comfortable - don't come in your sweats if you don't want to feel out of place, but I don't think they'd turn you away. Xi think this place is in a reclaimed car shop, a d they kept a lot of the architecture in place - large carport door, exposed ceilings, lots of brick -  but classed it all up. I ate right next to the carport door and had zero issues with it. Also, they seem to have a large outdoor space they used for NYE, and will likely be an excellent beer garden in the warmer months."
5,"How adorable! The atmosphere is intimate and cozy. Julep is situated in a little burrow with Barolo Wine Bar and A OK Cafe. All three establishments look clean, inviting, and interesting. :) 

Went to Julep with a very large group (we called to make a reservation) and received excellent service. The servers were friendly and attentive without being overbearing. 

The the cocktails were good, stiff drinks. I ordered the house Julep and was impressed by the strong but smooth bourbon flavor. 

The snacks: The biscuit with butter and jam was a game-changer. Very delicious, I will be returning if not just for these little nuggets of heaven. The pimento goat cheese with crackers and corn bread were also a crowd favorites. 

The small plates: The Mac n' cheese was great, as was the blue crab jasmine rice cake. 

Large plates: The perlou and the Farro Risotto were absolutely delicious.

The food was delicious and satisfying but the portions were not overly large. Most people cleaned their plates completely and did not take home leftovers (we ordered lots of starters and also dinner for each of us). 

Julep is a new favorite of mine! I will definitely be returning for dinner and/or cocktails."
5,"An update of an update of an update ..

Went there again today ...

Spouse had the pho bun bo - spicy beef soup from Hue ... mmmmm.  I had my usual vermicelli with grilled pork.  Tasty.  Fresh ... and we had two of the fresh salad rolls.  Rice paper sheets were warm, i.e. FRESH.  I love, love this place.  And the cafe sua da --- the BEST.  Good Vietnamese coffee, strong - but smooth - and sweet.  What's not to love."
5,Tried their Cheese Steak last week and was very pleased!! Chose the spicy peppers instead of the sweet and they did give the sandwich some definite pep. Will be back
5,"For such a small town, this place is almost always busy!  

Everything I have tried here is consistently good. Typically when I'm in the mood for wings this is my go-to spot! 

The owner is super friendly and is there most days!"
5,"I've used this shop several times, They know what they are doing, they don't quote you outrageous prices, He is honest and tells you about recalls on your vehicle  and saves you money.Thank you, Chevy replaced the steering column for free, He goes out of his way to drop you off and pick you up when the car is done. I don't even live close to the shop. Courtesy Chevrolet tried to do quote me anywhere from $600 to $2500 for a vapor leak, Tj told me the car is done and it's going to be $20 for a factory gas cap,  (NOW THATS HONESTY!!!) Thank You Kinkades Auto Shop"
5,"I dream about the Capastrami's; they are one of the best sandwiches ever invented.

My kids like to go to the Red Rock food court before a game of bowling and they get Fat Burger; I enjoy a tasty Capastrami."
5,"Recently had my radiator replaced with Kincaids; fair price, great work and very professional/friendly. Will definitely use again. Truly appreciative"
5,"I gotta say i couldnt be happier with the service i got at Kinkades. TJ and his team really took care of my truck and ensured quality customer service. I came in due to my truck makeing a ""clunking"" sound when i accelerated or braked. At first i thought i was in need of a rebuild for my engine or a new carberator due to info online from others with a similar experience/problem. 
I researched auto shops, tired of the usual Midas or Fletchers, and Kinkades showed highly recommended. Dropped my truck off and the team looked at it. 
Turned out my truck needed a new U-joint on the driveshaft. The clunking noise came from worn out bearings. The driveshaft had had some bad work done to the threads which exasperated the U-joint problem.
TJ and his crew took care of the everything and even checked my brakes and cleaned them up a bit free of charge. I walked away spending alot less that i orginally thought i would and my trucks going strong without a clunk."
5,"LOVED! My friends & I ordered a bunch of things on the menu to try & here is what we loved: duck confit rice ($35 - supposedly one of their most popular dishes), CGS which is chips & guac ($15), chori papa ($16 - ask for more tortillas) and Lomo saltado ($36 - beef tenderloin). There are three levels, we sat on the 1st floor for dining."
5,"I've gone the majority of my life in search of an honest mechanic. One day a friend of mine told me about Kinkade's and I've been going there ever since!! I have brought 3+ cars to them and they have always gone above and beyond!! This place is amazing. Honest, friendly, accommodating and reasonably priced. TJ is my guy for life!! I have referred several people to Kinkade's and all have been equally impressed. You cannot go wrong with these guys!! Thanks TJ"
5,Wanted Chinese food and saw this on near me. They had me at Hello. Very clean very nice amazing food great price 6 stars!
5,"Honest, trustworthy, professional, great pricing and all around nice guys. They are busy for a reason - book an appt if you can. They take time to be thorough, and they work their asses off. Everybody there is friendly and will make sure you really understand what's up with your vehicle and what all your options are. Waiting area is clean and has coffee and a soda machine. I don't think I can say enough nice things about them. I know they will have my back as I take on every piece of highway debris and pothole that falls into my field of vision like it's my job.

Parking is tight so don't get all Mr. Magoo with it, snowbirds."
5,Amazing food. The sambar lentil soup was good and not too spicy. Egg dosa was sort of pricy but a huge size. I tried the mutton sukka masala (sp?) was so good and not too spicy.
5,They are honest and have great customer service just like all of the other reviews say.
5,"This mechanic is the best in and around Phoenix. Honest, smart and polite. I started taking my car there after another mechanic didn't work out last year. I still take my car there. Recently, he serviced my a/c. One mechanics wanted more than 1000 dollars for a new compressor and parts. Yeah, not true. TJ seviced the a/c and that was all it needed. The best place. Even if you're passing through Phoenix, this is the place to actually reach a REAL MECHANIC."
5,"Best hot pot in Markham for it's quality. This is definitely my go-to place for hot pot. They have a vast selection of sauces, soup base, and food options to choose from. It's lively and clean environment, with good ventilation which doesn't leave you smelling after the meal. Although a little more expensive than other hot pot places, it makes up for it in it's food and ambience."
5,"As a first time goer,  I was very pleased with the professionalism and knowledge. I would definitely recommend Kinkades to others looking for auto repair!"
5,Their turkey and stuffing sandwich is absolutely yummy... It is like the day after Thanksgiving any day you want:)  Also their Roast Beef with coleslaw is a great choice.  Pastrami is really good.  My husband love the steak and cheese with mushrooms.
5,"One of the only South Indian  restaurants that is consistently good. Best  things here would be mutton sukka, lollipop  chicken, any biriyani or fried rice  , chilli chicken, shrimp masala, pepper chicken,  shrimp 65 poori amd garlic  naan"
5,"It seems like either Dumpling Restaurant changed ownership or they really started caring about their looks. The table tops are now draped with table cloths and with a hard plastic sheet that's shaped an inch or two too small all around. Even the menu received an upgrade from laminated sheets to an actual folder. 

Despite the questionable aesthetic changes, the overall flavour and pricing remains the same. For a basket of dumplings for $6-7 on average, you can't beat a classic in both flavour and value. Coming out piping hot out of the kitchen, the dumplings were scalding hot - just how I like them! 

If you are in the Scarborough (Agincourt) area on a budget, this restaurant might be your calling."
5,"Took out of town family and friends to Julep to celebrate my son's graduation. Everything --- the space, the service, the food --- perfect!
The space should be featured on Houzz. Upscale, stylish, and welcoming. Eric served our group seamlessly. The brunch choices were varied and delicious. Thank you, Julep."
5,Hotpot is one of my favorites!!!! This place has one of the BEST quality of food and offers a variety of side orders. I love spicy stuff and this place offers a variety of spicy base options. I love their drink menu from the fresh watermelon juice to wintermelon jars. Absolutely great! Will definitely come back as a regular! Best eaten in the Winter!
5,My husband and I found this little gem in downtown Cramerton for my birthday dinner. I wanted something local and off the beaten path and Mayworth's Public House was perfect. The food was delicious along with service being outstanding. Our server Jeremy gave us recommendations and made us feel so welcomed. And even when my steak came out slightly undercooked the manager came over to offer a discount! I didn't even ask for one. This place takes customer service to a whole other level. Will definitely be back with family and friends. Don't miss this hidden jewel!
5,"I went though a lot of dealerships in the Phoenix and sister cities area, including Chapman and Camelback, but Cardinale Way Mazda was the most straightforward and personable dealership out of the bunch.  I set up my purchase on the phone, and aside from learning how to use the car, I pretty much walked in with a check and came out with my brand new Mazda3.

I worked with some awesome guys, in particular Chris Hansen to get the best possible price vs. features.  Their brilliant and geeky tech guy walked me through the dash features and helped me get a feel for how it should drive.  It was really fun.  In general, their staff was friendly, direct, and didn't push any last-minute deals on me, no deceptive sales tactics.  This is probably why they are the most recognized dealer in the state.

Overall an amazing experience.  I highly recommend you shop from these guys, they really know what they're doing!  I especially suggest you talk with Chris Hansen, he's a great guy to work with.

Thanks Cardinale Way!!!

(as for the reviews below...I don't know why they had such a bad time, but if you look at other sites you'll see that Cardinale Way is the top-reviewed dealership, so don't let it skew your opinion too much)"
5,"Good place to get some fresh Sri Lankan food. I got the Dosa and butter chicken. The dosa was big enough to share and still fill us up. The prices were a bit high, dosas averaged around 11-15$. And the quantity for butter chicken was small. 

 The vibe is super down low. Perfect for date night. 

The staff is nice and knowledgable. If you don't know the ingredients they'll explain it to you properly. 

Came here a second time with a larger group. We booked ahead and they were super accommodating with us.  Their menu is super diverse with options for everyone. All the dishes we got were delicious and filling. 

Masala Butter panner - this is the sauce of butter chicken but instead of chicken, they use paneer. It's a mix of sweet and spicy and so creamy and delicious. There were enough pieces and made the curry super thick. The panner was super soft. 

Veg Manchurian Gravy - crispy fried balls with a sweet Manchurian sauce.  The inside is fried dough mixed with vegetables. Super delicious and can definitely be eaten on it's own. 

Chilli panner dry - this was my least favorite dish, however I still thought it was good. It's dry, fried tofu mixed with chilli. I felt there was alot of taste other than chilli, however if you're someone who loves spice, this is definitely the dish for you

Falooda- the drink was absolutely terrible. It barely tasted like an Falooda and instead tasted more like ice cream mixed with yogurt. The portion was way too small for the price it was."
5,"I am not sure WHY I've never been here before. 

The food and service was absolutely perfect. Where do I begin? 

We arrived around 5pm on a Monday. Seated right away in a very comfortable booth. Very nice ambience. Our server was very attentive during our entire time there. 

Ordered the Shrimp Rangoon for an appetizer. Nice and light, not heavy at all. Perfect crispness to them and great flavor. The ginger lemon dipping sauce was very good. 

Two entrees: 

1.Half order of the Shrimp Snow Peas and half order of the fragrant shrimp. 

2. Sesame Chicken

The fragrant shrimp tomato base sauce might just be the BEST sauce I've ever tasted. A little sweet with a little heat to it. Devine!! The shrimp in both dishes were cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. 

The sesame chicken had the best batter on the chicken. Light and a perfect crispness to it. 

Best Chinese meal in ages. I WILL be coming back to try more and I WILL bring more people with me. Thank you for a great evening."
5,I love this place. Grew up with southern mother and spent half my childhood in the south. This is the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. Don't miss the biscuits. Amazing. The pulled pork is pretty good too and Sunday brunch has some different options that are really well done. All the flavored are rich and complex.  Try this place - you will love it.
5,"Finally made it in to try Julep and our first time was great.  I love what they've done with the interior, and the three businesses sharing the space really work together.  All of the staff were phenomenally helpful and friendly - they really set the mood for a great night from the moment we walked in.  

Started with the case iron corn bread, which was served warm and fresh with a nice whipped butter.  The menu description says it comes with raw honey, which I didn't see - maybe it was incorporated into the butter but if so not in any discernible quantity.  The cocktails we had were both hits, well done on the bar menu.

Everything on the menu sounded so good that we decided to split a variety of dishes. The blue corn crab cakes were my dining companion's favorite and my least favorite - although I still thought they were quite good there was just so much good food.  A bit heavy on the corn bread and lighter on the crab was the only downside to these, but the flavors were spot on.  The field pea salad, which was recommended by our waiter is big enough to split between 3-4 people and just delicious, which fluffy clouds of goat cheese tossed throughout and perfectly complemented by the smoked tomato vinaigrette.  Our last small dish was the fried green tomatoes - the tomatoes came out light and crispy, and the accompanying salad was perfection with candied pecans.  

The Charleston shrimp and grits featured large juicy shrimp over fluffy grits all covered in a tasty ham gravy.   A great comfort meal, reminiscent of biscuits and gravy.  We finished off the meal with a slice of buttermilk pie with lemon curd - which featured a nice heavy custard weaved through with not-too-tart-not-too-sweet lemon curd.

Overall a delightful meal, and we'll be back."
5,"The food here was pretty great, the prices are reasonable and the wait was only about 15 mins on a busy night. Not bad at all. My favorite part of my visit was our waitress Giselle (I think that's how you spell it, lol) she was on top of everything and very sweet. I'll be eating here again soon hopefully I get her again."
5,"Dining out with an infant can be dicey, but the folks at Julep made it a breeze. They allowed us to make a reservation, even though we were one person short of their 6-person minimum; they had a high chair ready at our table without us having to ask; the server was super sweet and interactive with our 9-month-old daughter; they brought our food promptly even though they were super busy; and the noise level in the restaurant was high enough that her occasional shrieks didn't appear to bother any of the the other diners.

The food itself was great. The farro risotto was amazing -- as a vegetarian, I really appreciate chefs taking the time to make our dishes special, too."
5,"Just purchased a CX-5 from here and it was the easiest car buying experience ever. Eric was a no pressure salesmen and Chris finalized a ""no nonsense deal""
Thanks guys!"
5,"Best Chinese around.  Have won Best of Madison for over 20 years straight.  The Governor's Chicken is one of the best selections.  The fried rice is very good also.  I would just remind people, this is the Imperial Garden that is in Middleton.  Do not confuse this with the one on the east side of Madison.  They are two completely separate restaurants with different owners, menus, managers, philosophies, etc.  There is a big difference between the two, so make sure you are enjoying and reviewing the right one!"
5,I love Capriotti's vegetarian food. :) Their vegetarian cheese 'steak' sub is great. I had their vegetarian 'turkey' sub in the past and their veggie burger. They are good as well.
5,The menu had a great selection and it isn't your typical bar food.  Very good beer selection (locals) and great staff. Can't wait to go back again!
5,"How can you rate a place bad because of price?  If you are staying at The Boulders I am guessing that the price of food is not an object.  If you are expecting Panda Express then go find one.  There might be one around the Wal-Mart off Carefree Hwy and Cave Creek.  I bet you Price Haters complain at Morton's, Mastro's, Ocean Club, Tonto, Cartwrights, Harolds, and Black Mtn. Coffee shop.  Probably can not afford to go to these places.  This area Scottsdale, Carefree, and Old Town Cave Creek in not for a person on a beer budget it is pricey...might be too pricey for a beer budget $5.00/bottle for domestic beer.  So Expect High Prices.
Whew, awesome food, start off with Wor Won-ton soup, order lunch salad, salt and pepper shrimp, House Fried Rice & Noodles.
Great Place and service.  Great at any price...same as Tonto, Cartwrights etc.
Ta Ta you price haters go to Panda and find something to bitch about there."
5,hot peppers on the capastrami are delish! The coleslaw sets the sandwich apart leaving you feeling not so badly about the deeeeelish pastrami. checked in with yelp and got a free large soda! next time want to try the bobbie
5,"Date night at SG was a hit.  First we went to the Jones location and the customer service was terrible so we drove to Henderson.  Most locals think it's far, but actually not a bad drive at all.  The customer service was great.  We sat at the bar and played some games.  Our money got stuck and the bar tender quickly called a repair guy who came and opened the machine and gave us our money and we continued playing.   Now on to the food.... can I say sooooooo delicious! The portions were big well at least to me so I didn't finish it all and I was sharing with my husband.  The drinks were made to perfection and the other locals at the bar were very friendly.  It was my husbands birthday and they bought him a Yeager and redbull.  He is not a big drinker, but he enjoyed the drink. All around 5 stars for customer service, location, and the other customers.  We went on my husband's birthday which was Feb. 22 and I must say we will be returning.  We live in summerlin, but we enjoy this location the most."
5,"Best waffle fries ever! Great beer and wine selections along with great cocktail menu. Had the regular burger with side salad and waffle fries. If you love crispy waffle fries then these are for you. Salad was fresh and the burger wasn't a thin patty. Looks like the homemade kind. Check was about $50 for 2 burger, 1 cocktail, a side salad, and 3 draft beers. Not too shabby. Sports bar feel and music in the background. Definitely will be back."
5,"Had a really great experience at this restaurant tonight. My friend had a foodora issue (more with foodora, less with this restaurant) a couple of months back, and the manager followed up with her immediately after and offered to make her a reservation if she wanted to give it another go. 

Her and I went tonight, and every aspect of the dinner was wonderful. The manager had made us a reservation at 7pm on a Thursday - a busy time for them - and we were seated promptly at the bar. This was actually great, as the kitchen is all open. The wait staff was extremely friendly and professional, and ensured any allergies were looked after. 

The food was also incredible - our server suggested 3 to 5 dishes, and we ordered 5, which for two people was a lot, but I had no regrets. Loved the variation of corn chips and vegetables that came with the guac, and the while the rest of our food was amazing, the chori papa was amazing. We were more than stuffed. 

All in all we had a great time, and I would highly recommend this restaurant. Great vibe, great food, great staff."
5,"This place is an old family favorite. They are consistent in their preparation, good quality and service. They are NOT your run of the mill cheap Chinese chain nor do they offer the more daring, traditional style cuisine that some of the smaller places in town now do and can take a bit more courage. Food here is simply delicious. Be sure to order the mu shu with handmade pancakes and any of the governor's entrees - both wonderful choices."
5,"We visited last month.  I had the barley risotto, my husband had the shrimp and grits and we shared pork tamales.  Everything was delicious.  The grits were out of this world!  I would eat just a plate of that!  The julep tea (non-alcoholic) was really good too.  Will definitely be back."
5,"This is an excellent resturante for great food, and service. The best in town for friendly socials and having a great time!"
5,We bought a Dodge from them a few months back. Excellent service and super friendly people. If you are in the market please ask for Corey. She is amazing and even follows up with you months later to make sure u are still happy. She is awesome. We even got a Christmas card hand written from her!
5,"A friend recommended this place and I am so glad she did! The food is AMAZING and very inexpensive. I'm very picky when it comes to hot and sour soup and theirs is delicious. Everything else we got was really good too, not a single complaint."
5,service was just as good as the food!!!
5,"Great first experience, will edit my review with an update the next time my car falls apart. :)"
5,"Morals village is one of the better hot pots I been to. Their selection of a variety of soups, noodles, and meats/seafood is overwhelmingly awesome. I went with a group of 8 and we had to wait for 30 min because it was busy at night. They served us within 20 min and they brought everything over for us including the sauces. We can increase the heat of the hot pot to our liking. Our table got a the tom yum soup base and spicy soup base (which I recommend for those spicy lovers but a side note would be to take out the dried chilli peppers before eating, as it can increase the spice of the soup when boiled) 

It was a lovely time, the service was great and we had soft served ice cream at the end. The price is roughly 40 per person, give or take. It's well worth the money if you want to eat a selection of meats, veggies, noodles and rice. 

Highly recommend !"
5,Great vegetarian options for subs. The bread is fresh and very good. They have vegetarian turkey from Worthington or better than meat for the philly cheese steak or morning star farms if you would like. Fresh veggies on it as well. Great vegetarian options. Recommended
5,We showed up about 7pm on sat night with a party of 10. The placed was packed somehow got seated in about 15 min. Service was prompt and on point. Everyone was very happy with their meals and my 9yr old daughter said the mini burgers was the best shes ever had lol I have the fish tacos and they were great. Will definitely be back!!
5,"I'm really surprised to see so many negative reviews for this dealership. All I know is my own experience with them, which has been GREAT.

I bought my car there April 2013. My sales person (Chris Johnson) was very responsive to my emails and didn't seem ""pushy"" at all. I had already done all my research and knew exactly what I wanted. When I came in to sign the paperwork I didn't have to wait more than a few minutes before we got started. The whole process was fast and easy. One thing I didn't like was the guy I had to see after my salesperson, to talk about extended warranty, scratch protection, etc. He was a bit pushy and rude, didn't like him very much. Overall, I would say 4/5 stars for the buying experience.

BUT, I have to give them 5 stars overall because of how awesome their service department is. I have owned expensive cars, including Mercedes and BMW and this is hands down the best service department I've ever been to. Ever. My service guy (Nick) is always upbeat and friendly, I never have to wait even 1 second to go see him when I come in for service. He always meets or beats his time estimates. One time when I was getting my 30k mile service he was in jeopardy of running over his time estimate while I was waiting on my car, and although the service was done it was still in queue to be washed, so he ran out and washed it himself!

In life in general, I don't particularly like car dealerships, but as far as dealerships go CardinaleWay Mazda deserves 5 stars, especially for their service department which is outstanding."
5,"It's official. This place makes me weak in the knees. One of my best food discoveries of 2013!

Went in today, and got my regular order of Pork/Chive and Lamb Dumplings. Excellent as usual. Filled with tender meat, and flavourful broth. Once dipped in the Chili/Black/Vinegar/Soy provided at the table, it's over. Like, pack your bags and go home over. SO bloody good!!

Decided to explore the menu a little more today. We had the Kimchi Fried Rice with Pork. I am not a fan of Rice, but this was the best fried rice I've ever had in a Chinese restaurant. So flavourful, and the rice had a nice bite to it. 

The Fried Noodles with Seafood were a revelation. Someone in the kitchen is hand-pulling those noodles yo, and I've got to give them major props! These couldn't have been any more perfect. They had a perfect chewy/al-dente quality. And the smokey flavour from wok-frying was dope. One of the best noodle dishes I've had in a long time.

Also have to give a shout out to the Deep Fried Lamb with Cumin. This was just melt in your mouth good. So tender, and delicate. The cumin just added the right amount of earthiness to the dish, while the chill hinted at a bit of zip. I would order it again for sure!

I've been here about 6 times now. Is it too early to say I'm in love? Am I just lusting and confused? I don't know. But I have a feeling that this infatuation won't be ending anytime soon. 

In the words of Biggie Smalls (kinda), your Dumplings just hypnotize me yo!"
5,"Julep is the jewel in the 3 pronged crown of the Robina courtyard. Along with the great wine bar Barolo and coffee shop A-ok make it a destination spot you can hang out at all night and move between.

Dinner! The CORN BREAD is stab your friends hand with a fork if they try to take the last piece good. Fried chicken and collared greens are the better then places I've had in the south. Shrimp and grits here completely changed my mind on how I felt about grits. Awesome. 

Can't wait for the summer to chill in the courtyard."
5,"I like this restaurant as it serves authentic South Indian Food that includes non-vegetarian options.I have been here several times and like it coz they have various options - from the Paper Masala Dosa to the Shrimp Curry to the Biryani. Everything is prepared well and I have never had concerns from any of my colleagues and friends. The only thing to watch out is that the spice level is quite high. Their mild version too can be spicy for some (LOL!).  Apart from the food, there are a few key things I like about the place 1. They take the orders through a tablet. It's pretty professional and if you have asked for some changes, there is an entry to it. 2. The staff is friendly but more importantly efficient - they realize that given the large range of items on the menu, some items take time. They make sure that they ask for your preferences as to when you want it 3. They have a nice party hall that you can use for hosting events. Inform the folks that you have a special event and they'll make some ""personal space"" for you. 4. They have some Loyalty / Rewards scheme out there. I was pleasantly surprised when the lady told me that I had been here before and had accumulated some points and got a discount. Overall, it's a authentic south indian restaurant with solid management driving the quality and experience."
5,"We came here, loved the first Car we looked at. Really liked our salesman, johnathan, despite liking the car and J, we went to four other dealers and got the run around and poor salesmanship from all of them. We came back here today and found the car my daughter wanted, we are in the dealing process.  First round, cost too high.  We shall see how round two goes and whether we can make a deal.  Ok, 30 minutes later... Deal done!  Very nice finance manager,  Thomas, very normal and fair.  Next comes the dealer ad on ... Finance. Chris. Was super energetic,fast and efficient. Whole experience was completely positive. Highly recommend."
5,All I can say is the Pad Thai and Chicken Satay are awesome here. Although Sesame is a Chinese restaurant they sure know how to put together some great Thai dishes. I would also strongly recommend the veggie spring rolls as well as the beef and broccoli.
5,"Cannot say enough good about this place! Best auto service we've ever had! Good service, extremely fair prices, prompt answers, hard workers. We will be loyal customers forever. They know their stuff and will fix your car to run better than ever at a fraction of the price of anywhere else. So grateful for trustworthy, capable repairmen!! THANK YOU!"
5,Loved  the fish tacos and Mac Attack Burger. The sloppy Joe waffle fries are amazing. Wife's salmon was undercooked but staff handled very well.
5,"As an expatriate southerner, I'm always happy to discover a new place that features the tastes of home. My wife and I had a fabulous dinner here on Friday. It was busy, and we expected to wait for a table, but we were seated immediately. Our service by Amanda was excellent and the cocktails were dangerously delicious (and strong!).  I can't wait to go back."
5,"so good?excellent?best experience ever?so cheap if you are from US, this is ABSOLUTELY the right place! Beautiful dishes, welcoming service, nice environment. Staffs are so considerate. Five stars, recommend!"
5,I love this place!  I  took a larger group of work people out for a business dinner. It was so much fun!  The environment is super chill! The hostess was super nice and accommodating. The waiter was a little unfriendly but who cares - the food was amazing! The perlou was the best thing I have ever eaten ever! I am so going back with non work people! And back again with work people for sure! This place is 5 stars!
5,"TJ, the owner, may be one of the nicest, most understanding business owners in the downtown Phoenix area. He got me in last minute after work right before they were going to stop taking cars in because my oil needed changed and the tire pressure light was on. He estimated my cost and then gave me a small discount for using Yelp. I had forgotten about the check in offer but he made sure I got it! 
   My tire pressure light did not turn off after my visit, so after several messages back and forth and him continuously being patient and saying he could check it all I went back and had another great experience with fast and friendly service."
5,"I've been working with Zach for the past month on locating a vehicle. Understand that I work a lot, in between the office and home it is hard to go down to the dealership in person. At first I was hesitant to run my credit because of it lowering my score and not having all the specs of the deal in order, but boy did Zach deliver. I literally told Zach what I wanted and he even found one with navigation and tint. Best experience ever. So glad I stuck with Zach."
5,"Brought my vehicle in yesterday for an oil change and brake inspection. After doing the inspection, TJ called to let me know the brakes didn't need to be replaced just yet but should be done soon. I was only charged for the oil change. I appreciate their honesty and will will keep going back."
5,"I recently needed to buy an economical car as a third vehicle in our household for my mother-in-law to drive.  After doing research online, we decided to shop for a Mazda3 5 door.  At first we went to another Mazda dealer in Mesa who also sells Fords, but did not like the way we were treated.  When we went to CardinaleWay Mazda, we were treated with respect and one of the managers, Greg Limbeck helped us figure out how to register and insure the vehicle so that it was OK for me to buy it, and my M-I-L to drive it.  Here's the real kicker, we bought the car on Saturday and the following Tuesday Greg called and asked us if we would get upset if the financing was lowered from 8% to 6% APR... We went back to the dealership and it was no trick, the APR was reduced and we were able to shorten the contract terms with very little increase in payment.  Plus they were able to finance and register the car with my M-I-L on all the docs so that the insurance is easier than last time.  All in all, CardinaleWay Mazda treated us better than when we bought our last vehicle, a new Cadillac at another dealership and it has been the best car buying experience we have had in a long, long time."
5,"There are many all-you-can-eat Chinese Hot Pot places in Markham,but Moral Village is the best one so far!!! Just with an acceptable price, you can enjoy delicous soupbases, non stoppable lambs and beef, and all other fresh hot pot food as much as you want!!! Excellent services! All servers threat customer with great great attitudes. This place sure brings customer satisifcation! We went there and waited 1 hour long because Moral Village is so popular, but at the end it was worth it."
5,"Wonderful drinks and dinner with my partner.  We started with a bottle of wine in the courtyard ( mid November, so thank you propane heaters) and dined in Julep with appetizers of cornbread and pimento goat cheese, then the perlou and chicken.  Phenomenal! Highly recommend this for late afternoon cocktails and or diner."
5,"I have been frequenting Sierra Gold for watching games and eating late night meals since I moved to Vegas in 07.  I have some fond memories here:
1) my mom's visit when she wanted scrambled eggs and pancakes for dinner
2) many Longhorn alumni watch parties in the back private room, screaming and cheering - the one that stands out is our 9AM games where I come in and order breakfast like corned beef hash and an iced tea
3) going with a kooky friend who flirted with the waitress who mentioned many times she was taken
4) reading textbooks for a class during the SUPERBOWL and drinking a blue moon
5) my television EXPLODED (meaning it truly caught on fire) when the Duke-Texas game in march madness was about to start, so after cooling it off, I went to Sierra Gold to watch the game and the bartender asked, ""Are you that weird girl who studied during the superbowl last month?""

The menu is good - I like the wraps, the parmesan risotto side dish, the ahi tuna sandwich, and the shrimp/calamari appetizer, but there are lots of choices.  The pear salad is pretty good except the pears are canned ...but service is generally good and it is very cozy to watch games, and not too smoky.  Open 24 hrs and happy hour is half off pizzas, I think 9pm-12am."
5,"This review is long overdue. Basically: After being at my wits end with buying a car - CardinaleWay came to my rescue. They were able to get my interest rate right where I needed it to be. Every time I've gone in for service over the last year, they have been more than accommodating and reasonable. The service team rocks and Michael my sales rep is still my favorite - he even bought me a keychain with his own money because I mentioned it on the phone. Thanks guys!"
5,"This place has always amazed me. However busy they get, their food quality and their service is consistently good. I have tried a lot on their menu, and enjoyed almost everything. Will keep going back for more"
5,Just like mamma made - if mamma had formal training.  I heard the shot gun shell decorations were provided by Harry Whittington himself!
5,"I had to drive from Santa Barbara, CA all the way to Dallas, TX last week. Midway into my trip I began hearing a strange noise from my car. I stopped in Phoenix as I thought there was a problem with my engine. Paul at kincade pretty much dropped everything he was doing to help me and was able to figure out that it was just part of the tape that holds down the winshield had come loose and it was flapping in the wind. He also told me that I needed new tires. I ultimately got new tires at a discount tire nearby and I was on my way! Very helpful guys!"
5,Excellent Latin American food and very good service and also good place to have some drinks after dinner. I didn't like the deserts specially the 3 Leches but the rest of the menu is fantastic.
5,"Beautifully decorated, charming restaurant that feels both down-to-earth and elegant. Really hearty Southern food with thoughtful preparation - Shrimp and Grits are a must have, and best biscuits of my life! Killer bar set-up too and when the garage door is open to the patio I can't imagine a better place to enjoy Madison summer. 
It's just a matter of time until their brunch is out of control busy. Madison has been needing a spot like this!"
5,"I'll make this easy: Julep is the best new restaurant in Madison.  

The longer version:  My mouth waters every time I think about the possibility of dining at Julep.  After a week long road trip through Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana earlier this year, one of our first stops was at Julep so that we could reprise the southern flavors of our vacation.  The standout dish is the perlou - smoke white fish, oysters and Andouille sausage on grits - an especially amazing meal on fall and winter evenings.  Also terrific is the fried chicken thigh, which brings the heat and which is big enough to share.  Other notables include biscuits with homemade condiments (e.g., honey butter), shrimp & grits, cornbread, and (for our vegetarian daughter) mac and cheese.  The draft beer selection is good, liquor selection outstanding.  I recommend dinner over brunch.

I have to stop writing this, or I will need to drive to Julep right now."
5,The service here was great! We had the friendliest waiter and the food was excellent we will definitely be going back!
5,"When visiting relatives in AZ, I come to Sesame Inn often to get practically the only Chinese food in town (N. Scottsdale/Carefree area).  The ambience is quaint and the food is awesome!  Here's the low-down:

- The quality of ingredients are great!  The pieces of shrimp are quite larger than other Chinese restaurants.  
- The quantity of their dishes are a good size.  Lots of ""stuff"" in the hot and sour soup.
- The prices are similar to ""PF Chang's"" and it (prices) fits the upper-middle class demographics.  This is not some Chinese fastfood joint, which some folks may be used to their prices.

Some dishes to try:

Calamari
Ribs with carrots/peppers
Fried Rice
Hot and Sour soup
Westlake soup
Wonton soup
Sizzling Rice soup
Shrimp with Lobster Sauce
Kung Pao Chicken"
5,"Excellent service with a classy atmosphere. By far the best bar in the area. Bartenders are polite and pool tables are nice. If you're looking for a place to meet friends that offers gaming, pool and a lounge this is it. Also suggest asking for a dirty bong water shot. One of the bar tenders secret recipes"
5,"My favorite Indian restaurant in TO. The food is delicious and the service is good. Get there early and plenty of seating, get there late and prepare to wait!"
5,This was so delicious. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and was beyond impressed. It was the perfect crunch with all the flavor. The homemade pickles were a great touch. I'll definitely be back
5,"A top restaurant choice among the ocean of options in Toronto! Chef Steve Gonzalez and his team are serving up some of the best latin street food in the city. Upon arriving, we were taken to the upstairs bar for a couple cool draft beers prior to dinner. Dinner itself was also a trip; we shared the Octopus, Empanadas, and the Chori Papa, AND all three (3) were displayed beautifully and tasted absolutely delicious. Dessert is a MUST (i.e. the deconstructed Butter Tart). All in all, we had a cool experience at Baro, and look forward to being back."
5,"One of my favorite places to eat. I usually come during the buffet. The buffet is actually a good deal, $9.99. The food is super tasty and is truly authentic.  The buffet has a decent amount of selection, ranging from a rice dish, soups, sambar, salad, naan or parotta, pakodas, chicken, and shrimp dishes etc. There are usually three desserts, payasam, kesari and fruit.  I will tell you, their dosas are the best. It is so fresh and crunchy. One time I came in the evening when they had a la carte and I ordered the paper dosa. It was huge but it tasted so good. The dosas are highly recommended."
5,"Hands down the most authentic Vietnamese food in the GTA, very delicious Pho, vermicelli, and rice dishes. They serve you a side of beef broth soup with your rice order! Which is how it's supposed to be, it's sad how most places fail to do that these days. I come here often from the other side of town. Easily my favourite. Service is fast and attentive and I absolutely love hearing the Vietnamese ambient music as I slurp on a perfect steaming hot bowl of Pho Dac Biet."
5,Mmm the food was great! I really enjoyed the oysters and The Mac and cheese. But the pot roast was melt in your mouth amazing. Can't wait to come back:)
5,"I cannot recommend Kinkade's enough TJ and the team really go above and beyond on customer service, they communicate to you in warm and professional manner. On both of my visited they have exceeded all my expectations.
I always feel like I was never going to be overcharge or be forced to get any unnecessary work done to my car. 
High recommend for a great garage in downtown Phoenix."
5,"We had the best experience ever in buying a new car in the CardinaleWay Mazda, Mesa.  The ways that CardinaleWay Mazda treat the customers are frank, friendly and comfortable.

The salesman who I dealt with is Chris Johnson. He makes his job done while keeping his customer very happy and making the customer very comfortable. Definitely, he respects his customer.

Their Internet Marketing is very realistic. Their accounting people are very efficient. Their sales manager treats you like a real friend.

We bought a 2014 Mazda 6 in CardinaleWay Mazda. We are completely satisfied. I feel that I am very lucky to choose CardinaleWay Mazda."
5,"This laid-back Kentucky Derby themed joint is a magical addition to downtown.  Whether you are checking it out to have some drinks or to have a sitdown meal, you just can't go wrong. 

 The craft cocktails are very exceptional (a telltale sign of the perfect julep is crushed ice, and they don't disappoint) and the list is classy and perfected. I am more into wine, and I would have to admit they have a very competent wine list.  

The food is delicious and pretty creative, combining classic southern recipes with a flare of Madison eccentricity.  I try to get something new every time I go, but the staples I would recommend is the cornbread (WOW!) and crabcakes.  I am a huge fan of anywhere that offers small plates, both because I tend to have an ""eyes are bigger than my stomach"" appetite and also I love to expand my horizons and try many things instead of just one; they do not disappoint on their small plate options.  The fried chicken: Oh myyyyyy yummmy!  

OH And did I mention their super awesome patio!? I'm almost hesitant to give that little gem away for fear that all of you will steal my new favorite restaurant patio! 

Moral of the story?  DO IT."
5,"Came here yesterday night. There were mutiple menus to look at making it difficult to choose something somewhat. However, also a good thing being that there were many different assortment of options to choose from. I ordered the Black pepper chicken with spaghetti for 9.95. The chicken came out perfectly hot and crispy, and quite juicy. The sauce was really peppery, which I like. I like the fact that almosy every dish comes with soup and a drink. Comparably, the prices are fairly good and I find the food alot better than Hollywood. I would definitely comw again to try other things."
5,"This place is heavenly. I had never heard of Lo Lo', but everyone has heard the term Chicken and Waffles. I could only hope the food was as good as Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles.  I must say it surpassed our dreams. I wanted everything we dreamed of.  I think they have several locations, we went to first one found on Central - found on yelp.  Thanks yelp. Love this app.  Anyhoo if you are every in Phoenix plz go see the Lo Lo family. You will fall in love!"
5,"Super clean, nice place to have a meal... Home made chinese Mustard.
Liked the appetizer combo very much. Egg foo young is the best I have had in years & years. Great value, nice sized portions. Staff is attentive and friendly."
5,"Black-eyes pea salad- 5 stars
Cast-iron cornbread- 5 stars
Grilled oysters- 5 stars
Shrimp & grits- 4 stars (but I suspect shrimp & grits just isn't my thing)
Apple pie dessert- 4.5 (only because it had a hint of nutmeg or something I don't care for)- looking forward to trying the bourbon chocolate cake next!

Also, the coffee is amazing!

Great vibe! Love this place."
5,Great spot if you are looking to try non-vegetarian south Indian food. My favorite from the menu is mutton Biryani.
5,"I may have found my new favourite Vietnamese place. For one thing, other than a couple of tables of office workers, the restaurant was full of Vietnamese people. Also, the prices were very reasonable, and it's pretty easy to get to.

I got takeout from this place and based on Dong L.'s review, tried the Bún bò Hu. Sweet mother of mercy!  The menu describes it as ""'Hue' style beef & pork with vermicelli soup."" Although correct, it would be like describing a Picasso as ""dabs of paint on canvas"". 

I took the package to work and opened up the styrofoam container to find it brimming with shredded cabbage, some other stringed vegetable, herbs, bean sprouts, noodles, beef and some sort of ham. I opened up the accompanying soup container and got instantly punched in the face with a heavenly fragrance of spice and herbs. Inside the soup were slices of pork hock and blood jello. I put it all together and may have had the best soup noodles I've ever had in my life. The soup was a little salty, but all is forgiven as everything else surpassed my expectations.

I can't wait to go back and try out the other stuff on their menu, including the giant pancake that some lady got, stuffed with... I don't know, I didn't want to stare."
5,"Went on a monday dinner, restaurant itself is not so fancy but food was good. I almost didn't want to share this place. 

Food I had :  dumpling variety, fried dumplings caramelized sweet potatos, cold noodles, stir fried pork, kung pao chicken, fried noodle.

Dumplings : pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of dumplings but they were good. 

Cold noodles: had both fresh noodle and buckwheat noodle. Fresh noodle had more chewy texture which I liked it over thin buckwheat noodle. 
Both had big pieces of thinly cut pork. 

Fried noodle: soso

Kung pao : less batter than regular kung pao you can find at a food court.

Caramelized SP and stir fried pork: Best. I would come back for these. Sweet potatoes get stuck together when it cools down so you might want to take your portion right away. And watch out for the sugar strings. Fried pork, which was flat , thinly battered yet very crunchy was the best dish. 

Price : lovely. Cash only but no complaint."
5,"Brought my car here to have my radiator hoses and serpentine belt replaced after the dealership quoted me $850. In the process of removing the upper hose the outlet on the radiator broke. They had to replace the radiator as well now. Since they couldn't determine whether or not it broke because it was old and brittle, or if it was their bad and accidentally broke it off, they replaced the radiator for free! This was my first time coming here and I will now be a repeat customer! Great job!"
5,"I go there all the time for honest quotes and repairs. He does an amazing job and its fairly quick! Also, he has a free shuttle so he took me back home until my car was finished with a car wash! Highly recommended and would return there!"
5,"If you enjoy spicy flavour filled meals, then this is definitely the place to go! The waiters/waitresses are fast, the restaurant is clean and the food is always consistent with taste. If you're not sure what to get, the waitresses are really helpful too! I would make reservations if you're going on a weekend evening or Sunday lunch."
5,Brief update: I was headed out on a road trip when I saw a large puddle of liquid underneath my truck. Brought it over to Kinkade's and TJ replaced my fuel line and got me on my way within an hour. I can't say enough about the customer service that TJ and his crew provides.
5,"This was honestly my best meal in Arizona! Came in here before my morning flight and wasn't expecting much considering that it's an airport restaurant but thankfully this place delivered! The chicken, waffles and fries were all honestly amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some quick food before their flight."
5,"Have brought my truck here twice, had the AC compressor replaced in a day. Brought it back in , unscheduled, for a strange sound under the hood, TJ diagnosed it and repaired it within an hour , replacing a worn pulley for a small charge. Great service both times and what seems to be fair pricing. This is my go to shop from now on anytime I have vehicle issues."
5,"This is the best south Indian restaurant in Toronto. Their idlis are simply amazing. Being a vegetarian, I can not say much about the non-veg dishes though."
5,"I took the car in for an oil change, A/C fix.   Oil change, A/C fixed not blowing cold but better than driving with windows down all the time in Arizona.   I will definitely be bringing the car back to fix the A/C.  They know there is leak, put a dye to see where the leak is.   I plan on having all my automotive done here.   They treat the customer right, keep them in the loop."
5,"Excellent
Ordered sautéed green beans, house special noodleS, and sweet and sour pork, two beers and a large hit and sour pork
Perfect for two adults and two growing boys, a level above most Chinese in quality and certainly in service."
5,"I am in California and my son is in his first year of college at ASU Downtown Phoenix campus. My son's car was having some minor problems with his trunk latch mechanism, after some research on Yelp I sent my son to this place. I couldn't be more happy about the service they gave him. Even though it was a minor problem they treated my son, who's only 18, exceptionally. He was able to drop off his car and they gave him a ride back to school to attend his classes. Was given calls to update him on the problem and what was needed. Was given an estimate before the work was done, and after work was completed he was picked up at school to pick up his car. Taking in to consideration that my son is not mechanically inclined, he was treated with honesty and professionalism. I was ready to jump in in case it sounded like he was being taken advantage of but it was not necessary. Highly recommended this place. It is so reassuring, as a parent, to have a go to place in Phoenix for any kind of problem my son might have with his vehicle."
5,"This is one of the the best Chinese restaurants in the Scottsdale/Carefree area.  The people here complaining about the prices must go to cheap Chinese Buffets! Where can  you go for lunch for $10 and get a salad or soup, egg roll, main course with rice and tea? Everything we've had here has been excellent. The lettuce wraps are our favorite appetizer. You will not go wrong at this family owned and operated restaurant. We love it and suggest you give it a try!"
5,"Amazing restaurant that I ever been. The meat and the vegetables are really fresh. The service was really nice and patient since this is the first time I went there and he introduced so many good stuffs. The watermelon juice surprise me, it's soooooo good. The meat quality is good and the service is quick, they have a wide selection of the food. I was also very  impressed with the service, he checking on us often. I would like to go to this place again and again and I really love it!!"
5,"This shop provided me with a great experience and definitely won me as a customer. The owner was extremely honest and really a class act. It is not often that you find a shop that you can trust but for now, my search is over."
5,"Ive had two awesome experiences with tj at kinkades. I purchased a certified preowned hyundai sonata at a local dealership recently. Brought it into another local mechanic who said it had been submerged in water. Brought the car back to the dealership crying, angry and totally disgusted. The dealership vehemently denied this, but at this point i wasn't going to trust anyone at the dealership. We brought the car to kinkades for an honest, neutral opinion. Even though tj was super busy that day he took the time to talk with the dealership service representative, my dad ( who was helping me through the process), and me. He looked for signs of water damage ( found none) and gave an explanation for why the other mechanic gave that opinion. He even recommended a guy to do the window tint on my car. A profound thanks to you TJ. I will be bringing all my future business to you."
5,"""Dizzy"" was awesome. Super friendly and personable. Never preassured us and reassured us that he was there to make us happy. He delivered on what he said. Best car buying experience."
5,"I had a the best experience leasing a car today! Matt, Brian, Mama, and Donny were so friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and patient.  They didn't mind me test driving multiple cars until I found exactly what I wanted and I didn't feel pressured in any way.  I highly recommend this dealership and will never go anywhere else!"
5,"I bought my Mazda 5 from this dealership and the entire experience was great. Salesman was friendly, knowledgable and not pushy by any means. So now, I take my Mazda in for its maintenance upkeep at the service department and Steve is my advisor and he is great! He goes above and beyond I think. He always takes good care of me. I think it's a great dealership all the way around."
5,My absolute favorite Chinese restaurant. I have since moved away from the area but still make an effort return. The food and service are always awesome and always consistent. The egg drop soup is the best one I've found in Arizona and my favorite dish is the chicken lo mein or chow mein. Can't wait to go back!
5,"I was up there with mom for the Rock & Roll Half Marathon this past weekend and there was a broken piece hanging from the bottom of my car. Driving back Monday, my mom wanted to make sure it wasn't anything serious. We called Kinkade and explained our situation and they saw us immediately with no appointment necessary. They fixed the broken piece for the drive back and even called for quote on the replacement piece so I wouldn't be ripped off when I get it replaced when I get back in town. They did this with friendly service and no charge. I am so forever grateful for their team and service. I wasn't feeling to well and the drive back to Cali was rough, but thank you to this great shop for making ride back safer and survivable. You guys are amazing and we love Phoenix Arizona for great people & service like you! Thank you!"
5,"Had a great time here with my boyfriend it was his birthday dinner we got the chili cheese fries omg so good ^_^ also BBQ Chicken plus he got a steak he loved it! Great Service, Nice workers! But only thing one worker was watching the game on the bar don't get me wrong I'll all for that but he was being noise hearing us talk and kept looking over."
5,"Came here for dumplings and they did not disappoint. Their lamb and winter melon soup was surprisingly so awesome, soup lovers should try that for sure

Pro tip: if you get that soup to go, use seperate  containers for the noodles inside. It will expand 5 times like no body's business and absorb your yummy soup. Imagine my surprise opening the lid next morning and looking at a noodle Sahara desert"
5,"As a self-proclaimed foodie who has enjoyed ten years of Chicago dining and culture, I have largely been underwhelmed with what Madison has to offer a transplant. Thankfully Julep has restored my faith. 

The decor and ambiance indicates that the owners are mindful of a world beyond Southern Wisconsin (how refreshing). It's a curated experience that marries modernity, charm and approachability. It's an atmosphere that has energy but without the excessive din, the dining room is romantic but not a chick flick cliche.

Now about the food. While a modern take on southern favorites isn't a new concept, it's a welcome addition to the Madison dining scene. The flavors feel rooted in authentic recipes with new ingredients and small surprises that would bring a smile to any diner's face. 

We started with the pimento cheese and homemade crackers as wells as the fried shrimp and okra. Both were flavorful, well seasoned and surprisingly light. Mint Juleps and Dark and Stormy's were ordered and very well made.

Fried chicken boneless thighs, shrimp and grits and perlou were ordered with a side of Mac n Cheese. Each of the entrees had individual moments of surprise and delight. The fried chicken was outstanding. The perlou had bite after bite of heart warming flavor. The shrimp and grits were solid although heavy-handed with gravy (unfortunately, the roux needed more salt too). Lastly, the Mac n Cheese was the runaway crowd favorite that stole the spotlight from the main actors, but a strong showing by all regardless. 

The lemon curd pie with buttermilk crust was the final act that sealed the deal. We were in love with Julep and wanted more. 

Definitely make the trip to Julep. You won't regret it."
5,"Great place!  Had lunch here with friends. Shrimp tacos were a hit. Sandwich with grilled chicken & pimento cheese was excellent. And, for the gluten free, dairy free, pork free person, the make your own salad was perfection. Great service. We will come back!"
5,"Initial greeting and continued wait staff service were excellent, especially for a Friday night.  Food is always good making them a madison tradition. Fragrant shrimp is super."
5,"You cannot beat the atmosphere of this place. Their outdoor seating is beautiful and thoughtful. I had their seasonal risotto which had mushrooms, corn, squash, etc. and it was phenomenal. They also have a large cocktail menu. I will for sure be back here to try the rest of their menu."
5,"This is one of the best places to get sit down Chinese food in the Madison area! I have so many fantastic memories of dining here throughout the years. My heart just warms up and my stomach start growling when someone mentions Imperial Garden. 

Imperial Garden has a large dining hall, yet when you are seated you feel extremely cozy. The menu is giant in the sense that is very extensive and very big literally. Thankfully, they divided the menu into different sections like beef, chicken, vegetarian, and lunch! 

The only downfall is that they don't do delivery, but they do pick up!

The garlic green beans are spectacular, and every time I think of them my mouth waters. All the fried rices are phenomenal. 

In addition to the delicious foods, the service is amazing and attentive. They are prompt, and your water glass will hardly ever be empty! When you are seated, they get to you in a timely matter and will get you started with anything you want! 

With those things, there is a reason why I've been dining here for numerous years."
5,"The bread on these subs is some of the best, the pastrami with creamy coleslaw inside the sub, add sweet peppers and you get...ahmazzzzzing! Just when I thought my SUBLIME SUB cuisine could not get any better, I had a bite of a cheese steak sub with mushrooms...shut the front door and all the windows....daaaaamn this place rocks...you will crave these subs!"
5,"We have been Mazda customers for over 20 years and always taken the vehicles  to a dealer for service.  After experiencing service at a dealer in Tempe we decided to try CardinaleWay Mazda in Mesa even though it is close to 50 miles one way from our home.  It is worth the trip, Jesus the service writer is outstanding along with the service tech (can't remember his name).  Recently we had a major issue with the vehicle, but this service department handled everything in a professional manner.  My vehicle is better than new and looks like a brand vehicle."
5,"GOBBLE gobble GOBBLE...
Whenever I get that craving for leftover Thanksgiving dinner, my go to spot is Capriotti's!
I should probably preface this with:
I'm a COLD, leftover food kinda girl!
COLD pizza, COLD spaghetti, COLD anything really.......and the BOBBIE at Capriotti's tickles my fancy!
Thick slices of COLD roasted turkey, scoops of COLD stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo, fresh bread........MMMmmmMMM, the freakin' goodness!
=)
Yeah, I've tried other sandwiches they make (and they're GREAT too), but my motto is:
""If it ain't broke, don't f**k with it!"""
5,"We used Truecar to find a car we kinda liked. Ronnie texted me back right away. This was early morning on a Sunday. She came in (found out later it was her day off) to show is the car. She gave us the best service I have ever had while car shopping. She talked with us as a friend not a salesperson. She made us feel very comfortable and wasn't pushy. Seems like a sales tactic, turns out they don't make comission. Every single person we walked by greeted us were so nice and knowledgeable.

We will be buying our cars from them for life."
5,"Thankfully there is one Chinese restaurant in town that is consistently good. They have a quite little bar area with a good, friendly bartender and low noise level. The manager, Karen, seems to never go home because she is always there to make sure things are going well and is very personable. We had an appetizer plate for four and it was very good. It was served with four sauces and perfect. The food is served very fast as well. It was pretty busy but we still got everything in record time. We have been here many times over the years and have always been satisfied. If you have a problem like one of the reviewers did, go up to the front desk and TELL THEM! Everyone here wants to please you and its up to you to do something then not the next day. My only complaint here, and it's not their fault, is that if you are coming from the East side it involves a little navigating to get to their driveway which is a little tricky."
5,"We came to this restaurant to celebrate my Husband's Birthday. We were welcomed from the minute we stepped into the door. We sat by the bar and ordered amazing appetizers. Our bartender, Zack was so nice and prompt in his service."
5,"I would recommend this restaurant if you love dumplings. This place offers Chinese and Korean food. I went with a friend, we ordered pork & shrimp dumplings, beef pancakes, and pork bone soup. The food arrived quickly. We want to go back just for the beef pancakes and some other kinds of dumplings."
5,"This hot pot place is really good compare to the other hot pot places. Their AAA slice beef is really good and their watermelon juice is good to with their hot pot food. Their pots are available in small or large and you choose your soup, at separate charge. They have a good selection of selected dishes for hot pot and their customer service is good!! Best in markham so far...!"
5,"Visited again on NYE with a party of 6.  Our server disappeared for a long while.  5 out of the meals were good.  I ordered steak cooked med rare it came out well done.  The Manager came over remade my steak and it came out close to well done again. The manager apologized and offered another steak  with a desert.  The ladies took him up on the desert.  I went ahead and ate the second and he took it off the bill.  All in all, my two experiences were solid and I still plan to revisit."
5,I highly recommend this auto shop! I had an appointment for an oil change and everything was started right on time and finished in a timely manner. The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating and the waiting area is spacious and clean. I grew up with a mechanic as a father who ran shops so I have relatively high expectations of auto shops which were all met at Kinkades.
5,I looked up reviews prior to going. The bar was set high and boy did this place exceed my expectations! It was close to closing time but he still took the time to look at my car and basically explain how a car worked! I will definitely return for any future needs!
5,"I've certainly dined at this restaurant more than 100 times in the last 10 years if you count take out.   They've got an extensive menu and there are a bunch of things on it that I really like.  That being said, I've probably only had a dozen of the menu items because I tend to revisit my favorites.  I think I'm fairly picky about food and service as there are a bunch of local restaurants I've tried that I won't go back to.

The service is consistently good, the wait staff seems better trained than at most places.  The manager always recognizes and greets us which is nice.

My favorite menu item is the Three Delicacies Sizzling Fried Rice.  It has shrimp, scallops, and chicken  in a clear broth with vegetables.  It is poured on a hot skillet tableside.     They have other versions of this dish with just chicken or shrimp but I like the combination.

Now I suppose this is Americanized Chinese food but then I'm not Chinese and haven't been to China so I wouldn't know for certain.  It has occurred to me that I might well prefer Imperial Garden to the ""authentic"" Chinese food."
5,"Ordered a drumstick, thigh and one waffle and a side of collards.  My benchmark is Roscoes in LA and otherwise don't do a lot of soul food.  I don't get the other yelpers but my service experience was fine at 6:45 on a Monday night.   I ordered and had my order in 3 or 4 minutes. Thigh juicy, drum stick not so much, the crust was a bit salty but otherwise crispy, good and not greasy. The typically thin, non crispy waffle I associate with Roscoes or Waffle house - it was fine. Collard greens we were good. Should have been 4 but 2.5 stars is unjust for this place so I'm helping the average."
5,"Having just sampled Capriotti's again, this time at Night of the Living Neon, where they were very generous sponsors, I took my break from the slots at Red Rock for my Wednesday night Food Court Feast.  :)   Their Bobby was calling to me, but I decided to lower the carb quotient by going for their Cole Turkey sandwich.  I guess I didn't realize that, unlike all the other sub joints, Capriotti's uses REAL, FRESH turkey!!, and that helps explain why their prices are a bit higher than the competition.  

The sandwich was super.  I asked for the Russian dressing on the side, and I was given a container big enough to dress my next four salads.  The turkey was moist, the provolone really good, and the cole slaw just the way I like it.  My only complaint is that their Small sandwich, at 9"", is just too big for me.  I'd love to see a smaller one at a smaller price, but I bet not too many people would share this nit.  

I'm a fan!"
5,Sooo goodd!! The cocktails are awesome! The service is great! The foood is sooo unique & delicious!!! The staff is supper nice. They sent a bottle of champagne after a table/reservations mix up. Friday night is salsa night!!!
5,"Love this place! Been going here for years. Some of my favorite picks are general chu chicken, west lake soup, and ANY of the rice dishes. Service is always fast and friendly, especially from Grace! She knows our entire family and always asked how we were doing. I'd recommend trying to get here for the lunch specials, however, as prices have gone up for dinner over the years."
5,"Best pho place to go in the downsview area. I been eating here for years. Since my uni days and I still frequent pho mi asia whenever I am nearby. The bun and pho are bomb. Rice dishes are another solid choice as well. The staff are basically the same ones I knew many years ago. Service is what you expect. You treat them well, they treat you well. Tip them please!"
5,"Woo hoo!!! My new favorite Chinese restaurant in my Summerlin area. The service was outstanding. The portions of food that came out were plentiful. The taste was excellent and the price was fair. Great place, highly recommend!"
5,Fantastic! Stopped in while passing through town on I-85.  A little off the interstate but totally worth it!  My husband and I both had great food and the beer selection was stocked with local craft beer!!!  Great surprise for a small town!
5,"Sierra Gold has a comfy atmosphere, great service staff and bartenders, and is very homey and clean for a bar.  They accomodate football alumni watch parties and are great even in the morning for breakfast and a game.  I highly recommend the ahi tuna sandwich!!  I went there for the super bowl 09 too and enjoyed the crowd.  The calamari and shrimp fry with cilantro and banana peppers is also outstanding with a sweet chili and spicy set of dipping sauces!"
5,Food was great as always. The lovely ladies had the delicious crispy critters. Myself i had the strip steak cooked perfect. The sweet rolls got the best of me but I managed to get it all down.
5,"Crack rice. That's what the waitress called the OG duck chaufa, and she was right - I'm craving it right now. It's a must try! 

This place has superb food and service. The menu may look confusing at first, but the dishes are meant to be shared among the table, so you can try a little of everything. 

My suggestions: the margaritas, they were some of the best I've had and along with the crack rice, I really enjoyed the chori papa. The ceviche had a great flavour but I found that the portion was a little small for the price.

A definite must-try for your next group outing!"
5,I found them through Yelp for my ex who had nothing but rave reviews.  A year later my car died I had it towed they were so friendly and so professional. I am apprehensive about car shops due to my past experience. This is a place I recommend  They  will diligently work to help you. A small local company one I encourage  you to support .
5,"Favourites: nikkei ceviche, choir papa, duck chaufau(don't compare this to regular fried rice), pulpo charred octopus
Five flower cocktail $17 (worth it)
So-so: chicken wings, empanadas, matambre(flank steak)
Dislike: ice cream dessert,  choros(not bad but way too much sugar)"
5,I'm happy to see a local gem available at the airport. The food was fresh and quick. I order the Toy-toy and it took me back to high school. Tasted just as good as I remembered.
5,"Great cap sandwhiches, wish they had a drive thru. Fast riendly service and they offer delivery to mall workers."
5,"I absolutely love Kinkade's. I was given an estimate on my little 2006 Kia Spectra over a year ago. It was a little out of our budget at the time and it being our second car there wasn't any rush to fix it. Fast forward to this year, I finally had the time and money to get it fixed. I called Kinkade's and luckily they still had my estimate on file. I asked if I can schedule repairs for that week and the gentleman said yes. I actually towed my there that same day so that they could start the work whenever they had time and they were totally fine with that. They had my car fully repaired within 2 days! I couldn't believe it! They itemized the estimate by importance and drivability which was awesome.  I trust Kinkade's and couldn't recommend them enough!! The customer service is excellent, no hard sales tactics, no pushy office staff and they even have a shuttle service."
5,"It has been a while since I dined at an Indian restaurant so I was looking forward to this one after a friend had recommended it.  Service was friendly and courteous.  So that alone would make me want to go back.  Since there was a group of us, we were able to taste a number of dishes.  

Because Indian food is not exactly cheap nor are the portions big, I'll base my individual ratings mainly on the quality of the food and their prices/portions. This may be helpful to those who are new to South Asian dining. 

[Appetizers]
Chili Gobi Dry - Sort of like their version of vegetable tempura.  Was very nicely seasoned so it was very flavourful.  Because it's deep fried, it was of course a little on the greasy side.  4/5. 

Devil Chicken - If you like spicy, then you'd like this dish.  I didn't find it overly spicy that you would lose its flavour so I thoroughly enjoyed this.  Good sized platter and with the flavour of the chicken, I give it 5/5.

[Side Dishes]
Chili Chicken - Very very nice.  You get a good amount of garnishing along with the good amount of chicken.  Definitely worth the cost. 5/5.

Butter Chicken - Didn't exactly try the chicken but I definitely tried the sauce. I've never had such creamy sauce.  Was so creamy that it was even a little bit on the sweet side.  I usually have Butter Chicken with Basmati Rice but due to dietary restrictions (I know, dietary restrictions but going to an Indian restaurant.. lame), I instead enjoyed it with some of their Garlic Naan and a piece of Parotta (I'll get to those shortly).  Some people drink the Swiss Chalet sauce and if I weren't watching my diet right now, I'd be drinking this sauce, too.  5/5.

Boiled Egg - I know it's boiled egg but some people don't know how to boil a damn egg. I'm a (self acclaimed) egg connoisseur and I must say that these babies were boiled perfectly. If this were a scene from A Hundred Foot Journey (which every foodie should watch, by the way), I'd hire the person who was in charge of boiling eggs to be my Head Chef. Or maybe just my main boiler. 5/5.

[Indian Breads]
Parotta - Delicious.  Definitely a must have along with that delicious Butter Chicken especially if you're a lame-o like me trying to avoid as much rice as possible. 5/5.

Garlic Naan - As delicious as it was, I felt a little cheated.  Seemed like they just took some plain Naan and brushed it with some butter and garlic.  Again, don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I've had better.  Specifically at Samosa King where I literally wait 10-minutes for the fresh Garlic Naan.  The difference? The one at Samosa King seems to be kneaded directly with the minced garlic and then brushed with butter.  Because of the amount they give you, though, I'd give it 5/5.  

[Biryani]
Chicken Biryani - You're given a choice of boneless or bone-in chicken.  The difference is basically white meat/breast or drumsticks, respectively. That's what I'm assuming anyway because that's what I got and let's face it, drumsticks are cheaper to serve.  You also won't really know until you receive it and after digging underneath the rice (yes, I caved in and ordered rice). Boneless I'm assuming is white meat since there's a difference in price.  $2 to be exact.  With each order, you'll also receive a boiled egg.  Going back to Samosa King, I've had their Chicken Biryani but I prefer this one better.  Found the flavour of this one a little simpler yet very satisfying. But focusing on the price vs quality/quantity, I'd give it 4/5.  

Overall it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely go back.  Because of its richness, though, I'd wait a little while to go back.  As active as I am, I'm probably still burning the calories earned from this lunch."
5,"We found our special occasion Chinese food place in our new neighborhood! Friendly and informative staff and GREAT food. The Alcohol drinks were a bit marginal, but we found out it was the waitress that makes them, so next time we will just skip it or stick with something easy!  Will definitely go back!"
5,"TJ is the nicest guy to work with and his staff is so good at what they do.  I began taking my 2010 Prius to them for routine service a couple of years ago and they are simply the best, most honest, and caring auto repair place you will ever find. No lease give them a try if you need auto service; you will not be disappointed."
5,Been going there for 13 years and have never had bad food or service.  Lunch specials are a great deal. Owners care about quality.
5,"I would be DEVESTATED if this place ever closed.   Been going there for about 12 years now and I still have not had better Chinese food.  As a kid i would always get the lo mein and would literally lose my mind when I parents told me were going to Sesame Inn!  Since then I have branched out and gotten other things. The Singapore style chaoi  Mai fun,  pad Thai,  broccoli beef, and Kung pao chicken are some of my favorites.  I've only had maybe one dish that I didn't like.  Everything there seems to hit the sweetspot of being not too salty or greasy and always saucy enough.   Do yourself a favor and eat here, and while your at it order yourself a cup of their off the menu egg drop soup."
5,"We were passing through a few small towns on our way back to the hotel and we came across the restaurant on YELP and decided to give it a try.

WOW, what a great find.  We were a party of 5 and pretty much sat right away.  Our waiter was very accommodating and got us drinks right away.  I built my own salad and everyone else ordered stuff like Tacos, Burgers, Chicken tenders etc.  

I have to say I was very surprised at the quality of the food.  Very fresh and flavorful and not skimpy at all.  This was definitely a step above your typical bar and grill food.  I do have to say that we were advised they were out of stock on several things,  because it was more than 1 item,  but overall this didnt impact the experience.  

Small Town, Big Flavor and Excellent service.  I would definitely go back if I was in the area.  Give them a try."
5,"I love the super size sandwiches.  You can get a 20 inch sub for under $15.  It can feed Two dudes or three girls or One super hungry dude. I forgot the name of the sub I got, but its turkey, cranberry, mash potatoes and stuffing.  It's taste like after thanksgiving."
5,"Love love love this place. This has been my go-to date night spot lately. 

The food is delicious, the drinks are tasty and ambiance is dark and cool.

We've had almost everything on the menu, but our absolute favourite dishes are the duck chaufa, chips and guac and salsa, and the tiradito (tuna) ceviche."
5,"Great place, super friendly and knowledgeable staff, and fair prices. First went there when my oil was leaking, they diagnosed the problem and gave me solid advice and did charge a thing. Went back when my account was having issues and they squeezed me in on the spot and it was like $40-50 less than competitors"
5,"Is it possible to get good food at an airport? Answers on a postcard please

Well, if you're at PHX, it surely is! Lolo's chicken and waffles are famous in the Phoenix area and a recent refurbishment at the airport has seen them open a branch here in the pre-security food court

The girlfriend and I were in the mood for chicken so it worked out perfectly. 2 thighs and a waffle for $7 perfect for British appetites and prices

Having just had KFC, the benchmark the night before, we were in a good position to compare! The chicken was amazing. Super crispy yet moist on the inside. Top class

Only downside was that the food took 30 minutes but the manager Sean graciously comped our meal"
5,TJ has been working on my cars for the better part of 10 years . He has something you don't find in most mechanics and thats honesty. You won't find a better mechanic in Phoenix !
5,I'm saddened to review that the owners of the building were kinkades is at it kicking TJ and his crew out with less than a two week notice. I want to thank TJ and friends for there willingness to help me out and excellent customer service. In addition they found another shop for my now orphaned car to go to which was much appreciated and are towing it there. They are looking at new spots s0 kerp an eye out.  If your a customer leave them your contact email and they will inform you of there new location when they open. YOU WILL BE MISSED THANK YOU
5,"Same great sandwiches, but the prices are slightly higher at this location."
5,"I'm impressed. We came here on Easter with a party of 5. Call-ahead seating worked how it's supposed to work (but rarely does in other places) and we were seated in a few minutes. Despite being incredibly busy, the service was excellent. We never had an empty glass, and each course arrived piping hot. 

The 8 ounce sirloins were a perfect medium rare, the sides were well-prepared, and we had several baskets of freshly made rolls, all of them hot. 

If this place does so well when slammed on a holiday, imagine how good they'll be on a normal day? Next time we're in town, we're definitely going to find out."
5,I have been to Kinkade's a few times and have not had any issues.  These guys treat you fair and they don't suggest things just to make a buck.  They are very accommodating and are honest people.  I have recently read they have moved but I will continue to go to them since I trust them.
5,"I'm new to Rebel Place, haven't moved in yet but signing and everything was a breeze.  Everyone I met in the office was very nice (shout out to Sandy!).

Haven't seen our unit yet but the display room was really nice.  Looking forward to moving in :)"
5,Ordered here again today! As always good food!
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Sloppy Joseph is incredible and waffle fries are prefect. Service was great and good drink specials."
5,"I'm especially grateful for this bar, not only for the great food.. but for the awesome bartenders  Dawn & Stacy. Very attentive, and entertaining.  And not bad on the eyes.. the machines are AWESOME. . I'm always hitting a 5 spots or 4 of a kind. 3 this night.  Yeahaa!! Will be back! Thank you guys for everything! !"
5,"Update:
We were invited back and boy was it a different restaurant. Service was absolutely fantastic and very knowledgeable.

Drinks came quickly and the food was incredible especially considering they just introduced a new spring menu.

A very very special shout out to the beef dish (local lomo?) the glaze on the beef was out of this world and it was truly one of the best mains I've had. 

Will return again and would recommend you try it as well at least for a cocktail in the beautiful dining room.

------------


Extremely mediocre in all senses.

DRINKS
-took over 20 mins to get a rye and diet and when we followed up they said the bar was really busy...
-they mistakenly brought Rye and gingers instead

FOOD
- the food came out before the drinks which was not a good start 
- the chips and guac were very tasty, would have paid 7$ for this not $15
- the Tostada was just a giant chip loaded with guac, under it i may have found a tiny bite of chicken 
- flank steak with chimmichurri was not warm 
- the tamale was a giant corn cake that tasted like cardboard, very dense and completely under seasoned also couldn't taste any chicken in it

Overall the decor and atmosphere were good but compare the prices and food to other great restaurants in king west I would not return or recommend to anyone. The food severely lacked seasoning and service was sub par."
5,"I have never had a problem since I moved in. The staff are always so friendly and the maintenance men come same day or the day after. The security guys are very nice and I feel safe considering the nieghborhood. They have a free gym, study room, computer lab, pool, and barbecue area! Its awesome."
5,Great prices (considering that this Capriotti's is located within Red Rock Casino!) excellent customer service and delicious food! Free refills too! Lots of seating. 5 Stars!
5,Love this place! The orange chicken is my daughters favorite. The king Pao Chicken is my husbands favorite. I love the cashew chicken
5,"Today my husband and I went to this Texas Roadhouse for our anniversary and it was a FANTASTIC CHOICE! The service was quick and friendly. Our waiter kept our refills coming before we could even finish our first drink, and the bread roll came at the same pace! We both ordered the sirloin meal with Cesar salad and steak fries. Our steaks were cooked perfectly to our liking and were so juicy and flavorful! For dessert we ordered the strawberry cheesecake and I probably could have eaten about 5 more slices... so good! This is only one of many great experiences I've had at this Texas Roadhouse and what keeps me coming back!"
5,"Service is outstanding even when slammed busy which is most of the time. Food is fantastic beginning to end
Starting with the hot yeast rolls, the meat (even ask you to cut into your steak upon deliver to make sure it's cooked just the way you like it) and then apple pie for desert. Always a great experience!!"
5,I came into this location to look at a specific car & unfortunately the sale did not work out due to some specifics in the car/limited availability of it. But I will say Brian the sales representative was VERY transparent with everything & didn't try to pressure anything & him as well as his management team were very helpful in trying to help me locate the car I wanted. Anyone who goes to a dealership can know how unpleasant of an experience it can be depending on the sales rep you negotiate with & I can honestly say I enjoyed my time here. They really know how to make car shopping feel like something you want to do instead of a chore. 10/10 would recommend coming here & asking for Brian.
5,Previously have been here before but never really have had good customer care. One goes out to have a little fun an enjoy that afternoon. After going on a Saturday night for my birthday I will definitely be frequenting this place more often. The bartenders Andi and Chris are very polite and have a great enthusiastic personality. They are very attentive to your needs. Highly recommend going Saturday nights with Andi and Chris! Not a dull moment.
5,"I worked with Todd Giglio and purchased my 2013 Mazda 6. We never felt pressured from him to buy a car. We felt like he truly wanted us to have something we could afford, and something we were in love with. When he told me that he wasn't going to sell me something we didn't love, it was genuine. We got to the numbers crunching part and that went smoothly as well. I liked on his desk his ""No lie zone"" sign. They made us an original offer we couldn't afford, and came back the 2nd time with something in our budget. 

A truly great experience and I love my car."
5,"Food: Sexy pillows of luscious dumpling goodness in a ""Hole in the Wall"" type joint make for a good time.

One order of steamed dumplings per person is a good way to go. On my last visit I got the Assorted Pork Dumplings, and the Lamb Dumplings. Both incredibly delicious in their own right. 

The Dumplings take 15-20 minutes to prepare, because they are made to order. But hell, is it worth the wait!

They come out steaming in a bamboo basket. Each table comes equipped with Soy, Black Vinegar, and Chili Oil for dipping. I usually mix a little of each into a bowl, and start plopping and dipping the hot dumplings into them to absorb.

On the first bite, there is an explosion of juice. The meat is tender, and oh-so flavourful. The acidity of the Black Vinegar perfectly counters the richness of the meat filling, while the Soy and Chili Oil bring their salty and smoky dimensions to the mix.

This by no means is health food, but definitely a nice treat once in a while."
5,"Great food and great drinks. 
Half price Wednesday is great, Max and Winston provided outstanding and friendly service. We will be back soon!"
5,"Julep is my favorite restaurant in Madison. The concept, design and warm ambience alone would make it well worth a visit. Add to those a one-of-a-kind menu with fresh takes on southern cooking and it completely tips the scales. My favorite dish is the Fried Chicken Thighs with Collard Greens, Smoked Ham Hock and Pot Likker. There are several other dishes and small plates I've tried and thoroughly enjoyed.

Their bar is also a hidden gem: creative and well-selected Whiskeys, (try the Julep Julep or Hillbilly Hot Tea), tap beers, wine, and craft cocktails. The staff at Julep are welcoming and knowledgeable. Outstanding background music, live music most Monday evenings, and R.E.M. record albums on the wall. Julep Madison wins by a good three lengths."
5,Nicest and most knowledgeable dealership I have ever been to. New car sales see Darlene . Dustin Kees is patient and understanding will explain everything with those two you can't go wrong. When your car needs service ask for Nick he makes you feel like one of the family. Best new car buying experience ever. I am one happy repeat customer. I will never go anywhere else
5,"It's been awhile since I've been to hot pot which is one of my fave activities in the winter. Since this week the weather seemed to be more like fall, me and a friend decided to go for hotpot to warm up!  

I must say this is the first time I ever been to a ""Premium"" hot pot place! I don't understand why this place is 2 stars!?! It's decor, service and food was top notch to say the least! It's one of the best AYCE hotspot I've ever been to! Everything from the Angus marbled fatty beef to the lamb (surprisingly not too gamey) to the spicy Sichuan soup base was delicious! The meat was nicely marbled and thinly sliced so that it cooked in less than 5 seconds once it hit the boiling broth! 
I def recommend the watermelon juice and wintermelon juice to wash down the spiciness! Service was on par! Unlike some AYCE places who tries to ignore u, the staff there are nice and actually follows up with what hasn't arrived yet! Needless to say, I was stuffed to the max! The dinner ended with a choice of mango ice cream or slush! I had the slush which was a nice refreshing end to a very satisfying meal!
This is a must try for anyone who loves hotpot and wants real good food versus the subpar mediocre stuff! It's true what they say, u get what u pay for!"
5,"I went on Yelp to read the reviews for Rebel Place prior to moving in, and the reviews made the place seem like a hell hole. I was hesitant to check the place out, but I still gave it a chance.. Once i visited I fell in love with the room, and having my own bathroom (which you don't get in the dorms) as well as 24 hour gym,  computer lab, and study room... The staff was also very friendly, and helpful.

** Check the place out for yourself because that's what sold me. If I would of just believed the Yelp reviews. I would still be in the crappy ass dorms. :)"
5,"I must say that I do a lot of research before buying a vehicle, and that includes the dealership where I plan to buy the vehicle too. If you're reading this you're probably doing the exact same thing. Good for you! 

I've bought numerous cars from dealerships over the years like most other people, but I've also worked in the business myself selling cars. Needless to say I know the game inside and out. For that reason I refuse to buy from a dealership that plays those very games. I just don't have time for the headache and nonsense.

As I was searching for a Mazda dealership online I ran across CardinaleWay in Mesa and found out that they are a huge volume dealer. That was the first good sign! Then I started reading reviews on the dealership in comparison to others and I really liked what I was reading. However, Cardinaleway is about 45 minutes from my house so... I went to the Mazda dealer only a mile from my house to check it out first. Mistake! The folks working there were so lame that I won't even mention the name. I left pretty quickly. 

From my phone while sitting in my car at the dealership I went back online to look up Cardinaleway again, and that's when I started researching the sales team. I read the reviews and it was at that moment I knew I wanted to work with Darlene Ledbetter. The reviews sounded great but I wondered if the reviews were real and if I could trust them.

I already did research and knew what I should be paying for the vehicle, so I sent Darlene a message and asked her for her best price. Without hesitation she gave me an amazing number on her first reply with no stupid games! Another sign I was moving in the right direction!

From there... wow!!! It continued to be an incredible experience! I don't care about the free water or popcorn, but it's a nice gesture. All I want is no games and the car I want at the price I want right away. That's what I got! 

The car was a birthday gift for my wife and sweet Darlene...!!!! Oh how nice!!! She did a surprise delivery to my wife after hours and she even put a huge red bow on the car!!! I love it!!! Great attention to detail!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Tired of reading yet? Sorry but can't stop there! We put a lot of miles on our car rather quickly and it was already time for an oil change, which the great service manager (sorry forgot the name- tall heavyset guy) gives away for free! We had a slight bit of confusion at service and... HOLY COW!!! They went totally above and beyond to make an issue right that was only a very minor thing! Thanks service!!! 

I'm a big believer in that we all screw up at some point, it just happens, but it's not the mistake that defines someone. Instead it's how they address and work to resolve the matter that to make it right. These folks blew me away hands down!! I've never seen attention to detail like this company has! 

I should also say that even though the sale was done about two months ago... Darlene still had her hands in everything helping to ensure we were taken care of!! Good stuff! 

On a final note I have to give Darlene another shout out here... She said that she would ensure our car was detailed when we picked it up, but.... drum roll please.... SHE PERSONALLY DETAILED THE CAR HERSELF!!!!! Is this woman real??!!! She is an absolute MACHINE!!!! 

Thank you Darlene for everything! You're the best I've ever witnessed! I don't normally leave reviews and now you can probably see why. It turned into a book! Totally worth my time though! My wife is so happy with her new car! I'm sending everybody I know to see Darlene even if they want a 1967 Camaro! LOL! I wouldn't be surprised if she found one! I have so much faith in Darlene and all the folks at Cardinaleway!

I'll be baaaccckk!!!"
5,"Very very very yummy! Can't believe how much food! We started with the Sloppy Joe Fries this was enough for a meal for BOTH of us! But we were ambitious and ordered more food! Wings- yumm, Chazz's meatloaf- yumm (and an awesome name!) sweet potato fries- yumm! 
They also have a good selection of craft beer on tap and in the bottle! Great service very friendly! Overall very impressed! We will be back!"
5,"Excellent food. Friendly service. Attentive management. We were very happy with our meal here. There was nothing wrong with the previous place but this is an improvement.

Only minor negative is that the music in the bar is a little loud and echoes out into the dining area. Most people going to a pub probably won't mind it."
5,"This is really good!! I really love DeZhuang hotspot in China! The service e is good! I'm so sorry,so sorry! You have to take this place! This is the rule! ???????????????????????????????????????????"
5,"When my mom picked me up at the airport last week, her car (a 1998 Camry) reeked of gasoline, both inside and out. She had not noticed it because she had a terrible cold and couldn't smell anything! Next morning I borrowed her car and stopped in at Kinkade's and asked them if they would check it out and let me know what the problem was, along with giving me a price quote so mom could make an appointment and get whatever the problem was fixed. I waited about an hour while they looked at it, when someone came out and told me mom had a broken 'o' ring so gas was leaking out of it. However, they also told me they had fixed a broken 'o' ring for her several months ago and it was possible they had ""bumped"" the now malfunctioning one when doing the previous work. They said for that reason alone, they were going to fix it free of charge. But there's more. Instead of just fixing the one broken ring, they replaced all four of them with new rings; still free of charge. Who does that anymore? I was astounded and mom was so very grateful! It was like an early Christmas gift as far as she was concerned."
5,"This was my first visit to Julep and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the fried chicken thighs with collard greens.  The food was delicious, our server George (his first night) was great and what a beautiful space it is in.  I was with three other ladies and we all enjoyed the food and drinks.  I will definitely go back again!"
5,I love their beef wrap so much that when I am not in Toronto I sometimes come back to get some. And everybody who tried the beef wrap agreed that they are super delicious!
5,Just had a late dinner here. The food was delicious and the service was great and very polite! I had the teriyaki chicken and the flavors were right on point! Great place to go! I'll definitely be back!
5,"This place is a blast!!! If you like music, food and fun come here! Just finished an awesome dinner! The ceviches, chorizo potatoes and chaufa fried rice will be in my dreams tonight. I was also introduced to a columbian liqueur called aguardenta, perfect way to cap off a meal! Will definitely be back soon!"
5,"Pleasantly surprised. Airport food just conjures up images of poor quality food. 
I went for breakfast and the food was excellent. 
I had the biscuit and gravy. The gravy was well seasoned and hand good flavor, the biscuit was cooked perfectly. The cheese eggs were actual eggs. No powdered crap you typically get at an airport. 
I also got a single waffle as a side. The waffle is thin and dense which I like better than the thick fluffy kind. 
Note this eatery is prior to the security checkpoints. So eat before you go through security."
5,"Great location, excellent service and friendly staff.  TJ and his team are very professional and get the job done.  Definitely recommended."
5,"Service good. People nice but busy. If you don't make reservation first, you may wait over an hour to be seated during weekend. For me, I just come here around 4 when they just open. =D"
5,"Went to Cardinale Way today with my cousin to help her through the process of buying her first new car.  The entire staff was great, especially the Sales Manager, Donny Mortier.  They were all professional, helpful, and friendly without being pushy.  They made it a great experience for her.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new car."
5,"My best friend who is from Vietnam and who is no slouch at cooking swears by this place and I couldn't agree more.  

It is a typical Vietnamese restaurant, nothing fancy nor shiny and new looking but where they lack in decor and polish they more than make up for in quality of food.  The soup base is key and though I wish they had fresh noodles, it's not a deal breaker.  You can try anything else on the menu such as the BUN or rice dish and equally won't be disappointed.  As my buddy himself is a connoisseur of good PHO, he is always on the hunt to try new places and usually takes me along and PHO Mi Asia is our go to place.

Service is friendly enough but as can be expected, they're more about efficiency and turnover than making friends but this is more a factor of their shyness perhaps than anything.  Still, no matter.  The food is quick, delicious, and plentiful, and that's more than enough for me."
5,"Lettuce wraps 3x better than PF Changs. If Yelp reviewers consider PF changs 3 stars, then this gets 5.

Just to clear up for those who want authentic Chinese. Go to ICHIBAN NOW!!!"
5,"Awesome in every almost ever way! What more can I say? This place has over-the-top burgers that taste great. 

Not the kind of place to order a salad. Don't get the blue cheese chicken salad and you will be fine."
5,"We discovered Tenon a few months back and ever since we've been hooked! We live in North York around Dufferin and Finch and we make the trek just to Tenon because it's THAT good! The sushi is fantastic, the flavours are delicate and intricate, we haven't had a roll we didn't like! My favourite is the house special roll, the serve it warm it's mouth watering! The Thai dishes are good as well and there's a lot on the we haven't yet tried because we always order the Sushi. We highly recommend Tenon!

RE ANTONIA'S REVIEW - Did you miss the big sign outside the restaurant that says Tenon ""Vegetarian"" restaurant??? I'm not sure how you can complain that there was no fish at a restaurant that is called Tenon VEGETARIAN. If you are going to write a review, please make it useful next"
5,"For many years we stayed away from mainstream Japanese cuisine as the restaurant options for pure vegetarians was limited. When I found Tenon I had my reservations. We first started with a few take out items and then came in a for dinner. Everything we had was delicious! It's not meat substitute as some would compare or mock dishes. The taste,  presentation and freshness were welcomed: and trust me we tested the sushi, noodles, seafood, taro, soups and to many appetizers to list. All scored high marks. Only downside is they are not open super late."
5,"So happy they are open! The food is amazing as are the bartenders!!  Love Katie, Amanda and Matt!! Wish they were open on Sundays for football and hockey and BRUNCH!"
5,Came here the day after Christmas and scored a pair of Loubs and a Saint Laurent bag...we shopped at Saks and Neimans the same day but the selection and service was far superior at Barneys!
5,This place is so cool.   Pretzels are really good and the workers are nice. Prices are great too.  I've been coming here for years and look forward to my visit every time
5,"Fashionistas rejoice! 

A beautiful, multifloor store awaits those seeking unique, often small clothing manufacturers. 

This location of Barney's is oddly always empty, which lends itself to almost always having ones size in stock, unlike the Manhattan locations. 

The staff is quite helpful and friendly and an easy floor layout allows one to view jewelry on the first floor, Chelsea Passage home goods on the Mezzanine, and Men's on the top floor with women's wear on all the floors in between."
5,"Super nice selection and sale season is brutal, well at least for me. I plan my vegas trip when barneys shoes go on sale so I can find my size because one too many times have I had to cram my feet into smaller sized shoes and yet I do wear them, I'd much rather be on time for the perfect shoe. One of the top reasons I stay at the venetian/palazzo."
5,"They came in with their estimate right where I wanted to be for a new set of tires. I made an appointment for 11 and figured I would just pick it up later in the afternoon. I got a text at 11:45 saying it was ready for pickup. I'm sure it helped that I made an appointment, but still very quick work anyway. Will go back again."
5,"My husband went in this morning needing his tire repaired or patched. The crew here got him in and out quickly and helped him get back on the road for free. Super helpful guys! We will be back when it comes time to purchase again, thank you!"
5,"I stopped by Wheelfish for the first time in later November, just to check it out. I didn't know it was there until I drove past one day. My boyfriend and I had some beers at the bar and just observed the whole place. I jokingly, but also honestly, have described Wheelfish as ""Pinterest: The Bar"". The décor is just so pretty, that sort of country chic. It is absolutely not a dive. It's a great little neighborhood bar where you could take your family. You can tell they are still working on the remodel/decorating process, but seeing as they've only been open for a couple months and the place already looks SO nice, I don't mind. The bartenders were very friendly and prompt. The craft beer selection is great. If you are only familiar with local favorites, such as Yuengling, you need to stop by Wheelfish and expand your palette! My only request regarding beer selection would be if they added Dogfish Head Namaste or Acacia. I'd be in there atleast once a week if they did.

Yesterday we returned, this time with my parents, to try some of the food. We all ordered the beef brisket with different sides. The portions are perfect, just enough food. You don't have to worry about not finishing it all. I find it refreshing it go to a restaurant and get served a normal amount of food, rather than a platter big enough for 2 or 3 people. 4/4 loved the brisket! The variety of barbeque sauces was great. They all definitely have their own taste but none of them are over the top, perfect for us folks who are not hardcore BBQ aficionados. I also got the mac 'n' cheese, which was delicious. It is clearly made from scratch with real cheese and crunchy bread crumbs on top. I also sampled some of my boyfriend's sweet potato fries and they were excellent. They also look to be made from scratch. They were the perfect thickness and perfectly cooked to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. No sad, floppy fries there! The ranch dip they came with was delicious. 

Wheelfish shows a ton of promise and has already thoroughly impressed me. I hope this level of quality is maintained as their popularity grows. This is going to be one of those little hidden gems in the neighborhood, which is great because we really don't have anything else like Wheelfish in the area."
5,"Had an emergency tire replacement and Eric was able to get me right in on a Tuesday morning. All the front office staff was very welcoming and friendly. Although there was a line, they greeted the people and let them know they will be right with us. 

After further inspection they found another tire that needs to be replaced and tried to find something for me so I could get back on the road until they got the matching back set in. This changed the original plans as the tires I wanted were not going to arrive until later that day. 
Eric was patient while I sorted out my options to get back on the road. He did not try to up sell me either! Overall they were able to get all 4 new tires installed & out the door within 45 minutes."
5,"I have been coming here for years. Frank and his crew continue to exhibit true professionalism, respect and pride in their work.

I wish all auto service establishments had this approach. They should
Come here to learn how!

I'll keep coming back and a shout out to Joey for his help!"
5,"Free VIP entrance and 2 free drink tickets PER girl in my group (that's 12!!) for Zedd at XS on a crazy 3 day weekend!!! Thank you Michelle for making it such an ease, especially on a busy weekend like MLK weekend and for the most popular headliner! I'll be going through her for every vegas trip and would recommend her to all my friends (and yelp readers)! Shoot her a text: Michelle (908) 770-3570"
5,"There is another Chick Fil A five minutes from my house, but I drive 15 min to this location because they have the most fun and friendly staff!  I always feel welcome when I come in. The food is fantastic! Chick Fil A has the best chicken nuggets, waffle fries and fresh lemonade!  Yum!"
5,"Love this place, try the chicken bagel spicy.  Amazing!  Always go here any chance I get.  Thanks."
5,Michelle Gilman was an awesome host and made my sister's bachelorette weekend a very memorable one! Thank you so much for putting us on the guest list!!
5,"The location is easy to find, good atmosphere and decorations. Server was super nice and the food taste great! I can barely tell the difference between the veggie version and the regular ones. Highly recommend. :)"
5,"I've love Waffles INC a long time--since their New Brighton location and am SO excited for them to have a move convenient for me location.  I love the Funky Monkey Waffle and usually order it as it is wonderful but the first time we came to wexford, I decided to try something new and went with the Chicken and Waffles.  It was wonderful, a ton of food for the money (four full chicken tenders and a huge waffle) and was so delicious.  My dad stole one of my chicken tenders because I couldn't finish.  We were a party of 5 and everything went well.  My Dad had the sausage gravy waffle, my husband had the eggs benedict waffle and my mom designed her own.  Everyone loved their food especially my 4 year old who ate every bite of his eggs and bacon and deemed this his new favorite restaurant so clearly, we will be back :)"
5,"I have been coming to this Barney's since it has opened in the Palazzo and drooled lovingly over their shoe department.  However, I recently had the opportunity to buy some amazing Guiseppe Zanotti shoes (on sale, mind you).  Unfortunately they didn't have my size in stock, but were able to find them quickly and had them shipped from the Scottsdale flagship store.  The employees at this store are very knowledgeable about their brands, but they are extremely nice and chatty - no matter whether or not you are handing over your hard earned cash.  Love ya, Barney's!"
5,Love this place! Inexpensive. Great for a quick snack mid day. And they have a huge variety of items on their menu
5,"The Pretzel Shop is a Pittsburgh classic.  I would give the quality of the pretzels 4 stars, but when you factor in the low cost, and quaint set-up- this place gets bumped up to 5 stars.  It's a great place to stop by for a pretzel sandwich on a Saturday, for a breakfast sandwich (any day but Sunday), or to get a ton of soft pretzels on the cheap if you have people coming over.  All in all, the Pretzel Shop is a must-go if you are in the South Side."
5,"UPDATE (December 2016):
Note that the AYCE options are no longer offered. Unfortunate, because that's what made this place unique.

---------------------------------------------------------

One of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in the city and I visit whenever I get a chance!

They have many options here, not just sushi/Japanese, although that's where the place really shines in my opinion. I don't come here for the cooked stir-fry stuff, there are plenty a dozen of other Chinese vegetarian places whipping up that stuff in the city. Bento boxes can be had for $11-13 with a variety of combinations, accompanied by a miso soup. But what I really love, especially with good company, is the all-you-can-eat option. There's no other Japanese vegetarian place in the GTA that I know of that does this!

It's great to get a break from just being able to order generic avocado rolls, cucumber rolls, yam tempura, etc. like you would at regular AYCE Japanese restaurants. The rolls are much more varied here. They are well made by any standard -- the filling to rice ratio is excellent, the food is well presented, ingredients are fresh, and it is delicious. My only gripe is that it can be quite slow at times (depending on which guy is working behind the counter making the sushi). 

The dinner AYCE option adds a few more specialized rolls and items, like the green dragon and caterpillar rolls. Worth the price difference? Not really in my opinion. Regular Japanese places charge more for dinner only because you can order special items like sashimi at dinner time. Here, there is no sufficient justification for the higher charge. When they first introduced the AYCE option, the dinner and lunch menus were completely identical! Now they've improved the dinner items a bit -- it's good to see that these guys are constantly improving! Note that dinner does not include any mock sashimi. Personally, I don't care much for it because I'm not really a fan of it -- it's impressive how much it resembles actual sashimi, but I don't particularly enjoy it.

Service has always been courteous and friendly (and the servers speak decent English as far as Asian restaurants are concerned)."
5,Michelle was a great promoter! She hooked up my group at XS with no cover and free drinks. The bride to be had a great time! I'll definitely go through her again. She responds quickly via text which is very convenient. Thank you!
5,"This is THE BEST place to eat in Pittsburgh.  I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  I love pretzels!  I love this place.  I love that they won't wait on you if you are talking on your cell phone.  I love that lunch is less than $3.
My second favorite food to pretzles is probably rice krispie treats - and they sell those too.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! I am adding some pictures of fresh pretzels!"
5,"If I had a weakness, it would be the Pretzel Shop.  I'm there all the time!  Even though the shop is tiny and you can't eat inside, there is always a line to get food.  Sandwiches are no more than $3.00 and they have great cookies, muffins and desserts.  Seriously, a couple of slices of meat and cheese between a sliced pretzel NEVER tasted so good."
5,"Absolutely amazing!!!  Have been looking for a taco shop like this for some time since I moved to the PHX area.  I must say - I finally hit the jackpot.  Cabeza, tripas, pastor, carne asada, ceviche, etc....it's all fantastic so far.  They even do red munudo on the weekends (for that lovely hangover).  I HIGHLY recomment this to anyone who appreciates real mexican tacos."
5,"Coffee is strong and good, the vegan donuts are to die for. Great location, it is attached to the Nile theater, in the heart of downtown Mesa."
5,I had no idea this place even existed. Not even 5 minutes from my house... this could be dangerous!!! SO cute.
5,"I visited Wheelfish after thanksgiving and I cannot wait to go back. I am not from the area, but was visiting friends and I am glad we chose to go there for dinner and drinks. Loved the aesthetic of the bar, so nicely decorated. The live music was an added touch to the dining experience; loud enough that you could enjoy it, but quiet enough so that you could easily enjoy conversation with friends. 
They have a good food selection which is different than your normal bar food. Good smoked meats and a nice selection of side dishes. I had the sweat potato fries (the dipping sauce was amazing!), the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the slaw; all were great! 
The girls working were friendly and accommodating.  
There is a wide variety of drink selections available for someone who enjoys craft beer. I was with a friend who loves bourbon and he was in heaven. My favorite drink was their take on a Mexican mule; made with vodka but with an added jalapeño. It was the best mule I've ever had and I haven't been able to find one as good. 
I'm going to be back to the area soon and cannot wait to visit again!"
5,"This restaurant is very vegan friendly. PETA approved. Most of their dishes are vegan and only few items contain eggs. Mention that you are vegan and they are going to accommodate. Friendly service.

Fake salmon tastes like the real deal (to be fair all salmon is fake anyways). A la cart items can be a bit pricey. I suggest that you stick to bento boxes. Complimentary tea.

Overall great place for vegan sushi."
5,"Do I really need to even explain? This place is crazy! We didn't even know anything about it before walking in. We saw the big ""You gotta eat here"" sign and it went up from there! Food is amazing, staff is friendly.. It's simple.. You gotta eat here!!!"
5,"Michelle is a really nice promoter who made my Vegas trip stunning! She is really kind, always quick to reply and eager to introduce many free entries :) All you need to do is sending a text to her and waiting a bit, then choosing what you want from her suggestions. I'm planning to go to Vegas again and the first thing I'm gonna do will be texting her ;) With Michelle, you can enjoy every night in Vegas. I guarantee it."
5,"All the food was great. The House Special Duck and the sushi roll with deep fried king oyster mushroom were my favorites, It was packed but moved quick enough, and the servers were nice. I wish Toronto had more restaurants like this."
5,"I have been coming to Discount for years (since 1994) and I have always had amazing service. 

Today, there was an issue with a wobbly wheel after install... I have dealt with the D.T. Manager for this store (Frank) and today, due to the circumstances, I met the new manager Joe! 

Joe went unbelievably above and beyond today to remedy the issue and get me back on the road and for that, I will continue to be a loyal customer!

Things happen, but in the retail/wholesale game, it's how you react that makes the difference between ""Winning Companies"" and ""Losing Companies""!

Thank you Joe for having. ""Winners"" mind set and for going above and beyond to make a nobody, feel like somebody!"
5,"Michelle did an amazing job helping us get into the clubs at the Wynn on one of the most crazy weekends in Vegas, Memorial Day Weekend. 

Our entry went so smoothly and she kept us updated the entire time! She even sent us a reminder about where to line up for the guest list to make sure we didn't get lost or confused. 

Such a sweet heart and a very reliable promoter! Will be using her help next time I'm back in Vegas!!"
5,"Beautiful store, and excellent service in men's shoes. I didn't get to shop the whole store, but was delighted in our experience in the shoe department."
5,"I have been searching for a place like this! Food was delicious and flavorful.  We have live in Chandler,AZ for 7 years and didn't find this jem  until this morning.  Thank you Yelp! We will spread the word about Mucho Taco to all our friends and family.  Menudo was perfect! Street tacos moist and simple."
5,"5 stars because their pretzels are amazing. Honestly the best soft pretzels around. I will pick up pretzels plain. Or if I make it down for lunch I will get a hot ham and cheese on a pretzel. Delicious. Typically I will pick up some cookies also. Today we got 3 different kinds, snickerdoodle, m&m, and white chocolate macadamia nut. Yumm. If you haven't yet tried their pretzels I highly recommend. 
They close at 5 during the week and 4 Saturday. Also closed Sunday."
5,"Five stars
I grew up on CFA
It is Hot Good and well Extra Good. Order what you like its all GOOD.
All white mean chicken the king of sandwiches when it comes to chicken. The fries are the best ever to touch your lips and gums. They have pure honey & they know I'm on my way so they never run out."
5,"We went for the first time on Fathers Day and it was predictably busy. Happy we used NoWait app and got seated in about 5 mins. The server greeted us promptly and courteously and took our orders quickly. The wait for the food was a bit long but again because it was Father's Day they were at max capacity but the entire staff was hustling. The food was really very good ! I had the county mile, waffles, chicken, sausage gravy, and eggs over easy on top. Delicious! I would go back again and recommend to friends and family"
5,"It was our first visit to the place. We received a warm welcome at the door. So ice-breaking. The music was lovely. Service was great and so timely. The food was delicious. I like the brisket a bit moister but it was not their fault. We all like this place and will be back in the near future.  
P.s I forgot to mention that desert was amazing too."
5,"This CFA was always busy and full of kids for mine to play with. We wound up here several times on a recent visit to our family. I mean, it is CFA, they treat you well, the food was great, and the play area was big enough to fit the 10 or so kids that were in it every time!"
5,"Michelle is a great promoter, she hooked us up at XS and was super accommodating! Definitely going to text her next time I'm in town! Thanks Michelle!"
5,"Everyone at Discount is always so nice and friendly.  They had a super long line but they helped everyone fast and thanked everyone for coming in!!!  I have never went anywhere else to buy a tire, but fixing my tire and not charging anything was very helpful to this single mother of three!! Dominique, Colton, and Sean great customer service!! THANK YOU"
5,"Fun times at Wheelfish! On a side road a bit north of Pittsburgh, you definitely wouldn't expect it. It was small on the inside but I loved the feel of the place with the deep woods and lower lighting. They have music on a stage on one side of the restaurant with a bar and some tvs on the other side. A blues rock band called Strange Brew played and they were good! It was a good mix of the food and music and the music wasn't so loud that you couldn't talk.

The menu was impressive for a mostly barbecue place. They even had a fancy salad with beets and candied pecans. Their main dishes were ribs and brisket and those types of things but the surprise item for me in that section was the smoked eggplant!! It was really cool they had that option, although I was too full to try it. 

I opted for a bunch of sides (which ended up being extremely filling). I ordered the seasonal vegetables, which included zucchini, carrots, squash etc. The seasoning was perfect on them but a few were a bit harder than I like(I love squishy zucchini especially). I ordered the mac n cheese and it was a smooth and creamy dream. Came in a jar with breadcrumbs on top and was really rich and everything I'd expect. I also ordered a corn bread muffin. Those are the bomb! This one came with some raspberries inside of it. Really good. 

Definitely have to come back to try that eggplant!"
5,"Yum, not sure what there isn't to love about this place. Food is great and fresher than many other fast food places. The staff is friendly and always accommodating to my children and I. Yes, they get busy, but they are great at still getting you in and out."
5,Stopped in at the Wheelfish for dinner on a Wednesday night.  There was a good crowd along with live music.  Our table ordered family style and everything was great.  They even had fresh jalapeños x 2
5,"Got a flat in my run flat tire. Thought I was going to be out $230 for a new tire, but Steve not only happily got me in right away, but they were able to fix it at no charge! I was back on the road within 30 minutes. Thanks for the great service!"
5,"Best tacos ever!! And the menudo is soooo good! The staff is sweet, efficient and very friendly! Definitely my go-to place for some amazing authentic tacos :)"
5,"i love this place! Its right by my work and I go over and grab some food on the regular. Their food is really authentic and wonderful. Everything i've had is great from burritos, tortas, quesadillas y mas! the marisco is also really good y bastante picante. The price is really reasonable, except i'd like more guacamole for my 2 bucks. I'll keep coming back for more! Thanks Mucho Taco"
5,The service was amazing! And the food was awesome. The portions were big even for the kids meal so my kids could split a meal. Will go back because I want to try all of those milkshakes!!!
5,"Can Barneys ever not have 5 stars? I came here after stopping at the Christian Louboutin store in search of Pigalles. The CL store didn't have my size, but Barney's came through! I still maintain that Barneys has the best shoe dept ever. There were two or three staff in the women's shoes department. Each of them was helpful without hovering. For me personally, I don't like when staff hovers around me. With all the negative  press regarding treatment of minorities at Barneys, I was pleased that I didn't experience any negative vibes at any point during the whole selection, try on or purchase."
5,"Love this place! I have been coming here for some years now and I never leave disappointed. It's definitely a mom and pop restaurant with delicious tacos de asada, tripas, y cabeza. Their menudo is also delicious. Definitely a place you need to try!"
5,"This Discount Tire location has made a customer for life! Everyone was friendly, and the prices were fair. Also, I was in and out in about 30 minutes, tires and all. I was very impressed with the manager, who went above and beyond what was needed. I would definitely recommend this location to everyone."
5,"My experience with Michelle was nothing short of fabulous during Memorial Day Weekend. I was nervous about getting in during the busiest weekend of the year but Michelle hooked us up multiple nights. She is friendly, professional, reliable, and promptly  texted confirmations, updates and directions. She is now my go-to promoter for Vegas and I recommend her to all of my friends!"
5,"If you like to watch Riverdale, then this place is for you!! Or if you simply want to go at a place that's vintage and decorative. Perfect for pictures and theres lots of choice for food and desserts. It's a really big place so we never have to wait for lineups or whatsoever. If you get a soda drink, the second one is a free refill!! Would go again but it's far from where i live though."
5,Michelle totally hooked us up at Ghostbar and Xs! She was super communicative and entry and everything went super smooth. We were a group of 6 girls so we also got free drink tickets at Xs. We had a great time in Vegas thanks to her!
5,"We just LOVE this place! My husband and I come once a week. The staff is great and the food is amazing! Authentic Mexican for sure. We love the carne asada. Love the chips and salsa. The coconut margarita is a must-have! 

The owner works the bar and is great. The place is super clean, which is always nice. For real authentic Mexican on this side of town, La Unica is the spot. Nice patio and lots of TV's too."
5,The waffles were great....they were light and flavorful.  Wait staff was cheerful and actually looked like they enjoyed being there....saturday noon the place was full
5,This place has great food! They have so many options which  I love and we got a whole bottle of syrup so we never ran out which I loved and they have the best waffles here they are so good! The service was really good and you can also customize your own omelette.
5,"Let me start off by saying, this was my best experience at Discount Tire. More importantly, it was my best experience with customer service. I had recently popped my tire, so I was driving off of a donut. My wheels are after market and custom, so they needed to be special ordered. I called in and spoke to Joe, he instantly got me my tires the next morning(There were only 2 stores in Arizona that had them in stock.) Which was very quick because a different Discount Tire told me 2-3 days! Joe called me the second they arrived and told me he could fit me in to get the new one's on. He really made me feel like he was going above and beyond to make sure I could get back on the road. Joe had informed me about how much tread I had left on the front tires and the safety information. I love how he never tried to push me to buy new tires for the front, he only warned me when I'm in the safety zone. Joe is the best, hard worker I've ever met and he does an excellent job. Thank you Joe!"
5,I LOVED this Barney's. I bought an amazing pair of Helmut Lang leggings on sale for $100. The sale in their Co-Op section was extensive. The employees were extremely friendly and helpful... Far more than what I'm used to. I wish I could transplant this exact store to LA!
5,I can't get arrested at the Barney's here in Beverly Hills!  So imagine how floored I was to receive such immaculate and attentive service at the Palazzo location.  From apparel to cosmetics to shoes...top notch staff!
5,"We love, love, love the carne asada taco's at this place. It is a little whole in the wall kind of place but clean and the people are friendly."
5,"By far my favorite Mexican restaurant for a sit down meal. I typically go on Taco Tuesdays, but I am always sucked into the menu and get one of the entrees. It's $1 tacos in Tuesdays.  My favorite is the yolandas. Three chicken enchiladas either ranchero sauce and served with rice and guacamole salad. The portion is HUGE. I love their salsas as well. They seat you with a mild and a hot (and I mean hot) salsa, but you can ask for a creamy, spicy green salsa as well. The staff is always super friendly and make it enjoyable to eat there. To top it all off, the prices are super low even on the mains. Love this place!"
5,"Fantastically huge new flagship store with lots of space and light to move around in as you indulge your lust for high end fashion.  The service was excellent.   Against my better judgment I broke down and opened a Barney's charge to take advantage of the 10% off offer.  Theory, Marc Jacobs, Prada, Dolce Gabbana.... it's all here for the taking!"
5,"Auntie Anne who? The Pretzel Shop has perfected the art of the soft pretzel. Their pretzels are slightly tough on the outside....you have to really sink your teeth into them to pierce their delicious outer crust. Then once you do, you're rewarded with a soft, chewy, slightly sour bite. Texturally, it's everything a good pretzel should be. The plain pretzels in and of themselves are delicious and the flavorings are just the icing on the cake (errr...pretzel). My favorites are the cinnamon sugar and the cheddar jalapeno, but they don't make a bad flavor. The shop itself is simple (cash only) and no frills....reminiscent of the neighborhood it resides in. Do yourself a favor and go get a prezel here now. And buy me a cinnamon sugar one while you're there, k?"
5,"The food is delicious, and they even had a vegan waffle option which is rare. I definitely recommend this place!"
5,"Came in here on January 2nd to have air added in my tires. Now I'm a girl that knows her way with vehicles, but the light had been on for two days (came on NYE, and they were closed new years....or at least I figured they were) and being that this location is about 3 miles from my ice rink, it was more logical to swing by in the morning on my way back from practice instead of driving home, changing clothes, pulling out my other vehicle and dragging out the air compressor. 

They are always super friendly and polite. I'm always impressed by this! The boys that do my air check are always very courteous and do not make you feel like you are hassling them, or wasting their time, or any of that. Quick and simple and the guy who did my air that day even did thorough tire checks, and warned me the insides of my tires are wearing (I already was aware and go through tires like water haha), but I appreciate the check of my tread, rather than just filling up my air and sending me out!! 

All of the kids who have added air in my tires always strike up conversation with me and I appreciate that. Always fun to strike up conversation with employees.   

Clean & Quick, Been here multiple times, I think there was only 1 time prior that I had to wait about 10 minutes for air, only because it was a busy afternoon and two vehicles were already in front of me. But I did not mind. Otherwise I'm always in and then on my way!"
5,"This is a great promotion company, Michelle was extremely helpful getting our group on the guest list and we had a great time at XS!"
5,"Definitely one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while! It's such a great atmosphere and the ribs are phenomenal! Not to mention the ice cream sandwiches!  

Our server was a doll, I wish I knew her name!"
5,The best customer service...matched only by their great food! I love the Broccoli-Kale salad and grilled nuggets! And lemonade! And milkshakes!! Always friendly.
5,"Ham and cheese pretzel with a Colteryahn iced tea. That is all you need.  Also, don't forget to hit up the back door in Carey Way for all of the pretzels that look a little strange, but taste the same as all the others. All you can fit in a bag for practically nothing."
5,We had Eli as our server. He was prompt to out orders and made us laugh. All of the staff was smiling too. Food was outstanding especially the margaritas!! Highly recommend!!!!!
5,"The Pretzel Shop is one of those unique places that every city has. A wonderfully extra thick pretzel cut in half, slathered with sauce, and topped with your favorite pizza toppings, a pretzel pizza, screw the low carb diet!  Or, take the same pretzel, cut it in half and pile on turkey and cheddar, or ham and swiss, and you have a great sandwich with the extra crunch of salt from the pretzel top. What else do you need? Grab a sack full or a dozen or so pizza pretzels take them home, pop them in the oven and you have a great meal for the big game. I love this place!"
5,"This is basically as good as it gets for a pretzel shop and that's not a bad thing! This place has really taken a creative spin with soft pretzels..they offer all different kinds of flavors and sandwiches..I ordered a breakfast pretzel and it was alright..as a Philadelphia native, I think maybe I'm inclined to enjoy a pretzel by itself rather than topped with a mess of goodness. :) That's just me. Oh..this place was dirt cheap too..I gave her a $20 and got back like $16 and change for 2 pretzels and a sandwich..I was like wait..what? lol"
5,Excellent food! My husband had the sushi and said it was excellent! I have some other dietary requirements and the staff was kind and helpful. Food and service were above average. Highly recommend!
5,"We had an awesome time last night! We got hooked up with VIP access and free drinks! Best pool party ever!! Thank you, Michelle! :)"
5,"Get steak burrito!!! Coz I like spicy, so just have to add hot sauce..
Yum!!

Note: don't have chance to try other stuffs tho.. can't get away from their steak.."
5,Great vegetarian dishes and can customize to your dietary needs.  Definitely worth a try.
5,"This place is awesome! The staff is friendly, the food is great, the coffee is delicious and the cocktails are on point! The decor and whole vibe of the place is wonderful. I'm so excited to find a place in downtown Mesa with vegan grilled cheese! I would highly recommend and will definitely be back."
5,Every time I go here the food is phenomenal. I have never had a dish that disappointed me. From savory to sweet they have it all! I always use the Nowait app and never have a problem getting seated.
5,Micelle was amazing! Me and my 3 friends had really great time at xs club. She replied very quickly and gave helpful information. I will definitely tell all my frinds.
5,"Been dining here for years. Proudly owned and managed by a wonderful family. Pride of ownership shows in the service, cleanliness, and quality of the food. It's our go to place when we want good food in a hurry. Very reasonable as well"
5,"We like the food and.great service here. Breakfast burritos are my fave! They make them with just eggs, if you like. They taste fantastic--better than Filiberto's and Nico's.

They have various Caldos here (soup, in English)--my hubby likes that. you can't find caldo at many Mexican restaurants. 

Drinks: regular American fountain drinks, and also available are Mexican drinks (including fantas and Mexican Coke!! mmmmm)

Not a lot of seating, but there's usually not very many people eating in. The guy brings your food out and comes and clears dishes if it seems to be getting too crowded, too.  *and* bonus--my 1-yr old was getting angry about something--the guy magically appeared with a Capri Sun and it quieted my boy instantly! (I didn't even see that they had Capri Suns available ;))

 It's in the plaza near Goodwill on corner of Alma School and Ray.  Give them a try if you have a hankerin' for Mexican."
5,"In my 17 years of driving, i finally woke up to my first flat tire this morning. After changing it out for a spare, I drove over to Discount Tire expecting to pay for a repair or replacement. I was surprised when I was told if it could be repaired it would free of charge. I was even more surprised when I was offered a tire rotation free of charge as well. They identified a nail in the tire and were able to repair it, free of charge, just as promised. My total wait time was about 40 minutes, again, just as stated. The service easily exceeded my expectations and didn't cost me anything but my time. I would highly recommend Discount Tire."
5,I will definitely be coming back soon and Michelle will be my go-to promoter. She made sure everything was easy and we were taken care of. I had the best party experience at XS for Skrillex with my group of friends. I will for sure be recommending her to my friends. So glad I found her ! Thank you Michelle!
5,Kayla & Michelle are the best!!! They always respond to your text within minutes and no issues getting in.  It is as good as it gets and best promoters in Las Vegas.
5,"I really love it here!  Food is super good, they have really great sandwiches.  Can be a little difficult for the gluten sensitive vegan, like my partner, but sometimes we just brave through the sandwiches anyway!  Coffee is really good also.  It is so great to have a vegan place like this one!  Very much appreciated!!"
5,"A great spot on the emerging Mesa Main Street thoroughfare. I had an interpretation of a Chicago Dog. The dog itself was outstanding. They make their pickles! High quality foods and cold nitro brew on tap. 
Friendly staff. Word has it a nano brewery will open 3 doors down further enhancing this revitalized neighborhood. All hail public transit, it's having a profound effect on Phoenix and the surrounding cities like Mesa. 
Lots of other good food items, too. Whole takeaway rotisserie chickens. Fair prices!"
5,"Is it strange that I like this store more than the one in my NYC neighborhood?  The one in NYC loves to give a ""hip"" vibe to isolate themselves from Bergdorf; as this store in Vegas is more luxuriously professional.

I come back to this store every time when I'm in town.  I only shop on the men's floor and the beauty/handbag floor.  Every time a SA will come up and greet me or ask about my day.  their service is polite and yet professional, even if I tried on a bag or clothes and ended up buying nothing, they still would say ""it's been my pleasure serving you"".

What's not to love about this store?"
5,"Pricey.
Break the bank fantastic.
Fancy.

I came in with a $250 gift card, paid the difference and left with a fab Marc Jacobs bag.

 Love. It."
5,"It's just about time I right a review for this place!!!
Been coming for years it is always excellent.  
The enchilada sauce is fantastic."
5,"Hidden gem! 
Great BBQ spot that could fit in just as easily downtown. Menu is spot on and the service was great too. Do yourself a favor and try the deviled egg appetizer. You won't be disappointed!"
5,"Aside from breaking a lug stud making me late to get out of town on a road trip (pulling a camper, not willing to risk with a broken stud) these guys were great. Matched Tire Rack (less shipping costs), got my truck in and out quickly, and everyone was really nice. They did not, however, road force balance my tires so I had shaking in my steering at over 60. They quickly fixed the issue, but had my office not been close by I would not have been happy to spend time there twice for what should have been done the first time. I would have thought that with a 32"" tire a road force balance would be a given. Overall, these guys get 5 stars from me. We all make mistakes, and they made up for them beautifully."
5,Best customer service ever!! Since a repair didn't hold from another store they are replacing my tire with brand new one for free. Wow! I will be a loyal customer forever now.
5,"I just received the best service from Kevin. I am so blown away and appreciative. He seriously treated me like I was his daughter. Very fair and honest. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.

I will always return for any tire needs I may have, and tell my peoples what a great, quick, and fair place this is. Thank you so much, gentlemen.

Come here for any of your tire needs. You will not be disappointed."
5,Hidden gem in the north hills worth the drive! Classic barbecue and sides... great menu selections.
5,"I absolutely love this place. I use to go to another Mexican Restaurant in the plaza midwood area and it was the only place I went for almost a year. Well the service started getting slack and the food fell off a little bit. My fiancé and I decided to try La Unica and it was just ok the first couple  times but good enough for us to keep trying. And I am so glad we did keep coming back because it seems like they've done a complete 360. The food has always been on point but now the service is great too. I work in the industry and service is a make it or break it for me. You can have the best food in town but if you can't it right or hot or in a timely manner then I'll go find someone who will get me mediocre food like I want it. I feel like we literally see every server in the restaurant; whether it's bringing out chips or bringing our drinks or taking our order. That's what I call awesome; every server in the place should be just as focused on the other servers tables as they are on theirs to ensure everyone is always taken care of. I truly appreciate a Mexican restaurant with food that's always right, hot and timely and service that is quick, efficient and attentive. It's hard to find!"
5,This hip little coffee shop is perfect for downtown mesa. Awesome drinks! The nitro coffee hits the spot and its about time mesa got some good vegetarian and vegan sandwiches that are healthy as well as delish! This is my favorite spot!!
5,This is a five star breakfast place.  The gluten free waffles are excellent and the house made syrup.  Highly recommend the potatoes.  Definitely coming back.
5,Love these guys!!!
5,"We LOVE Mucho Taco. Family owned, nicest people. Amazing chips and salsa. Amazing drinks and food. You have to try it. Love the street tacos and chicken tostada!"
5,"My wife and I have been looking for a vegetarian sushi place for like.. forever. There is one in Montreal called Yuan that we frequent but nothing here in Toronto, until Tenon. We went last weekend for a birthday. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Their sushi is delicious, so much better than the typical cucumber and avocado rolls you get at a regular sushi restaurant. The flavours are varied, delicate and complex. My parents had a couple thai dishes and both were very tasty. They said the spring rolls were the best they ever had. And the sushi chef took the time to come out to talk to us about our order and our server was very helpful and the food came out very quickly. I recommend trying the house special sushi roll, it's phenomenal! I only wish they weren't so far away! We live in the west part of North York getting up to Markham means Tenon is only a rare treat."
5,"I've worked with Michelle a few times, and she's been great every time with getting my friends and I into XS. I always have a great time, I would highly recommend these guys!"
5,"Vegan win! I love that everything on the menu is vegan & you don't have to worry about substitutes or asking for anything special. You just order your food & eat it, wow imagine a world... I got the philly cheese steak & I've been dreaming of it ever since. I didn't realize they were closing so soon (5 pm, we got there at 4) I would have loved to be able to linger around & had some more beer or finished with a coffee but we didn't want to be a bother to the sweet waitress. My son had the vegan Mac n chz & omg it was so good he ate the entire bowl! We'll definitely stop whenever we are in the area!"
5,"Went in to get the tire pressure filled on the newer car.  The guy was super nice.  Sorry, I forgot his name, but he was super polite and so nice.  Excellent customer service and quick.

Thanks!"
5,"I needed new tires and like most people, I have a very busy, hectic schedule.  This location was able to take care of me even though I didn't have an appointment and they were about to close.  Everyone here was so friendly and the customer service was amazing.  I was greeted with a smile as soon as I walked in.  I was given a great deal on tires and they also match any competitors pricing.  I was in and out in no time.  I definitely recommend this location and will definitely be going back!"
5,"Is it possible to be in love with inanimate objects? Or maybe, hundreds at a time? 

They had a great selection of sale items and Christian Louboutins for $265! Need I say more? The mark downs were tremendous and there was hardly a crowd. This Barney's really makes the Pallazo worthwhile and completes the Vegas shopping experience."
5,"I could not ask for better. This is the only car place that has not tried adding more to my bill. Not just once but everytime I go there the gentleman is always looking out for me and not how much more they can get cause im a woman. They don't try to sell me anything that is not needed.
I am a loyal customer!"
5,Delicious vegan and vegetarian options! Their grilled cheese is amazing! Nitro Cold Brew is on tap and it is tasty. I am so excited for this place!
5,If you are going to Vegas you HAVE to hit up the Promiter MICHELLE! The XS night swim at Encore was by far the most fun I have ever had and I had absolutely no problems getting thanks to Michelle putting me on her VIP guest list ! The guest line was free and went by really quickly where the other lines were really expensive and really long! If you want to go to any events in Vegas trust me save your self the hassle and hit up Michelle her ig is Michelle_LasVegas.
5,Michelle is an awesome promoter! We were added to the VIP list. I was immediately given detailed instructions. We got into XS in less than 5 minutes and I had a complimentary drink! The club was rocking with great DJs! The bartenders provided excellent service!
5,The food is great. The service is excellent. The food is served quickly and the waiters are very friendly. The dining area is nice. The decor is awesome. The prices are acceptable. It's not too expensive. You must drop by if you're in the area and are craving some good junk food!
5,"First time here, but definitely not the last! The tortillas are homemade and so delicious! The tacos are so good they will break your mouth! The carne asada burrito is filled with meat. A small little mom and pop restaurant, but they are the best! Authentic real deal!!"
5,"I love this place!  I went to Barney's in Las Vegas on my trip last week on the hunt for a men's fragrance.  They have a great selection of scents that range from the reasonably priced designer brands like Hermes and Gendarme, to some super-pricey niche brands like Frederic Malle and Odori.  The rep (Joe) on the men's counter upstairs was congenial, knowledgeable and very accommodating with just about any request you could imagine (except giving me the scent for free of course).  After going to many of the boutiques on my fragrance hunt in Vegas and dealing with many knowledgeable folks (and some not so much), I ended up buying from Barney's due to the overall sales experience.  I spent way too much on the fragrance, but I got a good one and was happy to give the sale to a rep that earned it.  I highly recommend both Barney's and Joe."
5,"Yum yum yum..... I wanna rub chick fil a's chicken all over my face! It's soooooooooo good! 

Get a number five. 12 piece... The 8 will not be enough. Yum. Honey as ur dipping sauce is amazing! The waffle fries are delightfully delicious. 

The lemonade is the best you have ever had! I'm scared that this location is so close to my house. 

This location is clean and the staff is very friendly!"
5,Michelle was very responsive and got our whole group into the XS free on a Saturday with Skrillex and a free drink for the ladies.
5,"It's delicious, fresh & quick! The workers are really nice there!!! Truly one of the best places in Southside for food! Only problem is there hours and they don't take a card"
5,The place is always busy but these guys hustle you in and out ..the ease of making an appointment online is great ..you just have to be prepared for the unexpected rush but never a dull moment with other stores around to see while you wait
5,Vegan life! Love the options to enjoy sushi. A little pricey but very much worth it. Love ambiance of the restaurant and staff is friendly
5,What a great team! Took care of us from start to finish! It's nice to be reminded of why we always buy from discount! :)
5,I heart this store. I am not thrilled with the prices but sometimes you just have to treat yourself to the finer things in life lol. Viktoria at the cosmetic counter was very knowledgable of all the products and recommended some fabulous new items. I have been here a few times and the employees have been helpful whether I bought items or not. That alone will bring me back.
5,"What an excellent experience I had with Discount Tires today! Thank you, Joe, for your amazing customer service and quality work. The staff here was kind, accommodating, and efficient. I was back up and on the road within an hour. I will absolutely be returning and having all tire work and new tire purchases done through Discount Tires."
5,Came here for a birthday supper. It's my second time here in a span of a year and I have to say that this place is amazing. If your a burger fan you have to come here. They have some monster size burgers. This time around I got the Elvis burger and it was one of the best burgers I've had in a while. I'm not sure about last time but they didn't take reservations but the wait for a table wasn't that bad considering they were packed.
5,"Oh, Chic-fil-A how I love thee. Let me count the ways...
1. Good food
2. Fast service
3. Friendly staff
4. A clean store
5. Philanthropic giving

Our two boys love coming here for dinner. We will use any excuse to come. We have never had a bad meal or experience."
5,Great little restaurant. We enjoyed the dinner very much. The pulled pork is delicious as was the hamburger.  Loved the root beer float for dessert. Great drinks. We enjoyed music by BoJacks this evening. I suggest you try it out.
5,"Love this place. One of the three fast food places I go to.

Best chicken nuggets and waffle fries

The lemonade is super good as well

I love the grilled chicken sandwich also
It is fresh all the time"
5,"Friendly service. Immediate greeting. Waiting outside for my truck, they come out to give me a bottle of water.  Feeling appreciated!"
5,"Michelle got us into xs with free cover and free drinks, what more could I ask for? It was a great night and she is a great promoter! Highly recommend! Thanks Michelle!!!!"
5,"Relaxed atmosphere and beautiful decorations. Food is just too good not to keep trying all the menu items. Their coffee is superb, only time I'll ever buy a large coffee. Baristas are so sweet and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite coffee spots."
5,"What!?  How did I not write a review for this yet?  That's wild.  This is a cash only pretzel extravaganza.  Every type of warm soft pretzel you can think of from Tomato Parmesan to chicken salad.  Family owned makes Auntie Anne's look like McDonalds in comparison.  

This is a place that embodies the term ""just take my money"".  Look for groupon deals and get a whole bunch for an event or party."
5,"We always get my tires from Discount.  Last week my wife had to get tires put on the car before we headed out of town.  Unfortunately I made the appointment at the wrong location, but when she arrived they fit her in to the schedule with no fuss and minimal disruption.  On top of that they treated her with respect and dignity despite my screw-up.  I consistently point to Discount as a model of customer service and they proved me right yet again."
5,"This is a true hidden gem! I can't believe I just recently found this place. It is tucked away in a neighborhood so it's nothing you see from the main road. As soon as you walk up to the door there is a smoker on the side and the smell makes your mouth drool. Everytime I have been here it has been packed. Your best bet to getting a table is having a small party.

The restaurant is so cute inside. They have a great selection of bottle beers and interesting cocktails but are slacking on the draft beers. The food is ridiculously good. The nachos, ribs, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and coleslaw are all spectacular! Plus they often have some kind of different band on stage. This is such a different  kind of restaurant for this area and the best BBQ I've had in Pittsburgh. Definitely a must try!"
5,"I don't go here as often as I used to, which is a shame.

The Pretzel Shop is another Pittsburgh Institution. Made on the premises in large quantities, you can also buy a ton for very little. It makes places like Auntie Anne's look like amateurs. The pretzels taste great, and taste even better when you take home a full bag of 'em to eat later.

The sandwiches I've had here have been enjoyable as well. I usually get the sweet sausage pretzel sandwich or the open faced veggie pretzel. They're both tasty faves and I never had one of either that I felt was not up to scratch. The various cookies and other pastries they sell here are also quite good.

I've never seen The Pretzel Shop not busy. When I've gone in and it's been relatively empty, it only took about ten seconds before there were four or five people behind me. I've based trips to the South Side specifically to go here. It's one of a kind and deserves its reputation. Now if I can just get back to regular trips there once again."
5,"The whole experience here makes it worth it. The whole staff is super polite and the food is amazinggg. The restaurant doesn't look like much from outside but inside, it's a whole different vibe and it really makes for a good time. Plus, best mac and cheese ever!!"
5,"If you're looking for an authentic Mexican joint, this is a pretty great choice. The service was great, the staff was friendly and the food was super tasty! They even had the nondescript red and green hot sauces, a sign of any great authentic Mexican restaurant.

When you order, they bring your drinks out to you once you sit down, along with some chips and fresh salsa. They also sell soda imported from Mexico, made with real cane sugar! You haven't had a Coke until you've had one made with real sugar, let me assure you.

I went with the chicken fajitas. The food came out very hot, the tortillas were quite warm and it was all very good. The chicken was some of the most tender chicken I've ever had, no joke. It was seasoned really well and was just amazing. My girlfriend got the carnitas burro and was very happy with it, but she agreed the chicken is where it's at.

When we went in, it was about an hour to close, so the place was mostly dead, which may be why our service was so good. But, they seemed to genuinely want to make their customers happy, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the same level of service when it's busy either."
5,Best chicken fajitas in the valley!!!! Amazing! Also their fresh homemade salsa cannot be beat.
5,"I've shopped at Discount Tire since 2003 AD and have always had a positive experience. They have a decent selection of tires that can match almost any budget. They are hardworking & courteous. They've been cool enough to plug tires I didn't buy at Discount Tire for free - this is when I became a loyal customer and always shop this brand.

This location was friendly, efficient and extremely convenient. I would recommend this shop to my family and friends!"
5,I love Chick-fil-A and go there often.  Their recent coupons for free items have expanded the items I like to order.  Always polite and pleasant staff.
5,"The food is fantastic! We were a bit sceptical of this place from the outside, but friends suggested it, so we figured why not.  The half rack of ribs were so juicy that they just fell off the bone and the mac' n cheese was excellent. Waitress was friendly and the musician sounded great.   Will definitely be back!!!"
5,"Michelle is the absolute best in the business! I frequent Vegas and have always been taken care of by her and her team, fast responses, awesome comp guest list deals for every club and special hotel deals before I even get to Vegas. Highly recommended to any groups of girls (and guys!) traveling to Vegas that want to enter any club as a VIP guest and have an amazing time"
5,"My husband happenned upon this place using the Happy Cow app and it's def a gem in the middle of Mesa. We've returned multiple time and have plans to make a Sat brunch soon, as the menu looks fantastic. Adorable, cozy environment as well."
5,"My favorite fast food joint, by far. Fries are always fresh & the chicken is always hot. The only ""complaint"" I have is when I'm craving them on Sundays, they're not open! Haha!"
5,Who says vegans can't have sashimi! Best vegetarian/vegan sushi place! I can have their spicy salmon rolls everyday!
5,Very cool and swanky coffee shop! I went in for my first time today and was greeted by beautiful live music & vegan pastry samples I will definitely be visiting this place again and again xx
5,"Yes, this store is absolutely beautiful.  The handbags department is huge!  Ask for my friend Amanda, shell help you out.  
Next time i win big at the tables, im gonna shop!
This store beats the hell out of Suks & Needless markup thats off the strip!"
5,The fastest in/out I have ever experienced at any discount tire... and it was done right with the correct psi.
5,So yummy!!  Healthier than most fast foods.  They are also much cleaner.  I enjoy using their Chik-Fil-A sauce!  Make sure to try it!  They are super fast and very friendly.
5,"Goodness. The shame. I've lived in the South Side for almost two years and just recently made my first venture to The Pretzel Shop. I picked the best day possible - National Pretzel Day - so I got a handful of extra pretzel nugs tossed in my bag as a treat. Score!!! 

I'm a pretzel junkie, and these delightful little nibbles from the pretzel Gods totally hit the spot. They reminded me of the mall pretzels I used to get; I think the name of the place was ""Hot Pretzel"" (real original, right?) only a little softer and a bit more yeast-y. 

They have far more than pretzel nuggets (twists, sandwiches, flavored, traditional), but I got enough to carb out for the day for a whopping $2 or so. 

And with that, I've sold myself on a return visit tomorrow."
5,"Wheelfish was amazing !!!! From the time we pulled up to the very end. The building is so cool looking it's sad that's it's a little hidden. We walk in and get greeted by the chef welcoming us in and right after the hostess. She asked us where we would prefer to sit which I really appreciated we did sit pretty close to the live band but I didn't mind and they were great! Let's talk about the food.... AMAZING. I got the pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend got the brisket quesadilla. BEST quesadilla I have ever had hands down! Our waitress was awesome, very friendly ! Another great thing was that the chef brought out a dish for us to try not sure what it was but it was great! This place has it all. I'm telling you you gotta go try it ! It's awesome !!! 10/10 for sure !!"
5,"This place is awesome!!! Amazing coffee and probably the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had, and that includes grandma's. The owners are amazing, and the staff on top of it! Can't wait to return!!!"
5,"Went here today. Had a flat in a tire I bought from Discount. I'd bought the extended warranty and I knew the repair was free. However they replaced it with a new one. Maybe because it was caused by a small pair of scissors of all things.
Kevin was very nice and I am glad he talked me into re-purchasing the warranty because it's a very nice tire they put on. I don't know tires very well, but it looks like a better tire than the original.
There are restaurants, Sam's Club, and Walmart nearby too."
5,"Clean.  Great customer service. Family oriented.  Excellent tasting, high quality food.  They have a program to promote family togetherness by challenging the family to put our cell phones in the box for the whole meal to earn a free ice cream....the kids were all over this!  Brilliant!  The marketing director greeted us and took care of us the whole meal...refilled our drinks, asked about us as people, and spread positivity to our experience.  I believe her name was Sylvia...what a great person.   We do not have this restaurant where we ar from.....we are very impressed."
5,"Wheelfish is the best new suburb bar in Pittsburgh. The location is just off McKnight or Babcock, only several miles from downtown. The aesthetics are awesome. It's a fresh new rustic look done right. The BBQ is incredible. Expecting their menu to expand but hopefully not too much! A bar that serves a limited menu is great because you know they are doing it right. Hands down the best whiskey selection outside of any downtown/Lawrenceville bar. I mean this - coming from a huge bourbon and rye fan. Live music is also a key ingredient in this place. Plenty of parking, room to stretch out and bourbon & beer to drink. Do yourself a favor and check this place out over the holiday season!"
5,"Holy crap.  There is way too much in terms of selection at this particular Barneys.  I rate this location higher than the one in SF.  Shoe department is amazing.  Huge selection of Lanvin flats (a personal fav).  I'm used to being cramped in the SF location so this one feels like paradise.  Interesting enough, there was a 5:1 SA to customer ratio.  I felt slightly uncomfortable, but whatever."
5,"Our visit to Volstead was nothing less than stellar. We randomly came here out of curiosity and I must say, we will be back. I had an apple fritter (vegan) that was second to none, my boyfriend had a perfect grilled cheese (also vegan) and the employees are very personable. You can get dairy alternatives but upon request which is a first for me, the only unfortunate thing is that there are only 5 stars available."
5,"This location is very busy but they are my first choice over other locations in Gilbert/Chandler/Tempe They are customers friendly, they do not try to over sell you and even when I had an issue with my tires not wearing correctly, they worked with me to exchange them out for tires that are performing to my satisfaction."
5,Really good! Super gluten friendly with staff members who are Celiac. Most of the menu were things I could actually have! They have 2 choices of gluten free beer. The food was delicious too btw :)
5,I love the Pretzel Shop!! The pretzels are always so good and the prices are impossible to beat! I don't care for most of the pretzel places from around town but this place is amazing! You can get your fill for under $5. Plus the pretzels are extremely fresh and fluffy. A great place for some fast food. Just be prepared because seating is minimal!
5,"Anytime that I am in the South Side,  I stop here and get a dozen or so of their perfect pretzels.  Never had a bad on here.
Also, occasionally get a sandwich and this one didn't disappoint. Chipotle Turkey on a pretzel of course.  Delicious."
5,Michelle was great! So accommodating and nice :) She was able to get guys and girls in free at XS & referred us to another great promoter for Hakkasan. Will definitely contact her again in the future!
5,"One of my favorite taco shops.  Don't be fooled by the rough exterior as the inside is the inside is very clean and nicely decorated with colorful mexican tile.  You order from the counter and take a seat where the friendly staff will soon deliver fresh chips and very good salsa.  Your food will also be delivered on a real plate - not wrapped in paper or in a styrofoam box like many of the other area taco shops.  

The Al Pastor and Carnitas are top notch.  I usually go with Al Pastor tacos but sometimes like get Carnitas into the mix.  I'm normally not a huge fan of ceviche however I really enjoy Mucho Taco's ceviche tostada.  The beans are excellent and I've had a really good chicken soup here as well.  Other reviewers have mentioned the Horchata and I'm looking forward to trying that on my next visit.  According to the server all of the aguas frescas are made fresh on-site, so if you're looking for Horchata Ole! (or Orange Bang! for that matter) you'll have to try somewhere else.

Almost forgot to mention that the prices are very reasonable.  My only complaints with Mucho Taco are that the taquitos are a little small and that Al Pastor is not available in a burrito (only tacos and tortas).  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for cheap but tasty mexican food in a casual environment."
5,Amazing Chicken Tacos! Get them La Unica style. Quality authentic Mexican food for great prices.
5,"I've been coming to this coffee/vegan/pub/sandwich shop for the last year and love it. The owners Felisha and Michelle are here pretty much every morning making delicious pastries, prepping for the day and talking Bball which was unexpected and AWESOME! 

Even though all of their food is vegan it's not something they make a big deal about. They put half and half in my lavender toddy without batting an eye about it. They have great sandwiches, try the ""toast of the town"" for breakfast or the philly for lunch, I can't believe there's no meat in it.

You may have frequented this establishment at night by coming to one of the local downtown shows Mesa has to offer. They've got a good beer selection with local brews and flagstaff brews which reminds me of home. Thanks for the great mornings!"
5,Michelle is amazing! By far the most accommodating and friendly promotor I've ever contacted. She was able to put me and 2 of my girlfriends on the VIP Guestlist at XS. Then very friendly when I asked to add one more girl the day of. Then REALLY patient when I asked to add 3 more girls and 4 guys a few hours before the event. I felt horrible adding so many people last minute because my friends can't make up their minds but Michelle was awesome and understanding! Definitely will contact her again for all my vegas needs! THANKS MICHELLE!!
5,"I had the Megaberry... incredible!  Waffle was light and fluffy, berries delicious topped with whipped topping. Busy but service was friendly and attentive. We'll be back!"
5,"Wheelfish is a cool bar with good drinks and a great vibe. The food is pretty awesome as well. Cool vibe for live music good food and some beers.

Kinda has a hip modern barn feel to it."
5,"Great food and excellent service, kept the coffee coming!! I can't wait to try the many other options that are available. I don't know what brand of coffee they serve but I seriously love it."
5,"Always a decent selection of cool, casual clothes, although I wish they had bigger shoe selection like in BH but the sales associates seem friendlier and its not as crowded. 

They hunted down a hard to get bottle of Comme De Garcons x Monocle Hinoki, which I have had the hardest time finding...went the extra mile in finding a loose bottle in the stock room!  thanks!"
5,"My family and I went there last night and we were pleased with the authenticity of the food.
I had the Tamale plate and was surprised at how flavorful and fresh they were. I also had the Tripas tacos and they were the best I have had here in AZ. My wife had chicken tacos and my son had the asada burrito and both raved about the flavors. everything we had was cooked to order. 

The owner was very accommodating and checked on us several times to assure we were Ok.  

I read some of the negative comments and suspect it may be a little too authentic for some people's idea of what authentic Mexican cuisine is supposed to taste like.  I guess that is why Garcia's and Serrano's are so popular."
5,"My Saturday errand-runs just wouldn't be complete without stopping here. The plain pretzels themselves are delicious, but when can have sandwiches it's to-die-for!

 I've had the chicken club, the veggie pizza, the chicken parm roll (!!!) & even their pasta salad & I've always been satisfied! Their pretzel sandwiches are usually $3.50 (score!!!) & they have all types of variety.. even gyro!

BUT my favorite and choice most of the time would be the breakfast ones! goodness that's perfect even at 2pm. I always make sure to bring Bobby a sandwich home for after work because he can't miss out- it's not fair! 

Update:: Bobby's officially had the Pretzel Shop experience! We don't even care that we have to sit on a random person's stoop for 2 min to scarf it down ;)

**They also have a load of different types of cookies and sweets.. & if you thought the pretzel sandwiches were easy on your wallet, wait till you see the cookie prices!! Buy a Pretzel Shop shirt to be super cool walking through the Burgh!"
5,"Michelle is the most awesome human on the planet.  My experience in Vegas was such a delight and free of any snags.  She is my go-to girl when it comes to anything VEGAS!  I already miss it, hope to be back soon!"
5,"Only 50 cents for a warm and soft pretzel--worth every penny! The pretzel shop is such a charming little place that is perfect for grabbing a quick snack or light lunch. There are original salted pretzels (50 cents), flavored soft pretzels ($1), pretzel sandwiches ($3) and various fresh pastries. Cheap and delicious all in one package! I highly recommend giving this place a try if you're a carbs lover in the Southside area!

Also as a side note, they will heat up your pretzel if you request them to. Warm pretzels are the best!"
5,"I've been coming to Discount Tire for decades now.  They have a wide variety of tires available, and can order anything they don't have.  They also offer a sort of insurance (I don't want to call it a warranty because you have to pay for it).  The coverage is pretty good, and they will replace any damaged tire.  Only normal wear is exempted.  Their people also seem to be very knowledgeable about their products.

The only bummer is that they don't offer nitrogen.  A lot of cars now are coming with nitrogen in the tires.  If you come to Discount Tire you'll lose it because they use ordinary air.  But otherwise this is a good place for all-things tires."
5,"This year I have been traveling a LOT because of my job (flying in and out of state usually twice a week) and this going back in force have made pleasing my loved ones my #1 priority when im home, specially on their birthdays,  I have to get it right, perfect, over the top even if I can.

You can imagine how much the pressure was on for Chris' s bday...
So I went to the Barney's Union Square in San francisco between my extremely busy schedules to find him ""that"" perfect gift. I baught what I taught were absolutely amazing limited edition Prada sneakers,  had them wrapped and baught them back with me to Las Vegas (among a dozen of more average gifts)

At this point, I was a happy girl with a great and proud feeling of accomplishment. 
Little did I know was that he was going to absolutely HATE THEM, he tried to be nice about it but he just had that look on his face that doesnt lie...
I was heartbroken,  devastated, he kept on huging me and telling me that everything was fine but to me IT WAS NOT FINE, I FAILED, I really wanted to get it right and I didnt...

After done crying (I Was also very very tired) we decided to go together at the Barney's Palazzo Las Vegas to try to exange those Pradas sneakers for something that he would actually like and wear. Cause what is the point of buying that kind of gift in the first place if its gonna stay in the closet and never see the light of day (or in our case, the lights of clubs)

I didnt had much hopes of exanging that particular item, cause the price, because I baught it in a different state and because Barney's Las Vegas didnt had this particular item, not even carry Prada shoes for men!!!

But our sale rep was extremely helpful and was able to somehow return the Prada's wihout any issue,  questions... easy like a breeze, at this point, i sat on the couch to finally lay back, relieved :) and let our sales rep take very good care of Chris. 

And Chris actually had an amazing, positive, exciting,  relaxing retail experience. This really made me happy :)

He chose 2 amazing pair of extra limited and high end edition Jordans (gosh I was so off when I picked those Prada) for the retail value of the shoe we returned. Yaaayyy, mission accomplished!!! My baby love is happy!!!

Thank you so much Barney's for your outstanding customer service and your highly knowledgeable staff!

Also the beauty department downstairs is very nice and carry very hard to get perfume that I taught I could only buy in France.

They  carry great cosmetic brands such as Khiels, cle de peau, chantecaille and of course Chanel and many more great, not your everyday, brands. 
The manager for this department is extremely helpfull,  sweet and full of good advices :) I can't wait to come back when im in town.

Very nice layout and display of unique gift for friends, family, or myself!"
5,"Michelle is the best! Every time I come into town she's the only promoter I need. I hit her up as my driving into town and she sets up all my club itineraries for my entire trip very quickly and easily. 

She is also very accommodating. My group need to add more people day of literally a couple hours before heading to the club and she was still able to edit my guest list without any problems 

Hit her up, you won't regret it!
Thanks again for everything Michelle. Till next time"
5,"I made an appointment with Jose earlier today to bring my 2014 Corvette Stingray in for a nail in the front passenger tire.  I have had horrible service by 2 Chevy dealerships in the recent past so didn't even bother calling them.  Jose was very professional on the phone and in person.  In fact, I sat in the shop for abut 30 minutes and noticed that every staff member was courteous and professional to all customers.  My problem was resolved in a timely and efficient matter and Jose and the gentleman who plugged my tire and tended to my car (sorry I did not get his name) were outright awesome.  I am extremely meticulous when it comes to this car and they handled her with grace.  Thank you so much to the guys at Discount Tire Market St in Gilbert.  I will for sure be a repeat customer as well as recommending your shop to others!"
5,"Michelle is the best!  She hooked my group up with free VIP admission (for girls and guys), as well as free drinks tickets for the girls.  As compared to other clubs with ridiculous two hour waits, our entry on Michelle's guest list was extremely fast.  Michelle was very helpful and attentive.  I will definitely recommend her to my friends and hit her up next time I'm in Vegas."
5,"Happy to bring my kids here weekly. Love the friendly faces and great food.
So you can actually skip the toy in the kids meal and get ice cream instead. I never knew this before! Cool"
5,"It just doesn't get any better than this.

I entered the store through the cosmetics department, since i'm used to all of the men's skincare being on the same floor as the women's. It seems San Francisco is the only store that does that, as the men's skincare is on the... get this... men's floor. No matter, the friendly associates in the cosmetics section took me upstairs via elevator and led me to Joe, who took excellent care of me. He gave the the lay of the land for the entire store, was excellent for recommendations, and got me everything I needed during my trip. The staff as a whole at this locations is SO pleasant, a complete 180 from the staff at the SF Barneys. I can't wait to come back."
5,Cobb Salad was great!!! Always friendly and polite here. Thanks Chic Fil a. Oh - and the Cool Wrap is also very good. Not crazy for the grilled bites as there are too few for the price. Stick to the salad and also try the wrap and you'll be in good territory.
5,"Absolutely delicious breakfast. Ingredients are fresh, dishes are creative. This place brought me back to breakfast. My 6 year old loves it too. From the Eggs to the bacon to the waffles and chicken! We will be back. It'll be hard for me to go anywhere else for breakfast."
5,"When I pulled up to Wheelfish my initial thought was ""oh wow that's cool."" It's a rustic looking barn with Wheelfish lit up on top of it - almost looks engraved into the building. Anyway, I started to think ""I hope this isn't one of those places that are weird to you if you're not a regular."" But before I could even finish the thought, the head chef says ""Hey Welcome to Wheelfish!"" Then the hostess gave us options of where we'd like to sit... wow such a small gesture really goes a long way. Haven't felt this special since my 8th birthday but I'll take it. We get seated really close to the live band, which would usually bother me but it didn't at all. The waitress was perfect - friendly but not too much and the service was excellent overall. I ordered a brisket quesadilla... so good omg. I didn't think the second coming of Jesus would be in the form of a quesadilla but I was very, very wrong. Before we could finish the head chef came over and brought us these things to try. No idea what it was but I ate it and it was great. I started to get suspicions... do they think we are food critics? But once again I was wrong. The chef came back out with more plates for everyone to try. What a nice guy, and what a nice place. 10/10 def recommend"
5,Great food and friendly staff. Tacos were great and the salsa that came with the free chips was delicious
5,"Hello,

I would like to say your staff at Barney's in Las Vegas are incredible. I just spoke with Phillip Williams in the Cash office and I have never been treated so nicely in my life. He helped me with a query that was very out of the ordinary and was so helpful and understanding. I came online straight away after speaking to him to write this. Keep employing staff like him! 

Thank you,"
5,"Big fan of this place and need to work it into the rotation a little more often. Excellent barbecue - the chicken and pulled pork are standouts. Great drink selection and a few clever, high end cocktails. Super country vibe, which is great if you're into that. Friendly staff. Sweet potato fries and whatever they give you to dip them in are awesome. Also recommend the pulled pork nachos."
5,"First time at XS for their Night Swim and Michelle hooked it up! Came to Encore, got in line, and got drink tickets on top on free entrance. Had a lot of fun! Will definitely be using her for future Night Swims! Thanks Michelle for responding so fast and for being so sweet through text!"
5,Michelle is awesome!  She helps me every time I go to Vegas!  My friends and I really appreciate it!  Thanks!  We will be contacting you in April!  :)
5,"This party promoter was awesome! Everything promised was given to us. Free drinks for ladies, etc. I would definitely use them again if I came back to Vegas!"
5,I would choose this over any other mexican place in Charlotte. Perfect on every level. Their free salsa is as good as it gets.
5,Michelle is awesome! Very friendly and reliable promoter in Vegas. I have hit her up both times I went to Vegas and she took good care of our group. we were able to get on guest list and get a free drink ticket at XS. I definitely recommend her as a necessity for planning your trip in Vegas !
5,"Michelle was an amazing hostess!!! A friend of mine gave me her information, I texted her and as easy as that, she was offering my friends and I VIP passes to any club in Vegas! We went to XS to see Avicii, and not only did we barely have to wait in line, but we got 3 comp drink tickets each. She didn't wait for me to text her, she was on point every day asking if we would like pool cabanas or entry to pool day parties at a variety of different hotels, and asking where we wanted to be set up every night. I will be saving her number for future visits (where she told me she can find me great deals on hotels for my next trip) I would definitely recommend contacting her If you are in Vegas and want to have a good time! Thanks Michelle!! Xo"
5,"Best Burger in town! If u dont mind to pay a little bit more, u get good quality food."
5,"After hearing about Michelle from my cousin I am so glad I contacted her to help get the best experience in Las Vegas last past week. May 2015 the list of pool parties and night clubs to attend were a mile long! After contacting Michelle letting her know we were on our way, she texted right back. We told her which nights and days we were interested in and she got back to us with the best VIP locations and who the Celebrity DJ's were for that night or day! I would recommend Viva Las Guest List to anyone visiting Vegas anytime soon! IF there was a club or pool you wanted to go to she would forward you to another fast responding promoter to help! She even reached out to you to see if what you had planned for other nights with options! SO glad something like this exists! Getting in for free and getting free top shelf drinks really made the trip more affordable! THANKS AGAIN Michelle! Can not wait to come back!!!!"
5,"I can eat like 1000 of these sandwiches. Great food, everyone knows that. 

This place does a lot of community events and has great employees. I had a complaint about the coffee and the owner called me and apologized. I appreciated it very much. 

Thanks for the fun and great food!"
5,Always Fresh and Delicious! Have been coming here for years and never disappointed. The Tortas rock! Clean. Fast. Friendly service.
5,"I just want to share how much I love being a discount tire customer, and especially to this location specifically. I was having a ridiculous amount of trouble with my insurance company about an accident I was in. Ben was extremely helpful and gave me all the information I needed to make sure my insurance gave me the proper compensation for the damage done to my tires. A few other employees were JUST as helpful throughout the process, including providing price breakdowns and holding my tires for me till the check cleared and I could get new ones. Awesome job guys, my entire family and I are discount tire customers for life."
5,"This is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast. Our go to waffles are the chicken and waffles and eggs benny. Delicious creative menu that you aren't likely to make at home with amazing specialty syrups (we get every one for different bites)! The food is excellent, but the service puts Waffles INCaffeinated far above any other restaurant in the area. Quick service and everyone is so friendly that we feel welcome the moment we walked in the door. Highly recommend"
5,Such great customer service in person and over the phone. Amanda in handbags was such a great help. I love coming into this store.
5,"I loved my experience here and I have a LOT of tire and repair shop experience. I got a great price on the 4 tires for my van plus a rebate which I can do online. I called and was able to get my appointment moved up last minute when I got out of work earlier than expected. I talked to Kevin a couple times and he ended up checking me out saying, ""I remember you, how'd it go?"" Love being remembered! Everyone friendly and timely. Kevin wrote down all the things I'd need to enter when I did my rebate online which made things quick and easy so I can get that $70 back fast!"
5,"Had a early dinner with my daughters, and the food and service were perfect for a Mexican restaurant. A great addition to the neighborhood, and should thrive.. Great price point, and very clean dinning area.."
5,"A really great coffee shop right downtown Mesa. It's got a really iced relaxed feel, real inviting. I tried a iced chai and an prickly pear lemonade Arnold Palmer, both were delicious. Definitely going to make this place a regular stop!"
5,Michelle is the best!!! She was super friendly and replied my requests right away. She'll provide you everything you need to enjoy Vegas proper way. My friends and I went all the best clubs and it was so easy through her.
5,"My favorite place by far on Carson Street.  I really don't know where else one can find perfect (not the greasy mall kind) pretzels for 50¢ a piece.  You can get real full off these things with a drink for less than $5.00.  Since pretzels are one of the few things I can never get sick of, I don't know what I'd do without this place.  They also have cheap dessert type foods that are alright:  nothing gourmet, but they work.  Plus, a ton of pretzel sandwiches which I have yet to try.

The only slight problem I have with the Pretzel Shop is the hours, as they never stay open past six o clock.  Other than that, I see no reason why any pretzel lover would avoid this place."
5,"I was in a pickle and discount came through for me.

At the last minute on a Friday morning I decide to run down to Tucson to help my girlfriend move.  All of my tires are new except one, which I had already been warned to replace but I knew I could still squeeze a couple thousand miles out of that rubber.  Conundrum ensued: do I risk the drive there and back in the hottest part of the summer while driving on the death trap, also known as The Ten.  OR do I lose precious moving time by getting this tire replaced.  Visions of burning my kneecaps while changing a tire and having semi's whiz by forced me into this Discount.

I arrived by 8:00 and I was out by 8:30.  I was treated with respect and courtesy by the employees who helped me.  The women's bathroom was clean.  I'll be sure to come back here when I burn out these rubbers."
5,Michelle got my friends and I the hookup at several different clubs. She was great at letting me know all of our options. Extremely friendly and helpful! We had a great time thanks to her!!!
5,"I love this place!  The portions are generous and the food is amazing.  The chicken and waffles may be my favorite, but everything I've had has been very good.  I don't normally like 'breakfast potatoes', but they take it to a whole new level and I love them!  For the latte drinkers, their signature latte is amazing, hot or cold!"
5,"Went for all you can eat lunch. Having been a vegetarian for years but never having tried vegan sushi, I was excited to try. I was not disappointed! Service was friendly, food was super delicious, and prices were fairly cheap! I would definitely come back :)"
5,Michelle was amazing! Replied super fast and got me into where I wanted! She lets you know what events she can get you into that day/night as well!
5,"What Can I really say about Barney's..... they have all the latest brands , the store is broken up into sections which is nice, the women's is on level 2 and the men's is on the third floor. They carry the high end shoe releases most of the time like the Pharrell adidas collection and there never is huge lines. 

If you need a outfit for a night on the town and you go in understanding that the top fashion names are supplied here so it won't be cheap then Barney's will definitely meet your expectations. When I want to make sure that I won't be wearing the same thing as anyone else or I just feel like splurging a bit you can find me on level 3 getting fitted for something new . Also they always have a lot of staff even when the store is not busy and since it's a high end retailer the staff is very friendly and accommodating

Bonus: they also have a HUGE sale going on right now, up to 40% off"
5,"A BIG THANK YOU to Michelle of Viva Las Guest List.  I've been coming to Vegas for many years but only the last 4 years my friends and I would reach out to Michelle for all of our Day and Nightclub parties.  There has never been a club they can't get us into.  

My friends and I would typically text Michelle about a week prior to arriving to Vegas to let her know we are coming and when the date gets closer we stay in contact with her to find the best places to party.  

Just to name a few day clubs; Encore Beach Club, Wet Republic and Marquee Day Club.  
For that wild night life we've been on the guest list multiple times for Omnia, Hakkasan, Surrender, XS and Marquee.  

Never an issue dealing with Viva Las Guest List. Michlle is awesome so hit them up if you want a good promoter who responds quickly.

5,Pleasantly surprised with this little shop. It's so inviting; a wonderful place to meet with friends for some of their fabulous cocktails. Will be back soon!
5,"This is South Side's gem. I have been eating pretzels from here since I was a kid. Not only do they have awesome pretzels, but they make really good sandwiches as well. Prices are decent and it always feels good supporting local businesses."
5,"Today Jesse and Dustin were the guys who helped me.  My husband wanted me to take the car in this week and get whatever tires needed replacing done.  He thought 2 of them needed replacement, but Jesse checked and said only one needed replacing.

I wasn't that happy that they didn't have either Goodyear or General for my '95 Ford Explorer, but he found something comparable, a Pathfinder.  And he gave me a viable solution to replace the other 3 tires in a few months so that I can get back to having them all on the same schedule for replacement.

The place was clean and no real issues.  

However, the wrong mileage was put on my receipt, which I later had Jeff, I believe, change that and send me via email a new receipt.  They were off by 110,000 miles under what the actual mileage was, which was 230,000+ miles.  

Had called in earlier today to set an appointment for 2:30 pm.  They said they would guarantee that I would be out of there within 45 minutes, which I think it was closer to like 30 minutes.  That's good, because today I was really constrained for time.

Not sure if Dustin was the guy that put the tire on, but it looks good.  I told Jesse I did not want the air pressure in my other 3 tires changed, and Dustin honored this.

Though they got the mileage wrong on the receipt and didn't have the tires i wanted, I'm still giving them 5 stars.  Customer service was excellent and continues to be at this location.  Will keep coming back."
5,Michelle was great! So accommodating and nice :) She was able to get guys and girls in free at XS & referred us to another great promoter for Hakkasan. Will definitely contact her again in the future!
5,"Free chips and salsa with every order. Probably the best salsa I've ever had. The al pastor is also great, and the carne asada, too. Probably my favorite Mexican place in Arizona so far."
5,I just got back from Vegas and used Michelle! She was so great and got me and my friends including guys in to XS with no cover! She was very reliable and had great communication with me and even got us girls free drinks. Definitely use her she's the best!!
5,Stopped by and grabbed a pretzel sandwich for lunch today! It was delicious!!
5,Great service!  Michelle and Kayla were both very helpful and responsive.  Will definitely use them again when I'm in Vegas.
5,OMFG.   Smoked flash fried half chicken was incredible.    Desert a home made ice cream sandwich.    A+
5,"Really great pretzels! I got a pepperoni pizza pretzel, an Italian roll, and a normal pretzel, all under $5! Just remember to bring cash because they don't take cards! I will def be back! Yummy!"
5,I'm not even vegan and I enjoyed the Philly sandwich. They have a great variety and friendly staff. I will definitely be back.
5,Michelle is the best!!! She pulled thru when we decided to go to XS on fight night last minute! Complementary drinks and easy entry! Make sure to hit her up for sure if you're out here!!! She will hook you up with the best of the best!
5,"I have been going to Chick-fil-A's all across the country and I absolutely love it! 
All of the staff is the highest quality out of any place I've ever been! The food is great, and is pretty well-priced. The prices have gone up over the years, but not enough to truly deter people, I don't believe. The kid area was fun for me years ago, and I know it still holds the same value today. They easily have the best sweet tea out of any place I have ever been to, and am proud to say that I will never stop going to Chick-fil-A!"
5,"Went to Vegas with my wife and our friends. Wanted to go clubbing one of the nights so we reached out to Michelle . She's was great. She's a quick response , efficient , and legit. We ended up on the list for Omnia. We were two guys and two girls. She hooked it up great. We paid no cover , and had a great time! We have a promoter ... work with Michelle and you won't be disappointed! This is the second time we've reached out to Michelle and never been unsatisfied. Thanks to Michelle!"
5,I have been to every BBQ place in and around this city. Hands down the best ribs and sides. Sauces are very flavorful and delicious.
5,"I had to have a tire replaced (obviously, haha) and I knew the dealership and WalMart were both overcharging me. I went in on a Saturday to see if they had the exact tire I needed in stock. They did not have the tire I needed but ordered it that same day, and informed me that they should have it in by Monday. They phoned on Monday to notify me that the tire was in, and also asked when I would be able to come by. I went in around 3:20pm and was out well before 4:00pm. Each staff member I came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. They rotated my tires, and my Volkswagen is happy again = )."
5,"I came in today to get my free tire balance and rotation (scheduled an appointment last week).  I got in and out very quickly.  They found an issue with one of my tires, which I did have to replace.  The cost out the door was supposed to be about $134.  I asked if he could give me a discount.  He said he could do about $33 and that savings will also be less on tax, so I was out the door for about $98.

I have gotten all my tires for years at Discount Tires and their prices are reasonable.  Though I have a '95 Ford Explorer and they won't put the tire pressure to what I want, that is my only issue, but I can see from their point-of-view and won't ding them on stars for this.

The service I seem to get usually is consistently good and if something happens, like it did when I had to get 2 new tires last Fall, they compensated by giving me better tires that cost more for the same price as the tires I wanted, which were less expensive."
5,This is the best vegetarian/vegan sushi restaurant.   It's a small little place with great food and service.
5,"What a gem. What a treasure. I don't think there are truly enough adjectives to describe this place. The Pretzel Shop is just one of those places you as a Pittsburgher need to go and try out and it's definitely a place for a tourist to visit as well.

Being located in the South Side I kind of feel that it gets masked by the 100's of bars which in a way makes it all the more better. It's one of those places that gets better each time you go. It's pretty small so it's easy to miss it but once you walk through those doors it's like your hit pretzel wonderland.

My personal favorite is the ham and cheese pretzel sandwich. A pretzel sandwich with real ham, not lunch meat ham, I'm talking Easter Sunday ham. I also love that they heat it up for you. If you're a turkey fan, they have those too. In addition to that they've got your traditional pretzel as well as many other flavors. You really have you pick of many delicious pretzel treats. 

If you happen to go soon, pick me up their veggie pizza on a pretzel. I've been dying to try it. Just make sure you take cash since they don't take credit/debit cards."
5,The Pretzel Shop has to be one of the most unique places in the city. Where else can you get a menu that is full of pretzels?  This is a MUST stop if you're in the South Side area!
5,"Great place to take your vegan(and not so vegan) friends . The food is very flavourful and filling. Very clean place and pleasant staff. We have been here numerous times and will recommend it to anyone. I would recommend the buffet menu as it has a wide variety to choose from.
And if you want some frozen vegetarian meat substitutes to prepare at home there is a great selection."
5,"Michelle is amazing! I went to Vegas with my best friend to celebrate her 25 b-day in July, and thanks to Michelle we had a blast! We were able to get into all the great clubs with short notice, she really takes care of her customers! Thank you Michelle :)"
5,Excellent! Great little place in a residential looking area but a fantastic place! We had a bunch of people with us and they were prompt and didn't get a single order wrong. We will be back that's for sure!
5,Great place to eat the staff is always friendly. The food is also great my favorite are their tacos. Their carne asada burritos are also very good. This is my home away from home.
5,"For my first night in Vegas, Michelle really made the experience amazing! She hooked me and my friends up with admission to the XS pool party, the hottest in town. Def gonna be contacting Michelle when I head back to Las Vegas!"
5,"My partner and I just moved to Charlotte so we are on the hunt for yummy new spots and we wanted to find a delicious Mexican place to possibly frequent in the future. 

So awesome! great food, fast service, reasonably priced, and great staff!"
5,Great service! My tire was back ordered everywhere - even online with other companies (BMW M3) and Tyler tracked one down back east somewhere - when it would have been easy to just say there was nothing they could do. I've used Discount Tire for years and this is another reason why I won't go anywhere else.
5,"One of my favorite places in the South Side! The pretzels are delicious and the workers are so nice. Best time to get there is super early in the morning. If you drive around to the back ally  behind the building you can catch them right after the pretzels are taken out of the oven. 
So many great memories of driving down and picking up some pretzels before an early morning road trip."
5,"I really like this place, they have sandwiches which are very good, they just introduced a breakfast menu which I'm excited to try. Its close to home so I'm here all the time to study and the staff are so friendly, I also love that they have a latte of the day."
5,"Best Arizona Style Mexican Food in town. I love the red chile pork plate with flour tortilla. It's seriously off the hook ridiculously good. The rice and beans are great.  It appears to be run with the family's secret recipes. The tortas are also incredible here, I get the carne asada, but the key here is all the homemade sauces and fresh quality food. It's a small place and kind of a secret.  Super friendly staff and always clean. My only disappointment is realizing I cleaned my plate and have to leave.   All the customers seem to have that look on their face like they struck gold. Not the fanciest location, so put on your work boots and don't miss out. 'HIGHLY' recommended!"
5,Michelle is the absolute best. She makes everything so easy. Whenever I am in Vegas I hit her up and she never fails me. Hit up Michelle for all your Vegas needs.
5,"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.


The entire staff displayed such professionalism, friendliness and promptness with each customer that walked in the door. Tyler, Joe, Joey and Nate were such a pleasure to listen and watch while I waited. They are such gentlemen who accommodated the customers and are quite knowledgable. The service was outstanding!!"
5,"Came here 4 times now over the last 6 months and every time it was great.
Came on Saturday night and the place was packed. 
Waited 10 minutes for a table for 4. 
Many reserved seatings. 
Very popular place.

Yes it is pricey but for the mountainous portions you get it makes sense.

A lot of families here with tons of kids who seem to love this concept and love the jukebox where they choose the music themselves.
The restaurant's look is impeccable with a 50's style (plenty of pictures on here to see).
You really feel like you've stepped into a time warp and landed in the movie Grease!
 I was actually seated with Sandy so I was quite happy!

The menu is quite exhaustive so maybe prepare in advance!

The table near us ordered a JJB Challenge which is a $60 one foot high mountain of food, which, if finished in less than 60 minutes is free! 
I asked the waiter where the people that finished it where buried... 3 teens ordered it and could hardly go through it...
Is it possible one person can eat this in 60 minutes? I would love to see that! Or maybe not. Might be more suited for 4 adults!

Our waiter was fine with me but might have been bothered by one at our table that was a bit too complicated about something so simple as hot dogs and burgers. The waiter made a joke which I thought was needed, funny guy!

Ordered as appetizers the chicken wings (which are huge!) and Chilli nachos which were nasty good!

I had the ""Porky Pig"" which is a delicious messy nasty good burger on a pumpernickel patty (the patties and sides are your choice!) with a side of mash potatoes.

Love their milkshakes too.

Even vegetarians can find a burger here!

Our self-described connoisseur of fine hot-dogs thought his bun was hard so discarded it, I ended up eating it, the bottom of the bun was lightly toasted...picky little boy. 
Also got mad about the fact that they don't put ketchup or mustard in his burger and that he had to do that himself with the bottles in front of him.
 ""This is outrageous!"" 
he screamed at our waiter and ran out!
(This last part might of been part of a nightmare I had)
Well at least he liked his chocolate sunday!

He thought this place was gimmicky.

I think it's a wonderful concept.

This is my review so my opinion wins!

Great place, good nasty food, pricier than regular boring burger joints with no concept.
Worth every penny.

Even their washrooms are beautiful.

One negative note is the music wasn't loud enough and at 7h30pm they put the hockey game on with the audio which just killed the whole vibe! Thanks Debby Downer!"
5,"The gist:  Excellent flavor, excellent customer service, and great prices.

I had a craving for carne asada tacos....ideally with a baked potato side but that hardly happens in this Chandler area.  I ordered 3 carne asada tacos (they double up on the corn tortilla, cilantro, and the best little pieces of steak -got mine without onions) for like 1.45 each. I added a side of beans...please don't think think I'm a loon but these beans are so freaking delicious!!!  Refried beans...topped with cheese and NOT made with lard (yuck).  

My bf got the cheese enchilada combo...also yummy but not as fantastic as my order.

You order at the counter...while waiting they give you free chips and salsa....you here that people!  Free chips and salsa while you wait!  Yay!  And the owner also gave us a free Hibiscus Tea- so we can sample the fresh drinks they make there!  

I'm a sucker for excellent service and being treated like a valuable customer...you could  tell he took pride in his restaurant.  I would have liked this place because of that alone...

...but when I got home and bit into that delicious taco...oh my word!  I was happy!  

If you're all about flavor...this is the place for you!  Nothing fancy...just great food.  Don't ever go to a ""Mexican"" chain restaurant again...just come here and wait a few minutes for a fantastic meal."
5,"We eat here a lot and enjoy the made-to-order food. It's authentic Mexican, and a family-run small business. The owner does most of the cooking. When he recognizes a regular, he always peeks thru the kitchen window to wave.

They substitute without fuss or charges. They also have bottled Mexican Coke, Fanta, and others, in addition to Capri Sun, Gatorade, and fountain drinks. 

Free chips and salsa if you dine in. Not for carryout, which is a bummer if you are in a hurry.

2 bad things - it's so popular, often it's hard to find a place to sit...and the tables are picnic table-esque, so one size fits all. Also, if you pay with a card, they charge a fee."
5,Michelle is a great promoter. She takes care my friends while we are in Vegas last weekend.  I definitely recommend her.
5,"Excellent food and service. We had the Brisket with Mac n Cheese and Salmon with Sweet Potato Fries. The fries were some of the best I've ever had. The meat is a dry BBQ and sauces are served on the side. We tried the sweet and original. Both were very tasty. We even liked the music, a very nice mix. Run don't walk to this local gem!!!'"
5,I didn't know much about guest lists and how amazing they can be for a Vegas trip until my friend told me about an experience she had a while back.. I looked up some promotor hashtags in Twitter and Michelle had the largest following so I decided to see what it was all about. Texted the number that was listed in the Bio and everything alright started to pan out insanely well. Our girls trip was planned perfectly and Michelle got us into all the perfect spots and pool parties for the weekend!!! Def recommend!! I look forward to working with Michelle again and again!!
5,"Tony the owner and sushi chef is incredibly creative. I've been going there for the past 8 years (since before they went vegetarian) and have never been disappointed by the food. 

Service can sometimes be slow, but the sushi makes up for it in folds. Best vegetarian sushi in Markham and the best that I've have including the GTA!

I sit in traffic to eat at Tenon. Just go already!!!"
5,The men at discount tires never let me leave if my tires are in an unsafe state! they give me phenomenal prices and discounts wherever they can knowing that I'm a single mother with a very tight income...
5,"This place looks like a total hole-in-the-wall dive joint (near Goodwill at Alma School and Ray Road).  Having said that, the food is fantastic!  I really love the salsa and chips.  To me, the salsa tastes like a cross between the mild and hot sauce at El Palacio - another of my favorite restaurants near Chandler.  Food tastes fresh made.  I had two cheese enchiladas and a chile relleno burro.  The enchilada sauce is very authentic, and very tasty.  The chile relleno burro is huge - it is stuffed with all sorts of stuff - an entire meal in and of itself.  Be sure and check out the daily special.  I noticed it after I made my purchase, and it would have been an awesome deal.  Prices are very reasonable.  Also, I must say whoever brixes the soda fountain does a great job - the Mr. Pibb tasted perfect!"
5,Michelle is so sweet and nice!!! She helped 4 other girls and I into XS and we had a great time. I would highly recommend her and viva las guest list for all your vegas needs.
5,"I went with my family on a Wednesday at 6:30 for dinner. The menu is small but perfect. I figure if you are doing Barbeque and have a small menu, do it well. They did. I had the pulled pork sandwich with nappa cabbage and BBQ sauce, Mac n cheese, and the not your Mexican mule. The pork was tender and delicious, the bbq sauce perfect, and the mac n cheese may have been the best I've ever had. This is a hidden gem in the north hills off of Thompson Run Rd. My family had ribs, brisket, pulled park nachos, brisket quesadilla, corn bread,  and some draft beers. Everyone liked their food. It all looked very good to me. The server was awesome and very informative.

The ambiance was very rustic barn like... wooden walls, cool lighting, awesome tables and benches..... They had live music at 7. He was awesome. He played the acoustic guitar and sang while we were there and I also seen he brought his electric guitar, but we left before he plugged that in. It wasn't too loud so you could still hold a conversation with the table. The trays for the food were cool and different, mac n cheese came in a little glass bowl thing... It was presented awesome. They had 3 different types of BBQ sauces which were all homemade. 

This place is awesome to sit in or takeout. I will return. They also have a large amount of Bourbons and some pretty cool craft cocktails."
5,"Thanks to Michelle, we had very awesome experience at encore  forsure will contact her again for my next trip"
5,Michelle helped make my bday weekend an awesome one! She got my girls and I on the guest list of the best clubs in Vegas!  I highly recommend her! If you are in Vegas look her up!
5,"Incredibly clean, friendly and fresh. First time here and I will definitely be returning."
5,"Amazing pretzels, even better pretzel sandwiches. I moved away from Pittsburgh a few years ago and still reminisce on my times spent here whenever I eat a soft pretzel from anywhere else. I was daydreaming about The Pretzel Shop this very morning and needed an outlet to express my feelings. Thank god for yelp.

(The prices were very reasonable from what I remember.)"
5,"After working in the fashion industry in new york city for many years I can appreciate designer fashion among the best. Barneys NY is one of my favorite stores. (I actually call it my modern day fashion museum.) I could spend all day in there just playing in the clothes.
The co-op section is home to some of my favorite designers including Helmut Lang, Rag and Bone, and  3.1 Phillip Lim having the best selections in las vegas. You can discover some of the great Alexander McQueen (long live McQueen) pieces of his last collection right now before he committed suicide this past February. (He was a fashion genius of our time. I suggest going to take a peek.)
It also houses some of my favorite designers in the couture section. One of them being Rick Owens. Although the selections here are small and not quite as large as the New York store it is not hard for me to spend all day in here. (just ask my boyfriend who has to put up with it.)
Have fun in the shoe selection where you can find Ann Demeulemeester boots. My favorite boot designer! Look for Robert. He is always friendly and willing to help and answer any questions you need and can order your size for you from another store. He is my go to person.
If you're a male I'm advising you to go up to the third floor and spend an hour or two there in the Men's co-op and taking a peak at the John Varvato's for men selection they have. (I'm sure you will find some amazing new threads to make those ladies swoon.)
Have fun in my fashion wonderland here in Las Vegas and I hope you find a thing or two. :)"
5,"I am not in Mesa often, but I will always make a point to stop in to Volstead! I had to be in the area for a work errand and stopped in to grab a cup of joe. I was treated to one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had! I have since tried the food, and honestly wish I was in the area more often, excellent! I will volunteer for any more work errands to Mesa for more chances to stop in, thank you Volstead!"
5,"MY CLUBBING SAVOR!

I was referred to Michelle by my usual promoter in Vegas and I must say that she took care me just as well! 

Everyone knows that it is next to impossible to get males into the club for free in Vegas.. but Michelle was able to work her magic and got my group of 5 girls and 4 guys all comped for Kaskade @ XS this past Saturday!

She made the set-up process extremely easy and even followed up the next day to see if I wanted to go to other clubs Sunday night which was nice. 

Final Verdict: 
Michelle definitely gets my stamp of RELIABILITY and will be added to my small list of contacts for SIN CITY!"
5,"Thumbs up! The food was great, the service was amazing and the food came in a timely manner."
5,Great place. I got used to crappy service in other states and they really blew me away here. I can't believe that people work so hard but it's refreshing. If I'm ever in the area and need tires I will definitely hit these guys up.
5,"I love this place ! I could eat there everyday... The staff is very friendly and always makes sure you are satisfied.
P.s: notice that employees can't say ""your welcome"" instead they say "" my pleasure "". Lol"
5,Kayla is amazing! It was my first time going to Vegas this weekend and she kept me updated with all the Vegas clubs. My group got in the clubs quick and girls get free drink tickets!! Thanks for making my first Vegas trip memorable!!
5,The food is super tasty! I made my own waffle + it was cooked to perfection! I also really liked the coffee. The wait staff was friendly and even let us stay past closing to finish our coffee + order dessert without making us feel rushed or rude. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!
5,"I drove from the Ahwatukee, West Chandler area for 12 minutes to check this little place out. I was wanting to eat real street tacos and there is none of those in Ahwatukee or West Chandler only in Phoenix, Mesa and stuff like that.  Well,  I LOVED THIS LITTLE PLACE, nothing fancy, simple, good service, free chips and salsa.  Street tacos are amazing (soft tacos)   I'm coming back again."
5,"I love this stalwart neighborhood pretzel shop that seems to have been pumping out delicious pretzels forever and ever. 

Whenever I know I'll be out for most of the day and want to pick up something quick and hardy to keep me going thru mid afternoon, I'll do a drive by and pick up one of their delicious pretzel sandwiches (filled with turkey, meatball, hot or sweet sausage options) or an equally delicious hot dog filled pretzel, a carton of turners iced tea and a sweet pretzel or gob for a little sweet treat and call it done. 

It opens early (before I am usually up) and closes at 5 so the earlier you get there the better for fresh hot pretzels."
5,"This is a Chandler gem, hosting authentic Mexican flavors and dishes. Tacos , rice beans, all the real deal when it comes to home-style cuisine"
5,"I can't afford the clothes but it doesn't stop me from appreciating them, they are gorgeous.  The staff wasn't snooty, they were chatty and sociable, knowing I wasn't going t buy anything.  Robin, in the fragrance department, was very helpful and kind.  I liked the Frederic Malle perfume but it didn't last long me.  I appreciate that I got a sample so I knew that before spending the money on it.  It's a beautiful store with very nice staff.  Totally not what I was expecting.  I thought I was going to feel very out of place and silly, that wasn't my experience at all."
5,"Just to start this review off, I have never seen a company so devoted to its customers. I have been going to this location for 5 years and have never once been disappointed! 

About 2 months ago, I took one of my cars in to get the tires changed. It was extremely late and I felt bad. Joe welcomed me in without hesitation and quoted me on brand new tread. About 20 minutes into waiting, he came to me in the waiting room telling me that the back tires were a different size and that normally the price would be quite a bit higher. Instead Joe apologized for the mistake and ate up the cost. 

About 5 days ago, my tire pressure light came on. Being the busy guy I am, it's hard to get into the shop. On Saturday, I was able to stop by the store and although they were extremely busy, they assured me they would have the car complete within 45 minutes. After going to lunch and coming back, the car was sitting out front waiting for me. The rep said they had found a nail, repaired the tire and was free. 

This kind of service is hard to find in an age where companies push customers in and out. For this, I will always be a loyal customer. Keep up the great work!"
5,Love this breakfast place! Their waffles are delish and servers are fast! My fave breakfast spot in North Hills.
5,Very good food. But sort of pricey. First time here and had delightful service. The gentleman that waited our table was very nice and quick. Lovely experience!
5,"Well, i went to EDC in las vegas this year and it was awesome, i was looking to go to a pool party and then i met michelle, she told me she could get me into funkagenda's pool party for $15 which was a $275 value, and i immediately accepted. When I got to the Palms (since it was in the Palms Casino pool) The cashier told me it was for Free since i was on the guest list. Had a great time, cant thank her enough, i even got to talk to the DJ, it was awesome!"
5,"The wings!!!!! Soooo good! Really cool place. The design outside and in is very unique. I normally hate being at a small bar with live music, but the singer and the guitar were the perfect level and not too loud that you couldn't have a conversation. The homemade BBQ sauces were the best! Brisket bomb. Burger bomb."
5,"I went here with a friend today and it was delicious & amazing. I have not eaten at a ""wow"" place in a while where every bite was to be savored. Even the drink I had was equally amazing.
I got the opal grilled cheese sandwich. Everything served is vegan which I love, although they do have regular cheese if that's the preference. I just tried the vegan, and I cannot get over how good it was. I love a solid grilled cheese place, and this one is close to me so I will definitely come again. 
I also tried the ""Pick me up"" drink (good name) which perfectly served it's purpose, that was also excellent.

The design/area was cool and dimly lit. It was a Sat night so you could also hear the show playing next door which I liked as it added to the scene."
5,Michele is awesome and has helped me every time I've come to Vegas. She always gets us on the XS guest list and any other club we want she refers us to the people we need to contact for them. Texts back immediately and very helpful!
5,Reminds me of Texas Mexican food. The chorizo is amazing and the service is quick. Order the queso along with a corona when you sit down and take advantage of Taco Tuesday ($1 tacos). You will not be disappointed.
5,"'My pleasure' is something you will consistently hear at this location, and so do I take great pleasure in devouring everything on their menu from the chicken strips to the grilled chicken bites, and chicken tortilla soup.

What makes their fast food concept so special? The chicken. It is so juicy and fresh.   Even the breaded entrees are not overshadowed by the hard and crusty layers of breading other ff chains glob on - on efforts to save on the protein. Here you get generous portions, each one delivering taste and freshness. Especially the grilled chicken has a tooth some and juicy flavor.

What u love most about the sides? Kiddos get a plethora of fruit in a fruit cup ranging from crisp apples and blueberries to tangy sweet mandarins.

The lemonade virtually tastes like a fresh squeezed lemon with simple syrup and I am consumed by how amazing it tastes.

The most terrific thing? It is so kid friendly that twice a month they have an hour or so of activities for kids. These include a scavenger hunt or art contests, art projects, face painting, and more. The wow factor is that is is absolutely free.

The staff are consistently friendly and engaging, they even bring your order to the table.

I come her about twice a month with my girls, my 5 year old asks to go every day! 

And yes, as far as fast food goes, they can't do any better."
5,"I Love the food, the place is comfy, parking is free and it is in close to uptown!"
5,"If you like good authentic Mexican food, this is the place!
Great service too!
They also make a great jalapeño margarita, which I love!"
5,"Michelle is fabulous! I've used her on two separate trips to Vegas and she's nice, easy to work with, and doesn't hassle you. I feel like reaching out to promoters can be on par with reaching out to drug dealers...it feels skeevy and uncomfortable. But Michelle is so nice, it feels like talking to a friend with all the right connections in Vegas!"
5,Burgers & fries to die for. Piled on goodies. Root beer floats. Ice cream if you have room.
5,"Five star experience thanks to Justin! There was a nail in my tire and I made an appointment to have it removed. I arrived a half an hour early for my appointment, and was helped immediately by Justin, despite the large crowd. 

I had been dreading the wait and the threat of an aggressive upsell. That is the opposite of what I received! Justin was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful from the start -- he even suggested that he go out and look at the tire with his tools before making me wait for the entire team to give it a once over. So we went to my car and he worked very hard to remove the nail himself. He informed me there was no air leakage and therefore no reason to wait -- I was free to go. Woohoo! 

Justin looked over my tires and gave me an honest assessment of when I would need new ones; but at no time did I feel pressured to make a purchase. The nail removal service was free, and I will always be thankful. Justin volunteered to go out into the parking lot at high noon on a hot day and pre-check my tire, just to ensure I would not need to wait. Great service! Thank you so much."
5,"This place has a very southern vibe. On a Saturday nite you can find good live music and good bbq. The brisket is awesome. The whiskey and scotch selection are extensive. Nice craft beer list too. Never made it to dessert, but I bet it would be good too."
5,"The guys here are always awesome. I've dealt with Jazz and Joey and both were very helpful. The boys in the pit got my destroyed tires and spare repaired and rotated very quickly. I highly recommend this location. Thanks guys, Nick"
5,"I work in the area so I come to Volstead often and I am grateful for a place to have meetings and grab a bite that impresses every time. The atmosphere itself is cool and comfortable, especially on that rare Arizona rainy day. Volstead has that classic coffee shop feel with a bit of that trendy vibe added in. 

Their coffee is on point and definitely will pick you up. I get the house-made toddy, sometimes regular, sometimes lavender. Yum! The food is all vegan and it definitely doesn't taste like it. It's amazing. They do a great job of making what should taste like nothing, taste delicious. I'm not a vegan so I don't go out of my way to find vegan joints, but I really do enjoy all of their sandwich options immensely, especially the Squaker Texas Ranger. They even offer a unique selection of cocktails and craft brews and ciders. 

The place is clean and friendly. All of their staff is really nice. The bathrooms are always clean and stocked which is a huge deal to me. 

All in all, it's one of my favorite places to go to meet a colleague or a friend or just grab a bite."
5,Awesome place. I loved their food and the drinks are to die for!!! I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
5,"Been coming to much taco for about 12 years, it's my favorite place for a carne asada burrito. The free chips and salsa are fresh and delicious. I usually get the lime juice when they have it, but their horchata is good too."
5,"Ok,this place is amazing!If you had a stomach ache before,(which I did),I never got one for 2 WHOLE YEARS!!!!And don't get me started on the chicken deluxe...

They have everything from Soup to chicken to sandwiches to salads to you get the point...And they have also a lot of dressing choices,hot sauce,ketchup,ranch,etc.I also want to tell you about their Chick-Fil-A sauce..If you like eccentric/Unusual sauces,it's good.I think many
Would like it either way..

Overall I rate 5 stars.Now,this is ""Overated Review"" but Food is good,not to greasy,AMAZINGLY customer support,and CLEAN restrooms.They also clean every table when the person leaves,and another clean every 5 minutes,so there's that.And the Play Area,(not
5),but I can tell it's amazing,EVERY kid wants to go there,and from the looks of it,it's clean!The drive thru also serves the Best Drive Thru food,and it's exactly if you were to go inside!Also,The cashiers say words like ""Your Welcome"" and have a positive smile that you can't resist!"
5,"Michelle is the MVP! She responded quickly and made sure my party was properly accommodated.

Michelle got 6 of us into Kaskade at XS last night for FREE and even got our girls free drink tickets! Made my Vegas trip that much more amazing!"
5,"The ""salmon"" sushi is amazing. The portions were very big and everything was fresh. I wish I had known about this restaurant before. It's kid-approved too. We're already looking forward to coming back."
5,"Home cooking for sure and super delicious!!!  Not the best of areas, but you won't be even notice after your taste-buds are whisked away to Grandma's House.  We go here once a week at least.  Super affordable, super yummy and super friendly!  Like being at home without having to cook!!!  ps....the chili rellenos are to die for...I order 2 with green sauce and a side of beans....it's the BOMB!  Carnitas tacos is also a weekly favorite!"
5,Terrific store huge selection of everything great customer service i came looking for a new celine and was helped very quickly. They had alot more displayed than the actual store in crystals (i had to go to both) made a very nice buying experience
5,I like this place came here while waiting for a concert. Good chai and it's not super packed with hipsters like most coffee places.
5,"I have been a customer of Discount Tire Center on Market Street in Gilbert for a couple of years now, and I love them. Their customer service is superb. Bought a set of 4 new Micheline tires from them in April. Unexpectedly, one of the tires blown out. I brought the car to them, and they replaced a brand new tire in less than 30 minutes, no question aksed. Not an hour and a half to two hours like other places. They are genuinely care about their customers and very friendly. My wife used to bring her car to a nearby Costco for tire service. Now she is a Discount Tire member. Good work guys!"
5,Michelle was awesome! My friends and I went to Vegas during the weekend of the fight for a bachelorette party. As im sure you could assume it was the busiest weekend. BUT - she managed to get us into XS to see David Guetta. My friends and I had two comp drinks each. It was amazing and the bride was happy. Also she gave me another great contact who hooked us up at Omnia the next night. I will always use Michelle for any Vegas needs.
5,Michelle is AMAZING! I wish I could do more for her than just this Yelp review! This was my second time using her and she got my friends and I into Xs which was great! And then Omnia which had Afro jack as the head liner so the line literally wrapped around the building outside!! And we just walked right past everyone and got in for free on both nights! We even had a guy with us and it was no problem. I plan to use her again in July! Thanks again Michelle!
5,"Best breakfast in Wexford! Sausage gravy will never be the same. Bennys? Killer! Potatoes completely reimagined. And even roast tomatoes on the side. I was loving it all. To top it off, the coffee was robust and flavorful. Try a latte or two..."
5,"You have to come off the main road to find this place, and if you do it will sooo be worth it. Smoked meats including chicken and salmon along with red meat are served straight up with a veg, on a salad, or in a sandwich. The beet salad with chicken and the chicken with a side of veg are two of my favorite things to order. Pair that with a cool new-rustic atmosphere and regular acoustic bands and this place will have you sneaking out of the sea of chain restaurants and into your favorite new place. Love it!!!"
5,Michelle the promoter hooked us up all weekend!! We were a big group of 15 and she got us in to all the hot spots! Defiantly referring her to everyone!! Thanks for making our weekend an unforgettable one Michelle!!!!
5,This location is always clean and the staff is friendly. I visit here when the truck is being serviced next door. The same team always seem to be working the front as well. Pristine both for food and experience!
5,"Ariana took care of our group and could not have asked for better service. We had an amazing time and the food and drinks were on point. A great local that is worth checking out.

The ambiance could use a bulb or two turned off. Its a little aggressive. Lighting like a grow house."
5,"I have some great experiance of food from Mucho Taco.  I ordered a carnitas taco, the Chimi de Asada, and a churro.  

After I placed my order I had time to look around and this is really a cute place.  Very clean, and I like the décor on the walls and the painted tiles.  It's small, but really has a nice atmosphere.

I get my food in 15 minutes............. Great service, I am definatley going back :)"
5,"I've been stopping in this pretzel shop since I was a wee lad!  Back when my father would take me in the back door and get a fresh hot pretzel right out of the oven for a nickel (think it was a nickel, was about 20 years ago).  I can say that this place is still every bit as tasty 20 years later!

Best pretzels I've ever had by far.  I can almost taste years and years of pretzel crunch on the bottom of every pretzel that comes out of that oven, unbeatable.  Everyone in my family goes back here every time we visit Pittsburgh.

Prices still seem to be very good, I usually need at least a dozen to eat personally.  Sounds kind of absurd, but what's absurd is how delicious they are...I don't eat them in one sitting, I find them to be just as amazing a few days later as they are right out of the oven stored in an airtight container.  Salt will make them soggy when being stored, but I still love them!

I wish I could give more than 5 stars... I wish I could have them shipped!  Craving some now."
5,Mike W. As a life resident of Pittsburgh I grew up eating South Side pretzels outside of Mt. Oliver pool being sold out of a wicker basket.Now I can not go thru South Side without stoping.Not only did I bring my kids there I now enjoy brining my grandson.The pretzel Shop is a must visit frequently.8
5,"One of my favorite chicken places to eat. 
Always fresh and delicious 
Staff is alway helpful. 
My drive through orders are always complete. No worries"
5,"Michelle is absolutely spectacular. I do not come to Vegas without contacting her! She responds quickly, answers all my questions, and is so friendly. She has gotten my friends and I into every club and event possible. 

She makes great recommendations and I always give her contact info to anyone I know traveling to Vegas. She has made the difference in all my trips, don't know what I'd do without her!"
5,"Have been going here for years! Great service, always do their best to fix your tire problem fast even tho they are super busy, great customer service and don't over charge, highly recommend"
5,Chick-Fil-A is a great grab and go or sit and dine fast food. It is my favorite in town. The people are all so friendly. They have options from Soups and Salads to Chicken Nuggets and Mac-n-cheese. I highly recommend the Cobb salad with grilled chicken. The diet lemonade is enjoyable also. The only complaint I have is that the kids play section is usually really germy. Enjoy!
5,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!! I can't say enough about you guys!!! Use these guys if you're trying to get into ANY club.  They actually respond to you in less than a minute.  THIS IS NO JOKE!!!  They got me and my friends (Bachelorette party of  12 girls) to OMNIA for Calvin Harris. THEY followed up with ME instead of ME having to chase THEM down for answers.  Absolutely the BEST service.  They even answered all my random crazy questions... LOL... head bands are not ok at OMNIA, but hella ok at XS... FYI.  David DLR, you are AWESOME dude!!! Quick to answer all of our questions and direct us without even having to meet face to face!! I will definitely use you guys again, the next time I'm in vegas.   Thanks so much again, the girls and I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend.  Just to be clear, we did not pay ANYTHING to get on these guest lists.  They added us to the guest lists and we got free entry to the clubs.  We paid for our own drinks."
5,The muffin I got was amazing as was the coffee. Cute little shop. They had fast friendly service. I'll admit that I went there because I wanted to support a lady-owned business. :) I am excited to try their other food and will definitely recommend to coworkers looking for a lunch spot or morning coffee stop.
5,I always call up Michelle whenever I am in vegas. She is the most reliable promoter I have ever used. I always recommend her to any friends going to vegas.
5,"Kayla and Michelle were so easy to work with.  Simple text exchanges and they hooked us up for both Friday and Saturday night guest lists at Surrender and XS. Quick and responsive!  We'll be contacting them everytime we come to Vegas (our ""playground and 2nd home""). Thanks so much ladies!"
5,"Michelle was the best work with!! She got us into XS on a Saturday night with no line and two premium drink tickets!! We had the best time and she made it so easy!! Contact Michele if you are headed to Vegas and want to get in the best clubs with no wait!! Thanks michele!!! 
Michelle (908) 770-3570"
5,"Excellent customer service I'll be back when I need new tires.
On a busy Saturday morning I was greeting immediately by a friendly staff member. I was expecting to be sold a new tire as I didn't think that the damaged one I had could be saved. The store had about 15 people in it and the wait for my tire repair was over an hour and a half. They actually texted me in about 45 minutes to let me know the tire was fixed. Not only did they not try to up-sell me to something I didn't really need, the service was completed before the expected time, but the repair was free, I was surprised and impressed at this and will definitely be back for my rotation and balance in 6k miles. Great location!"
5,Best cinco de mayo  in la unica . It was very busy it was there first cinco de mayo .All the servers were very nice they were running trying to take care of everyone .i am sure next year they will have more servers.But we had a great time.The band was awesome and the margaritas were the best i have has.Thanks la única for a crear day.
5,"Excellent dollar tacos on Tuesday, el pastor was the best of what we tried then the chicken. One of the Salas's was full of onions and extra spicy, unsure why it was like that, but we liked it. Looks pretty nice inside and the staff and service was great"
5,We had a buffet lunch there over the weekend. Very nice and cozy restaurant. Good selection of delicious vegetarian food. Reasonable price and convenient location. Will go back again for sure!
5,"I am a big fan of the Discount Tire business model.  Every single time I have gone into a Discount Tire I have been greeted promptly and in a genuinely friendly manner.  Upon reaching the counter, the employees show options and assist in making a decision on what tires to purchase without any pressure or upsell."
5,"So good. the sandwiches, the salads, the ice cream. and of course, the fries. sooo good. and chik fil a sause is the best. and it is all pretty healthy for you too!"
5,I absolutely love la Unica! There cheese dip is delish. Dalia is an awesome waitress FYI
5,"Modest, clean, cozy vibe. The girls who run it are kind and everything on the menu is amazing. I try to grab a coffee every other day and today I got a new card in the mail, I called to activate it and didn't realize it took 24 hours for it to go thru. I ordered a coffee and the card declined, the ladies were nice enough to give me a coffee anyways. I was so embarrassed and they made me feel really grateful to have a local business that really takes care of us downtownees. I'll be stopping by for a coffee tomorrow and give a BIG tip for helping me out!"
5,"As Pittsburgh as Pittsburgh gets.

Not as cheap as it once was but I love these pretzel sandwiches.

Everyone should stop by and get at least a pretzel. You will love it.

Line can be a little long around lunch time but it moves fast.

I like the chicken salad pretzel the best.

Also get a cinnamon and sugar pretzel."
5,"One of my favorite places to hang out and grab a bite in Downtown Mesa! Great vibe, wonderful staff, vegan food and great coffee and adult beverage choices! Attached to the World Famous Nile Theatre Volstead Public House brings some good vibe to Downtown a Mesa! I love it! Check out their lavender iced coffee or nitro coffee !"
5,"See Jade in the makeup department. He is so good, and provides Excellent customer service."
5,"Who would have thought that we would find this type of BBQ at this little place in the North Hills and by this type of BBQ I mean good BBQ...no great BBQ! Wow! Little unassuming place off of Thompson Run Rd in the North Hills. Our service was terrific but the BBQ...wow! You pull into the parking lot and the smoker is tapping on your nose with the wonderful smell of sweet goodness. Fantastic! The meat that we tried, pulled pork, beef brisket, and ribs, all were fantastic! Juicy and, and the flavors, wow! Mouthwatering good!!! The beef brisket was hands down our favorite (both me and the hubby agree). This is some of the best brisket I have ever had in my life!!!! Don't get me wrong though, all of the meat was fabulous! The sauces are on the table so take your pick. I liked the sweet BBQ sauce best. This is a personal preference. All tasted pretty darn good though. We had sweet potato fries, regular fries, and seasonal cornbread which was blueberry when we were there. It was all so good.  Their regular fries, hand cut and dirty and deeeeeelicious!!! I am impressed and we will certainly be back!"
5,Ok vegan sushi?! How can I say anything bad?! I can't! Everything on the menu can be customized to be vegan (this is a vegetarian restaurant). Even my mom was amazed that what she was eating wasn't actually real shrimp! The service here is good and the restaurant is fairly large. I would honestly recommend any item off the menu. I come here for lunch and dinner and have never ever been disappointed! It's so nice to see a vegan restaurant so close to work and home!
5,"okay - love this place, especially the malle perfume display and the vendor - so much fun!  I forgot how shopping with a friend and talking to strangers can be so engaging.  I am going to regularly come back here - great purse selection - if only they'd carry better women's clothing - classic clothes for women instead of the standard t-shirts and jeans thing...maybe start with apc and then go to Mayle - maybe some smaller designers....?"
5,This is the best place ever!! Great coffee drinks! Tasty food and specials! Oh Lord and the baked goods are amazing. I love the atmosphere here and the food is great too. Everything is Vegan which is another win!! Did I mention they do bar drinks at night?! Go to here!
5,"Four years after moving to NYC, this is one of two Pittsburgh spots I still yearn for daily.  (The other is Mad Mex.)  I've never tasted another soft pretzel that even comes close.  Dense, salty, doughy, just-barely-underbaked perfection."
5,"Got a flat amidst a busy day.  Justin greeted me as I came in for a repair patch --  glad to see there's humor still in the work environment.  Found out it was free and they took care of it right away.  

Side note, I'm watching one of the managers make his crew hustle -- there's a lot of shouting and teamwork going on in front of me.  Looks like they train to be speedy and thorough.  

Props to this discount, you guys run a tight ship.  New customer."
5,"To be honest... I have no idea what these low reviewers got when they came here because I received 5-star all around. After I left I actually felt bad for not leaving more of a tip - it was that good.

I didn't expect much but the food came out lightning fast and it was very good. The service was amazing with the fella working came out to see how we were doing and even offered to put the unfinished ice-cream (that the kid didn't eat) back in the freezer while we ate."
5,Wonderful place. They gave a donation to our fundraiser. Great owners and delicious pretzels.
5,"The food and service were both amazing! My husband got the #1 combination and cleaned his entire plate. I had the Enchilada Supreme or something like that. It was one chicken, one beef, and one bean enchilada and they were all delicious. Our server Jose was very attentive and kind and provided excellent service! We will definitely be back!"
5,"Michelle is fantastic!  I've contacted her for every Vegas trip for the past several years and she is always responsible for us having a spectacular time!  If we don't have any plans, she has great recommendations too!  She's even suggested great room rates if we decided to extend our stay. Thanks Michelle for always making sure we have a great time!  You are my go to!!"
5,The guys were amazing. I made an appointment to get my tire inspect and 45 minutes later I walked out with a patched tire and no charge. I have nothing but good things to say and will be coming back if I encounter any more issues.
5,"Delicious! We got the chicken and waffles, the sausage and gravy, and the veggie omelet. Everything was so delicious! They have 3 different syrups: vanilla bean, bourbon barrel, and regular. They are all to die for!"
5,"I love Barneys.  The service and decor are excellent!  It's modern, clean and the layout is conducive to a huge shopping spree.  Unfortunately I can't afford anything in the store, so I just steal...

Steal IDEAS that is! (No need to call the Barney five o).

Since Barneys usually carries new designers and is the cutting edge of new fashion, I often try to get ideas there.  What is the new look for this season?  Well I am wondering that myself since I'm fashion challenged.  Honestly,  I need all the help I can get.  

Well Barneys has the best selection of designer jeans and shoes... Christian Louboutin is the hottest thing, but really, who can pay $700 for a pair of shoes?"
5,Michelle is one of the best promoters Ive worked with in Vegas.  Ive been there twice this year and she has never failed to get me and my girlfriends on the guestlists. I definitely will work with her whenever Im in Vegas.
5,"Good vegan food and drinks!! Coffee or alcohol, how can you go wrong!"
5,The Philly is awesome!  I wish this place was closer to where I live or work.  Very friendly service.
5,I had a good burger with a bacon poutine! So good! I will say is a must go when you want a good burger for a good price! Burger with fries starts at 6.95$ so cheaper than macdonals
5,The food was delicious. So many different options on the menu it's hard to decide what to get. I do recommend looking on Nowait to get yourself in line before you head there
5,Such a great local place in the North Hills. Good drinks and also the BBQ food is impressive.  Also happy to say that they support local music.
5,"Great place!  Amazing service and very tasty food.  Some plates do not have mega portions if that's what you're looking for, but I always leave feeling filled.  I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for some authentic Mexican food!  Muy delicioso!!"
5,"Cheap, great food, family owned, wonderful employees.  The service is always with a smile.  The daily specials are great and they are conveniently located with extended business hours!"
5,Kayla was super helpful getting all the ladies in for free and free drinks! So helpful for such high demand clubs :)
5,Best pretzels in Pittsburgh! They use an Old World recipe and bake the pretzels in a traditional open hearth brick oven. Be sure to get some pretzels after they come out of the oven and are still warm - so good!
5,Beautiful establishment with delicious food- I was recommend to get the Squawker Texas Ranger... i was not disappointed. Perfect place for vegan options. I look forward to my next trip
5,"Joe M. and his team are awesome!  Full set of tires, they set my appointment,  job complete when they said it would be!   I observed the busy Saturday business.  All of the team were professionals,  courteous and genuine with their clients.  Seemed like the team in the garage were having a good day!   Appreciated the positive attitudes!   This is the ONLY PLACE to get your tires and service!"
5,"Best pretzels I have ever had.  Great old school spot.  If you really want then fresh out of the oven, head to the rear entrance on Carey Way early in the morning like my grandpap used to.   Don't yinz bring no credit cards!"
5,"Vegetarian heaven! I've never come across so many menu options I can decide from - usually there's only ever a handful of vegetarian options but this place has a huge variety. We ordered different varieties of sweet potato and avocado rolls with beef skewers, chicken teriyaki and pad Thai. Every single item we had was absolutely delicious! Each item was uniquely seasoned and tasted amazing!! I would highly recommend the tempura yam roll. Service was great, lovely interior, tea on arrival and great value for $$$!"
5,I am so impressed with the patience and kindness of the workers at Chick-fil-A. They are always so nice and proactive with getting you what you need. It is a parent's dream - the play place is awesome and I can get a Diet Lemonade and sit in the booth and watch my 3 year old play. The salads are fresh and delicious. The kids meals are great and I really appreciate the toy which is always educational and interactive.
5,"SO!!!  I usually NEVER EVER shop at this store, in my experience it's usually filled with lazy, rude, and quite ignorant employees... But my wife likes the perfume you sale so I was forced to suck it up and go in.... I was first greeted by this very beautiful and outgoing girl named Jennifer who's makeup looked so professional and yet colorful too! i was somewhat taken aback, But in a good way. She was extremely knowledgable and helpful. She should be given a promotion so that she can train the rest of the employees. She and she alone are why my wife and i will be happy to continue shopping at Barney's."
5,"Best street tacos I've found in the east valley!! Delicious meats, perfect spicing, fresh tortillas and great salsa!"
5,"This is a true gem that is sure to do well.  New cafe in Downtown Mesa.  This place has something for everybody: Coffee, great food, beverages for the 21+ folk and a super sweet vibe.  Staff was very friendly when I came in last weekend.  The interior is very cool!  Check out one of the pillars toward the counter which has legit WWI ammo cases build onto it!  Nice touch!  This is a great place for a quick drink or a really chill hangout spot for a longer stay.  Volstead is where its at."
5,"Michelle is amazing!! My friends and I had such a great time at XS at the Encore! Michelle is a reliable promoter, super friendly, and makes sure her VIP's are taken care of. My group received free entry and drink tickets for the ladies. I would definitely recommend her a must contact when going to Vegas."
5,"Very satisfying meal! Would go here again! 

I was with one other person (who is not a vegetarian but still loved the food!) and we ordered a mango salad, yam tempura roll, assorted veggie tempura, spinach tofu, and pineapple ""chicken"" fried rice. It was just enough food for us and we were both really hungry! The meal also comes with tea so that was a nice touch! We also asked for everything to be made vegan, to accomodate my dietary requirements. 

Service wasn't anything special, but that was made up for in the food. The mango salad was very fresh, with an interesting dressing. The Yam tempura roll was nice, although nothing special. The veggie tempura assortment was nice and had a variety of veggies including eggplant, yam, sweet potato, broccoli, zucchini, and mushroom. It was nice and crisp. What really made the meal for me was the spinach tofu. It was soft but crispy tofu slathered with a delicious peanut-y sauce and served with some dehydrated spinach. The spinach was seasoned and almost reminiscent of those crispy seaweed snacks you can buy. The pineapple ""chicken"" fried rice had other vegetables in it and the soy chicken was not overwhelming which was nice.

All in all, I can't wait to dine here again. Fantastic meal!"
5,"The only bad thing about the pretzel shop is that it closes at 5pm weekdays and 4pm on Satuerday.  Everything [sandwiches,pizza,cookies,3 sizes of pretzels ] is delicious !!!"
5,"Amazing Caldo de Pollo and Menudo!  Brought me back to life.  Mucho Chimichanga is super good too.  Ordered for pick up, the soup was still blazing hot once I got home.  Something special about this place.  I will be back for more food!"
5,"My BFF and I have come here multiple times a month for the last several months, admittedly usually on Tuesdays. But even if I celebrate a Taco Tuesday every now and again, I always make sure to add other things to my order, because hogging a table for $4 isn't great. I also tip at least 20%, and if I'm getting tacos, that's based on the original price, not the $1 Tuesday price.

Anyway, on Tuesdays it can be pretty busy, but it's real slow during the week, and that's a shame. I'm always telling people how good it is in the Plaza Midwood Facebook group, but they always want to list other places. IDK man. 

They always give us extra chips and salsa too and that's good because we are fatties. I always get some queso. The hot salsa is too hot for me, but I'm a whimp. Even people I know who aren't whimps, like my BFF, need to mix it sometimes. Don't feel bad if you can't do it by itself. Or do, I can't tell you how to live your life.

Also a medium margarita is giant and wonderful. 

Today we had Ron and he was super attentive and nice. He kept us all filled up on our food and was always there right before we needed him. He's got a great personality, like most of the wonderful people who work there. 

Anyway, go to La Unica."
5,"This place was fantastic! I'm not a vegetarian myself but I went with a friend who is and to give you an example of how delicious the food was, my friend nearly knocked me out thinking that I tricked her into eating real meat! But not to worry, everything is soy based with vegetables even if looks fool you. We ordered the chicken teriyaki and some sushi rolls. Heads up, even though the sign says sushi, they actually have a grill menu, Thai menu, and other Asian dishes as well as sushi. This place is a must try for both vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores! Yum!"
5,"Never fun when your tire blows out driving to a job site on one of the hottest days of the year, but found a spot of shade and got it changed pretty quickly.  Limped over to Discount Tire on the spare, where they took very good care of me and replaced the tire under warranty for free!  They're also the main (very generous) supporter of the MS Rides nationwide so very happy to buy all my tires here.  Thanks for taking care of me #discounttire"
5,"Super yummy! Great street tacos, salsa and service. Perfect Taco shop. Enchilada sauce and beans were very authentic. Loved the rice. Soft and flavorful."
5,"I got the iced almond milk latte with carmel and white chocolate flavoring. It was pretty delicious. It is hard to find a decent almond milk latte, and though it wasn't the best it was well worth the trip. The coffee was nice and strong and stood out in the drink, which I love. The flavoring wasn't too over powering. And I am guilty of being one of those people who love a sweet drink, though, I am trying to cut more sugar out of my life so maybe it was a good thing to not have it so sweet, and so with that I tasted the almond milk flavoring more than I would like. But since I am cutting out diary and sugar I better get used to it, and the drink I got at Volstead is something I could enjoy. 

In addition, it was empty when we got there at 8:30ish am and so that was nice as well and it was a great setup to do homework or get things done. Plus the music was great. A little bit too loud to have a meeting there, but I am sure they would turn it down if there wasn't too many people there."
5,This Discount tire has always treated me great and they do everything the can to make your experience as great as it can be because let's face it... No one WANTS to buy new tires!
5,"Love this company. Just got my tires air'd up and they offer me water! Anyways, I bought 4 new tires last year and I shopped around. Sam's club had the best price. Some other company beat that and then Discount beat that price! I got a great deal! Very friendly!"
5,"This is our new favourite go-to restaurant for special occasions and any time we can come up with an excuse to drive all the way to Markham. My husband and I have been working our way through the all-you-can-eat menu and have loved just about everything we've tried. Even the items we've liked less have been good, if not great.

My only two complaints are that they don't clearly label which things are vegan or which can be made vegan (I think we've only been served vegan items there, but I'm never 100% sure, since nothing on the menu is labeled), and that they're located so far from downtown Toronto. Open an East End location, please!

They have a new freezer section with various veggie meats and things like house-made won ton. 

The staff is very friendly and the ambience is nice."
5,"These are the best pretzels in Pittsburgh.  Period.  It's tough to walk by and not pick up some pretzels to take home.

I recently used them to help cater a holiday party.  a.) It was only $20 for 50 freakin' pretzels.  b.) They had the order ready on-time.  c.) The pretzels were great as left-overs days later.  Win all around."
5,"LOVE this place. The only person that doesn't love pretzels is a person that hasn't been here. The buffalo chicken sandwich is messy but really good. Only downside to this place is that they only take cash but hey, it could be worse."
5,"Zelens and 3 lab products. The best skin care lines. thank you Cece for your patience in finding me my skin care regimen. My skin feels and looks clean, soft and rejuvenated! I loved your expertise."
5,Great place.  nice ppl.  a little pricey but worth it.  chicken enchiladas were great.  rice and beans great as well.  I will go back.
5,Michelle is honestly the go to woman out in Vegas. I've been staying in touch with her the last 3 years for the Vegas night life scene. I have never been disappointed and aside from her referring me to the correct people I love that everyone is on top of it all and responds quick. I don't usually Yelp it but I knew I had to get the info out there.
5,"My absolute favourite veggie sushi place to go in Toronto. They serve more than just veggie sushi. They have sizzling plates, noodles and a whole bunch of other items on their menu. I consider the AYCE option each time, but I end up opting for the regular menu, which has the sushi/sashimi options and I end up ordering enough food that I'm stuffed full anyway.

I've been here with family and friends and all of them are initially quite fascinated by the concept of veggie sushi. They agree that it tastes interesting, but we all agree that it is quite pricey for veggie sushi. It's the handiwork that goes into making this stuff.

In any case, this is a great go-to vegetarian option for me in Markham! They accommodate larger groups and there are even tables that are sectioned off for privacy.

I've been quite a number of times, but I still haven't gone through all the items on the menu. There are just that many options, which is amazing!"
5,"Hands down best waffles (regular or vegan) I've ever had. You didn't really need syrup and they were super filling. The mock chicken was pretty good and the dish came with syrup and hot sauce, so options. Didn't realize that this is an all vegan place besides a few dairy addition options. I walked in trying to figure out what to order. I asked what was vegan and when they said everything I lit up and did a happy dance  They have a great brunch menu Saturday mornings. I've only tried brunch options so far but their whole menu sounds great. So far tried a strawberry scone which they wrapped up beautifully like a little present and chicken and waffles both were delicious. The chicken and waffles looked so fancy and had a mango slice on the side. A+ on presentation. I want to eventually try all five of their brunch options, everything sounds so good! Will be back."
5,"I just wanted to take a quick minute to say that I love Barney's. 

I had the chance to visit the Barney's at the Palazzo in Las Vegas and was overwhelmed with its variety. 

I had the pleasure of holding the most opulent khaki canvas with leather trim tote ($445) by Dries Van Noten. I was devastated I couldn't leave with it in my arms. 

In any case, I didn't leave Barney's empty-handed. I was able to purchase Comme des Garcons' new scent Wonderwood. So excited to wear it out."
5,Whenever my friends and I go to vegas we always contact Michelle to get us on the guest lists for all the best clubs and she always makes it happen!
5,"Wow! I really want to give a heads up to management way to go on the new girl in cosmetics! I came in looking for a fragrance (im picky), I was litteraly hounded by the staff! A litte blonde lady with an accent kept following me throughout the store when she asked me what i was there for i said fragrance! I also wanted to let her know i would be sampling the fragrance before i bought it, Now this is where im shocked! She then looked at me and said ""ooh ok you just want samples "" then proceed to dump me off on another employee, she said here you take him he just want samples. I immediately felt compelled to call managment! Especially since everyone there was rude! Except for Jenny (the girl with the pink hair!) She was so incredibly warm and friendly!! And wow the knowledge this girl has is amazing! I even asked her how long she worked here because her knowledge of the department was astonishing! She completely changed my whole perception of the store! I was no longer mad her cheerfulness and authentic approach was infectious! She proceeded to give me some samples of an amazing fragrance!  I will only be coming back to her! This girl deserves a raise! I stuck around to see if this was just a fake or truly great customer service, to my surprise she greated and treated everyone that crossed her path with such outstanding customer service! Great job Jenny!"
5,"One of my favorite spots to go for taco Tuesday's! The staff are very friendly here, great for group events, fast service, $1 tacos on Tuesdays & unlimited Nachos."
5,"After having had a terrible pretzel from the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, we happened to park right in front of this shop when we were going to explore Carson Street. You walk in and there are just pretzels behind the counter, kind of like what we're used to seeing with bagel shops here on the West Coast. Each one was $.50. You can't beat it. We shared one since we were on an eating mission and it was a darn good pretzel. Lots of locals inside just grabbing pretzels here and there to go.

TY wanted to take some back to LA, so we asked how well they kept. We were told that you could take them back and throw them in the freezer, but since we were homeless, having checked out of the hotel already, we had to forgo any extras."
5,"Place has a nastalgic feel,  love it! Food menu looked great, donuts were amazingly authentic. Coffee was flavorful and smoothe. I recommend the nitro with no sweet, no cream for you plain coffee drinkers. The cocktail menu was enticingly unique, if I were there later in the day I would have indulged. Overall great place, can't wait to come back and try one of those gourmet grilled cheeses."
5,"I got treated very well on my two visits at Barney's during my honeymoon. 

Helpful associates willing to help you out. The layout of the place has flow. It's super will organized and clean. I only wish they would have a little bit more inventory to shop at. 

Barney's do sell Byredo Perfumes. Oh it's the best."
5,"Similar to Montreal with their bagels, this shop sells fresh, hot pretzels.. REALLY GOOD.
2 pretzels and bottle of water, only 3 bucks, awesome."
5,"We tried this restaurant for the first time this morning, and even though it is Father's Day my husband and I were seated immediately. He got the breakfast tacos after seeing them on the table next to us, and he loved them. I got the breakfast magic and asked to have avocado added on top. Oh my, it was fantastic. Unfortunately, it was huge and I had no chance of finishing it successfully. We will definitely be back."
5,"This place is staple and one that I frequented when I lived in Pittsburgh.  The pretzels are always fresh, delicious, and inexpensive. They have a veggie pizza (on pretzel) that is amazing and pretzel dogs. They also have a wide variety of flavors for their pretzels and dipping sauces. When I visit, this is one of the ""must-go"" places for me.

You can't go wrong with The Pretzel Shop/"
5,"This is one of my most favorite places in Pittsburgh.   I love pretzels and these are way better than the ones from the mall that are dripping in butter.  The pretzel sandwiches are less than $3 and a great lunch - not too much food.  I also like this place because it is one of the few place you can buy rice krispie treats.  This is just a great little neighborhood shop, that makes a great pretzel for an amazing price.  When they had to raise the price to $.50 they even posted a sign apologizing and explaining the price of the ingredients had gone up.  I definitely would put this on my list of places to eat in Pittsburgh."
5,"I'm so glad my group got connected with Michelle! Not only was she quick to reply to our messages, she was also super friendly and ready to help us out. We had such a great weekend in Vegas because she was able to get us into the guest lists where our favorite djs were playing. Can't wait to work with her next time we're in town :)"
5,"Michelle is easily the BEST promoter in Vegas! I have used her every time I come to town! She makes sure you're taken care of and is always available and attentive! We have gone to XS for free and she even includes drink tickets for girls. If you're coming to Vegas, definitely give her a call!!!"
5,Contacted Mellissa from Viva Las Guest List the day I arrived to Vegas.. on a Monday by the way.. and she was quick to respond and was kind enough to get us on the Guestlist to see LIL JON at XS nightclub. We had complimentary admission plus were each given 2 drink tickets.. This company is legit and will come through with your request. highly recommend them for any of your party night events!
5,"Pretty straight forward place. Although we didn't stop here this time around, we commonly stop in for my girlfriend. She loves the Bobbi Brown make up counter here. 

Service is great."
5,"The Best Pretel I ever had was the size of a steering wheel, came with Beer Cheese, and had sections that were so thick the dough had hardly finished baking. That was best  pretzel I ever had - made of Bavarian Dreams by lederhosen-clad geniuses. Yes, that was the best pretzel I ever had...

Until I found this place. 

Knowing my deep love for the softest and sourest of soft sourdough delicacies, several friends referred me to this south-side wonder. I knew I needed to have cash, so I went ready and entered a magical world of delight. Ready-to-go sandwiches with meats and cheeses on pretzels; pretzels with and without salt; pretzels with cinnamon; options to overwhelm even the Sultan of Brunei. 

I grabbed a turkey and cheese pretzel sandwich... FOR LESS THAN $4. That is not a typo. It was delicious, it was warm, it was filling... it was the best lunch I had that week. Feeling like I was in Wonka's shop, and not wanting to waste this rare opportunity (I don't hit the South Side often) I also grabbed a plain pretzel. That thing was eaten before I was done biking back to the 10th street Bridge. 

If you want a great pretzel, this is the place."
5,"The volstead public house is a very friendly place to go for a quick bite. All of their sandwiches are vegetarian and can be made with vegan cheese. We got two vegan sandwiches and were very pleased with them. They are a bit small so they're not filling but they were excellent. Also the staff is very friendly. Overall, a nice place to sit and enjoy a cruelty free sandwich."
5,"This is the BEST mexican in Charlotte. We have tried a few. More than a few. And this is hands down the best. It is a little dive-y but thats what makes it great. Ask for Carolina. She's the most amazing, sweetest waitress. And get the salsa verde (it's free! just ask!) - its an avocado based salsa that will blow your mind."
5,Marco was the most polite and great guy ever he even had a lil fun sliding our cards:)
5,Have loved them since they were sold on the corner by Southside high school in the 80s! Still the best!!!
5,"Where to begin. Here visiting a friend and they recommended this place and boy howdy, I am not disappointed. Started off with their Signature Latte and Cappuccino. It's quite possibly the best sweetest coffee I've ever had. My husband almost went into convulsions because of how sweet it is. But I loved it. I had their sausage gravy waffle and my husband had their Souther waffle. We both discreetly licked our plates when had no more food to eat. Staff was pleasant, no real atmosphere to speak of but who cares when the food is this good. Glad my diet doesn't start until next week!"
5,"This place is a hidden gem! We shared the chicken wings which were great, and I had the brisket with a corn muffin (yum!) and Mac and cheese. My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing and French fries which were super fresh and crunchy. Warning- it fills up quick and on the weekends they don't take reservations so get there early or prepare to wait."
5,"First time here.. Tried the vegan philly cheese steak and all I can say, it was DELICIOUS!! The vegan cheese was great and the service as well! Thank you"
5,"Michelle is great!! This was the second time I used her to get on guest lists for the clubs in Vegas and I could not be happier.  She was so easy to work with, just a few simple texts and we were all set up.  She was friendly and very clear with instructions as far as where to go for lines etc.

A friend of mine referred me to a different promotions group and they were trying to charge DOUBLE the cover of what the club was charging.  DO NOT USE THESE GUYS! STICK WITH MICHELLE! We got in for free at XS and Hakkasan (she put us in contact with a guy to set that up) and even got 2 free drinks at XS. She is absolutely wonderful and I am so glad I stuck to my guns and didn't pay some outrageous fee that the other companies charge.

I will be passing along her information to all of my friends that are going to Vegas and I will 100% be using her when I return."
5,Jaz gave us great service when we came back for warranty! Very professional will definitely be back
5,"We love Waffles INC!  We frequented the original in New Brighton years ago and so pleased to see the shops grow all over the Pittsburgh area.  They have great service, pleasant atmosphere and the food is outstanding!  Congrats on your recent opening in Wexford!"
5,"Y'know, I have never actually been in this place as it always seems to be closed whenever I venture to the Sahs Syde, but every now and then, someone I know ends up getting pretzels from there for everyone, and they are always tasty either hot or cold. Today someone gave me a couple of the soft pretzel rods, so I figgered it was high time for a Yelp. 

My father grew up in South Side, so the pretzels became a semi-regular treat for us. Once as a child, I was whining and carrying on about something I didn't wanna do or whatever while we were visiting my grandmother when she lived on Sarah Street.  So, to get me to shut up, my mom pulled over on Carson, came out with a brown paper bag, pulled out a South Side pretzel the size of Andre The Giant's hand, and stuffed it in my mouth with a big grin on her face. True story. That was the first time I ever had one; at age 6. There wasn't a peep outta me the rest of the day. 

Hey, eatin' somethin' good is work when yer a kid. Ever hear rugrats carry on when they're eatin' a hot fudge sundae? Dig what I'm sayin'?

I like to bite a chunk off and let it dissolve in my mouth a little. 

These ain't the kind of pretzels you'll find at a department store's snack bar or a ball park concession stand. You don't get that pepper on the bottom, that oven baked flavor that bleeds character, care, and the old-school, that chewy toughness that evokes what South Side used to be; street as hell."
5,"Although I pass this place everyday, I limit myself to only stopping once or twice a week. If there is an open parking spot in front of the shop, my car seems to always pull in on its own.

Over the years, I think I have tried every sandwich here and they all taste great. My personal favorite is the hot dog pretzel. It is a party in our mouth!

Lately, I've only been getting regular pretzels. At 50 cents a piece, how can you go wrong? If you don't like a lot of salt, make sure to tell them ""light salt"". Lunchtime lines can get a little long and remember they only take cash."
5,"We really liked this place. Surprisingly good, given the location off the beaten path. We had brisket, ribs and salmon, and they were all tender, smoky, not dried out. I've been known to fire up the smoker myself and I was impressed. Service was attentive, and everyone was nice, including the singer-songwriter that was performing. The cocktail menu was fun, too. We will be back."
5,Been coming here for over 12 years and everything tastes great.  Good for kids too as you can order a la cart beans and rice with a tortilla and my kids were happy!!  Good salsa and recently they added Mexican Popsicles that are so yummy!!! Reasonable prices and clean too!!!  One of our families favorite places.  Nothing fancy just great food!!
5,"Although the service was incredibly TERRIBLE, the food was amazing, so didn't want my review to reflect the poor service. Hopefully the Manager or Owner will have some training so patrons are greeted, and not treated like they are an inconvenience. It was every person during our visit, so maybe she was just having an awful day? Anyway, food was AMAZING, and definitely worth a try to satisfy your Vegan palate. It should be noted I am NOT vegan or vegetarian, but visited with my BFF (who is), and we both loved the sandwiches we shared. Philly cheese steak & fried chicken sandwich with incredibly tasty blueberry BBQ sauce. Yum!!"
5,"Michelle is so great!! I've had two great trips because of her! The clubs in the Wynn and Encore are all the best on the strip and she gets you in so fast that your feet don't have time to hurt while waiting in those long lines.

I also personally enjoy a girl promoter. For some reason I just feel a bit safer. She's super reliable and can get you in any club you want to go to on the strip. Definitely recommend using this service and especially Michelle!"
5,Michelle is deff a great promoter! Responds back quickly and gets us on the guest list every time.
5,"I cannot begin with the praise I'd give this restaurant.  First off we arrived and the owner himself greeted us at the door. They had their exhaust fan go out and had a limited menu. He offered a free appetizer coupon for a different day if we had decided not to stay. He was so welcoming and they had even created their rainy day menu that we stayed. Our server David was very nice and patient with us.  My boyfriend got the pulled pork nachos and the portion size was more than enough as an appetizer or a meal.  I got the 1/2 of pulled pork with a baked potato. I CANNOTTT stress how amazing and delicious the pulled pork was in its own. They had four different house made sauces, my favorite being the Texas because of the thick smoky flavor. My potatoe was soft and I had liquid cheese on it making it a perfect pair to go with the pulled pork. Everyone made sure that our experience as great and the food was well worth it. If we are even in the area we would definitely stop by to taste the full menu. The most exciting thing is that the portions were large enough for us to have left overs for a perfect late night snack."
5,"You will never find a better pretzel anywhere. Period. I remember coming to The Pretzel Shop literally 20 years ago as a kid with my dad on really special weekend outings, and when I go back today it's just as delicious, with a nice helping of nostalgia.
The pretzels are really inexpensive, drinks are cheap too, and you can get other pretzel-foods here too like pretzel sandwiches. It's a very low key trip, you could come in sweats and fit in. This is a quick stop on your way somewhere, not someplace to come and sit for lunch.
c a s h o n l y"
5,Definitely one for the books here in Vegas this week for my birthday. Thank you Michelle for a great experience. Cant wait to be back soon.
5,"The food at wheelfish is amazing! My husband had the ribs... so good! I had the brisket quesadilla. The brisket quesadilla was delicious. For an appetizer we had the pulled pork nachos. Best nachos I have ever had! The atmospheric is fun, kinda hipster with a live band. Really great place to visit in the north hills on a Friday night! Our waiter Nick K was so friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we had a fabulous time! 5+ stars to the wheelfish"
5,"By far my favorite Barneys store among those I've been to. This particular location is huge with lots of space to walk about. Thanks to their recent Spring sale I'm embarrassed to reveal the number of times I came in here during my 5-day trip to Vegas. 

The sales associates are helpful without being in your face too much. They were there to help but at the same time gave me space to look around.

Based on size, Barneys is probably the retail store that stands out the most at the Shoppes at the Palazzo.

After multiple trips to Barney, my purse came out thinner but I came out happier! That's what's important right?!"
5,"The girl was sooooooo nice taking our order!!! She also had some fly ass makeup so we told her, again she was sooooooooo sweet!!!!! I ordered 4 carne asada tacos and a large horchata! The place itself is so cute, LOVE the Mexican tiles on the walls! Chips n salsa, AMAZING!!! Will be coming back"
5,"Great customer service and high quality, delicious food every time. There was a line wrapped around the building and I waited no more than 3 minutes after ordering to get my food. They had a young man outside taking orders which made the ordering process smooth and very efficient. Good job Chik Fil A!"
5,"Absolutely love Michelle best promoter I've encountered! She always hooks it up, never a time that I was disappointed. Very reliable, nice , and sets you up in a timely manner. I like that it definitely matters some promoters take hours to get back to you. You won't ever have to worry about that from Michelle. 

This is the only person I deal with and go to when I want to have fun. I recommend others do the same. I've had countless great long extreme fun Las Vegas nights/ mornings lol due to her services. I guarantee you will too, especially if you are a very versatile individual and like other music besides hip hop and have an open mind : ) !!!!"
5,Great service! They were all so friendly and very helpful! I went to Big O Tires before them and the guy was so rude and could care less about what I needed. Then I went to discount tired and was treated completely different! I will definitely be going back!
5,"Pleasant ambiance, rather large menu wiyh vegetarisn snd vegan options. Service is friendly. Prices very reasonable. Worth comming back."
5,"I went in on a Saturday with one hour left until closing. They were very busy but I didn't feel i had inconvenienced them in the slightest. Everyone there was professional and efficient. They were able to get my issue fixed with my tire, plus give me a free rotation,  and I was out the door by the time they closed. Thank you for the great service!"
5,"I had a great experience with this store today that I needed to share. I brought my car in to have aftermarket wheels and tires installed. While waiting for my install, I took notice of how courteous and hard working each member of their team was. It's refreshing to see people take so much pride in what they're doing. Joey, an assistant manager, was a pleasure to deal with. He and his crew did an amazing job with my car. I highly recommend this store to anyone needing tires, or looking to have new wheels installed meticulously."
5,"Better service, more sales and wider selection than the one in SF."
5,"Whenever I need tire service I come to this location because they truly care about service and even when something may not go great the manager Joe or assistant manager Yaz step up and go the extra mile to make things right.  All the employees are friendly and work very hard.  This location is popular so it is a very busy store so you may have a wait but they hustle to do their best without compromising quality work.  I would suggest making an appointment time to reduce waiting but just make note that your time is a priority checkin time that moves you towards the front of the line.  With an appointment they are guaranteeing you will be served within 45 minutes from check in.  I always thought it meant your car would be serviced at exactly that time, but Yaz patiently explained it to me and so now I know.  I highly recommend this Discount Tire, and they will continue to have my business."
5,"These guys just do a great job! I pulled up to get a new tire for a trailer and Preston was out in the parking, an employee, an ran over to roll the tire for me. Then I met Joe, the manager, he was quick to jump in and help, even being the general manager. Nice to see leaders lead, it shows in the shop. I would highly recommend these guys!"
5,"The Pretzel Shop on East Carson is one of my favorite spots to go in southside whenever i am in need of a quick meal! Their basic pretzels are very inexpensive, much less pricey than the typical ""Auntie Annes"" inside malls! Not to mention, they are a lot better tasting! They always have helpful employees that ring you out quickly, and deliver your food within seconds of ordering! I will always be returning to The Pretzel Shop!"
5,"I come here a few times a week for the chips and salsa and shrimp tacos.. The horchata is the BEST in the area...they have fresh limeade and pineapple juice that they make daily..

I recommend any chicken dish since they spice it so good... The taquitos are a great value and a meal in itself $3.99.. Now fir the best shrimp tacos in the world... The shrimp are seasoned and grilled ( not fried), juicy and it cones with a big slice of avocado and fresh pico on the taco.. I could eat 6 of these and still want more.

This is a small family owned joint and the owners are friendly and keep the place really clean. I just can't say enough about this place... I LOVE it... It's like going to an old friends house and being treated with TLC... Oh and the police like to eat here too, so I feel pretty safe"
5,I went crazy with my make my own crepe and had a chocolate chip and bacon crepe with caramel sauce! Talk about delicious!! They have great service and the coffee was superb. We will definitely be back for our big breakfast fix again!
5,Michelle was very helpful and did what she said she would! I had a lot of questions as a vegas first timer and she always responded to me with what I needed to know. My group of four girlfriends and I got in XS to see Zedd for free and got a free drink ticket as well. I am very happy with her excellent service :)
5,"I wuv you Barneys.  

Other than the Henry Cuir and Valextra, I go GAGA for the handbag department.  The Balenciaga selection is extensive.  I cross checked online and MOST of the items in the store are also online.  Ask for Sunny, straight up and not pushy.  

Shoe selection is fantastic-esp the Alaia.  

As for beauty, I gotta have my Dr. Sebagh Deep Exfoliating Mask."
5,"I don't do fast food very much anymore, but I stopped here over the weekend to show Chick-Fil-A some love for standing by their morals.  I was in the area to visit another store, and made sure to stop here for lunch! 

The employees here are very friendly and helpful, as they are at every CFA I've been to. If you're unfamiliar with their menu, they have breakfast from open to 10:30 - the awesome CFA biscuit, and bacon-egg-cheese, and others. My favorite items on the rest of their menu is the regular CFA sandwich and the spicy chicken wrap...I get them with fruit cups instead of fries, and their great sweet tea. Yum! This is a treat, not a regular thing for me, but I'm glad to support them. 

This location is at the corner of Tatum and Cactus, on the SEC, in the same area as the Wal-Mart and Michael's."
5,Excellent food and atmosphere! The bartenders are terrific and the owner Katie is fantastic!! Definitely get the corn muffin- it's not your mothers it's better! A great stop in the north hills!
5,"So did a mobile order for the first time. It was super easy! Also ordered breakfast for the first time at Chick-fil-A. I got the chicken biscuit & 4 count minis & hash browns. It was delicious. The chicken biscuit was super good, you can taste the honey in the biscuit. It's good with any sausage for example mayo, ranch or polynesian. Polynesian sauce is my favorite for the chicken biscuit & minis. 

They do have a couple of outdoor seating. There's a play place inside.

5,"Awesome time in Vegas because of you!   Free entrance into XS and 2 comp drinks per person on Saturday night!  Woot woot ;)

***Only grief about XS club itself was the promotions entrance was on the backside so we ended up doing a full circle around the hotel casino AND the comp drinks were not for flavored alcohol (no upgrade option)."
5,"This place is awesome, I've been out to sushi before with friends and had limited options of food being a vegetarian but here I can literally order anything on the menu and it all tastes great! 

I came in a Saturday evening and it was so busy - had to wait a few minutes for a table but once we got seated and ordered - our food came within minutes and it was piping hot!

We started with the vegetarian tempura which was freshly fried and so delicious. 
Then we had combo A which is 8pc sashimi, 6pc sushi, 8pc rainbow roll and 8pc California roll. 

Everything was so delicious and looking around seeing other people's meals - their choices look awesome too!!

So happy with my meal but I'm sad that it's 1hr away from me :("
5,Wow !  That's the first thing I said to my partner when sauntering inside this museum-like department store.   The selection is great and the store is so clean plus the SA are nice and friendly !
5,Really cool spot to have a drink and relax. The ambiance is great and the staff is very friendly.
5,Kayla helped me and my group have a great time in Vegas and save money which is hard to do. She made us feel very welcomed. Thank you. And thanks Michelle for your help too
5,"I have used this location many times and gotten hassle free, efficient service.  However, last week my visit wasn't up to its usual standard, so when I received the survey in my email I answered it honestly.  I got an email from the store manager, Frank, apologizing for the trouble and telling me what he was already doing to ""make it right"" (which, in this case, was ordering a new set of wheel locks direct from the auto manufacturer so that I would not have to).  Here I thought I'd have to go to the trouble and expense of ordering a replacement set myself, and he already had plans in place to fix it.  Customer service is half about getting it right the first time, and half about fixing the things that happen when it ISN'T right the first time.  Nice job and thank you to Frank and his staff for fixing it without being asked!"
5,"Hot, salty soft pretzels stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs or sausage for under $3? Yes, please. The staff has mad skills at keeping the line moving fast during peak hours. Bring cash and get off the phone while you're in line!"
5,One of my new favorite spots! I'm not a huge coffee person but their cold brew nitro is AMAZING!! The staff is so attentive and the customer service is great. The hubby and I both got grilled cheeses and they were delicious! I would definitely recommend the green chili. Can't wait to go back and try more of what they have to offer! The vibe was great we just sat and chilled for a few hours. Some great people watching.
5,Neat place to check out when you're in Pittsburgh.  Neat operation!  Very friendly staff allowed us in the back to see how their pretzels are made.
5,"There was a bit of a wait but totally worth it! The food was amazing and the service was awesome!! Lauren is the best! I totally recommend asking for her. She was funny, kind, and very attentive! Loved this place and will be back!"
5,"Michelle was great! Helped me and my girls get into XS nightclub, no problem. Very professional and responded back in a timely manner. I will be calling her next year when I go back to Sin City! 

MIchelle: 908-770-3570"
5,Special Thanks to Kayla Nennecke! She made sure my group made it on the guest list on short notice to see Dillon Francis at Surrender (Encore). And Kayla hooked the ladies up with free cover and free drinks. Had an awesome time at Surrender for my 24th Birthday
5,"I love the carne asada burritos from here! Also if you eat in, you get free chips and salsa. However, if you want to order more it's 99cents. Plan on spending he 99cents, the chips as salsa are addictive!!  I always want to try more of their menu, but how can I not get the carne asada burrito?! Next time I'll have to come here with more people so we can share more items."
5,I just had the very best toasted bagel sandwich that I can recall.  And it was vegan!!! It's called the Copper State Bagel Sandwich. Friendly service and a good location in downtown Mesa!! I'll be back.
5,"I called to see how much it would cost since my husband and I are on a road trip we wanted to save some money and get tires that will sustain for our trip.  Lloyd was very nice on the phone and assisted me well that it influenced me to get it done there.  The other place called prior was charging me $540 for 4 new tires and here at Discount Tires, I got 4 NEW tires for $284 with tax and everything!  David, the person that helped me was easy going and kind.  Thank you for your help and great service!"
5,"La Unica has excellent food and options for all diets. It is very authentic, extremely fast and super affordable. They have dollar tacos every Tuesday which are Delicious and always keep the chips and salsa flowing free of charge. On top of all that the wait staff is kind and courteous, especially Evangeline and Ellie. La Unica is the best! 

I highly recommend!"
5,"I am happy, once again, to be a Discount Tire customer.  I am traveling home from a long road trip with 1200 more miles to go when I realized my tires were done for.  I came to this Discount Tire at the recommendation of my brother in law, who lives nearby.  I am so grateful he did!  The staff are courteous and friendly.  Eric is the best!  He not only quickly got the ball rolling, but gave me a discount equal to the rebate I could have gotten.  Since I am terrible about sending in for my rebates, this is extra special.  In addition to that, he referred me to a local shop for my alignment and oil change.  He called ahead to make sure they had the equipment needed for my old Odyssey and let them know I was coming once my tires are on.  I am so impressed.  Many businesses could learn from the customer service and just plain kindness shown me here today.  As a mom traveling alone with her kids, this kind of care by strangers makes all the difference."
5,Excellent food. Absolutely the best al pastor in the valley (that I've found so far). Everything else is great and prices are reasonable.
5,"Call ahead and order their Home Baked Cookie Trays - they are AWESOME! If I fail to bring one in to work for special events, I get a heap of questions! They never disappoint with any of their baked goods, and prices are reasonable!
Pretzels are great, I prefer the bacon/parmesan ones myself.
Great food, great prices, exceptional service from an original family run, South Side business!"
5,"I just bought some hubcaps for my tires that I've been looking for forever. Manny went above and beyond to find them for me and get them in quickly. I don't usually write reviews but I had to because of how well I was treated today. I'll be a customer for life, won't buy another tire from anyone else again. If you go down there ask for Manny, he's awesome!!!"
5,"Went here super hungry after a 2 hr massage and really excited to try their vegan sushi rolls!

My dad, bf and myself ordered 7 dishes  talk about ordering with our stomachs!

We had the udon, eel sushi, spider roll, pad thai, general Tao chicken, hot and sour soup, tempura!

Everything was on point, fresh, crispy and delicious! 

Favorites were spider roll and general Tao for sure! 

Friendly service with great presentation!

Will def come back :)"
5,Chill vibe.  Delicious food!  I'm going there right now.  The Squawker Texas Ranger sandwich is legit!
5,"I tried this place a couple years ago but haven't been back just because it's far from my house. My friend and I stop by Thursday to grab dinner. The place was packed which is a good sign right there. I got there lemonade/limeade and my friend got the Micah, both home made. Their salsa has the perfect spice to it and their chipa are always fresh and warm. I ordered there in chicken fajita plate. Their meat was perfectly seasoned and there beans werw phenomenon and I'm really picky about beans. My friend ordered a bean and cheese chimichanga enchilada Style with rice. They forgot to put the rice and ham burrito where a polygenic and brought her a huge plate of an extra rice. I took a bite of hers it was one of the best bean and cheese chimichangas. For dessert we got there fried tortillas with cinnamon which are tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. We also ordered their flan I have never had a flan that good at any restaurant. The texture was just so smooth and creamy we ordered another one to go because it was so good."
5,"I'll start this by stating that I DO NOT fit the typical Barney's demographic. Not visually, anyway. That said, I do fit a small niche of fragrance enthusiasts. To me, fragrances are like wine. A sensory experience. I wear them for me. Most all of the perfume sales people at Barney's are also enthusiasts. If they don't approach me immediately because of my ""just passing through the store to my car"" look. I'm talking VERY casual and not in a hip kind of way. I think they actually come to me pretty quickly, all things considered, lol. But once we start talking, they see I mean business. Sadly, my Barney's is closing (Dallas) and I planned to by a 290.00 bottle of Serge Lutens during their awesome cosmetic bag event. Dallas is not participating in the bag event due to the closure date.
Enter Las Vegas. The Venetian is my customer and I find myself in Vegas more than I would prefer. I've been in the Las Vegas store a few times and have bought some nice exclusives there. I decided to call Vegas to see if they could secure the relatively rare product I wanted and talked to Raul. He told me that they did not carry it, but Madison Ave (NYC) did and he would take care of everything to make sure I got what I wanted, and during the big event. Now, many of you would think ""well, he wants the commission, right?"". Well, of course he does, but it's not as much as all that and he spent a lot of time getting this, following up, calling me back a few times, etc...
Great customer service, Raul!
So, he will get my business by phone moving forward and in person when I am in Vegas.
This is a great store, with great customer service.
I think they try to balance the desire of many people to NOT be pestered with the polar opposite... People who get offended of they are NOT approached! Oy!
Don't get butt hurt if someone doesn't fall all over you. Make eye contact and they will come.
Why buy a luxury product for the same price at a non-luxury store?
Go to the best and they will work for your loyalty!"
5,"If you are going to eat fast food them this is the place to go...good chicken sandwiches, yummy shakes and great kids meals."
5,"Ok. So you're in the mall (I'm sorry for you, really I am.) you smell that salty baked pretzel smell and suddenly you think going to Auntie Anne's is a good idea. You're wrong. Dead wrong.

Hold out for some Pretzel Shop love. The place is not only easy to find being right on East Carson Street in the Southside of Pittsburgh, but it has the absolute cheapest and FRESHEST pretzels ever. 

The downside, you can't sit down to eat inside and there is always a line. Honestly neither of these deter me as I am perfectly happy being a stoop-dweller and taking up someone else's front steps to eat one of these salty snacks. The line just tells me that it's worth it. 

The prices literally are rock bottom. Don't miss a chance to get something, even just to take home, from here. Delish."
5,"I just moved to the north hills from NY and am in love with the vibe of this place. I got the brisket my friend got the salmon. Slaw, mac and cheese, also smoked eggplant. Everything was amazing also had ice cream sandwich for dessert. I had the tequila drink that's like a margarita on the rocks. Live entertainment topped it off... had no clue but when I walked in from the parking lot to the Altman bros I knew this place is a gem. Will be back here many times in sure"
5,"I got the #1 combination for lunch with one taco, two enchiladas, rice and beans! The most delicious enchiladas I've had in Charlotte! Rice and beans were yummy too! Loved my house margarita! Service was incredible ... Very sweet and always checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed!"
5,"Best authentic tacos in town! From some former Californians, we were disappointed in Charotte's Mexican cuisine, but were pleasantly surprised with La Unica. I recommend the tacos to anyone and everyone and am glad we found our new favorite taco spot."
5,Can I say how relieved I was to find these guys working hard with a shop full of customers in line and moving systematically through each person's needs! I couldn't have been more blessed! He offered a reasonable amount of time to address the issue and got me on my way. Thanks!
5,Michelle was so helpful and exceeded my expectations. I was able to show a friend visiting Las Vegas an amazing night out. Xs is the best pool party in town and Michelle got us great access with no trouble or wait! She is definitely the promoter I will be using any time I go out! Also got my friend an amazing deal on a hotel room which allowed him to stay and enjoy the city a couple extra nights.
5,Michelle was the best! Went there with five girls and one guy. She got us girls into every pool party & club we asked! And ALL FOR FREE! :) She always promptly replied and was able to answer any questions. She even let me know each morning which dj's were at which clubs for the day. Definitely helped make our trip the best we could've expected!
5,"Michelle isn't the typical promoter! She keeps her word and has access to many top clubs in Vegas! If you're used to promotors who just talk and don't deliver , well guess what, you're in luck cause Michelle is the opposite! Very nice and friendly! You won't regret working her!"
5,"I've heard great things about this place! However, when we got there it didn't look like anything special, so we just got 4 regular pretzels (60 cents each!!) and went home. This was quite possibly the best pretzel I have ever eaten in my life. And it was cold. I wanted to drive back and get more! I definitely recommend this place if you love a quality pretzel."
5,"YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE!

Now that I got your attention... Michelle is the best in town! She is amazing and will definitely take care of you no matter where u want to go. Everytime I'm in town she takes care of me and I have the best time! .. Even if it's very last minute I know she will still hook me up. She's the best hands down. 

Please hit her up. You will not be disappointed!"
5,I grew up in Pittsburgh but now live in Texas. I always look forward to making my regular trip to The Pretzel Shop. Pick up 30 pretzels and I am good for two weeks. These pretzels are a Pittsburgh staple. Make sure to try the back entrance for a hot baked pretzel!!!
5,Michelle is amazing!!!! Really hooked it up and took care of us this weekend. Such fast responses and was super helpful. Definitely hitting her up again the next time around!
5,"I've been going to the Pretzel shop for decades. DECADES! I used to go to the back ""door"" where the oven is and get the fresh out of the oven pretzels that would burn your hand even through the bag. These are amazing. They've been supplying all of Pittsburgh their soft pretzels since I can remember! A  bag of these taken to give out at work will make you a hero and not cost you an arm and a leg. 

My daughter lived on the Southside and while we were gutting her house and remodeling, I'd stop here every weekend and order our lunches. The sandwiches are KILLER. You haven't lived till you've had the hot dog wrapped in pretzel dough. And for $1.75 you can splurge for a couple and live like a king! The sausage pretzel sandwich heated while you wait so that it's super tasty is another clear winner! So too is the meatball sandwich roll - for $2.45? Are you kidding me??? A great place to get great food (more than pretzels!) at an outrageous price! You'll love it!

Oh yeah, they have pretzels too - flavored ones if you like. How about jalapeno, Cajun, garlic, or parmesan bacon? Spectacular!! But here's a tip, the BEST thing in here is NOT the pretzel. It's the baked goods. Their chocolate gobs are what your mother wishes she could make. Off the chart. Get two - and not to share! You're welcome."
5,Im a regular here and the food is exquisite everytime I come here. I always want to order much more but can't! This place never dissapoints and the chef knows whats up
5,Michelle is AMAZING she really made our Vegas experience unforgettable. She got me and my friends VIP treatment for very busy nights at XS. Will def recommend her to all of my friends and to anyone going to Vegas.
5,I won a gift card for this shop through Allure magazine and so I shopped for jeans here.  I bought Seven for all Mankind jeans and paid for the tax which was only $7.00 since my gift card was $100.   I was immediately greeted as soon as I walked in unlike other shops I've been to.  Amanda was fantastic; she offered great customer service.  I didn't expect for the employees to be this helpful.  I just wish I had more money to shop here.
5,"Best Mexican food in Charlotte! The menu offers a lot of different options that you can't usually find. The burritos and tacos are my favorites. The margarita here are great too, and the staff is awesome!"
5,Burgers are awesome and the curly fries always are perfect! Service is great even for a busy lunch
5,"I felt like The Pretzel Shop and I were star-crossed lovers of some sort. Any time I was ever in the southside and found I was craving some salty-carb action it always seemed to be closed. I would shake my fist at the sky and wonder who wouldn't ever let me have delicious warm pretzely snacks.

Then on a chilly but clear Friday I was finally able to make a lunch dash! I grabbed two of the smaller bacon parm pretzels and luckily had some cash on me, as it's a cash only place. 

While on the salty side, they were DELICIOUS. They weren't warm but it was nothing a quick trip to a warm oven or the microwave wouldn't cure.

If you're in the southside around lunch time, and you want to grab a quick snack or meal make sure to stop here."
5,"The food is insane.  A super fun addition to the neighborhood. Really close to Ross Park Mall. They don't serve greasy bar food -- they sell generous portions of smoked meats, real Mac n cheese and corn bread muffins. Best salmon I've ever had. Great place to see a live band, watch a game or just hang out. Love this place."
5,Michelle was amazing. She got us into all the clubs with no hastle and no wait. I will definitely call her again the next time I am in Vegas. :)
5,"Always busy but fast and efficient nevertheless! The chicken is nicely breaded, flavorful and juicy! You can get it grilled too. The chicken can be a sandwich, nuggets or on a salad- all good choices!"
5,"Vegetarian review here! We ordered take out sushi from this place. We pointed to the one we liked on their brochure and paid about 60.00. Whoa, expensive!!! BUT, It was a pretty big platter and everyone, about 5 of us, with huge dinner appetites, enjoyed it. We had some leftovers, too! The platter came with a lot of soy sauce, ginger and wasabi. Honestly, it seemed like it was the real thing. I was even scared to eat the salmon pieces because it looked like real salmon. Every single roll I ate was delicious! I would serve this platter to all my meat eater friends just to impress them and freak them out! I can't wait to go back and try other platters and their lunch specials! Fast service and friendly service. 5 stars from a humble veggie!!!"
5,"Their portions are enormous! The veggie burgers are very good and surprisingly they have a lot of vegetarian options. Also, the interior decor is very nice. I definitely recommend!"
5,I've been here several times and everything is good! They have a solid beer selection. Every sandwich I've had has been tasty. Their coffee is quality and they offer handcrafted pastries! Another win for Downtown Mesa!!
5,Michelle was quick to text back and even text friendly reminders and added discounts to restaurants during our stay amazing thanks
5,Kayla Nennecke was a great promoter!! Got us in everywhere we wanted and made sure we were taken care of!
5,"This little gem totally caught my eye as I drove down main street one day for lunch. I wish this establishment was transported to central phoenix so that I could take advantage of it more! They have cute classic sodas (peach is delish) , coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, and the ambience is wonderful. I went in the early afternoon and it seemed to be the perfect spot to go and get some work done or have a meeting. They have wifi and plenty of seating. Decor is on point beautiful and the place just feels very warm and inviting. Will definitely return when I'm in the area next."
5,"New restaurant VERY GOOD!! Great atmosphere and Vegan/Vegetarian/Pescatarian friendly menu with eggplant dish and salmon sandwich. Very spacious, cozy and has a live band! Great food, prices and experience!"
5,Michelle is the absolute best !! She replies super quick and gives plenty of information that you'll need when getting into the clubs. She'll take care of you getting in along with drink tickets :) very friendly and a great promoter ! I highly suggest you text her :)!!!
5,"Why would anyone ever get tires anywhere else? Unless someone is giving me free tires, I'm coming here!

1) There are locations in multiple states:
I've gotten tires in California and have gotten them repaired at other discount tire locations for free! They guarantee their work and replace them for free if needed. They have 900+ stores nationwide so you can probably find one anywhere!

2) Super cheap tires: 
I've gotten 4 new tires for under $400.

3) Free repair:
They will repair slow leaks/ holes etc for free. They've even repaired tires I did not get at their location (manufacturer tires) for free!

4) Quick service:
I've always been in and out under an hour without an appointment.

5) Great customer service: 
I've had great experiences at every single location I've been to. These guys are super nice and helpful. 

I'll always come here for tires."
5,Kayla was awesome! I Def recommend contacting her for guest list entry next time anyone is in Vegas
5,"Jukebox is one of my favorite burger places to dine at. Very fun atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. 
I've gone there countless times and I always go for the Humphrey burger with bacon. You can also choose your choice of bun. (Rye, Sweet Yeast, Pumpernickel, and more)

They also offer a great selection of milkshakes. You can't go wrong with a hot fudge milkshake!
The desserts are amazing, their chocolate cake is very rich and moist. The cookie they serve is warm and topped with your choice of soft or hard ice cream along with a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce. I omit the chocolate sauce, but that's just my preference. 

I definitely recommend!"
5,"Husband and I have been searching high and low for good barbecue since moving here from the South two years ago, and we FINALLY found it at Wheelfish. The pulled pork is perfect, slaw adds a great tangy crunch (not mayonaise-y, which I love), and the sides were all incredible as well. We had the blueberry cornbread, pork & beans, Mac & cheese, and sweet potato fries - all delicious and perfect portions. Last but not least, the live music was a huge bonus!! We'll be back again for sure."
5,"We went here for lunch after doing an escape room nearby. Super nice people and very good food. Not an expansive menu, but that was a plus because everything ordered at our table was excellent. Go for the cowboy sauce - definite bite but not too hot to enjoy."
5,"Y'all already know. It's a Southern thing, brought out here to provide delicious fried chicken with a smile and a very subtle Southern Baptist sense of humility and service.
You'll NEVER have inconsistent quality. Your kids will love it. It's impossible to get sick of it. I grew up near the original, I will never live more than a mile from a branch of this staple."
5,"These guys quite literally have the best Mexican food for the price in the East Valley.  It is always clean, the portions are fair, but my God their food is delicious.  They have the best enchiladas I've had anywhere.  I have to say that anytime I drive by that place my mouth waters.  They actually cook their food and although it's a cheap Mexican place, the food is equally good or better than many of the upscale Mexican restaurants.  They have their own recipes for their sauces, and have the best red sauce I've ever tasted on enchiladas.  I crave them and think about them all the time.  Their chips and salsa are great, which are free if you choose to eat there, just not for takeout, which kinda sucks, but it is good too.
Over the past maybe year to two years that I have eaten there I have found that they are typically pretty nice.  There was a guy working there are Christmas Eve last year and he was nice.  He'd always be cool whenever I would come in.  They got some big bootied young girl who was rude as hell, but I go for the food so I won't stop going in there to eat.
What really sucks is their location is next the Goodwill at Ray & Alma, to the left of the Goodwill, sandwiched next to another restaurant and like an American Legion VFW bar lodge thing.  Because of the location, I don't think many people stop there because it is not easily visible from the street.
These guys have the best Mexican food out there though.  They are inexpensive, usually generous with the portions, and clean.  They are the opposite of Filiberto's on cleanliness, which is a filthy place.  Mucho Taco is always spotless and never smells funny.  You don't have cooks back there who are dirty and sweaty and busy contaminating everything like what you see at Filiberto's.
It is very hard to find a place where you get perfect food every single time.  Each time I have Mucho Taco I am satiated and happy.  The food never settles weird in my stomach, and I have a very sensitive stomach.  I know that they do a good job of keeping their kitchen clean, and the quality of the food is good.  You can really taste the difference.
I would suggest trying the cheese enchilada combination plate, eat in, and try the different salsas with chips.  They are so so good."
5,"Excellent Tacos El Pastor and Fresh tasty salsa.   Speedy friendly service.  The space is clean, decently and appropriately decorated and laid out well for a small space."
5,"Cute coffee shop! I walked in and asked what vegan options they had thinking they would have a few and was so excited when they said everything on their menu is vegan! They have pastries on display and the cashier was really nice. The place was pretty low key when I went in on a Saturday afternoon, not very busy. It's in downtown Mesa and by so beautiful murals and wall art. I ordered a strawberry scone and it was really good. Not too sweet and not hard like some scones. I wanted chicken and waffles but they were all sold out by noon! I definitely need to come back to try the chicken and waffles. I love the ambiance and it seems like a great place to bring your laptop and do some work while drinking coffee or munching on a pastry. Woo hoo for surprise all vegan spots!"
5,"Went here for 2018 cow appreciation day. I had never been to this CFA and it was ABSOLUTELY PACKED FULL! It had a line out the door and the parking lot was crazy full. Even the drive through was full of cars. Despite this location being the busiest CFA I have ever visited, our food came out the fastest of all six CFAs I visited that day."
5,WE LOVE ThiS PLACE!!!! It's such a hidden little gem. Salsa is wayyyy so delicious! The kids that run in are so kind and friendly. For us it's a weekly trip here. Thanks so much!!
5,Food was solid and had a nice latte. Chill environment that my kids liked as well. The people were really nice as well.
5,"Nice little breakfast spot. Friendly people, good service, very good waffles AND they have some vegan options which is super fun.  It's a cool atmosphere and feels clean. We have eaten there several times and will certainly be back!"
5,"I always want to make a stop here when I come to LV...their selection during sales is actually pretty good!

This store is gorgeous and they have different levels. Very beautifully laid out."
5,Great service with a great rebate on Labor Day weekend. The building was packed but I was still in and out in less than 90 minutes with no appointment. I got a great price on wheels before the rebate.
5,"Jukebox was worth travelling almost 2 hours from Lasalle to the West Island and getting lost for half an hour and walking forever. It really was. We almost gave up and turned back and went downtown but I'm glad we didn't! 
I ordered the buffalo chicken poutine and a banana split milkshake (which was delicious), one of my friends ordered a burger(not quite sure which burger but he said it was delicious!) with a side of poutine and a cheesecake milkshake and my other friend ordered a chilli cheese dog and a side of poutine with a chocolate milkshake(I think). SO filling, I couldn't finish my food so I brought the rest home. We really wanted to order a desert, but we were way too full.
Jukebox is worth the try and the long distance. The atmosphere is beautiful and breathtaking. It felt like it came right out of the 50's. I will definitely go back, no doit about it. 
But it would be really cool if they opened one downtown(my only complaint)."
5,Get me early cuz they go quick! If you get them while they are hot you'll be hooked for sure! Best soft pretzel anywhere!
5,If you are missing home come to this place! It was recommended to me by a friend and it's just like nanas food. The novelas playing on the tv and the friendly staff is just a bonus to its authenticity.
5,"Had the sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast pretzel sandwich. It was a large portion, worth the money, and was very delicious!
Husband got the chicken club and a pepperoni roll. Club was good and pep roll was incredibly squishy (in a good way!).
Also got a chocolate muffin that I can't wait to try!
 This is now one of my favorite spots! Will be back for sure!"
5,"Located at the ""funnel"" end of the neighborhood along the South River that locals fondly refer to as Bronado Alley, The Pretzel Shop should be the first thing that comes to mind when you are in Pittsburgh and someone asks you if there's a shop somewhere in town that sells pretzels.  Trust me, if you walk into this place and offer them money in exchange for a pretzel, they will definitely help you complete that transaction.  Like their ads say, they didn't spend all morning baking hundreds of pretzels just so they could not sell them to you.  What kind of business model would that be? Sure, it'd be kinda cool in that 'exclusive' way, but you'd get tired pretty fast of not getting that salty, salty pretzel you want so badly.  Fact is, you go here, you're gonna get a pretzel, so stop worrying about it.  Plus, all their milkshakes are three dollars, $2.50 if you're a redhead.  Don't ask them why, but they steeply discount their food for redheads.  Oh yeah, it's possible they have outdoor seating, but I've never been able to tell because I've been busy eating pretzels - which this place has a lot of!"
5,10/10. Best restaurant in Markham! Has immense vegan options. Even if your not vegan you'd fall in love with this place. The servers are also so friendly. Go try it now!
5,Great food and relaxed atmosphere. Some of the best I have had in Charlotte.  It is high on my list of place to enjoy a meal.
5,Kayla was super awesome and accommodating it was my 22 birthday and she made sure me and my entire group got in every where and even made awesome suggestions for things to do! Deff use her if planning a trip to Vegas!! Her number is (201) 741-8419 (:
5,"My dream closet would look like this Barneys!  

This Barneys is just as gorgeous as any other and a little smaller in size and selection.  Regardless, this girl loves to walk around and drool over the Bottega bag on display, this season's thigh-high Louboutins and the Helmut Lang draped leather jacket in black!"
5,"Since collaborating with the Nile theater, people might be confused with the location of the coffee shop/restaurant but it's not too bad. The food itself is very good a little bit on the pricey side though. The environment is very vintage and stylish. Their coffee menu is also splendid."
5,"I'm a food snob and a risk taker. I pulled into the parking lot faced with a difficult decision. Untested Mexican or Thai food for dinner. I read the yelp reviews for both, as any patriotic American would,  opted for mucho taco and was seriously disappointed.  I only ordered 6 tacos. Yes I did get the complimentary chips and salsa (also 5 stars). But I'm afraid the craving for more cannot be sated by any fewer than 20 of these perfect tacos. Generous pricing, a clean restaurant and excellent service round out a top notch experience. Bravo mucho taco!"
5,"This place gets extra points for having food I can order for my kids which is not hamburgers and fries. We ordered the kids banana and strawberry crepe, and the chocolate chip waffles. They were a big hit! My wife and I shared at the BC breakfast with blueberry toast. The waiter was very courteous and we were quite impressed overall."
5,"Being former Shadyside residents turned suburbanites my husband and I often express our disappointment to now be surrounded by chain restaurants when we once surrounded by an array of unique cuisine options. Enter Wheelfish.

The menu is not overwhelming, focusing on BBQ and a few accompaniments. The specialty cocktail list has a nice array of selections. I really enjoyed my gin cocktail, Heart of Darkness. There's also a range of rotated craft beers and ciders.

My husband ordered the chili, which was very generous with the meats and had just the right amount of spice to it. The included cornbread was savory and well portioned with the chili. I went with the spinach and bacon salad, adding chicken and the sheep's milk feta from their beet salad. Perfection. We brought our (almost) 9 month old who happily helped us polish off the tomato bisque.

The staff was friendly and attentive, working together to ensure everyone was cared for and enjoying themselves. 

They also support local musicians by offering them space to perform for their patrons. 

The ambiance is very modern. Reclaimed wooden walls. Edison bulb light fixtures. Vintage window ceiling fixtures.

The pricing was also very fair. For the chili, tomato soup, salad, a beer and a cocktail we paid about $40 before tip. Definitely not a bad Friday out!"
5,"At first I started eating here because it is so close to my house. Now I keep coming back because it is darn good mexican food.  The parking lot is a little scary with massive potholes, but considering how some other restaurants nearby have such little parking I'll take the washed out gravel pit.  If you have a low rider you may want to be careful though.

They bring out 2 bottles of salsa, 1 hot and 1 mild.  The hot is too hot and the mild is too mild but when I mix them together (75% mild, 25% hot) I get a salsa that has a kick but is still edible.  I'm not a heat seeker so I'm sure some would find the hot salsa to be fairly mild.  The chips are thick and have good flavor.

I've had a few things on the menu and I have been happy. Never too salty or too bland which seems to be how some Mexican restaurants are.

I will be back many more times."
5,"Delicious and super cheap! Pretzel sandwiches- lots of variety, flakey and savory rolls.  Awesome homemade soft pretzels at 60 cents a piece. 

Who doesn't love a soft pretzel?"
5,"I came here with some friends last weekend for their vegan brunch, and I can't say enough good things about it! I got the chick'n and waffles and it was genuinely the best vegan meal I've ever had. I might start requesting Saturdays off of work so I can get brunch every weekend! Pretty quick service and a very nice facility."
5,"I'm glad I came to this store, employees are very friendly, especially Gina Ayala she took care of us, she had the best customer service on the strip. I appreciate her service and sincere customer service. I would definitely come here again, thanks to Gina."
5,"VEGAN HEAVEN!! THIS IS IT! RIGHT HERE, IN MARKHAM!

I'm so happy I found this place and it's so great because it's fully vegan.
So much yums... I don't understand why this place is never packed, if this was situated downtown, it'd definitely do very well. (Name me at least 5 vegans in markham that you know. Exactly) 

I came here twice so far and I la-la-love it. What blows my mind is the 'salmon sashimi' and fake salmon.... omfg, it's ridiculous how close it tastes to the real thing, texture wise. It's everything salmon was to me except it doesn't have a fishy smell AND it's cruelty free - 100% approve! That smell that smells smelly. Even my omnivore friend was mind blown by how good it was.

Also, the fake chicken tripped me the helllll out. The texture was on point and I lowkey got scared. The sauce was tasty as well and gave me a flashback of my love for teriyaki chicken back then. Such a good replacement and tasted exactly the same.

Honestly it's kind of expensive, considering real fish isn't used but it's a great vegan friendly treat and it's nice to know we have one here in Markham aka meat-lovers land!"
5,"I don't really know what to do with my life now that I've been here. The variety is immense and its the best sushi I have ever had as a meat-eater and as a now vegan of many years. It just can't be beat. The AYCE had so many delicious options and was a measly $20.  The mock fish made me nervous but the textures were beautiful and the flavour mild yet complementary to the veggies. How can I just go back to eating sub par cucumber rolls now?? 
This place is just so far away from me and all other veg sushi is ruined forever. How is this gem in Markham and not in Toronto?? This is making me want to finally learn how to drive. 
I'm distraught but so impressed. If you can, go here and try as many things as possible. Take your friends. TAKE ME. Demand the owner to open a downtown location. Aah!!"
5,Great smoked meats and overall good menu. Loved the pulled pork nachos. Nice atmosphere. Definitely visiting again.
5,Great vegan spot. Not a ton of healthy but a whole lotta flavor and bar type food you may miss from your meat eating days. We had the squaker salad. It was terrific. Not coated in sauce just little diced faux grilled chicken lightly dipped in wing sauce. There was a little vegan ranch drizzled but a cup on side so didn't weigh down the salad. Also ordered the meatball marinara and it was amazing. Sauce was very good and the balls full of Italian flavors. Lastly had the boy blue sandwich with a sweet BBQ sauce. Definitely coming back.
5,"If you are looking for EXCELLENT Mexican food - this is your place. The prices are great and the food is terrific! Nowhere in town will you get better refried beans - yes, they use lard but if you are wanting health food go to a salad bar!! If you want the best mexican food - go to Mucho Taco. My favorites are the #1 Taco, Enchilada, Rice & Beans or the Carnita Torta!! Yum! Yum!!
The employees are great and attentive and the restaurant is clean - big bonus!!"
5,"We moved from Pittsburgh to Seattle a year and a half ago. I make my mother in law come down here every so often and express-mail us a couple dozen to freeze. They're THAT good. I am incapable of going to the South Side without a stop here. (And yes, they freeze well. Not as good as fresh, but you can't get a decent pretzel for love or money on the left coast.)

One tip: if it's before 2pm, don't go in the front door. Walk a block up or down Carson, walk away from the water, and then go down Carey Way, the alley behind it. They have a back entrance that goes straight into the bakery, where you may bask in pretzel-warmth AND buy them right out of the oven. No sandwiches or cookies or drinks back there, just pretzels, but OMG pretzel pretzel pretzel."
5,"I have never been disappointed with the service at Barney's. The staff is professional and friendly. I happen to shop there on a Tuesday night and was helped in my pursuit of some new clothes for the spring. The gentleman who helped me was very helpful with pairing items and offering suggestions without being pushy. I love this location. I have been to a few other locations around the country......I have never been disappointed.
Keep it up big B!"
5,"We were staying at The Palazzo and decided to check out Barney's. I was looking for some shoes, but did not find the exact ones I was looking for and my wife was looking for some cosmetics. She found the moisturizer she was looking for and it was not overly expensive. It was not cheap but the price was much better than I expected. Jennifer, in the cosmetics department was super. She was so friendly and helpful and gave us a number of great samples as well. I would shop here again."
5,Clutch chicken sandwich as always. No errors with my order. Line was long but worth the wait.
5,"How do you know a place is good? When you haven't even finished your first meal and you're already planning your next visit! This was my first visit ever to a Waffles INCaffeinated, and I got to enjoy it with a rather large party on a Saturday afternoon. The manager was very helpful and accommodating!

Now, for the food. My faith in humanity and homefries has been restored! (It's so easy to screw up potato, and it takes talent to make them taste amazing.) The epic homefries feature a mixture of a variety of potatoes - white, sweet, blue/purple, as well as green peppers and onions. Everything was extremely well seasoned (any more and it might be too salty), and the crispness of the potatoes was amazing. It was like eating cubed french fries or slightly more solid tater tots. Seriously, five stars for these little starches!!!

Waffles, because well...they're all about the waffles. I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer variety of toppings, and had a plan going into my meal. The in-restaurant menu had more pre-made options than what was online, and greatly helped my decision process. I opted for the Sacre-Bleu-berry (blueberry waffle, peach cream cheese in the middle, and more fresh blueberries on top.) To mine, I added raspberries because all those fruits together sounded delicious, and oh yes it was! The syrup options on the table were a vanilla bean syrup (simple syrup with vanilla bean highlights), and traditional syrup. I tried both syrups, and felt the vanilla bean was perfect with just a hint of sweetness.

Also, the coffee was coffee. If it's available, try a little vanilla syrup in it with your meal!

I look forward to going back and trying some of the savory options like the waffle with in-house made sausage gravy and some of the chorizo waffles."
5,"Wheelfish is worth the drive wherever you live in the greater Pittsburgh area! It is on Thompson's Run Road and I came from the Babcock Blvd side. There are many signs warning of the road being closed ahead, but the road is open to Wheelfish from this direction. Just ignore the detours. 

They have a small selection of craft draft beers and a much larger list of bottled crafts. I sat at the bar and enjoyed listening to the local patrons. This is their neighborhood bar. 

It was $2.00 Taco night so I ordered 2 with a salad and Mac n cheese. My salad was so fresh, with lovely greens and a homemade citrus vinaigrette. The Mac n cheese was just like mom used to make and topped with garlic breadcrumbs! Delicious!

The tortillas were brown on edges like they were warmed on the grill. YUM! My Pork taco was outstanding. So full of flavor! I tried each of the homemade BBQ sauces in separate bites. Every sauce was good, but I favored the Spicy Texas sauce. The Brisket taco was a little shy on the brisket but the green peppers and onions were so good and the chimchurri was excellent!

I will definitely return to this hidden gem BBQ place out in the wilds of the North Hills."
5,"My husband and I love this place. We've been here too many times to count since moving to the area. Delicious, fresh food with fantastic flavor EVERY time. I've had the burritos, tortas, chimichangas and tacos and I can't decide which one is the best. I highly recommend you check this place out! They are quick and friendly - perfect for lunch or for those nights you don't want to cook."
5,The best department store in the valley! I love their cosmetics counter. Staff is always gets me what I need without attitude or waistline my time. They also have a huge selection of handbags.
5,The best place for vegetarian Sushi. The tenon special was the best. I finished with the golden dragon. I recommend this place to everyone.
5,"I didn't think that vegan sushi would stand a chance against the 'real' stuff but it turns out that fish ARE friends and not food! Tenon is a Japanese restaurant (with some Chinese-ish fare) so you'll see things on the menu like bento boxes and maki rolls along side some roast duck and chicken dishes. We ordered:
- Gold Dragon Roll: They promised mango and they delivered on mango! 
The entire roll is covered with slivers of mango and mango sauce. You'd think it'd be too sweet but they balanced it really well with salt in the form of the BBQ sauce. Also what the heck?! How could vegetarian tempura shrimp taste so good?
- Tenon Roll: This roll was a lot of interesting textures and delicious flavors altogether. The outside is wrapped in the most delicately sliced king mushroom. The avocado and cream cheese filling in the middle makes it a dreamy one-bite.
- House Special Duck: The house duck really looked the part! The 'skin' on the duck was very crispy and the inside was definitely meat-like. It really amazing smoky BBQ like flavor. Also the bed of spinach it was served on was also flavored really well, which was a huge plus.
- Sweet Sour Eel: I'm not usually a huge fan of eel because of all the teeny tiny bones that you have to watch out for. That's obviously not a problem here! The eel pieces looked the part, had great flavor on their own, and when dipped in the sauce was fantastic. 
- Gyoza: The gyoza were also pretty good. A tasty filling. 
- Pineapple Chicken Fried Rice: The perfect starchy compliment to the meal. Lots of great filling and you never noticed that the chicken wasn't chicken. 
I was pretty much in awe of this meal. I was just so surprised that everything tasted so good even though it was meatless...maybe those vegans aren't so crazy after all?! I will comment that it was a teensy bit expensive considering that everything was meatless but well worth if if you're looking for the best vegetarian/vegan sushi in the GTA!"
5,"Made a bad night really special. 


On Nov 8th around 8:30pm, me and my boyfriend went to pick up some dinner after a crappy day, and an even crappier week. All I wanted to sooth my sorry soul, was a spicy chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A. We placed our order, and pulled through to pay for our food. I had knowingly left my wallet at home. so my boyfriend reached into his pocket to get his. He sighed deeply, and turned to me and said, ""I left my wallet in my backpack at home."" My stomach dropped, and I was pretty crushed, because seriously....all I wanted was a stupid chicken sandwich...

So we pull through, and I let a young blonde woman know that we forgot our wallets at home and couldn't pay for the food. She smiled and without missing a beat said, ""Don't worry this one is on us."" No guilt, no second guessing, just no problem and a smile.

Touched, we thanked her and pulled up to get our order. Not only did we get our (delicious) food, we also got a few extra of our favorite sauces as a little icing on the cake.

You didn't know how stressful our week had been. You didn't know that all I wanted was that chicken sandwich....you were just being kind to a stranger in your drive thru. I want you to know that this stranger really needed, and appreciated it. Young-blonde-woman-who's-name-I-don't-know, thank you for your kindness. And thanks Chick-Fil-A for empowering your employees to show that kind of compassion to your customers. 

It was the most delicious sandwich I ever ate :)"
5,"I love everything about Barney's of New York!  All the employees were very friendly. Especially, Genevieve the sales associate who helped me with my purchases. She was very knowledgable and personable. Didn't rush me at all when I was deciding on what perfume I wanted to purchase.. She also helped me pick out some Chanel Makeup and made sure that I had the right color of foundation to match my skin tone. I'm so happy with my purchases... Will surely come back and see her again for future purchases. Thank you Genevieve!"
5,"These guys have the BEST shoe selection (rivals that of Saks in NYC) and the service is FANTASTIC!  Also, the sales/markdowns are INSANE!!!"
5,"Great service and attentive staff.  Server explained and offered suggestions.  They had a special apple cider old fashion,  which was great!  
Fried deviled eggs-  must buy,  fantastic!   Tomato bisque was creamy and home made. The fried pork was tender and not tough.  The fried egg rolls were ok,  not my favorite.  Little to much wrapper and not enough ingredients. 
The chef or owner came by to check on us,  he was super friendly and made the experience better.
Overall I highly recommend and will be back to try more stuff."
5,"Best vegetarian sushi hands down. The general tao chicken is the best and tastes like chicken! All the ""meat"" dishes taste real and you can also buy the ingredients from the store. The red bean ice cream is also delicious."
5,"This place is really good! I wanted to go here for a while and finally did. The menu is big and there's a lot of good and customizable choices you can make. Since I love poutine I decided to get the Poutine Brgr with a root beer float. I chose the honey brown bun, chicken as the patty and Susie Q fries (curly fries) as a side. The burger was so good and bigger than it looks. The root beer float is hugeee my straw couldn't reach the bottom without tilting the mug. I was super full at the end. The service was also really good and I didn't have to wait long for my food. Definitely coming back here a few more times. 
The Poutine Burger is a success!"
5,Kayla Nennecke helped my friends and I to have a great time in Vegas setting us up for the clubs all weekend long! Call her when in Vegas (201) 741-8419
5,"This place is a pittsburgh MUST. I have been coming here for a long time and it just keeps getting better and better. My favorite item of theirs is their cinnamon sugar pretzel-- it is the best around. Their pretzels are soft and it is obvious that they are fresh. Their veggie pretzel is amazing- they have a ton of pretzel sandwiches which are awesome for lunches. Their mini pretzel pieces are so good and super cheap. Their baked items are incredible too! In the fall, I bought soft pumpkin cookies with white icing and they were literally the best pumpkin cookies I've ever had. I walked in the other week and they just had taken out tomato basil pretzels from the oven- oh my goodness... The mozzarella cheese was still melty and the tomatoes were hot- incredible. They also have an adorable back door with limited hours where you can purchase anything from the store plus bags of broken pretzels for a low price. I can go on all day about this place, it's perfect. They are super affordable and always are delicious!"
5,"These guys were great. I was passing through from Colorado Springs to Los Angeles and hit a board with nails in it.  Even though they were booked up, I got there first thing in the morning and they got my car done in about 35 minutes. I ended up replacing the tire - the puncture was on the sidewall and therefore unrepairable. I bought a pair of tires to keep things even left to right. So in 35 minutes they got two tires replaced, balanced,  mounted on the back and the existing pair moved to the front. Prices were reasonable, and the replacement tires are from the same manufacturer, slightly different but very similar model. Friendly, staff, highly recommended."
5,"I have been coming here for about 5 years and I love the food, the service and the price. The funny thing is... I can go to Abuelos and spend 40 dollars or I can go somewhere else, but I really like the ""no hassle"" service.

I don't ever need to wait for a table. The food is always fresh and available. 

I have had places like Olive Garden tell me they ran out lasagna or Paradise Bakery run out of mushrooms. 

I never have ever had a problem here. I love the enchiladas and fish tacos!
The burritos are pretty good too."
5,Had a good time. Sandwich was good. Barista was helpful with the menu. I'll bring a few bike riders with me next time. My visit was during the week so next it'll have to be the weekend for the expanded menu. I'm ready. One the customers on the way out mentioned it was one of their favorite spots for breakfast and went out of the way to get the breakfast bagel. Check it out for your self. Peace.
5,"Whew! This is three floors of MORE. More jewelry, more Coop, more bags, more cosmetics, more shoes - many, many more shoes. More sales too - the economy is suffering and the sales are ON, early. Go take advantage.

This store beats my Boston store due to it's size and selection - Stella McCartney, Dries Van Noten, home decor, etc etc. The staff? Not so much. Though I've had good service and met friendly people in both stores, Boston wins on style points. The men were what you'd expect, but, the women, not so much. Some were a little sloppy. Normally I wouldn't grade on this, but it was that remarkable. Sorry, but the staff needs to complement the store."
5,"Wheelfish is a great local bar/ restaurant with top of the line food and drink. As another reviewer mentioned, the food is not your typical bar fare, but delicious smoked meats and home cooked sides. I personally got the smoked chicken and sweet potato fries. Although it is true, these items are separate, I think my meal was only around $15, which is what you would pay if these items were sold together. Both were piping hot, chicken was super juicy, and fries crisped to perfection.

Even better than the food was a specialty drink called ""Make my Mule Mexican."" At first I thought this was tequila based, but to my delight it was not. It was a delicious vodka mule with a dash of jalapeno, to cut the sweetness of the mule. They have lots of craft beer for the beer snobs, but also reasonably priced American drafts for the traditionalists. 

When I visited Wheelfish, it was right after the opening, and although there were only two girls working, they ran their butts off, we stayed hydrated and had a great time listening to some live music. I was happy to hear that they do plan on expanding the menu to inculde more share-ables as they get some kinks worked out. 

I loved visiting this neighborhood bar, with such an eclectic feel."
5,"The Pretzel Shop is a tradition for myself and many of my friends. It's a taste that can't be duplicated: it's honest, satisfying and a connection to the historic South Side.

It's best to eat the pretzels warm, fresh, with mustard. There's nothing quite like it. They are soft and chewy with coarse salt and a distinct aroma. It's a taste of authentic Pittsburgh."
5,"Yum!! This is a gem in Mesa, whether you're a plant-based/vegetarian/vegan foodie or not!  I had the Squawker which is a buffalo ""chicken and mozzarella"" sandwich with a side salad yesterday... So good! And my sometimes soy-sensitive tummy didn't give me any troubles afterwards, which tells me it's quality ingredients.  The chicken substitute was not fried, which I like, and the cheese was some of the best I've had. I'm not a fan of ranch , but I actually found myself dipping my sammy into it a couple times. Good stuff! 

Coffee is also quite good. I only added a splash of coconut milk so I was able to enjoy the full flavor of the beans. 

The restaurant is clean and adorably vintage in decor, and the ladies that run it are very sweet. There was a brunch special of chicken and waffles that looked amazing (those waffles are huge and fluffy ) I'm aiming to get back out and give that a try next time its on the brunch menu. 
Two thumbs up!!"
5,"Love to come here for the fries and shakes! Delicious and quick, friendly service."
5,"RRL, LVC, Thom Browne...thank you Barneys

This and Chrome Hearts was probably the only stores I would spend my own money on in Vegas

Did I mention the great customer service?

It's a high end store, what do people not understand about the price? haha"
5,Ok vegan sushi?! How can I say anything bad?! I can't! Everything on the menu can be customized to be vegan (this is a vegetarian restaurant). Even my mom was amazed that what she was eating wasn't actually real shrimp! The service here is good and the restaurant is fairly large. I would honestly recommend any item off the menu. I come here for lunch and dinner and have never ever been disappointed! It's so nice to see a vegan restaurant so close to work and home!
5,"We probably ordered too much food but it's hard to decide when you live far away and don't know when you will be back.

This was our second visit and we stick to the Japanese menu and ordered things we can't get at home. Our sushi feast included 4 special rolls, 4 regular rolls, 2 hand rolls, and 1 appetizer.  

All the rolls had the rice on the outside and one of our special rolls, the Montreal Roll, was tempura roll where the entire roll is battered and fried. After scanning the menu for tempura rolls, In thought there were none so that was a pleasant surprise. 

Tenon is very generous with the avocado which I very much appreciated. My favorite roll was topped with avocado, a zillion thing slices crowded together. The king mushroom special roll was another favorite. It's five pieces and topped with 5 large bonus pieces of tempura mushroom in addition to the tempura mushroom inside the roll.

As soon as we sat down, they brought us a hot pot of complementary green tea. The tea was permeated with the flavor of toasted rice and was quite lovely.

A note to vegans - the items on the menu with cream cheese are not labeled with the red dot meaning ""contains eggs or dairy"" but I do believe they are made with dairy cream cheese. I first this I ordered was Philadelphia roll and the last thing I said was that we wanted the food vegan. The Philadelphia roll came without cream cheese so I can only assume the cream cheese is not vegan.  For some reason the red dot only appears next to items with mayonnaise.

There are lots of types of vegan seafood - salmon, crab, shrimp, as well as meat - chicken, duck, beef, etc. 

Highly recommended. I'm sure everything is delicious."
5,"If you're reading this review, you know about Discount Tire. I've always had exceptional service at this location. There's typically a wait but I know there's an option of setting an appointment that just doesn't always work with my schedule. Just another great experience today with a rotation and balance. Highly recommend All Discount Tires and if this is the one close to home you're not going to go wrong."
5,Loved this place today during lunch! Not too busy and great food. Avocado delight was a great appetizer for 2 and no carb.
5,Great customer service! The guys working here are always full of energy positive attitudes and they care about my tires. Allot of team work here so refreshing to see the energy levels and everyone hard at work !!
5,"All. Time. Favorite. Store.  

If I had a million dollars, I'd blow it all on a cocaine binge (kidding!) and this place (not kidding!). 

They have a great selection of cutting edge designers like Alexander Wang, Proenza Schouler, and 3.1 Phillip Lim--all under one roof! It's fabulous! I challenge you to find a Proenza Schoulder PS1 bag (or a selection this large) anywhere else in Vegas.

Moreover, Barneys is the only place in Las Vegas where you'll find the eco-friendly Monique Pean jewelry line.  It's expensive, but it's fossilized wooly mammoth, recycled gold, and conflict-free diamonds.  I'm not going to sermonize you, but I know staying away from blood diamonds is important to some.

Overall, I think my favorite thing about Barneys is that they don't skew ostentatious.  They're more about edgy fashion than in-your-face displaying of brand labels (I get it, you blew a lot of money on that Louis Vuitton).  I'm really happy this store is in Vegas .....although I can't afford 90% of it."
5,Everyone loves their burger when we stopped by here for lunch. Very accommodating restaurant that even offered to do bunless burgers. The deserts looked absolutely amazing. Definitely want to come back and have their kitchen sink desert which has every ice cream flavour and very topping in a miniature kitchen sink.
5,Michelle did all the arrangements to get me and my friends into XS night swim with ease. She was super friendly and responsive when I emailed her. Had an incredible time.
5,"Great location, the restaurant looks new and neat clean. the price is right, the food is awesome and the staff is very friendly. We are definitely coming back"
5,"The best pretzels in town!

When any of my coworkers has to go near the South Side they stop by and get a big bag of pretzels to share with everyone in the office.
Not only you get salted or unsalted pretzels but they also have stuffed pretzels and even pizza pretzels. A great place to stop by for a quick and economical lunch/dinner/snack.
Here you get quality and price. Don't be fooled by imitations. This place has been open for decades; there's a reason for that."
5,"Way too crowded while live music was playing. My suggestion is either buying a bigger building considering enough money is definitely being made, but more urgently telling the waiters to stop pressing up against me with boners undoubtably from the lust of my undeniably attractive body"
5,"Soo good, if u are eating only vegetarian foods this place u must eat, everything so nice"
5,Store Manager and assistant Manager were super helpful and friendly. They saved me from not coming to them at all. We had a BAD experience with the store on Baseline and Greenfield. We had such a bad experience there that we almost didn't give market st a second look. But we tried again and they came through with shining colours. I will be getting tires from them in the future!
5,"Diamond in the rough. I was looking for a spot between here and there and Wheelfish was the perfect fit this evening.

I started with Smoked Georgia Peach cocktail. It was fresh, boozy and had a light smoked flavor. For dinner I ordered the Roasted Beet Salad with Salmon and a Blueberry Corn Muffin. The salad was tossed perfectly with a citrus vinaigrette. I enjoyed all of the components of yellow raisins, sheep milk feta and candied pecans. The salmon was smoked to perfection and had a glazed crust which hit the spot. I thought the corn muffin was dry and the server promptly told me she would comp it. 

From the service, to the delicious food, to the great rustic atmosphere of an old barn, I thoroughly enjoyed Wheelfish and will be back."
5,"When I crave homemade Mexican food but I'm at work far from home, this place is just as good! The people working there are really nice, work hard and make great food! THIS IS NOT A HOLE IN THE WALL, the place is very clean and the great service I get surprises me every time."
5,"We all know the granny that say she puts that stuff on everything. You know, the red hot granny. No, the brand Red hot sauce, not...I don't even want to know what you were thinking. 

Buffalo sauce is my weakness. I go through a liter each week. Do I have stomach issues? Maybe. Is it worth it? Definitely. 

So when I saw that they had a vegan buffalo chicken sandwich that I could wash down with a vegan latte, I got in my car to drive THIRTY MINUTES just to enjoy this sandwich. 

It was worth the time and effort. I went on a Saturday morning. They had live music (he was incredible), a fundraising event going on, and arts and craft. The staff was so incredibly nice. 

The sandwich: Fell apart a bit, would not get it on sourdough next time if another option was available. The ranch was absolutely perfect. 

The latte: Wonderful espresso. Carefully crafted. 

The salad: My favorite part. It was so fresh and crisp. I ended up eating the excess chicken with it. 

I'd recommend this for a coffee date or kids that do well with music in the mornings."
5,"We went to Wheelfish yesterday for our anniversary.  It is a small joint in the middle of Mccandless, and we are so glad we found it!  My husband is a BBQ fiend, and he drags me to every BBQ in and around Pittsburgh.  This place is the real deal.  Food is reasonably priced, fresh, delicious and smokey perfection.  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We had the pulled pork nachos... All people should try these nachos, they are amazing! The pulled pork is one of the BEST we've ever had, they make their own queso AND chips! SO DANG GOOD!!  My hubs had the smoked salmon and the brisket and I had the brisket. Everything is great, the fish was delicious and the brisket was tender and sooo good.  

They have a full bar and lots of local beers.  They also have a cooler with bottles, lots of random beers- seasonal, ciders, etc...  It was great for a picky beer drinker like me!  

We will most definitely be going back!"
5,"Amazing! Don't waste your time with the sandwiches or pizza--all that stuff just gets in the way of the main event: the pretzel! Best pretzel in the city.  Best anything in the anywhere. Cheap, too. Only complaint: not open late enough."
5,"I was looking for a place where I could get a frothy cup of coffee. Lately that's all I've been craving. So naturally I yelped coffee shops and the Nile Coffee Shop popped up. 

We headed there for the coffee but found a gem for delicious vegan cuisine. The menu is quite extensive for a coffee shop. Everything is vegan. I got the buffalo chicken. It came on toasted bread with my choice of a side salad. The sandwich was mouthwatering. The buffalo sauce had a bit of a kick to it and left your mouth wanting more. The salad came with a balsamic vinaigrette, so nice and sweet but not too sweet. The combination was the perfect amount of food. 

For my drink I ordered the cappuccino. And yes it was perfectly frothy. In my quest for the perfect cup of coffee, I found exactly what I wasn't looking for. Now I have a new breakfast/brunch/lunch/coffee spot to look forward to."
5,Best promoter hands down. Michelle helped in putting me into XS two nights in a row with very little time given in advanced. She was also very clear on where to go and check in and even offered other venues because she can get you anywhere! Trust her and your Vegas experience will be one to remember.
5,"I've loved the Pretzel Shop for much of my life! We used to have pretzel day in school and we could bring money to buy a twisted soft pretzel from the shop. And my dad would always bring home a big bag full anytime he was working near the South Side shop. 

Now that I'm older, I go in for the awesome sandwiches. It's such a treat to get the chicken salad or just plain old turkey and cheese on a pretzel bun. I always get mine warmed up and usually buy a can of pop with it, then take it to one of the outside tables to people watch while I eat. I almost always can find parking right outside the shop since it's not in the crazy crazy part of East Carson. 

It's such a simple shop, with no gimmicks. I love that. It's a Pittsburgh staple and I hope it's always around!"
5,"Went here for taco Tuesday, and the tacos were great! Good dollar special tacos autenticos. The chorizo tacos were especially good. Nice atmosphere, good drink specials, and not too expensive! Definitely coming back!"
5,"Yes. Just yes. This place is fantastic. Not only is it full of character and mood lighting, but they have a 100% vegan menu. Am I vegan? No. Can I appreciate some kick ass vegan cuisine? Yes!
The avocado toast is amazing. I obviously wouldn't be a millennial if I didn't order it. Hubs had the ""soyrizo"" (chorizo) southwest bagel sandwich. He was very skeptical at first, but he loved it. Even wanted to order a second one.
The coffee is good, not great, but suits me just fine for an afternoon of working and snacking.
We will definitely be back to try more sandwiches and salads!"
5,I love this store! The sales associates are very helpful and friendly. I had been searching for a particular pair of louboutin boots and couldn't find my size anywhere. Justin finally found me a pair and had them promptly shipped to me. He was extremely helpful with everything.
5,"I absolutely love Tenon, cause it was the first vegetarian and vegan Japanese restaurant I've ever been to, and it's not super far (like in downtown). They offer both vegetarian and vegan options!! They used to offer all you can eat, but they stopped a little while ago! They still have a great dinner menu though- when I went for dinner after they stopped their AYCE, I ordered a vegan duck noodle soup, but the ""duck"" was actually just bean curd rolls - which was still very nice and I enjoyed it. It also came with a good substantial amount of noodles, soup, bean sprouts, and a side of lime! 

My friend had a tofu pad Thai and the portion size was pretty big, so she couldn't finish the whole thing. We could've probably shared that pad Thai and maybe had a small side dish as dinner to be honest! 

The seating areas are really nice, it's tidy and clean, there's a washroom that's kept clean, and both the chef and server are really nice!!"
5,"5 stars!   Yes, I did.....

First off, as other Yelpers mentioned, this is a ""hidden gem"" and not only is it off the beaten path, it is so far off the path, that the path disappears, you hit B.F.E., then go another 100 miles.....

My experience was totally Yelp random.    I was at the Three Rivers Harley Davidson Dealership and searched for BBQ, this place popped up.  I am so happy that it did!!!!

Getting down to business-----

1.  Deep Fried Deviled Eggs - The best I have ever had.  The Bullet bourbon bacon jam with a jalapeño is a killer combination.  The bread crust gives it a snap, yet the inside is devilishly delish!   

2.  The Chopping Block - Warning!  Addictive as hell!   Crispy Pork Bites are to die for, in fact, after it was all said and done, I ordered an order just of the bites.  Marinated pork butt then fried.   So basically, you have a caramelized crust with a fatty inside, can you say ""flavor explosion""?  Bacon is to die for, I could live on their bacon alone.   Kielbasa was to be expected, pretty good smoked flavor (I am not a Kielbasa expert).   Bacon jam and chili hurry - yes please!!!!!!    One bitch, its small and not really shareable.   I could prob eat two of these!!!!

3.  Brisket - Very good smoked flavor with a perfect crust.    They slice to order.  Perfect!

4.  Homemade BBQ sauces.   What?   Yes!!!!   All equally phenomenal..

Jonathan, who is local, was my bartender.    Great personality.   The ""executive chef"" ---- BBQ has an exec chef, wtf? ---- was friendly and chatty, explaining his secrets.    They do a great job, it is a pity that they are about 10 miles way past B.F.E.   I was there for lunch, but it looks like it would be a great place to hang out and listen to music, I was liking the craft beer list and bourbon list!!!!!!!!    As General MacArthur said, ""I shall return"""
5,"A delightful restaurant for those who are vegan or for those who just want to place less meat into their mouths. Their service is extremely satisfactory with a wonderful assortment of delicious dishes to choose from. Their location is within Peachtree Plaza / New Kennedy Square (facing Kennedy) so if possible, avoid the prime busy times to dine there, such as on Friday evenings or on the weekends when parking is extremely difficult to acquire."
5,"PRETZELS - YASS! 
My husband stops every couple weeks and grabs us some tasty pretzels. They are always fresh, and sometimes still warm! He recently visited and just wanted to double check that their pretzels are vegan friendly. They are! Also, the kind woman working told him they have quite a few vegan options and so he brought me home a pumpkin cinnamon spice pretzel with a vegan cream cheese dip. It was AMAZING! 
I obviously had to visit for myself this afternoon and all the girls working were super friendly and got the orders quickly. 
Did I mention the vegan cream cheese dip???? Yum yum yum!"
5,Exceptional vegan food.  Staff is always friendly and polite.   Love the squawker sandwich.  Everything is super fresh
5,The use of Nowait now Yelp is the best thing ever. The service is second to none and they remember thier repeat customers well. Good job guys.
5,"Kayla, Michelle, and Jenn are AMAZING!! They never fail to get us in anywhere we want to go and always get us free drink tickets!! Everything always goes smoothly when dealing with them and you know that's not an easy thing to find!"
5,"This is a great shop. They have a clean and spacious lobby, a quick to interact staff, and they engage with customers eagerly and patiently. We have all of our vehicles tired here and have only ever experienced tremendous customer service and efficient work on our vehicles. Assistant manager Brian Black has been a great help. There are lots of Discount Tires in the east valley, but this one has been the best we've found in our six years here."
5,"1st time & definitely won't be the last!!!! We ordered the poutine burger & chaplin franky burger.
Everything was delicious.
Also did a takeout for some friends for chili & brownies for desserts 
Thumbs up all the way around.
Waiter was George..whom to quote Tina Turner is
""Simply the best""!!!!!"
5,Excellent bar food!  Tucked away location worth it. Band was excellent and welcome surprise too. Order the nachos or wings the do not disappoint!!
5,"Went into the restaurant and waited to be seated. Had a seat for 2. Lots of seating.  Restaurant was clean. Server came over quickly and was super pleasant.  I ordered the Carnivora Omelet with a side order of bacon and rye toast with coffee. My guest had the Megaberry with a side order of sausage. Order arrived quickly. The omelet with the egg on top was delicious. Filled with bacon, sausage, ham, cheddar cheese, chicken.  My guest Megaberry Waffle was huge. It had blueberries and raspberries on the inside and berries on top with whipped cream and a vanilla  bean sauce.  My guest advised that the waffle was soft and the berries were delicious. The sausage patties were large."
5,"Loving this place, I came across by chance a few months ago , very small place hidden in a shopping center , great carnitas , tripas and tortas ! Good service , I usually order for pick up and they get my order just right ! Lots of flavor and great prices"
5,Yummy eat em ups thanks hot food great people who very assertive and showed much more care than most places. Highly recommended
5,"What ingredients go into pretzels anyway?  I don't know - but apparently The Pretzel Shop in the South Side has found a way to mix in magic... cuz HOT DARN these are some fantastic pretzels!

Go once and you'll be back again and again and again.  You will not be disappointed (somewhere... Lou Pappan is guaranteeing that statement)."
5,Why would anyone get tires at someplace that is not a Discount Tire? They are without a doubt the best! I remember going to discount with my dad over 30 years ago. They haven't changed. In fact they are better. Their service is the best.  Today a group of 5 customers including myself waited out front for the doors to open. Promptly at 8am the managers and several of the staff came out and immediately assisted all 5 customers. This place rocks!! Need a flat fixed free? Come here. Need your tires rotated free? Come here. Want the best priced tires? Cone here.
5,"Love their chicken sandwiches and biscuits! Their lemonade is awesome, as well. The service at this location is always fast and friendly. The food is hot and fresh. I stop here pretty often for breakfast on my way to work. You can order a sandwich instead of a biscuit for breakfast, if you prefer! :)"
5,"Went in to get help in the Men's dept.
Was greeted by a kind woman who led me to Luis Torres in the Men's dept.
He was most helpful getting my bow tie to make it come together( not a clip on)
Anyway he was patient and kind to help me out during a wardrobe crisis.
Thanks Luis Torres you saved the evening."
5,"I've been here once and the food is pretty good.  We got 3 different burritos.  My husband didn't want anything, so the kids and I cut the burritos into 3 and I got to taste each burrito.

Each were really yummy.  I think one was a chili relleno, another carne asada, and chorizo and egg.  Each burrito was $4.95.  They weren't gigantic burritos like Filiberto's, but they were a good size.  

It took them awhile to make them, but well worth the wait.  The place was nice and clean and no real issues."
5,"I am totally IN LOVE with Barneys at the Palazzo. Crazy love. This location is definitely better than the SF Barneys. The interior is very spacious and the stairs leads to four levels of heaven. The handbags and shoe sections are so much bigger than SF. Plus their selection is very extensive. Even my BF thought Barneys was really nice. The COOP floor was easy to browse and the service was very nice & friendly. 

I can't wait to go shopping again!"
5,"Best part about this store?  Totally freaking empty.  Scored a sweet wallet for half price, a shirt from apc, also half price AND it kept my wife occupied for two plus hours while my buddy and I hit the sports book at the Mirage.

Sales staff here is SUPERIOR- had multiple helpful, relaxed encounters with sales people who all had the same attitude ""take your time, let me know if you have any questions, buy when you feel like it.""

What retail should be inside or outside of Las Vegas."
5,"Brought the in-laws here since they're from out of state and as usual, this place did not disappoint. Suggested the ribs to them, my go to, and they loved them! Thanks for making their week stay great!"
5,"There are only two Balenciaga retailers in the Las Vegas area. One is Neiman Marcus and the other is the new Barney's at the Palazzo. I was so jazzed to find this store in our hotel....walking a few hundred yards to drool over Bbags instead of having to go to the fashion mall? So all over it.

We got to Vegas at noon, had lunch...and by 2pm I already had a bag on hold for me at Barneys.

I wussed out though, it was just a little too much $$ for me to make the split decision to take it home with me without further thought. However, I did find an awesome pink patent Marc Jacobs tote that was quite affordable...averitable bargain for Barneys.

The service was awesome...the salesgal who helped me was amazing, she went in the back 3-4 times to look for various Bbag colors or styles, and when I left with the $120 bag instead of the $1200 bag, she was still chipper and friendly. 

Awesome selection of shoes as well, a ton of Louboutins. Wish I could justify $700 for a pair of shoes, but man all you do is walk on dirty-ass streets with them. I'm a bag girl for sure."
5,"Finally a sushi restaurant where a vegetarian can eat everything on the menu! Their sushi is very good and fresh. Lots of variety to choose from. They also serve faux meat dishes and thai food, but I have not tried that yet (except for the faux beef skewer which was good). Definitely the best sushi place I've been to"
5,This was a great Barneys.  Not as big as L.A. but waaay better than San Francisco.  The service was much nicer as well.  The store was pretty quiet so I had a lot of attention.  GREAT shoe selection!
5,"Thanks to Viva Las Guest List I had the best trip to Vegas! Michelle and Kayla were so helpful in planning my nightclub guest lists I don't know how I could have done it without their service. I hadn't been to Vegas before so I didn't really know what to expect, but luckily my friend sent me the name of their service. And WOW did they answer my texts quickly! They put my friends and I on the guest lists for the best clubs for FREE and we even scored some free drinks from their guest list. Awesome service."
5,"Yesterday before the storm was my second visit to this foodie heaven with the blissfulness of the 1950's.

J'y étais avec des très bons et amusants yelp-o-friends et on c'est bien empiffrer de repas léger (toux) et milkshake infini.

J'adore ce dinner à l'américaine avec son menu très varié, les portions sont énormes et c'est ce que vous voulez quand vous venez ici.

Des burgers de 1/4 de lbs à 1 lbs,  que vous choisirez les pains, les sauces et ... surtout les accompagnements!  Oh my god!  Mac n Cheez, frites délicieuses, onion rings, poutine etc...

Then, you have a taste for the american south west?  No problem try like me (see picture) the great Chicken Waffle sandwich Southern Confort!  Sweet & Sour!   I had mine with a Mac & Cheeze Poutine!

Cherry coke?  Here, you get the real deal from the fifties:  A large glass of coca-cola where they poor in with marascin cherry sirop!!  Miam!

If after you bugers, chickens & all salty greasy goodness you're still hungry.

Pas de problème!  You could have a sink of ice "" scream "" lol  to share with your friends  et si vous commander un milkshake vous avez votre verre plus le stanless steel content with all the rest!  This is amazingly what I call tu es servi comme une reine et un roi ici et tu en as pour ton argent.

Parlant service!  Excellent service, courtois, attentionné!  C'est incroyable quand tu penses que c'est toujours plein, avec file d'attente et que ton serveur et ses aids sont toujours attentionnés pour ta gang!   
By the way hi-5 to Taso tonight Friday 21st September with this blackout following the Gatineau tornado!  The way he handle the close & payment was amazing!   He even took I nice picture of our group in the dark that Kandi posted.

The server is helped by whom I call runners & your food come fresh & warm very soon after you order!  This too is amazing & you don't feel rush even if they rush!   Very awesome experience!  

We even have a covert of Leonard Cohen Hallelujah by a very interesting gentleman that work there!  Missed his name... Maybe my friends do? 

And finally:  it's a must go west island & at all if you are hungry & like my stepdaughter you like the 1950's oldies sounds & food!

Cheers!"
5,"This place was great the food was incredible. And the staff was super helpful. They have gluten, soy free vegan options so my wife was thrilled"
5,"Why is it that Chick-fil-A seems to have great customer service at almost every location? Why can't the other fast food chains get it right like these guys? Friendly employees (none of which I saw using a cell phone on-duty), fast service and my order is always right. Keep it up Chick-fil-A, whatever you're doing is working! :O)"
5,"My 400th review! And a 5 star one at that - toot toot!

I am so glad I use yelp for this exact reason. I've been in the Charlotte area for almost two years now and I've found another great salon. 

Great, new, clean salon with all top quality OPI and CND products. This seems like it's not a big deal but do some research and trust me it matters. Plenty of salons are using cheap products that look like they're high end since everything is poured into generic bottles. I've been getting acrylics for 10 years now; there's good, bad and really ugly when someone hurts you because they're saving money. 
The owner, Michael has no secrets and everything he uses he's got for sale for customers - top coats, scrubs, instant dry oils, lotions. There are tons of regular polish colors to choose from in addition to gel polishes. 

My tech did an awesome job and I was given a discount I didn't even know was coming and my broken nail was fixed for free! Can't beat the customer service. The two employees I talked to were super nice and happy to be there which is a plus. 

There's parking on both sides of the salon - street and spots. I will be back and next time I'm getting a pedicure. Wish I needed one today because I would've gone for it. This is going to be the ideal place for a girls day out - get something to eat on Central Ave and come treat ourselves to nails nearby."
5,Best nail salon in the area. Worth the extra few bucks. You will be taken care of. They are clean and use quality products. Accommodating and respectful. Lovely decor too. A must try if you care for quality nail work.
5,"What can I say about Puff Vapors? They helped me with my transition from smoking almost 2 years ago when I purchased my first pen from them. But that's what they do. How they treat people is the main reason I will always go to them and recommend their shop. No matter how my day is going I leave the shop with a smile on my face. Everyone is so welcoming, humble, supportive and helpful. They go beyond ""good customer service"".  You can't find better juice flavors anywhere. Not that I've tried to cause I'm loyal, and we have a good thing going Lol. Thanks for everything you do guys"
5,Excellent service in a very contemporary office with a lot of newer technology to assist patients.
5,"My dental exam experience at Dee for Dentist was very nice:  Professional, Friendly, and Relaxing. I highly recommend."
5,"What can I say about Puff Vapors? Well, Puff is the go to vape shop in Vegas. They have everything you could possibly need! They stay up to date on what's new in the market, so that means they always have the newest and latest gear available for purchase. They make their own juice in house with tons of great flavors! My favorites are... Dew in the pink, Ferrari, yabba dabba doo, and lemon cheesecake. They have great prices and always offer specials and discounts via their email mailing list.. so sign up! The staff is amazing and super friendly, after visiting a couple times you'll feel like you are going to visit your friends, it's almost like a family over there. Scott the owner is an awesome and humble dude, if you're a fan of the San Diego Chargers you may just get a small discount if you catch him in the shop haha. The staff is very helpful with any questions you may have and they are very knowledgable. They don't charge for builds on your RBA's, but you can give them a tip if you so desire. If you're thirsty while in the shop they have a water dispenser and sometimes kuerig coffee that you can make for yourself. It is an awesome place with a great location, they are always playing some good music or have something interesting playing on the TV hung on the wall. There are some comfortable couches you can lounge on and blow some clouds while relaxing. The juice is top notch and you can test all the flavors at the juice bar, where they have a menu with all their flavors... They have literal TON of juice flavors to choose from. Stop by and say hi if you're in the area and grab yourself a new piece or some ml's of their juice... Tell them trouble makin' Joe sent you."
5,"Best Ice Cream in the City.  Pricier than chain ice cream places, but the price is relative to the quality of the ingredients that Ed's uses (such as Amarena Fabbri Wild Cherries).  The only downside to Ed's is the constant lineups that extend out the door, but since their service is fast this is really just a testament to how good their ice cream is and not an indicator of a inefficiently run shop."
5,"This place, and Physical Therapist Dr. Lindsay Whipple specifically, has given me my life back!  I have been coming here for about 6 weeks now and the results have been unbelievable.  I can't say enough about Dr. Whipple and the physical therapy staff of AZSDS.  Dr. Whipple is extremely knowledgeable, she spends a great amount of time with her patients, makes herself very accessible, and really cares about her patients.  As much as I'm ecstatic for being relieved of my sore neck, I'm actually going to miss my weekly visits and seeing the staff of this place.  Now if THAT doesn't say how great this place is, I don't know what does.  
Thank you Lindsay!  Hand pound - Jelly Fish!  :-)"
5,"I've been receiving chiropractic care for the past 10 years, and this practice is absolutely the best. After being sidelined for almost a year with 2 herniated discs, Dr. Rudd had me back up and running (literally) within 6 weeks. The combination of ART, decompression, and massage has been a lifesaver and got me back on the path to being and long distance runner again. The staff as a whole is awesome, I wouldn't go anywhere else."
5,"Dr. Stone is awesome! It's very difficult these days to find a pain specialist that truly listens, shows empathy, and offers alternative treatment options. His medical assistant, Kathy, promptly follows up with my insurance company to make sure that I receive approval for my injections on time. Also, my medications are electronically sent over to my pharmacy, which is great because that's one less trip! I have also seen Tina Trettor, NP for general health issues and she is fabulous as well. The wait time has always been quick, and my time spent with Dr. Stone and Tina have never felt rushed. Everyone is personable, professional, and demonstrates a strong quality of care."
5,"Hands down the best shop in town to go for e juice!!! Truely amazing customer service, every flavor is out of this world, 
I wish they would open another shop on the north end side of las vegas, but the drive 17.2 miles is worth the drive. 
Plus 20% off for military, these guys are huge supporters of our armed services."
5,"Great service, awesome burger. Wife had grilled chicken sandwich, and was best she had in a long time. Cold beers, tons of TV's and good friends. Recipe for a great night."
5,I absolutely love Dee for Dentist!!! I have incredibly sensitive teeth so cleanings can be painful but every time I go in Kristen is so careful and I experience little to no pain. They pay attention to detail and they really have your best interest at heart. I believe in the work they do as I recommend them to all my friends and family. I've been going here for 3 years and don't plan on changing.
5,"If there was one annoyance when it comes to going to an ice cream parlour, it's choosing which ice cream flavour you wish to have a one-night stand with. Oh sure, you can double up on scoops, but come on, I'm not an animal...

Ed's Real Scoop is no exception to this annoyance. They have an abundance of flavours that go beyond your chocolates and vanillas (not that I'm one to slam the classics). Creme brule, Dulce de leche, Chocolate Banana, French Mint...

Why are you still reading this? GO NOW!

Also, I challenge anyone on their way there to find a better aroma to walk into than homemade waffle cones. Spoiler Alert: You won't."
5,"Absolutely love their pizza!  So glad that we stumbled across this restaurant & their delicious Chicago style pizza!  Our family has pizza night every Sunday night & this is our new go-to place.  The sauce is amazing, the cheese is great & the crust is done perfectly.  Highly recommend to all."
5,"I swear this is my new favorite salon. I've never gone to the same nail salon twice. This is literally in the best lively location! I have to admit I have horrible manly, short, ugly nails and they definitely do wonders"
5,Rivals Is consistent in their service and the beer and food choices. They have a chef who delivers great entrays. The wings are always consistent in doneness and flavor. They are getting ready to expand into another location formally owned by Fatheads. I expect nothing short of greatness. Thanks.
5,"Dee for Dentist is by far the BEST dental office I have ever been to. The staff is wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable. When you call in to ask questions or check on an appointment, it's like talking to an old friend. The office is clean, beautifully decorated and it's like they have anticipated everything you'll need, before you arrive. There's coffee, tea and water in the lobby, charging stations for your electronics, netflix movies to watch during your visit and tooth brushes and mouth wash to clean up before your appointment. The staff talks you through every step of the procedure you're receiving and are attentive to your concerns and questions. I've had some bad dentist in the past that were rude and grump jerks, this isn't one of those places! I love this office. Will definitely be going here from now on!"
5,"This place is heavenly! A very extensive and delicious gelato and ice cream selection and great people working there willing to give you samples before picking out your flavour(s) for the day. 

Although a bit further away from the downtown core, I love heading out to the Beaches for some ice cream and a stroll in the area and down by the water on a hot summer night. Beautiful!"
5,The food here is amazing! Authentic Mediterranean food with the ambience rich in culture. You can find the restaurant inside of the market.
5,"Delicious, inexpensive and large portions...  Had the chicken shawarma platter, fatoush salad and hummus...  Well done, Al-Hana!!  Will be back often.."
5,"My husband and I love this place! They seriously have the best juice and customer service is amazing!!! Justin ROCKS he is very helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive to the customers needs"
5,"I had a great experience at Dee for Dentist!  I first noticed how friendly and genuine the staff is from the front desk all the way to Dr. Dee Dee herself.  Everyone was easy to talk to and seemed eager to answer all your questions while making you feel comfortable.

The next big thing I noticed was the amazing technology.  Aside from the standard X-rays, you received full photos of all of your teeth! This was displayed on the TV right in front of you.  It's so hard to take a look at your teeth from certain angles (especially the ones in the back) so  I found that super interesting.  You are able to see exactly what Dr. Dee Dee is talking about as she explains the situation of each tooth.  The cavities are even highlighted in red!

Unfortunately, as it turns out, I needed more dental work than anticipated.  The good news is Dr. Dee Dee walked me through each step and explained everything thoroughly.  I am confident I am in good hands and my teeth will be well taken care of.  I must also say that I highly appreciated my little chip on my tooth getting smoothed out, while my former dentist told me there was nothing he could really do about it. 

The environment was incredibly clean and nicely decorated.  I loved the decor and almost felt like this was a spa for my teeth.  It did not seem like your standard dental office at all.  They really took the time to almost make it seem like a home.  

I'm so glad I found Dr. Dee Dee through Yelp!  If you're in need of an excellent dentist, this is your place!"
5,"Dr. Stone is the best! His bedside manner is so awesome. He always listens to me and really makes me feel heard. Whenever I have a problem, he does his very best to come up with a solution, which is so comforting as a patient. He really does what is best for you. I highly recommend him! The wait times at this clinic are also very short. A big thanks to the whole staff for that because I know that is hard to do! I have to travel far so I love knowing I will be in and out! I just got botox treatment here and am excited for the results!"
5,"Sanfratello's is a welcome addition to Gilbert.  After 40 years in Chicago I moved to Arizona.  In my six years here have not found a great Chicago Pan or Deep Dish Pizza... UNTIL NOW!  An earlier review claims it is not Chicago Pizza, they are so wrong... The sauce and sausage are on point.  This is what it says it is a Chicago Pan Pizza.  And an amazing one at that!  It is not an inch and a half deep dish... But finally a solid Chicago Pan... I feel like I am at home.   So good.

As for the thin crust... On point again."
5,"Everything from the service to the food is spectacular!!! The wait staff make you feel like family and the food is like mom cooked it with love, but even better. Seriously THE BEST Biscuts and cinnamon roll I've EVER had. I'm a super picky eater and breakfast is my favorite meal so the fact that I love this place says a lot. Don't miss out on this place and if you get the cinnamon roll top it with nuts and raisins... you will not be disappointed! Don't let the decor and simple building fool you! It may  not be as fancy as Over Easy or decorated like Hen House, but it's soooo much better than both! So what are you waiting for? Get your Iowa Cafe on people!

BTW, for those that can't stand public bathrooms, like me, you will be impressed with this one. The sink in the bathroom is beautiful and everything is very clean! :)"
5,"Connor is the nicest guy working here, very friendly experience I had with him as he explained the various yogurts they had. He makes it a chill environment."
5,"Iowa, the 29th state. Iowa Café the best home-style breakfast place in Mesa. I'm a Midwesterner, and this is down on the farm good home cooking. The café is decorated in everything Iowa. They have pennants from probably every college in the state not to mention the giant Hawkeye banner on the wall. The menu has all the farm fresh favorites.
I ordered the corned beef omelet with onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. This came with sides of toast and home fries. The eggs in the omelet were light and fluffy. the corned beef and vegetables were cooked to perfection. A rather large portion. The home fries were deep fried not skillet fried which made for an even golden brown color and a surprising crispiness. 
The food was great, the service was good, and the total bill with coffee $15.10. This is the best mid-west breakfast I've had in Mesa."
5,"Dr Joy Wolfe has been my primary care physician for last 2yrs and her attention to care is unmatched my any medical physician I've ever come across and if there's a question that you need answered over the phone she makes sure her assistant gets back to you in a timely manner, I just love her attention to care"
5,"Cool cats behind the counter. Very nice and helpful.
My husband and I went here on a neighbor's suggestion, no disappointment here!

Also, if you're new to vapors (like us), and you're trying to quit smoking, take your time tasting the sample vapes! They have a large selection of flavors from original cigarette tastes to desserts to everything in between. :)

Cheers!"
5,"We work at MetroPet Veterinary Clinic just down the road in Berea.  We eat at Perk Cup Cafe weekly, if not more often.  The food is consistently excellent.  Prices are very reasonable, and all of the servers are really nice.  We will continue to be regulars as long as Perk Cup is there.  You make our lunchtime relaxing and we love you!"
5,"Being a transplant from Chicago this is great food and does not disappoint. I wish they had REAL indoor seating ...but I will be happy to take my pizza to go. I was a little surprised that it took 30 minutes to make a small thin crust cheese pizza, but next time I will just call it little bit earlier.. not a big deal. So happy to have this iconic pizza in the valley to make my Chicago belly happy -thank you!!!"
5,"This place is my favorite for lunch!  After discovering Baiz on yelp I have been back for lunch almost once a week, sometimes more.  I usually get the chicken shawarma plate.  Wish it came with hummus, but it's available as a side.  Kabobs are good also, but they take awhile because they are cooked to order.  They make their own pita, it's always fresh.

You have to try this place if you haven't before!  Great food, friendly staff, and a market full of food you can't find in other grocery stores, you can shop while you wait for take out."
5,Could not have been any better!!   Terry preparing the omelette and waffles literally tripped over himself to help us and explain the Sunday brunch etc.  Recently moved to Berea and this was our second visit.  Both visit everyone was very polite and helpful.  This is on our list of new hangouts.  Waitress (Kim) very efficient and kind as well.  Very welcoming place.  Definitely being added to our list of new hangouts.  Love it!!!
5,I've been going here for Gel Manicures and pedicures. As a hairstylist its been hard finding Manicures that last but this place does the best job so far. They have a great selection and a wide variety of drinks and a great atmosphere. The Gel has been lasting 2-3 weeks which has been wonderful with my busy schedule and for how much I use my hands.
5,"Love this place so much! We go weekly and have never had a bad experience. Kid friendly but an adult atmosphere. Good selection on the menu, have never been disappointed! Best patio EVER"
5,"Oh my!!  Not only was this some of the best Middle Eastern food I've had in Phoenix, but it's rates right up there with some the best food ever!  And for cheap!  

Met up here for lunch today with Rand H, Mike C and Arlin B and even though it's in a crappy part of town, it was well worth it.  We started with some of the little pies, we had the meat, and the spinah/cheese.  Different than other pies I have had at Middle Eastern places, these were made with a tasty dough instead of the layered sheets of whatever they use.  The fillings were seasoned and fantastic, so good I bought a dozen to take home!  99cents for one, 8.99 a dozen, how can you beat that price?! We also all shared a plate of hummus that was delicious, creamy and tasted like hummus should.  

For my meal I ordered the beef shawerma plate, but was already full from the other goodies I brought most of it home.  While the meat looked like it was burnt, it was nothing but tender and seasoned just right.  Oh...and everything came with what seemed a stack of fresh made pitas!  

Hours later I'm still in that happy food coma place and I'm already planning my next visit."
5,Dr. Dee and Mike have been so amazing to me the past four years and Suzanne too. They are accommodating to my schedule which makes life easier. Every time I walk into their establishment it just feels clean and fresh. I highly recommend.
5,"OMG - I love this place.  It looks like a tiny store from the street, but when you walk in, it is like entering another world.  The interior is large with modern finishes, super hip music, and they show HGTV & The Food Network on large, flat screen TV's.  Now about the service itself.  At other salons, my pedicures only last 5-7 days.  In some cases, my polish chips the next day.  Not at Tiptoe.  My pedicures last 2-3 weeks!  I'm hesitant to rave about this place because I don't want Tiptoe to become too crowded!  Oh yeah - and did I mention you can purchase a glass of wine from the cute wine bar next door and take it to your appointment?  This place is a dream - highly recommend!"
5,As a practicing chiropractor in the Phoenix area I occasionally need to refer a patient out. The doctors and staff at this clinic are great at what they do. I highly recommend the office and would feel very comfortable receiving care from them. Dr. O'Connor
5,Randy at Puffs was very helpful and friendly. He went above and beyond. He help figure out the problem with my new e-cig even though it was not purchased in their store. I recommend them...very knowledgeable and friendly.
5,"This is my new go to place. I love the friendly staff and they do a fantastic pedicure! The only criticism is that I would prefer ""spa"" music."
5,"My wife and I have eaten here several times. The service has always been fantastic. I will say that they do keep their restaurant a little on the warm side, but given that the clientele is a little older I do understand. We have ordered a few different things off of the menu and they have always been fantastic. Their pork tenderloin is my favorite, and it is NOT a health food. Wait staff is always very friendly and the restrooms have always been clean. This has been our ""go to"" breakfast/brunch restaurant for the last couple months. Nothing beats an Iowa home cooked meal."
5,Jesus I love this place. The ice cream is so rich and varied. I especially enjoyed the Mayan spiced chocolate gelato (or something like that). Perfect on a hot summer's day.
5,"Great experience. I picked  this office based on yelp reviews. Well totally agree with what other people are saying. Office is a little hidden but Megan helped me find their place over the phone. Well deigned office. Megan very helpful at the front desk. My hygienist was Christine, very professional and worked in detail. I appreciated
she took the time to explain everything.  Dr Dee is amazing - great people skills and also
Takes the time to explain everything on the treatment  and answering any questions. 
Small things make a huge difference, their restroom is immaculate and very well designed.  I haven't seen anything like this in any other dentist office.  The extras are good too a t-shirt, tooth brush, toothpaste and floss. I'm planning to stay here for a long time. Fantastic choice for my family members and friends.   Keep the good job !!!"
5,I spent 9 months in the middle east and fell in love with street shawarmas.. Ive recently moved back to the Valley and my cravings started so I went on a hunt... after trying a few spots out I finally found (for now) the closest thing to a street shawarma.. this thing might even be better as the ingredients are much fresher than a shawarma made in the slums of Bahrain.. they wrap it the way its supposed to (ive noticed a lot of places around here are turning them into sandwiches) and the chicken is thin enough to be crispy but it is still juicy and the veggies are fresh and crunchy.. I believe they even had cucumber chunks in there.. dont forget to stop in the back and get the best Baklava known to man.. good job guys!!!
5,"This place has been good every time we've had it! Even our Italian family who makes amazing pizza liked it, so that's saying something.  The crust is different and really good.  Sauce and toppings, fresh and yummy.  Good stuff guys! And very friendly staff which is always a huge plus =)"
5,"Scott runs an awesome shop. There are a few employees that aren't outright rude, but I get the sense they couldn't care less if I was in there or not, which is disappointing. But I love the place enough that I just make a beeline for the employees that seem like they want to be there. Awesome shop! Keep it up Scott!"
5,Best dental office I've been to ever anywhere. Clean and relaxing environment with a really knowledgeable caring and friendly staff. The dental equipment used is the best out there. The star of this office is 100% Dr DeeDee. She's extremely knowledgeable and helps you understand what's going on inside your mouth. The work is first class.
5,"They have brunch!! Next time we'll plan better!  We just came in for a mid-morning snack & tea/coffee - the Sunday brunch looks fabulous, with omelet bar all for $12.99! $5.99 for kids!"
5,"First time trying frozen yogurt, very nice place. Clean and easy to navigate. Lots of toppings, things I'd never otherwise thought to put on ice cream."
5,"Glory Be I have found my new dentist! The whole experience was pleasant and welcoming. Yes I said pleasant! Every person in this office was professional and personal. They made me feel like I was part of the team. Loved the whole experience. My t shirt gift was the cherry on top too cute!! Teeth fixed, and look forward to schedule my next cleaning in the future:) Thanks guys!"
5,"My favorite of the 3 local  juice makers.  IMO they have the best flavor selection at the best price with consistent quality.  I love the vanilla custard and puff butter.  Lemon cheesecake,  crunch berry custard,  blueberry cheesecake,  crunch berry.  I could go on and on.   Their customer service is top notch.  The only disappointment is that I can no longer buy higher than 6MG juice in store which makes it less convenient.   Until I level down I have to plan ahead and call in my orders to the super friendly dudes at Puff's distribution center.  The decreased convenience won't stop me from enjoying my favorite puff flavors.  We have a world class juice maker right here in Vegas.  Check them out."
5,Being originally from Iowa this place was spot on! They had the Midwest hospitality that no place out here has! The pork tenderloin tastes just like home! Service was amazing and all the staff were spot on! Will definitely return here!!
5,"I was a bit skeptical getting a men's pedicure, but glad I took a chance. I was able to make an appointment during a busy Saturday afternoon. Fortunately I arrived early because finding a parking space was tough. The apartment buildings nearby consume all of the on-street parking so I had to park several blocks away.  The staff was very friendly and I felt very comfortable. Mary gave me a great pedicure...my feet feel and look great! Obviously I will return."
5,"Get the burnt marshmallow ice cream. Will change your life!

Seriously though, it's a great ice cream store, pretty reasonable price. Smooth and creamy, doesn't melt too fast, and the service is speedy (and will deal with your indecisiveness because there are a good number of flavors to indulge in)!"
5,Great burger!  Friendly and fast service.  Even wearing my M coat was treated respectfully.    I will come back!
5,"Yes, this was really my first time ever in a frozen yogurt shop.  I have heard about them for years, but just never went in until I arrived on my first night in this city.  Too exhausted to chew, yogurt sounded great. I felt like I walked into heaven upon entering the door!  Very white and clean.  Enormous buffet of gigantic toppings-- fresh ripe berries, toasted coconut, kiwi fruit!!!  Made me so happy to be able to have this heavenly treat!!!  Staff was friendly and offered a sample, but I knew mango was for me without trying it.  Signed up for a loyalty card, and since this place is just a short hop from me, I will go back.  Full size cookies, brownies, moon pies, and more to put on the bottom!  And the neatest thing was the tiny cream puffs!  Might not want to load up on heavier toppings as it is sold by weight, but I had fun being allowed to create my own treat."
5,"I had my appointment today for a dental exam and cleaning. Haven't been to the dentist in a little while. Dee For Dentist's staff were all so nice and very informative of what was going on with my teeth. Their office is VERY nice and they have high tech technology. I was able to get a 3D view of my entire head and they not only help with teeth but they explained they make mouth guards if you grind your teeth and guards that helps keep your airway open if you have sleep apnea. Luckily I didn't need this but I thought that was awesome for a dental office to provide that. They can make retainers and do crowns in house which I thought was so cool haha. All in all, I would recommend them to anyone and I will continue to come here for my cleanings and any other dental needs. THANK YOU Ro, Jo, Mo, and Doctor Browne!"
5,"Dr Brown did my crown, it was pretty awesome because I didn't have to come back 5 times to get a crown fitting. They made my crown in house, saved me time, gas, and money. My friend referred me there and it is probably one of the BEST dentist I have ever been to. I hate change but I AM SO HAPPY I changed dentist office. Loved the staff and my experience - just wish it was closer to our house. Brought my husband and son as well, great experience."
5,After visiting Pink Spot my wife and I found Puff Vapors. Pink Spot didn't carry the new SubTank by Kangertech and Puff was the only store in the area that carried it. We were very happy with the store and they were very knowledgable and helpful. The best part was that after all the hype my wife realized the SubTank wasn't for her and later that night we returned it for a different tank. The Aerotank V2 was a little cheaper so they gave us 3 boxes of coils. The Asian guy gave us no hassles on the return at all. Well done Puff Vapors.
5,"I love this place! Every single staff member is friendly and professional. I have been several times and have never had an unpleasant experience. Kristen, the dental hygienist, and Dr. Meevasin are very amiable, listen to any and every concern, and ensure you leave happy and with all questions asked. In addition to excellent customer service, the office is very well decorated and full of all the high tech gear you could want (I.e. iPads in the waiting room and large TVs in every exam room with Netflix running on them during the appointment). Not a single detail was missed! 

I truly cannot say or think of anything negative about this place or the people! You guys ROCK!"
5,"We held my daughter's bridal shower at the Perk-Cup cafe last Sunday afternoon.   Vicki and Tina (owners) did a great job.  Everything was to my specifications regarding food and room set up.   The young lady who was assigned to our room was courteous and very quick to take away dishes, etc. when we were finished with them and made sure we had everything we needed.   My daughter was thrilled and our guests commented on how delicious the food was and how nice the room was.
Thank you for making this special day for my daughter even more special with your attention to detail.  ."
5,"A missed flight, an extra night near the airport and a shuttle dropped me off at the only reputable establishment in Cleveland, Rivals. 

A gigantic 25oz. beer mug full of a local IPA served to me which was enough to please a Viking, I was already happy with my decision to go there. 

Chicken sliders w BBQ sauce and fried onion rings hit all the right notes only caveat they were unexpectedly very spicy. 

Barbacoa tacos, bomb! These things were clearly made and shredded by hand on site. I was delighted w this unexpected Mexican dish. 

Another gigantic beer and I retired for my flight home the next day. 

Getting stranded and getting to meet all the local staff and fire department raising money for charity while pleasantly watching the sun set at the outside bar wasn't the worst thing after all."
5,"Every time I go in there I'm always happy with the service and the food.  They have great specials.   I just bought a j b dollar deal, spend $10.00 get $20.00 worth of food and drink.   The new bar / patio is beautiful.    Lots of parking as well."
5,"Showed up at Puff Vapors 10 mins before closing, I know very bad of me. The guys there were very friendly and happy to help me. I went in to get a refill of my crack aka Tidal Wave. If you have not had this flavor it is amazing! They not only set me up with 30ml juice but they also put new cotton on both of my rda's. Again thanks for your help and the hook up! I highly recommend this place plus they are the only ones who sell my crack."
5,"After a long time on the road, my sister and I wanted a nice sit down dinner. I found this place close to our hotel. The place had lots of parking. Ambiance as you come in was good. There was the bar area as you enter then the dining area was separate. We chose to be seated in the dining area. It started as a quiet evening. The staff were friendly. I got a margarita for $3 since it was their Tuesday special South of the Border night-yay! Unfortunately it didn't have enough ice. Not very impressed about that. But the high light of the evening was the food. We ordered caprese salad which was delish for sure! I was actually surprised. Then came the wings. My sister chose the sauce, smoke bourbon bbq, honey bbq and I chose hot garlic. My hot garlic is not as hot as I wanted but very tasty. The other 2 sauces surprising (since both were bbq)full of flavor yet distinctly different. We loved it! This place got packed when several large parties came in for graduation celebration with no reservation. The serving staff took turns attending to us and did a great job! I would highly recommend and would def come back given the opportunity."
5,"I love this place! I'm so picky about my nail places. I rarely want to spend the money to go so when I do I expect the best. Michael and his staff are incredibly kind, the polish selection rocks and the wine included in the service is really just so appreciated. Not to mention the space is fun and very clean, which is really what is most important. I have annoyingly sensitive skin and I had ZERO reaction to the pedicure I received (normally I have issues at every salon I attend). This is my new nail spot in Charlotte. Big shout out to Michael and his team!"
5,"AZ SDS has a very friendly, knowledgeable, courteous and humorous staff that make appointments go by quickly.  Very caring which enables the staff to truly help all patients."
5,"A great ice cream shop located in the Riverside area. I've been a frequent customer area many times. They have both gelato and really delicious ice cream flavours. You can sample some of the flavours before getting the scoops. I ordered the Burnt Marshmallow and Raspberry White Chocolate flavoured ice cream and both were delicious. I was quite amazed by the burnt marshmallow one as the staff said it was one of their more popular choices. It's a small ice cream shop and they do have some seating inside and a few seats outside.  If you are in the area and want good ice cream, then come to Ed's. Overall, a positive ice cream experience. Great friendly staff that are always smiling. Prices are really reasonable and for the value, you get some delicious and unique flavours. Will definitely be back for sure!"
5,Absolutely love my nails! Michael did such a great job. The interior is so relaxin and they definitely make you feel amazing from the moment you walk into the salon. Highly recommend!
5,"I started seeing Dr. Christopher over a year ago, and was so impressed with her methods, and how she integrates other beneficial therapies into her practice.  I have been to so many different chiropractors and other practitioners over the past 15 years, and have never experienced such a thorough approach to health, wellness and recovery.  I have struggled with chronic pain throughout my entire body since the Fall of 2000.  I am also a Yoga Instructor.  The holistic approach (chiro, physical therapy and massage therapy) have helped me to improve my practice, and even my own yoga teaching.  I have been able to incorporate several things I have learned to help my yoga students protect their own bodies better during their yoga practice.  I have referred several people here, and everyone who gives it a try is happy with their results."
5,My sister told me about this hidden gem.  Outstanding service.  Food is the best around as well is the bakery.  I drive all the way from  Deer Valley to go eat! Yum yum yum.
5,In town on business and tired of crappy room service.  Found this place on Yelp and ordered for delivery.  Natalie who took my order was fantastic. My food arrived hot and in less time than she said.  Everything was delicious (especially the cannoli). I will definitely be ordering again when I'm in Gilbert!!
5,"One of my all time favorite breakfast places in Mesa! My grandpa used to take me here when I was younger and I've always love their biscuits and gravy, so delicious! Best gravy and their chicken fried steak is pretty tasty too. I told my bf he needed to try them out and so we made the drive out there and now he's a fan lol. It's always busy when I visit but I don't really mind. We only wait about 1-2minutes to get seated. The staff are so friendly and always make sure everything is going great. Food comes out fast and hot and the servers always make sure your drinks are never empty. Definitely recommend!"
5,Best yogurt on the westside in my opinion. Friendly staff line is never too long. The inside is always clean and maintained.
5,"Best hangout! Love taking clientele for a drink after work, winter or summer weather the staff is always excellent!"
5,"Terrific ice cream wrapped in a store that makes you feel like it's out of a movie.  Ed's story is great, too - he originally came up from the US, knew nothing about making ice cream, but decided he wanted to do it, experimented a lot, and, voila: awesome ice cream store.

Everything is fresh, and the whole store just smells of sugar.  It's going to be packed this summer (as it usually is - even when it's cold out - go figure!)"
5,"My husband is from Munster, IN. He says there's nothing like Chicago pizza. He grew up eating Sanfratello's pizza. So he was over the moon when he heard that they were opening the place near Phoenix. We loved pizza (of course;)) and the service was great. So this is officially the greatest pizza place on the west coast;)!"
5,"It took me over a year to finally suck it up and find a dentist after moving to Vegas, and so of course the first place I looked was Yelp. When I saw Dee For Dentist's glowing reviews I was sold.

The entire staff is amazing. They're so friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. My teeth come out sparkling each time I get them cleaned. The doc is super gentle if you need to get any fillings. She numbs you up so you don't feel a thing :) And if she thinks you might need some major work done (i.e. root canal) she lays out the options for you so you know exactly what to expect. Overall this is a great office - I highly recommend you ditch your old dentist and start coming here! :)"
5,"Dr. Dee is the best. I have had four dentists since I have lived in LV but won't need another. My mouth is in the best shape it has ever been. 

They have the most modern facilities and make the crowns right there so you only make one trip  I've had two done there and they are perfect  

I would definitely recommend them."
5,"Very clean chic elegant and upscale location. I was looking for a place to go and get groomed and found this location . Booked an appointment and came to get cleaned up. Parking is a bit of a drag here but luckily I found this spot located in this busy Area. 

Came inside and was immediately greeted and prepped for my services and the chair was ready in less than 60 seconds. I really like the modern feel of it and not the typical nail salon feel. Prices are slightly above average for what I pay in baltimore but for good service and great environment what's a few additional dollars. 

I was even offered cold drinks when I arrived and it was not super crowded and flooded with people at this time. I guess because it is the fall and kind of cold. Either way glad Yelp lead me to this location and so far not disappointed."
5,"Best new favourite Gelato place anywhere (and it helps we live nearby!)

We've seriously gone to this place once or twice a week since we moved into the area a month ago (and it's almost Winter man!) because it's so delicious.

My girlfriend loves the spicy chocolate gelato they have (she says she thinks it's got actual ground peppers in the recipe to give it that kick) and I have not gone a single time without rocking at least 1 scoop of the Cherry gelato. If you like Gelato, and you like Cherries, then I fail to understand why you would not have had this flavour yet.

Once good tip. Ok, so it's not cheap. It costs like $3.50 for a two-scoop cup of gelato or ice cream (they have both, everything seems to be the same price). So my girlfriend and I get a cup each, and it's like $8 after tax... well, they sell pints of the stuff for $7.50 (tax included), and you're getting like 4x as much product for a cheaper price. Granted you gotta take it home right away or it'll melt, but it's worth it.

Bonus on the pint: I specifically asked the guy working there about this. They have a freezer of pre-packaged pints ready to buy. But if they have enough of the flavour(s) you want available on the rack that day, they'll make you a pint of whatever you want (mix the flavours up - who cares they'll do it) and you can take it home for that same $7.50. Killer deal.

I vote this place ""Win"""
5,My husband and I both see Dr Christopher she is knowledgeable and always caring. We travel for work and the office is always very accommodating when we call at the last minute.
5,"Auden is the best!  I spend a lot of time working out and not a lot of time resting or recovering.  Regular massages with Auden keep me healthy.  He is knowledgeable about the body as well as my sport (running) and does a great job helping me work through whatever is hurting.  His massages are not what I would call relaxing, but they effectively cover all the muscles I need massaged and he helps stretch me out and release tight joints."
5,"I have always loved the dentist, but over the past few years, my teeth have been bothering me so I soon became afraid to go. Finally, I got the courage to head over to Dee for Dentist. I was glad I did! I was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the office is!! It is extremely clean and everyone is super friendly! The rooms feature netflix and you can also see the inside of your mouth on the screen if you want to. I have never been to a cleaner and more comfortable dentist office in my life! Dr. Dee Dee and her staff truly make you feel relaxed and actually leave you wanting to go to the dentist! They are all smart, professional, and kind. Thank you again Dr. Dee Dee!"
5,"I don't know which is bigger? Huge or Giant? But whatever is bigger I want to thank Rivals Sports Bar for looking after their customers. I had a bad reaction with novocaine and one beer. I have no idea what happened but they looked after me and they even called the paramedics for my safety. This thank you goes out to John, Rachel, Sarah and all the other staff and most of the customers because we know everybody here! It's like cheers."
5,"Stopped in here today to get provisions for Sunday Snack and Game Night at our house, in part because I've been meaning to check it out and in part because supporting our melting pot neighborhood feels more important than ever lately. 

They have a stunning display of cookies and desserts, and we promptly demolished our selections as soon as we got home. Huge vats of hummus and babaganouj, soft, pillowy pitas, and savory cheese and spinach pies accompanied our weekly boardgame ritual. 

I am glad I finally made it here, and I plan to go back again and again. I am glad they are here!"
5,"Find everything you need in this office, from chiropractic to physical therapy to massage and pain management!"
5,We picked this group out of our qualified providers and we made a great choice. Everybody is friendly and understanding. Top notch equipment and great healthcare. Very well pleased.
5,"Auden Leyva is hands down the best sports massage therapist I have ever had. He practices ART (active release technique) which had my shoulder injury (going on for over a year) feeling better after my first visit. I had no experience with the PT side of things, but being that I work in a PT clinic here in Washington, the facility is huge and seems very nice! They also offer a lot of services for a really great price. Wishing I still lived in Arizona so I could get in with Auden weekly!"
5,"I have had acupuncture done there with Jody and she was awesome.  She is very knowledgeable, understanding, and patient.  She doesn't rush you and really takes time to find out what is going and wants to get to the root of the problem. She doesn't just try to mask the pain. Highly recommend."
5,"If You Like Ice cream you have to try this place.
I had the Blood Orange and it was a 10/10.
That's a high rating because I am no a big fan of ice cream
But this place is heaven."
5,"You need to come and try this bar that isn't on a normal street corner. The wife and I stopped in for late night dinner and boy did they deliver. I have not had bar food this diverse, unique, and tasty in a long time. I will be coming back for more."
5,"I went here to look for a better vape mod because my mod is not working properly,a guy named MIKE give me a great deal and made the happiest guy today..
I highly recommend this store specially to all the filipino's out there.come check this store and look for MIKE.he is the coolest guy
Thank you so much MIKE and God bless your business man"
5,"Honestly best pizza we have had since being out here from Chicago , we will return , Chicago deep dish is a must , good sauce , good crust , good cheese , doing things right !!!!"
5,"As a big fan of frozen yogurt when moving from Chicago to Arizona I was hopeful to find a great froyo place. After a few unfortunate tries I came across Yogurtology. Let me tell you the selects at this location are great! There are so many toppings to choose from and my favorite is the brownies and cookies that they have to place on the bottom of your yogurt cup. The employees are super friendly and always giving a helpful suggestion of any new flavors to try. One of the best things is the ability to taste the flavors prior to making your decision as to which ones you'd like. I highly recommend their mint flavored yogurt, you can't go wrong!"
5,"If you ask me to list some of my favourite dessert places in Toronto, then I believe Ed's Real Scoop will be right up there. This is my go-to ice cream/gelato spot and sometimes I would even go out of my way to drive all the way down to the Woodbine Beach just to get a scoop of their sweet sweet icy dessert. 

My favourite flavours are the Pistachio and the Bacio flavour gelato, and thank god a Medium allows me to choose 2 flavours. However, if you want it in the waffle cone, which is filled with marshmallows, it is $1.20 extra. The gelato and ice creams are made fresh in house and you can tell it's good quality, because the texture is very dense and doesn't melt as easily as the store-bought stuff.They do allow unlimited sampling before you make your decision, which is nice, and the staffs have always been very friendly and knowledgeable of the ingredients. And yes, credit cards are accepted. 

I highly recommend giving Ed's Real Scoop a try, and it is especially nice enjoying some frozen treats while walking along the beach in the summer :D"
5,"Very helpful team! They have helped me to be able to continue working through a pregnancy that was very tough on my back. Auden, Dr Christopher, and Jody in particular! Thanks for all you do."
5,"Nice, clean place with friendly staff. I made an appointment via the Yelp app very easily. The owner replied back very quickly, we chatted and I had an appt for that night (Friday evening). Glad I did, the place was packed. And there seemed to be filled with regulars. Not surprising since Tip Toe was recommended by a friend."
5,"Terrific Monday specials (3 sliders & fries, ribs & wings & tater tots), good prices including $3 pints-lots of choices, and terrific service!!  Steve was the best waiter we've had in ages!!!!  Excellent job!"
5,great customer service! Scott knows his stuff. friendly staff. good prices on their home made flavors!
5,Amazing ice cream. Friendly staff and great location to just walk around and enjoy some delicious ice treats
5,"What a treat to go to Tiptoe today, I love this place. You should ask for ""S"". She is so friendly, has a great personality and gives the best pedicure!"
5,Hands down the most quality juice and accessories shop I have experienced. I Really enjoy the customer relationship you build here. They seriously make you feel at home and let you know the pros and cons on your purchase.  I come here to just chill and get away from life...
5,"This is such a professional office. I like that they cover all my options and tell me the cost right up front. By doing this i can make my own decisions on what i can afford and need. I have never felt pressured to get work done and have always been given options on payment plans.
Every person in the office is so nice and does everything to make my visit comfortable. I also love that I get to watch movies while there."
5,Rivals is an all time favorite for my husband and I. We love their burgers and chicken sandwiches and they have amazing wings!! The owner John is a super nice guy and you can tell he really cares about his restaurant with how well it's doing. We stop in 2-3 times a month for dinner and we are never disappointed. Their outside eating area/bar is very nice and we frequent that in the spring/fall on the cooler nights. All in all you can't go wrong at rivals!
5,Great office and AWSOME staff. I'm a loyal patient because they treat you right. Very understanding and always work with you.
5,"I love Sanfratello's!  Loved them in Glenwood, IL when I lived In IL and was overjoyed when they announced they were opening here in Gilbert a few years ago.  The meatball sandwich is the best I've had (with or w/out cheese or garlic bread).  Pizza - both the thin and the pan are worth the price.  It really makes me sad to read the reviews where people compare this pizza to Papa John's, Little Ceasar's, Pizza Hut, etc. in terms of price.  This is REAL pizza - not mass produced, chain restaurant style pizza, ie great quality.  Homemade sausage, Gonella bread - top quality ingredients.  You are what you eat and I sure feel better about eating food that is fresh and real!   Service is always great, fast & friendly.  The only downside is they got rid of the jalapeno poppers appetizer which was one of my faves.  Otherwise one of the top places in AZ to get pizza!"
5,"This post is in response to an earlier post by Milena B. 
The accusation that Dr Christopher has a prejudice against LGBTQ is absurd and 100% False.
How do I know you ask?
Because I'm a lesbian and have referred several lesbian friends to her practice. WE have ALL been treated with top notch care. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else. The fact that ignorant people would go as far to purposely hurt a business due  to potentially differing political views is abhorrent and shameful!"
5,Absolutely the BEST Shawarma in town!!! Come to Baiz for all your ethnic grocery needs and top it off with an awesome meal!
5,"The entire AZSDS staff is friendly, helpful and professional.  Amanda stands out as a phenomenal physical therapist.  She is thorough and empathetic but tough.  I have come a long way in my recovery because of Amanda's hard work and patience.  I highly recommend Amanda and AZSDS."
5,Disney Dole Whip in Phoenix!  Yay!  Just like Disneyland!  So many great + fresh toppings.  Best yogurt place in town.
5,"Sanfratello's made me the happiest girl this side of Chicago when they opened their Gilbert location!  I love the pizza - thin or pan - love the fried ravioli!  I just wish I lived closer so the thin pizza would still be piping hot when I bring it home.  Thanks for making AZ feel a little more like 'home' - this Burbank, IL gal appreciates it!!!
** Edited to add** You people comparing the cost of pizza here to Papa John's or Pizza Hut are out of your minds!  This is FRESHLY made pizza - not prefixed delivered frozen to a store.  Yes, you are going to pay more for the quality of ingredient.  You get what you pay for - eat junk......you know the rest."
5,"Just visited Dr. DeeDee for a wisdom tooth extraction and am very pleased with the professionalism of her whole office.  It's not a rushed practice like many medical offices.  They take the time to make you feel comfortable and explain the whole procedure and post-op care.  My tooth had incredibly long roots and the Doc took great care in making sure that I was in good spirits the whole way through.  She's got  finesse and gentleness that make her great at what she does.  The Doc's husband, Mike, manages the front office and promotes great hospitality while you are visiting.  
Kudos to this family for making a great dental practice through and through!"
5,"Visited Yogurtology tonight and the kids loved making their yogurt, Thank you for offering the best toppings and bottoms! The store is clean and the employee was friendly. I think my kids tried every flavor before deciding on what they wanted! Thank you for offering samples! Would high recommend Yogurtology Glendale anyday over any other yogurt shop!!!"
5,Nobody looks forward to a trip to the dentist! What a job you have! Thank you so much for taking such good care of myself and my three kids. EVERYONE on the team were so very nice and comforting. I came to this office by word of mouth and now I will continue to spread the word!
5,"Great breakfast place. Very clean, welcoming atmosphere. Everyone seems happy to be there. Amazing food. I ordered multiple plates of eggs, bacon, sausage and French toast. 

Perk-Cup is a wonderful restaurant. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for both a hearty breakfast or a quick bite to eat."
5,"Today The bf and I had pamper day, I ditched my last nail shop so after reading several yelp reviews I decided upon this place. Don't get me wrong I was still hesitant to come bc I needed a full set and in the past no one could ever get my acrylic the way I wanted but Michelle is amazing I'm hooked, she was very pleasant and thorough with me. I def plan to come back bi weekly making her my new nail tech. 

Thanks Michelle!!!"
5,"I've been wanting to go to Ed's for couple years now. Finally made it tonight. First of all lets understand something, all I require to sustain life is ice cream and pizza. So you know how seriously I take my ice cream. WOW!!!! I was so impressed. Had scoop of Caramel Apple & Burnt marsh mellow ice cream in a waffle cone. All I can say is damn good thing I no longer live in the Beach. Which is where I grew up. Cuz I'd be eating Ed's ice cream daily."
5,"Ed's Real Scoop was open on the holiday Monday! Woohoo! After having Ed's many times in our cookie sandwiches at Bakerbots, my husband and I decided to head over to the Beaches to have some ice cream by itself. 

We both really enjoyed our experience - definitely some of the best ice cream in Toronto!"
5,"Walk along Queen Street East in the summer and there are *very* few places that have lines out the door. Ed's Real Scoop is one of the rare exceptions: it's always busy because they serve, without a doubt, the best ice cream in this part of Toronto.

The selection is great and every day or so the staff will put a 'suggested pairing' on the chalkboard. That suggestion is almost always good: its led me to try some chocolate chilli ice creams and try their burnt marshmallow. I've never been disappointed by following the pairing suggestion. 

One special note: be sure to get a waffle cone. They actually put a little bit of marshmallow in the bottom of it, so that it doesn't leak any ice cream out the bottom. In addition to be incredibly practical it means that the bottom of the cone is a special treat!"
5,"Rarely do I ever give out five stars but Dee For Dentist is now my new spot when getting my teeth cleaned every 6 months. I've been coming here for the past 3 years. The dental hygienists are very nice and knowledgeable and tell you what you need to work on if there is a problem with your teeth. Back at my old dentist I used to go to for my cleanings the dental hygienists were very rough when cleaning my teeth. I take very great care of my teeth and gums and the dental hygienists at Dee for Dentist know I do and are very gentle when cleaning your teeth. From the front desk to the assistants, hygienists, dentist, they are all very nice and I'm glad I switched over to Dee For Dentist."
5,"Real stuff! So good on a summer day!
I loved the yogurts they had. One scoop of passion fruit. One scoop of raspberry. Perfection.
I will say though, to definitely try a taste before you choose a unique flavor. My friend loved the Burnt Marshmallow but it wasnt for me. The staff is friendly about you sampling, so do yourself a favor and try it before you buy it."
5,"My friend took me there after a nice dinner at the Beaches. It was sunset. You know what does that mean? It was the longest line I have been standing in this country, except five dollar Tuesday at Carlton Cinema last spring :P

Well, the stand was totally worth, as you probably figured out. The cone is nice and crisp and the scoop is H U G E. I love sweets, would eat them every moment, and I was struggling while eating it (probably because of the earlier dinner), but anyway, it is big no matter what. 

I chose pistachio, which is my all time favourite. Stellar! Loved it.

They offer variety of other stuff as well, as their own made chocolates, candies etc, so if you do not feel just ice cream, then there are other options for you available. 

Do not let yourself down if you see a long line on a nice summer evening, as it goes pretty fast, as the girls at the register work real fast and hard. They still smile :) 

Just do it!"
5,"Puff Vapors is our vape shop away from home. We love Vegas and discovered Puff Vapors thru Yelp. My wife and I have been to many vape shops and Puff Vapors is unique, because they make there own e-juice. Their flavors are amazing and they will even mix flavors for you (ex. Snickers, cheesecake, and made a Snickers Cheesecake YUM!) they will also make any of their juices in all VG blend. They have excellent prices and great inventory and their outstanding  customer service brings it all together. It's our favorite vape shop when were in Vegas, come by and check it out. Thanks Puff Vapors you got customers for life."
5,"Drove all the way across town to check this spot out since my sister recommended coming here and they have crazy flavors. I'm not much of a smoker but decided to get a vapor anyway. 

The staff was very friendly. They have two stations where you can sit and taste the different flavors they offer. Plus it was a pretty good deal $25 for 3 flavors and if you need a starter vapor prices start from $25 and up. The flavors I decided to buy were crunch berry, cheesecake, and toro rouge."
5,Came in with my roommate as new vape users and Casey (sp?) was our salesman.  He made us feel welcome and not like idiots (like a couple of other shops in town).   He was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations and spent the time showing us how to properly use the product and had no problem answering any questions we had.  Even the other employees not helping us asked how we were doing and were very friendly.  We will return and recommend to anyone looking for a great vape shop!
5,"It was simple for me to give this place and its staff a 5 stars. Amazing management and bartenders along with very good food with ample selection of beer. Can't go wrong when looking for a great place to catch a game or have dinner with friends. Thanks to Nikki, Johanna and Rachel for making my evening that much special . Enjoy!"
5,Visited again a few weeks ago and it was just as enjoyable as our first visit.  I believe that Kim was our waitress this time.  She was very attentive and the food was excellent.  Our experiences have been all-around great.
5,"This is my go-to nail salon. The quality of the work they do is fantastic. I always get the gel manicure which is $35, they have a wide selection of colors to choose from and take their time ensuring your nails look great. The regular pedicure is $30, but you can upgrade for $5 and do the pedicure in a box which includes fun extras.

The establishment is always clean and comfortable. Even the waiting area is inviting. They offer crackers, water, soda and wine (21+) to all customers. They have HGTV and Food Network on at all times and a great playlist. 

Overall it's a great experience. I recommend making a reservation as they are typically busy most of the time! The wait can be upwards of an hour and a half at times."
5,Dr. Rudd has been my chiropractor for 6 years. He is attentive to my needs and has helped me with various back issues over the years. I would highly recommend his services.
5,This little shop is easy to access and worth the trip. The employees are always friendly and helpful. The yogurt and toppings are delicious and abundant. The prices are competitive and even better once you are in their system.
5,Be shop in town by far great products at good prices and awesome customer service.this is defiantly my everyday shop. Its nice to walk in and the staff can answer all your questions and are happy to do so
5,"Yogurtology is our #1 favorite yogurt shop!  We are frequent visitors and have been there both the 28th and 29th this weekend!  Every time we go, we get exceptional service from the employees from the moment we come in and get greeted, to yogurt samples, etc.  Yogurtology has the best flavors along with all the bottomings and toppings you could ever want!  Never have had a less than exceptional visit at Yogurtology...thank you!"
5,"Highest of recommendations for this place.  Superb flavor, great prices.  Perfect spot to grab a bite before a ball game downtown (not near the rail line).  

Just know what to expect-- it's a deli counter in a middle eastern market in a ""questionable"" neighborhood.  The tables are aluminum and rickety, so I usually take it to go.

The hummus is the best in town, as is the pita.  I usually take an extra order of both to bring home for the week.  The baba ganaouj is good and very smokey, but I prefer the hummus.

I've tried every sandwich on the menu.  The best is the chicken shwarma.  Rotisserie chicken, shredded and seared crisp on the griddle, then folded into a pita with garlic spread, tomato, lettuce and pickle.  They are small and amazing, so I always get two.  The beef shwarma is also good.  

The kebab sandwiches are very tasty, but the pieces of meat are huge and difficult to eat in sandwich form.  Better off getting kebab plates."
5,"Al-Hana makes me sad for one reason: I am so in love with the falafel that I still haven't had a chance to try their world-famous cheese pizza thingies.

For the uninitiated, Al-Hana is the restaurant that occupies one corner of Baiz Market, the amazing Middle Eastern grocery at 20th and Roosevelt.

If you want amazing food, period, you gotta eat here. The pitas are baked in-house and they are amazing. flavorful, soft, just chewy enough, and perfect. The falafel is seasoned perfectly and fried to a crunchy perfection. The babaganouj is impressive, as is the Hummus. The only thing I am not 100% in love with is the Tabbouleh, which is just a tad short on lemon flavor for my taste. If you're feeling like a salad, I would recommend the fettoush salad instead, as it is an unexpected delight.

The set up is a bit on the disorganized side: The menu board is an incomprehensible mess, so you're better off asking for a menu, or even better, describing what you want to the helpful staff. The food does take a bit of time, so feel free to explore the market while you wait.

Al-Hana is a great place to take people who think that Phoenix is just a city full of Macaroni Grills and Cheesecake Factories. They will be surprised at what unique, authentic spots we have here in town....but you might want to warn them about the whole goat in the butcher department first."
5,I see Auden Leyva here for massage. I was having a lot of neck pain and shoulder blade pain. After seeing him for about 2 months my back is feeling a lot better. You really need someone who knows the deep sports massage. He is digging and stretching your tissue and muscles to break up the acid and help blood flow and repair. This isn't the relaxing fall asleep massage. But the pin is worth the outcome. Auden is very nice and easy to talk to. He listens very well and if you give him time you will feel better.
5,truly delicious pizza never disappointed when we order it always get delivery and they're always on time I highly suggest the Chicago meat lover style as it is a grease lovers heaven and I mean that in the best most delicious way possible
5,"Love this place. Great yogurt and the Acai bowls are amazing and a healthy option. Great service, friendly atmosphere, and very clean. This is a must stop by place"
5,By far the best ice cream in Toronto. i had the creme brulee flavour which was super creamy - a lot creamier than most places I've had which gave the ice cream a rich texture. Delicious and worth the drive to the beaches. I was a little upset when I drove past the other branch on my way back home though - could have saved some time if I knew about that one.
5,"Our family favorite ...Sunday breakfast buffet is amazing! So much great, hot food. The selection is too much. Lol . Made to order omelettes are perfect! Customer service is outstanding!  Kim our server is the best! She is very attentive and caring."
5,"I have always been nervous about dentists, but this office, staff, and Dr. was the most amazing dental team I have ever been to.  Starting with the office design, front office staff, dental assistants and then the Dr. all with such great care and compassion. I can't compliment them enough.  I was even amazed with their bathroom! I highly recommend Dr. Dee."
5,This restaurant is great. The shawarma was sooo good. My goodness I loved everything!!!!
5,"These People are Great.

So i was staying in vegas at freemont and wanted to check out the local shops. i did. I asked every shop who else i should visit for the best selection of Genuine Mech Mods and they suggested PUff over and over. 

it took me a day or two b/c puff is something like 12.3 miles from freemont experience. I was glad i made the trip. These guys know their stuff with everything they sell. they were friendly and had they best selection out of the 7-8 shops i visited. furthermore i heard a rumor that they might be starting a downtown area operation. I cant say too much, but i will be keeping an eye out for some awesome-ness. 

I own a shop in texas so i know a bit about the details of running a vape shop. These guys are worth your time. If you are serious about your vapes, you need to be here.

On a side note: my cabbie abandoned me, and these guys gladly gave me a ride. i dont think they want to start a transport business anytime soon, but it speaks to the character of Puff Vapors. Thanks Guys

P.s. Sweet beard Dude..........."
5,"It's true!! Ahwatukee BEST!! AZ Spine Disc and Sport is always putting their patients first -caring for their medical and sport injury needs. They are HUGE on helping the community!! Dr. Christopher and staff are professional, friendly and display AMAZING care to their patients! -"
5,Just had my teeth cleaned by Ro at Dee For Dentist. She did an amazing job. Super friendly and very thorough. Thank you!
5,"Kid tested, mother approved.  I love this place.  Excellent care & child friendly.  Dr. Dee & her staff take the time to explain everything and my kids came out smiling.  The decor and cartoons (that they put on when they saw the kids coming in) is the cherry on top.  And for those of us who are prone to making appointments and forgetting about them...  they have a confirmation system in place that is tech friendly.  If you want to feel good about going to the dentist again, give this place a try."
5,"I only heard about Baiz about a year ago but was hooked when I found that it had an enormous selection of middle eastern foods that you can't get at any of your common grocery stores. Then, just a few months ago I tried out their in-store cafe, Al-Hana. The food is DELICIOUS! I am usually in a hurry to get off to work or school, but if you come here for lunch, expect a short wait.

Al-Hana at lunch is usually a little busy, not too busy, but it will be about 10 minutes before your order is ready. I've only been here for lunch so I generally get one of their pita sandwiches which are dirt cheap at $4.75. The Shish Taook, Falafel Sandwich and Iraqi Kabob (my favorite thus far) are amazing. They are just the right size and will fill you up enough not to put you to sleep once you get back to your desk. I HIGHLY recommend getting one of their sides too. The Tabbouleh and Babaghanuj are seriously mouthwatering (mine is while I'm writing this). They're each about $4 for a small but are good portions and well worth it!

So bottom line if you enjoy middle eastern cafes, you have to swing by Al-Hana at Baiz. They're totally affordable and you can order an awesome pita sandwich and grab any extras in the store while you wait (a yogurt drink and some baklava are my standard).

Enjoy!"
5,"I too am not from Chicago but really enjoy a good deep dish pizza.  Been too long since I had access to a decent one.  Unlike some of the ones i have tried here in AZ, this one is of high quality and not too ""Bready"".  Quality ingredients and yes a little more expensive than what Little Ceasers???  I hope so....  Have had no issues with customer service, every time I have called in, the experience and pick up have been both efficient and friendly.  Great local option.  Highly recommend."
5,"Excellent service and staff! My go to for vape juice. Unbeatable prices and selection, I really enjoy their custom blends."
5,"Great dentist! They are professional, friendly, funny, and relate-able. Did a great job on my cleaning and the office is comfortable and clean. They also have some really great imaging technology and found things that other dentists have not found.  I would recommend to anyone."
5,"Finally found a great nail salon in Charlotte that I will keep coming back to! Convenient -in Plaza Midwood, great space with plenty of room. Very modern and perfectly clean!!! 

Pricing is very fair and on average with across Charlotte. Welcoming & hospitable as soon as you walk in. They took me right on time for my appointment, offered a selection of beverages and helped me with my bag.

Good selection of colors that are so organized, much easier than most locations to find what you want.  One of the owners did my pedicure and it was the best pedi I have ever had- polish is perfect, very relaxing and not in a rush. Manicure was from another staff member who also did a really nice job!"
5,"Finding a dentist can be the worst experience.  Finding a dentist you can TRUST, now that's nearly impossible.    That is Dr Dee down to the Tee.  Dr Dee has always been the most knowledgeable, kind and caring dentist I have ever been too. I won't go anywhere else.  

  She thoroughly explains every procedure before it happens, EVERY TIME.  You're never left in the dark.  She treats each patient like they're her own family.  She has always made me feel like I'm in the best hands possible- so much so, that when the day comes that I have kids, they're going straight to her for every tooth related thing.  

  Also, you want the most modern and up to date dentistry techniques?  This place is constantly on the pulse of modern and BEST dentistry.  I need to know my dentist is absolutely on the cutting edge of technology and not left behind like most dentists.   

  I also want a staff that is up to her caliber.   This staff will never let you down.  No pressure, completely informative and perhaps the most well run office I have ever seen.  

Trust is everything. And she has mine."
5,"Owner is almost always there, true local beach character, excellent products.  Wish he had the pumpkin ice cream all year round. Not only my fav in ice cream but my fav business in the beaches."
5,"I'm not from Chicago, but I've been to several of the key places that serve as true pure examples of ""Chicago-style Deep Dish"" pizza. I also grew up on Rosati's (which came here from Chicago decades ago). 

Here in Arizona, there's not a ton of places to get a Chicago deep dish. And I've seen a few of them close as well. I've been to a lot of them, and some I like more than others. Rosati's is great, but quality can vary wildly from store to store. Oregano's sells a deep dish... it's good, but intense. 

Deep dish pizza in general is intense... it's a ton of food. It's also kinda weird if you haven't had it before. Sauce on top? WTF is that? It's almost like an upside-down cake made with pizza ingredients. It also requires you to wait a long time as they take like an hour to cook. But it can definitely be worth the wait.

Sanfratello's is a new chain that comes to us straight from Chicago. Tonight, I picked up a deep dish pepperoni and sausage, a caesar salad, and something called ""pizza fritz."" Their pizza boxes are pretty unique - they don't require employees to spend hours of their day folding boxes... it's a clever design that I've never seen before. It also seems like less cardboard, and it's more sturdy. Who cares though, right?

The food was delicious. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from the pizza, but it was excellent. It was lighter than a typical deep dish. All the flavor was there though. It was a great example of a good Chicago deep dish, but when I was done eating it, I didn't feel like I had a giant brick in my gut. The salad was good as well - tender chicken, clean fresh lettuce, crisp croutons, and tasty dressing. Can't ask for much more. 

The pizza fritz were like a puffed pastry made from pizza dough sprinkled with powdered sugar. Pretty simple, but a nice little treat. Didn't seem like it was super high in calories like other desserts. It came with some chocolate dip, but we opted to put chocolate swirl cookie butter on it instead - because fat. Shut up.

The setup here is more or less pick up and delivery... they do have some nice yet very small tables inside, and a few tables on the patio. This location is set up similar to how most Rosati's are, but a tad bigger. Don't expect to bring the whole family for a sit-down meal.  

Anyway, I like this place. Put one closer to my house. 

Oh, they deliver too. (sadly, not to me)."
5,"Very satisfied with treatment here at Az Spine Disc and Sport. Keeps me healthy and strong in my career and hobbies such as trail running and rock climbing. Special thanks  to Dr. Christopher, Dr. Rudd and Auden Leyva!"
5,"I've loved this store for years, Scott is an amazing guy and a fantastic owner... Today however, my already great experience went above and beyond previous expectations. I went in to purchase one bottle of vapor fluid, the manager of the store (Justin) was so knowledgeable and professional that I ended up with 6 new juices that I found very unique and I also purchased a whole new box mod, tank, and coils because he recommended it based off what he knew I wanted... On a scale from 1 to 10 I give this place a 11.  Today was a turning point for me. I will forever be a loyal customer as long as you have such a great staff employed. Thanks again!"
5,"This clinic and specifically Curtis (PT) are outstanding.  I heard about the clinic from a friend, and went there with a running injury and pain, which I feared were going to end my running routine.  Curtis used a number of techniques to relieve the pain and put me on the path to recovery.  Within a few weeks I was much better.  Curtis established a good routine for me to continue on my own and discontinued my in-office visits. Months later I feel great.  I've completely recovered, have no pain and I have better mobility than before I was injured."
5,"Puff Vapors is by far, the coolest Vapor Joint in town. The staff spend quality time informing every customer about product knowledge,vaping,and anything else you want to know about vaping.I've never seen a business that does a needs analysis on everyone that walks through the door,and Scottie has a genuine concern in making sure that you succeed at getting off the stinkies.The atmosphere is great,and the company is great.

The E-Juice that they sell is the best in town,I've tried other bigger vapor shops in town and found out that bigger does not mean better. So if you tried the rest you need to stop by the best,you'll thank me later....
Larry T."
5,"Let me start from the top. I called Wednesday morning to schedule an appointment, and thankfully they had an opening Thursday morning. Which worked perfectly with my work schedule.

It was excellent service. Setting the appointment and checking my insurance went so smoothly. To top it all off i was then informed of a way that i would be able to fill out new patient forums online prior to my appointment. (Which made things 10000 X'S easier.)

Upon arrival i was greeted with such a positive and welcoming vibe. Checking in was a breeze, thanks to having the option of filling out papers prior to, and my wait time was 5-10mins.


Not only was the dental assistant very friendly, she made sure that i was comfortable and informed of every thing planned for my visit. She walked me through every procedure, introduced me to the staff and thoroughly explained every piece of equipment. 


Once Dr. Dee joined us it was nothing short of a safe, comfortable and confident vibe. She was so accommodating to me and the things i needed done. She constantly gave me options and suggestions and i never felt forced at all. The hygienist was amazing! 


I absolutely love this place and their staff, from front desk to the Dr. and everyone in between. I definitely will be returning and a long term patient, and already referring them to anyone i know.


Thank you for the amazing service, i appreciate each and everyone of you!"
5,Excellent place! We had a group of close to 30 people and they handled us with no problems. They have a separate room for larger parties and a large parking lot across the street for extra parking. The food was excellent as well and the prices weren't unreasonable.   I highly recommend this restaurant for large parties.
5,"First time I tried the cookies and cream as they were just closing, but nice enough to still let us in.  The second time I tried the green tea ice cream and I am in love.  Simply delicious.  You can really taste what's put into it.  And you get a choice of candied topping on the side!  Oreo cookies are my fave amongst the wide assortment."
5,So incredibly happy I went here! I came for a second opinion and thank goodness! I was told elsewhere I needed a root canal and Dr. Maria did not agree. She took her time looking at my X-rays and examining my teeth to say she doesn't think a root canal is immediately necessary. She wants to wait and watch it. I am so thankful I listened to my gut and got their opinion! Was recommended by my boyfriend's coworker. The office staff is friendly and helpful! The assistant was so sweet and knowledgeable. Asking me several times if I had questions for her. I really appreciate this office! I highly recommend them!
5,"My first time here and loving it! 

  Service is awesome as soon as I walked in the guys from behind the counter greet me as is if we knew each other. I told them I was looking for some E juice and right away they have what I need!

 They have some cool stuff here and don't be afraid to hang out and vape with them!"
5,best juice in town at this place. great customer service!
5,"I was hungry for breakfast along my cycling journey this morning and saw this gem along the way.  It looked to be a small business and locally owned, something that met the criteria for my blog.  The breakfast here is not only amazing but comes at an extremely fair price.  The customer service was above and beyond and something you will find with a local restaurant.  If Melissa is there try to get in her section as she is a top notch waitress.  Fun, bubbly personality with a great sense of humor.  I had the Chicken fried steak here and it was super delicious.  They serve breakfast, lunch and supper at all hours too so thats really nice.  Screw IHOP or Dennys, take the time and stop in to the Iowa Cafe.  I'll certainly be back.  For a more detailed review please check out my blog at www.azspicycycler.com and check out my YouTube channel (search azspicycycler) for my video."
5,"I use to HATE going to the dentist because of two very bad experiences! But Dee for Dentist got me feeling comfortable being there. I explained to them that I was horrified with my past experience and they assured me that they only focus on you when your in the chair. They don't go around and work on other patients and leave your mouth open for hours. Dr. Dee and her team take time to know with what's going on with you. They let you know what procedures they will be doing in exceptional detail... Always making sure if your feeling ok when working on you... I didn't feel no pain at all when I got a tooth extracted... I was amazed!!!

Dee for Dentist has a great team! Very professional, caring, and top notch customer service! It's a great and convenient location. I finally found a Dentist worth going to and no longer afraid to go to the dentist! That's a pretty epic feat for me! I highly recommend Dee for Dentist!!! 10 stars all the way!"
5,"Good service, good beer, good food. The hot sauced and homemade chips/dip are my favorite! Very fun for Browns games."
5,"Real ice cream!  So good!

If you love coffee ice cream, you must try Ed's ""Mercury Espresso""... it has a great coffee flavour, and it's not too sweet like the Hag Daz I used to buy before I discovered Ed's.  

The take home container is a great deal, especially with their frequent buyer cards!"
5,"I have been to many chiropractic clinics in the valley and AZ Spine Disk & Sport is one of the most upscale, professional and advanced clinics around. A fantastic full service office from Chiro, Massage, physical therapy, acupuncture, vitamin injections and a nurse on staff. They are always looking at the newest and best technology to help their patients perform better and heal from injuries. Their chiropractors are all amazing and their Massage Manger, Auden, does great work with ART and Muscle stretching!"
5,"Al-Hana is the cafe located inside the Baiz Market that serves amazingly genuine middle eastern provisions ... this according to my fiancee who hails from Michigan, worked in a Middle Eastern restaurant while going to MSU, and considers it her favorite cuisine.  Wrap that into one giant grape leaf, and you have one crazed Middle Eastern food enthusiast.  

We went here to pick up a few groceries and some take-out from the small cafe tucked in the front corner of the market.  I had already called 'dibs' on the chicken shawarma while on the short car-ride to East-Central Phoenix, and I fist-pumped in her face to let her know I just shook her down.  Um, no worries for her because she dominated the rest of that menu, ordering a falafel sandwich [in pita], za'atar bread [dipped in labne purchased at the back deli], and six veggie grape leaf rolls.  Lunch + leftovers = $20.

All of it was fresh, delicious, and enormously stirring.  Their blends of spices and dips are phenomenal.  I considerably recommend Al-Hana as a quick stop for genuine M.E. grub."
5,"Many friends have raved about Perk Cup Cafe & Grille and I finally had a chance to go there and it was terrific.  I had one of their overstuffed omelettes (called Healthy One, which was stuffed with fresh and delicious baby spinach, tomato, mushroom, green pepper, artichoke hearts, and onion.  I did not add cheese but it was an option). Yummy.  I had the choice of home fries or fresh tomato slices as my side.  I chose the tomato and were they ever flavorful.  I think they came out of a garden instead of through a store.  I also had the choice of toast, bagel or English muffin.  I chose the English muffin which was fat and delicious.  We added a side of fresh fruit:  strawberries, pineapple and cantelope which were all perfectly ripened and delicious.  I chose to have their flavored coffee and I loved it!  My friend had a beautiful salad and a cup of their homemade chicken soup, and was very pleased with the quality of ingredients and flavors.  Our food was superior.  The restaurant itself is newly built, very clean and features walls of art by various local artists which can be purchased.  It's a lovely environment.

Now, I did read the Yelp reviews posted on this site before I went.  Because I have heard so many positive comments from friends about Perk Cup Cafe I decided that we would give it a try.  Our experience was nothing like the reviews I read.  There were plenty of busy and friendly waitresses.  The place was nearly full with lots of chatter from young to old.  People were enjoying themselves.  Our waitress, Sheena, told me that the negative Yelp reviews resulted in the departure of certain employees and replaced with customer service oriented people.

Bottom line is that Perk Cup Cafe is doing a really good job.  Everything that you would want in a local establishment is top notch here.  I'm happy for the city of Berea that their town can offer such a nice establishment.

P.S.  I have been told that their weekend brunch is a must try.  We will be going!"
5,This is the best shop by far in vegas. Their prices are the lowest in town. All their flavors are spot and are soo addicting.my favorites are loopy custard and yabba dabba doo custard.
5,"For those of you looking for a diner with Mid-West prices, portions and hospitality, this is it!  I went there not knowing what to expect and found the plates to be packed to the edges, the service to be just enough without being pushy or disruptive and the check to be well within reason!  I will definitely e returning in the near future."
5,One of my favorite placea.  The patio in the summer is great and the food never disappoints.  I have tried most of the menu and i have not had a bad choice.  The burgers and the Salmon are the best in the area.  The wings are up there as well.
5,"BEST PLACE TO GO!!!
In this difficult climate of trying to navigate one's health care, this location couldn't be more helpful. Every question I have had, has been promptly answered and the doctor's expertise knowledge in directing  me to exactly to what I need and what I was inquiring about has been a God send!  
Thank you for your great advise on the Bvitamin boosters and the wonderful (and truly affordable) packages you have! 

I'd give you a million stars if I could!!!!"
5,"Always awesome, always accommodating, always friendly!

Oh yeah, my teeth are super clean!

Thanks Dr. Dee!"
5,"Awesome yogurt, amazing toppings as well as the acai bowl! They have the friendliest staff who are quick to greet us when we walk through the door offering us samples of whatever flavor we want! Go here and you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,"Located in Central Crossing Plaza all the way at the end of the strip off of Lamar Ave, this nail salon is a hidden gem in plaza midwood. The atmosphere and decor is very modern and looks high-fashion, but it's all comfortable and functional. Also, HGTV and Food Network play everyday....that's all I need in life. The pedicure chairs are the most comfortable ones I've ever sat in (I always struggle with those weird neck pillows attached to the chairs). The receptionist today was a doll. I learned that the owner, Michael, made the salon how it looks today with his bare hands. Tina was my nail technician for a gel manicure and toe polish change. SHE IS THE HOLY GRAIL. She cut my cuticles like a goddess, my hands looked like model hands. She also polishes all the way to the cuticle, so do not fret if you have Tina! I live in Greensboro but I definitely am considering becoming a regular here - it's totally worth the drive!"
5,As a PT myself i have nothing but wonderful things to say about the great crew at this establishment. Rest assured if you are seeking medical care here you will be well cared for. Wish I could give them 100 stars!!!
5,Great Salon with great customer service! Just relocated to Charlotte and found out about this Salon on Yelp and they're definitely worth going to if you want to get pampered! Anytime I request an appointment through Yelp I get a response right back.  A young lady by the name of S did my pedicure and was amazing (see you in 2 wks S)! I will always be requesting S and I can't remember the lady name who did my nails but she was great too!! It's not a gimmick this place is great as well as the Customer Service!!
5,"MMMMMmmmmmm.....

I had my first waffle cone, it was so worth the extra $1.20
and the flavours....
the strawberry cheesecake was a bit disappointing but the creme brule and sweet cream...omg
and at the end I wasn't as thirsty and grossed out with myself as I usually am after ice cream-maybe because it's made with real cream. 

It's not cheap though, for ice cream. Two smalls in waffle cones came to nearly $12. Nonetheless, for a rare treat, it was great :-)"
5,"Love this place! Not a ton of options on the menu, and I've only eaten breakfast here. Their coffee is amazing, and the hash brown are extra crispy-which I love!"
5,"So thankful for Auden Leyva at AZ Spine and Disc, he has helped me stay injury free during my marathon training.  It has helped tremendously!   I recommend AZ Spine and Disc to everyone not just runners or athletes."
5,"I love ASDS and highly recommend them. Everyone is so nice from the front to the back. Scheduling is very flexible. Dr. Vince is amazing for my chiropractic needs especially since my knee replacement Dec 2017. He takes his time with you and answers all my questions. He definitely knows what he is doing. I have had back issues for over 30 years and have been to numerous chiropractors and they all have been great and very helpful. ASDS....there is no comparison with all that they offer. It's not JUST chiropractic care. This place is HUGE! You have a choice if you prefer private adjustment rooms, a whole separate medical office/staff, separate gym from physical therapy area, acupuncture, auquatherapy, pain management, massages, supplements, personal training, and more!"
5,"This place is a million times better than any ice-cream shop out there.  Their NY Cheesecake and pomegranate yogurt is so good when mixed together.  The perfect blend of sweet and sour.

My little brother is a really picky eater and hates just about all sweets on the planet but even he enjoys this place which is saying a lot.

The store is really clean and the prices are pretty darn reasonable.  I took 3 people here and paid less than $20 for us all which compared to dairy queen it's cheaper and healthier for you.  Just writing this review makes me want to hop in my car and speed on down there before they close tonight. Soooo yummy!"
5,"I have been a smoker since I was 14... I'm 25 now, so for roughly 11 years my lungs have been full of tar and bad toxins. I have been vaping for almost 8 months and I love every bit of it! I get the feeling of smoking but without all the harmfulness of it. Now I've been to many vape store all across vegas and I have to say PUFF VAPORS is definitely the best Vape store in vegas Hands down! Best prices on mods, tanks, tips, and custom juices. Along with the un-beatable prices, the staff is unbelievably knowledgeable in every piece of equipment and hardware. I had the chance to meet the owner Scott and the assistant manager Konrad, and let me just say those guys made me feel like ""part of the family"" the second I walked in. If your looking for a vape store that you can feel comfortable and welcome with a huge side kindness, then Puff vapors is hands down the place for you! I will definately be going back and spreading the word for these guys! It's places like this that we need in this town instead of the ""get in, spend your money, and go"" stores."
5,Obsessed with this place. Everyone there is SO helpful and take the time to answer all your questions. I always spend more than I planned but that's because they have the best selection. This is my new go to place. Thanks guys
5,"Def has become my fav froyo spot. The owners are super nice, the staff is helpful without being annoying, the place is super clean and most importantly the selection is awesome! I love the tart with almonds, berries and coconut! YUM! Hot temps are around the corner, but at least I've found a great place to cool down!"
5,Auden is amazing!  He gets me functional every time!  The chiropractor there have a great knowledge of functional mechanics and can get you on your way!
5,"This little restaurant is amazing.  As authentic as it gets (as far as I know).  With cheap prices and traditional food, you cannot go wrong.  

Chicken Shwarmas, babaganoush, hummus, falafel, pies, and kabobs are delicious.

Baklava from the bakery area is amazing as well.

I do suggest covering up your shoulders and wearing pants, as there are a lot of Muslims who frequent the store and restaurant.  I felt uncomfortable wearing shorts and a tank my first visit (which was during the summer) but it was my mistake."
5,"I stopped by and selected a Shawarma plate for lunch after spotting the giant rotating spit of beef. The serving size was huge; it ended up being a meal and a half. The beef, rice, hummus, and other accompaniments were all delicious. Even relative to other similar authentic middle eastern places, I felt that the food was a step up. Everything was just tastier. Al-Hana is out of the way for me, but I definitely plan to return."
5,Great homemade ice cream. Waffle cones are made in house (sometimes you can see them being made from the front window)
5,"The kids convinced me to come back here to get the pie that they have been craving and I wasn't wanting to go after the last visit but I did.  Very glad that I did.  The pie is amazing and the breakfast was also fantastic.  I don't know what happened but I have to say it was all as good as we experienced at the old location.  You must have the pie regardless of when you visit.  Pie is good for breakfast, lunch or dinner here."
5,"I moved to Charlotte about 4 months ago and thought I would try a few salons before picking one. However after visiting Tiptoe, I have never gone else where. This salon has exceptional service and quality of product! Michael always gives me great recommendations for new styles to try. I always leave loving my nails and getting more compliments than ever. Thanks Tiptoe!"
5,"The experience is great. The office is clean, and the staff is friendly. And they do their best to accommodate your needs. Thank you!"
5,"I love Dee for Dentist. I was impressed with the clean office and they were very accommodating with my busy schedule. I've had a hard time finding a great, honest dentist here in town and I highly recommend their office to anyone. Everyone there is so nice and friendly, especially my dental hygienist, Kristen.  She is so gentle and does a great job cleaning my teeth."
5,I've been getting chiro and massage therapy from AZ spine for a few months now and I can honestly say I've had major improvements. The staff here are attentive and friendly
5,"""I dont review often....... but when I do....... "" I must say the most courteous and pleasant dental office I have ever been to. Yes they are that awesome!!!! A+++++ for sure in my book"
5,"Note: I only ever get the In-N-Out pedi with regular polish.

I LOVE this place. I get my mani done elsewhere (I have a lady I love who does my SNS) but I really look forward to my pedi's here every ~3 weeks. They have red/white wine, Kuerig coffee, bottled water and PB/Cheese crackers available. 

I also really like their color set up. The have every color under the sun, and the matching gel bottle right behind it. Very organized, very good for my OCD. 

Come here for a $25 pedi with red wine and PB crackers included. That's my idea of perfect."
5,"I must say that this place is the first restaurant recommended to us by a voice synthesized computer (we asked 'Siri', the artificial intelligence voice resident on our iPhone 5, to recommend some breakfast places {they serve lunch/dinner too}, and one of the places 'she' mentioned was Perk-Cup Cafe)!  We definitely 'owe her one'!  We were looking for a new place to try for breakfast, and let me tell you, this excellent cafe/restaurant does NOT dissapoint!   Breakfast (which is served all day) choices are plentiful, and my wife was thrilled with her delicious 'Miss Vicki' breakfast bake, which is a combination of layered sun dried tomato pesto, provolone, italian sausage, hash browns, and scrambled eggs.  I had a cheddar cheese omelet with red onions (with rye toast), and a pancake side.  Both were scrumptious!  The interior is very nice and modern, with a huge 'open air' layout that looks like a combination diner / hip cafe, complete with fireplace, armchairs lounge area, high chairs and a long bar table lining the windows, and conventional dining tables and booths.  And a pastry counter to test your will-power on the way in or out!  VERY nice!  On a side note, the restrooms are immaculate clean, and they even have a drive-thru pickup window too, as well as free Wi-Fi!  The staff is very professional and friendly too.  My only regret is that we didn't discover this gem sooner!  Needless to say, HIGHLY recommended!"
5,This has got to be the best Vape shop I have ever shopped at all of the staff know what they are talking about and are not just out to sell you something for a commission. The friendly comfortable atmosphere has me wanting to spend the entire day just relaxing and enjoying company.  The e-juice has got to be the tastiest made right there as I wait.
5,"When it comes to great ice cream, I think that Ed's real scoop is the way to go. If you are lucky enough to live in The Beaches, then you might want to try Ed's ice cream. When you look in the window, you see Ed's famous GELATO, and who doesn't like gelato?!

Ed would be very happy if you tried his ice cream on a nice hot and sunny day.

My Dad's favourite is the Burned marshmallow flavour. It is up there in Ed's best work. Maybe if you write a review of Ed's real scoop some day, you can share your valued opinion to the world. 

I realized that most people put 4 stars. I am assuming that they haven't had the full on Ed's experience.

In conclusion, Ed's Real Scoop is a hit!"
5,"The craft beer selection of draft and bottled goodies gets a 5 by itself. Nice lovely bar, delicious food and great service."
5,"The best breakfast place in the area.

We have been coming here since 2011, we bring friends and visitors.

First, it's a nice location with lots of parking, in a new plaza next to the train tracks. The restaurant is large, very clean and includes a fireplace with chairs, as well as an outdoor patio.

I recently stopped in to have a baker for breakfast. It's a baked breakfast dish, straight out of the oven in a ceramic pot to your table. Eggs, potatoes, and a variety of meats, vegetables and then topped with cheese. I had the VegetaBle baker and it was delicious. It came with rye toast, which was buttered.

My wife had pancakes with blackberry brandy. She asked for the side order version as the normal portions are rather large. The side portion included two large pancakes with a warm blackberry sauce that looked and tasted homemade.

All costs are very reasonable, my dish was 6.99 my wife's was less than that.

As a final perk, when leaving they asked if we wanted another coffee to go. Who has ever done that before?"
5,"We ordered Sanfratello's pastas and pizzas for my daughter's birthday party and we could not have been happier!
Service was fast and friendly. Portion sizes for their catering were more than enough! Prices were reasonable :)"
5,"Hands down best experience ever!!
I really appreciate the excellent care and advice!!  

THANK YOU!!!"
5,Love this place! Francesca was very sweet! She teaches me something new about Vaping everytime I see her;) great customer service and she is very patient and sweet;) Thank you momma!!
5,"So I came in yesterday because I had accidentally sat on my girlfriend's pen that was in my back pocket and it broke at one piece where it bent. I went in there asking for the exact pen showing the guy what happened and he examined it to see it was still firing and said he could just super glue it back together and it'd be fine. I was so blown away by this. He could've easily just sold me a new one to get the money but he didn't, not only didn't but fixed it for me! I will come here and only here for my vaping needs because this a top notch customer service driven shop."
5,"Oh dear goodness, the fact that Yogurtology has become something of an obsession of mine over the past couple of months + finding this location ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK= very bad news for my wallet. On the other hand, I will now be in heaven without having to drive 30 mins out of the way.

There is peace and happiness in my life.

(Read my other review of the camelback location, but its 5 stars now)"
5,"I've been going to Michael for 3+ years now; in my opinion, his work is stellar. From the first time he polished my nails (as a walk-in) I knew, at that moment, I would never go to anyone else! He knows my likes/dislikes and if I am ever displeased with the results (which is rare), he does what it takes as a professional to ensure I leave with a smile on my face. I love the new salon!! It is very modern and spacious. Thank you, Michael, for the work you do. I always receive compliments on my nails. Going to give the coffin nail a try, next!!"
5,"I love this salon and I have high standards coming from NYC where there are a million great nail salons.

I used to live in NODA, but moved to south Charlotte and I'll still be coming here.

I'm also that lady that just brought her baby (I would never do this on the weekend or after 5, but I was desperate and we are going on vacation).  They were great at getting me in and out and working around the wiggly baby.  I still got a great mani/pedi and they were all so nice to me and my baby."
5,"This office is amazing! Great staff and so many options of care. Everything from specialized Chiropractic, to Physical Therapy. They also have one of the best Sports med/Rehab Doc in AZ. I would def recommend seeing any of AZ Spine's providers!!!"
5,Best shop in Vegas . I refuse to go to any other shop. The costumer service is the best I've ever had. The asians are nice too.
5,"I absolutely love this place! They have amazing customer service! Always take good care of their customers and it's not like you walk in without being greeted and have to figure everything out by yourself, which I appreciate that very much, other vape shops aren't as helpful as this one!"
5,"I just moved to Charlotte and I'm so glad I found this nail salon. Super clean, modern, and friendly. They really take their time on each customer and don't rush through the experience. I'm very impressed with the attention to detail. 100% would recommend to friends and won't be going anywhere else to get my mani's and pedi's!"
5,"RASPBERRY w/ WHITE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM  AT ED's IS DIVINE.
I get it every year when I go to the beaches jazz fest, (since they are located across from OMalley's which is where gofreddygo--awesome cover band & in my opinion the best at the jazzfest-- performs outside of :) When you walk by Ed's you can smell the waffle cones (they make everything RIGHT THERE!) so everything is extra fresh and delish.  They also have really cool flavours including seasonal ones & it just tastes so much better than baskinrobbins..... mmm i wish i was there right now.   *note- not really a sit down place, its pretty small/narrow to accomodate a long line but who eats ice cream inside anyways, esp. when you could be walking on the boardwalk :)"
5,"If I could give it more stars I would.  I grew up on this pizza and it tastes as good now as it did then.  Amazing!  Great crust and flavorful ingredients.  Their sausage is incredible.  You can't find pizza this good anywhere here, trust me we've tried. My only complaint is that it's not closer to my house so we could go more often.  We met the owner, Scott, today and he's a great guy.  Give this place a try, you won't be sorry!"
5,"I would agree that it is hard to go wrong with froyo but I absolutely do not think all frozen yogurts are created equal.  Yogurtology is head and shoulders above the rest!  Imagine starting your yogurt creation with a tempting ""bottoming"" like a moon pie, brownie, or graham cracker crumbs, next add the smoothest, creamiest, most flavorful frozen yogurt ever created, and finish off your delight with any number of topping from the huge topping bar!  Not only that, Yogurtology is immaculately clean at all times and has very good customer service too!

My frozen yogurt habit is definitely on the ridiculous side of things and when I say I LOVE Yougurtology it is an understatement.

P.S. if you have been to Yogurtology and you did not at least sample the Oatmeal Cookie you have not been to Yogurtology...I advise going back now!"
5,"I LOVE ice cream and gelato~ and outside of Florence, I honestly feel this is the best...  I've had the chocolate ice cream, chili chocolate and pistacio gelato...  all awesome.
And the service and atmosphere is the cherry on top:)

yumyumyumyum!!"
5,"I highly recommend! I went to see Auden Levya & he did a superb job.. definitely knows what he's doing. I'm an ultra trail runner & have to admit that I don't do stretches/yoga on the regular, so definitely had some knots all throughout my body. He definitely worked it all out! I will be back :) thank you!!"
5,"I just can't say enough about this place.

I had a problem with my current mod, so I brought it in to Scottie. He brought out the pliers and screwdriver and went to town on this thing...the guy really takes care of his customers.

Unfortunately, the problem I had wasn't completely fixable (though Scott got it working better than it had been). I ended up buying a new mod: the Privari mini. Beautiful piece of machinery. It's also the one Scott uses and he hasn't steered me wrong yet!

Love this place."
5,"Clean, fresh, and organized!  The staff is so friendly and welcoming.  As soon as we entered, there was a young lady who asked politely if we would like to try anything.  All of the toppings and goodies were filled to the rim and had such a variety.

Two thumbs up for the cleanliness, variety and friendly staff!"
5,"Came here after grandsons basketball game - nice little find!  Split a sandwich & had a beer.  Great sandwich & home cut fries - service was great - brewmaster came out & introduced himself & gave us samples of their Rival IPAs!  We are seldom in this area, but if we are again, we will make a stop!!"
5,"Shoutout to Mike for always taking care of us and giving the best recommendations. He knows his stuff and will really help you out. The staff is cool and all give out good vibes. Puff has all the good stuff too, especially their juice"
5,"Since sweet Marie of Modern Nails (my former super loyal only-would-go-somewhere-else-if-my-best-friend-made-me nail salon) sold the business, I was total devo. She went on sabbatical for a month and immediately the vibe changed and I moved neighborhoods anyway so I went on a hunt for a new salon. After trying a half dozen places around Central Charlotte I ended up here. 

Michael, the owner of Tiptoe, once worked at Modern Nails so he comes from good pedigree and gives great service. They also seem to have a hostess who checks people in and offers them drinks, cleans up, etc. 

To my delight, the place is very open (I had crowded, cramped salons) and kind of industrial modern which is different.  They have a ""fine"" color selection (they have the hip colors but I'd like to see more Essie) but I often bring my own anyway so that's OK. The staff is much younger and more hip than the typical staffs and take your cue about whether or not you want to talk or not. :) They all speak English primarily or very fluently. Both techs I've been do have done a great job with a smooth polish. The only word of warning- the massage chairs can be either pretty wonderful or brutal depending on if you have knots in your back. 

They offer organic spa pedis with good products which is nice - I always question how many parabens and chemical toxins are in the lotions so it's nice to have a place that offers a better alternative. 

I'm so glad my new hood has a great nail salon!"
5,"From the staff to Dr. Dee are all wonderful. After having problems about 2 years ago with a different Dentist, I just felt the need to go else where. I am so glad I found Dee For Dentist. 

Dr Dee, is honest and will take time with you and answer any questions you have."
5,"This is the second year I have been a patient at Ahwatukee Spine and Disc Center.
Dr. Christopher is the most knowledgeable and caring chiropractor I have experienced anywhere in the valley. She is realistic about my long term challenges but has also been extremely effective in addressing minor injuries that cause daily discomfort. I have avoided more invasive treatments because of her expertise.
She employees other professions who also exceed my expectations with the compassion and skill that they demonstrate.
I highly recommend this office and staff. I am very grateful for the support that is provided by this team for my optimum health."
5,"Oh Al-Hana, your garlic sauce will be the end of me. This little spot in the Baiz Market is not located in the best part of town but is truly a gem. My husband loves their schwarma sandwiches and I always get the chicken ta-ook (I apologize profusely for the atrocious spelling). I also love the tabouli. We have also had their meat and cheese pies which are pretty good. They have really good hummus and babaganoush. The garlic sauce that comes with it is to die for and I always want to eat ungodly amounts of it. Pita bread and garlic sauce...that could be my meal in itself. Love it. I always like picking up a packages of pita bread while we are there. I think we spend less than $1 for a pack of 6 pitas. Crazy cheap! Would I go to Baiz to buy groceries? Not so much but we definitely make the drive for Al-Hana."
5,"Really liked their Oatmeal cookie yogurt, which they make on site. 
Have many different flavors and toppings. Friendly staff!
They have both inside and outside seating!
Will definitely go back!"
5,"Toasted marshmallow.  Get it.
Oh yeah, they also make their own waffle cones Fresher than Will Smith.  You can walk in here on the weekend and watch them bending the waffle around a metal cone, it's really cool. In the bottom of each waffle icecream cone is a little melty surprise that you'll get to discover.

I used to travel from Don Mills and Lawrence just to get this ice cream, now that I live in the beach I've had to refrain from eating 2x a day!

Icecream doesn't get better than this."
5,"Went there for the first time today and got the organic pedicure.  It was awesome!  Great location, loved the massage chairs and my feet feel fabulous.  Great find!"
5,"Been coming to this place since their second day open. In love with their juice & customer service.

Definitely one of the first places I go to immediately once I'm back in town. 

Any member of the staff will go out of their way to help you out with your personal vape needs and they are all extremely knowledgeable. There's no run around or just looking to sell you the most expensive thing here, they want to ensure you are happy with your purchase. 

I recommend all of my family and friends to go here for the great service, atmosphere, and products!"
5,"Absolutely wonderful!!! I was in so much pain. When I called to make a new pt appointment, I found out my insurance was out of Network but their staff & office supervisor worked with me so that I could be seen. The staff was ver courteous & professional. Dr. Pierce was great & took time to explain everything to me. I walked out after my appointment feeling awesome!! I will definitely be going back to see them"
5,"Dr Ryan Rudd is fantastic, he really takes his time and listens to what my ailments are so he can manipulate me the proper way! I have never left feeling worse after treatment and always enjoy going to see Dr Rudd when I am in need of treatment because I know he will fix me up!!! Thanks AZ Spine Disc and Sport and Dr Rudd for taking great care of me!!!"
5,Great place and friendly staff that always want to help you. I love there cupcake yogurt flavor. Good prices and lots of extras for your yogurt as well
5,"Holy moly, this is decadent ice cream!

So far, I've tried: 
-Burnt Marshmallow (my favourite! Tastes exactly as it should: delicious)
-French Mint ice cream (similar to a mint chocolate chip - can't go wrong)
-Pumpkin ice cream (seasonal - so flavourful and spiced! Like pumpkin pie in a cone!)
-Coconut gelato (oh my goodness)
-Green Tea ice cream (comparable to sushi restaurants' selections)

ALL GOOD. I can't wait to try more.

The service is excellent, friendly and prompt. There's always about 4 lovely people behind the counter (in the summer at least). They're more than happy to let you try any of the flavours.

You can get half scoops of different combos, regular scoops, large scoops... it's a lot of ice cream! To give you an idea, two regular scoops fills the waffle cone. You can also get any of the flavours made into a milkshake. 

It's clean, brightly-lit and there is adequate amount of seating inside and out on the benches facing the street - but I've never really seen anybody sit inside. And if you go by enough, you'll notice that unless it's very hot or very cold outside, the door is always open so that the tantalizing scent of the freshly-made waffle cones is ready to draw you in."
5,We had the chicken and beef shawarma sandwiches and it was delicious!!! Would definitely come back to eat and try different menu items.
5,"I would recommend AZSDS for Physical Therapy without any reservation. Dr. Whipple is knowledgeable and up to date on all the latest techniques and modalities. As a result she is able to modify and adjust each treatment as necessary. Perhaps best of all, she has retained her Vermonter sensibilities and sense of humor and this goes a long way when dealing with a complex case! In addition the entire facility at AZSDS is top notch and the practitioners work seamlessly together. Have I mentioned the HydroWorx? As Dr. Whipple likes to say, ""it's a game changer!"""
5,"This place blew my expectations out of the water.  I took my girlfriend and we both ordered the Clevelander, which was sirloin steak,  corn on the cob and a baked potato. It.was.so.good. I can't even begin to explain how great it was. I then told our waitress how much I enjoyed myself and she told her manager who then came over to our table to shake our hands and tell us she appreciated having us as patrons. They had a lot of people who were clearly enjoying themselves. Friendly service and they seemed like they were really proud of their restaurant. I will definitely be going back."
5,"If I could give six stars I would. Going to the dentist is never something you look forward to. On this occasion I was in for a crown of top of a fresh root canal two days earlier. I was already sore and knew I was in for more of the same. Jo does a great job of prepping the site, and building the crown through her video game as she calls it.

It is very comforting to know your dentist takes a great deal of pride in her work. I'm the type that is very tense in the chair, and Dr. Browner has a way to calm that feeling with her professional attitude and calm confidence. She let me know it was a challenging procedure and she would do her best to achieve the desired results. As of today, everything is A-OK. 

The entire staff is helpful and friendly. The practice is immaculate, and welcoming. I appreciate their service and keeping my choppers in working order. :)"
5,My friends and I love this place! It has a Great selection of quality of yogurt. It also has all of the toppings we could ever want. I am always very pleased with our service as well. I definitely recommend it!
5,This place is amazing so hi-tech and detailed .  Super friendly staff . This office is clean and has great lighting lol.  We set a plan for my services that fit my budget.   Dr. Dee is very impressive she is down to earth but very knowledgeable .  I'm so happy I found this place
5,"came here for dessert at night. this place closes pretty early at 9:30 so we just made it in time. it's a cute small place but compared to everywhere else it had a long line up. the line moved quickly and there were many choices of ice cream to get and you can mix and match for the same price. all sizes came with two flavours !! 

we were able to taste test the flavours which was great and I got the regular size for $4.33 plus tax which was a good price and I got to get a free topping and I got gummy bears!!! the portion was perfect for me. the waffle cone is $1.33 more but taste very delicious and crispy. 

I chose the flavour chocolate cheesecake and cookies and cream and they did not disappoint. both were perfectly sweet and creamy. my favourite flavour of ice cream is cookies and cream and the cookies they put were soft and YUMMYYY. everyone in the group left satisfied.

overall the place is really good and I would recommend it to everyone. they have unique flavours such as burnt marshmallow that my friend really liked and taste like real burnt marshmallow. one set back is the way they take orders because they do it by groups which is a little weird and can cause some chaos. other then that a cute little store by the beach with amazing ice cream"
5,Great shop. Good flavors and great products. One of the best vape shops in Vegas. Very happy with all the products I have gotten and they try to help retiring customers with fair pricing and friendly customer service. Highly recommend!
5,"I LOVE this place!!!

Beautiful decor, and great customer service.  Someone greeted us when we arrived and offered us something to drink and a seat in their waiting area right away. 

We only had to wait about 10-15 minutes, which was great since we were walk ins on a Friday evening!  I was visiting a friend in Charlotte to get away from Hurricane Matthew and needed to get my nails done - found this place on Yelp and so glad I did!!

They have a great selection of nail polish - and they pair the gel/regular polishes together by color which I love.  That way you don't have to hunt down the match to your gel color when you want regular polish on your toes. 

I got a full set - woman was great. Not super chatty, but I had no problem with that at all.  She spoke when it mattered (asked me what shape I wanted, pointed out how the polish is organized, etc.).  Wish I lived closer!  I plan on making  a point to get my nails done here whenever I'm next in Charlotte!"
5,"I've been a client of Michael Tran for 7 years. He is absolutely the best in Charlotte!! I constantly receive compliments on my acrylic/gel nails. He is super talented, and his new salon is state of the art!!!  Love TipToe!!"
5,"Between the knowledgeable staff and amazing prices, this place literally makes you feel safe in this over saturated vapor market. I feel like there are now more vapor stores than McDonald's around town, with that comes very inconsistent treatment, prices, and information. Trust me when I say that this should be your one ""go-to"" place for any of your vapor needs. I would like to commend Scott (the owner) for his proactive approach of always being close enough to his business to instill such good customer treatment to his employees, and for hiring Shane as a manager. With the two of them there, the place is a well oiled machine, and it will have my complete loyalty throughout my vaping life. They have even helped remedy situations that OTHER vapor stores messed up on to earn my business with them. 

10 out of 10 on everything. Keep up the great work guys!

Lucas Barcelo"
5,"I went here today to take a couple work clients out to lunch. I'm from Dublin Ohio but these clients are from the area and picked the location.

The building itself looks brand new inside and out. The place is very clean and big. I noticed that they have a party room also.

They serve all day breakfast and have wonderful smelling coffee! 

I had the short rib sandwich, the guys had a fish sandwich and quesadilla. Everything looked fresh. My sandwich was outstanding! The meat was juicy and very tender. The sauce was also very good.

I would go back here in a heart beat. My Cleveland office is about a mile away from it and rest assure I'll be back!"
5,"Let me start by saying that I haven't been to a dentist in over 20 years. Dentists terrify me. But I had a situation where I had to go...and I am very glad I found Dee. First, I called them at 10:30a, and they had me in at 1:00p. Then, when it turned out I needed treatment STAT due to infection, but I was going to leave because my anxiety was through the roof, they called in a script to help calm me down, and fit me in for a second time to do the procedure. The Doctor herself called me to check on me. The entire staff was caring, professional, and efficient. I highly recommend."
5,The food has always been priced reasonable and taste fantastic. Dinner prices could be a little more expensive but the quality makes it worthwhile.
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! Be prepared, this is a call-in-your-order, delivery or stop-in-and-order place. Now that you know, get ready for a fantastical experience for your taste buds. The pizza is different than what you find elsewhere. Sanfratello's uses very high quality ingredients including 100% Scamorza cheese and YES, it makes a difference. I'm also a huge fan of pizza sauce done right and Sanfratello's got it down perfectly. They also have really good pasta (not sticky, gooey or stuff that's been sitting around in a pan) and stellar meatballs. How's this for a change of pace... Sanfratello's has ribs. I was too stuffed with pizza, salad and pasta to try the ribs, so that will have to wait for next time. Definitely consider Sanfratello's for a refreshing change of pace on the valley's pizza scene."
5,"Been to this place a few times and I gotta say they are the best! Unlike other vape shops with ""poser gangstas"" who try to make vaping look cool, these guys are just here to make vaping fun and easy specially for newbies like me. Their prices are unbeatable and customer service is outstanding! I'd definitely be sending more business their way.thanks guys!!!"
5,"A locally owned Mesa gem, well-known to folks from the neighborhood including the friends of mine who introduced me. The most delicious pies in the world, my favorite being coconut cream. Awesome breakfast entrees. Really friendly staff who actually seem to be from Iowa. And an interior that actually does magically transport you back to a small-town diner in the middle of rural Iowa. 

Eating here is simply a classic American dining experience from top to bottom."
5,I checked this place out for the first time last week and loved it! Amazing service and great quality work! My gel nails have never looked better! I was offered a glass of white wine and a refill when she notices my glass was empty. Pedicure was perfection! Highly recommend!
5,"This is absolutely the best place to get your nails done in the Plaza Midwood / Uptown area!!! Such a clean modern space with amazing massage chairs, nice tv's, fun music, good wine, and a great selection of colors. And the best part - the owners and staff are super friendly and do everything to make sure you have a good experience.  I've been going with a friend about every two weeks since they first opened.... I won't go anywhere else!!"
5,"OK, I'm not used to getting so much tasty food for so cheap. Another rare gem found through yelp! While some of the reviews described an eatery that seemed to good to be true, I've never been disappointed by any establishment recommended by my fellow reviewers so I knew I was in for a treat. And boy, what a treat is was! The babaganooj was the best I've ever had, the beef kebab sandwich was really delicious and so substantial that I almost regretted having ordered other things. I wish I could remember the name of the dessert we had (I'll have it again anyway, when I return) but the cheese, the crushed pistachio nuts and the syrup made for a really rich heavenly delight. Another place that I'm kind of glad isn't too near where I live ... otherwise I'd be constantly overeating."
5,"I love Tip Toe and Michael has done an amazing job with the salon and his staff. I started seeing Michael when I moved from Chicago last year and I feel lucky I found him. I get gel manis every two weeks and my nails are in fantastic shape and stay on without chips the full two weeks. He uses the best products (with always updated polish shades) which I think makes the difference in the quality of the service.  Salon is clean and brand new; very relaxing with a nice glass of wine. Michael has long time loyal customers ( I count myself as one) and once you go you will forever be ruined for another spot. Run, don't walk, to Tip Toe!!"
5,"Stoped in on a Wednesday morning around 9:00, after a visit to my doctor's office.  Noticed all the cars in the parking lot and knew there wasn't an outbreak of malaria nearby, so I assumed they were here for some other reason.

Glad I came in.  The service was a bit slow getting seated and then getting my order placed, but to reiterate, just a BIT slow.  The place was pretty crowded and the lag in service wasn't due to people not caring.

I wanted something light and simple, so I asked for 2 eggs over medium, ham steak, coffee and water.  The food came right out (brought by a different person than the one that took my order- good teamwork!) and was exactly what I expected.

There is also a nice 'lounge' area with a couple of leather chairs on either side of a fireplace.  Nice alternative to a Starbucks. Would not hesitate to come back again.

After I paid, waitress asked if I wanted a cup of coffee to go. 4 stars just went to 5!"
5,"Michael Tran, the best in Charlotte, has finally opened his own operation in plaza midwood and what could be better?  Utmost attention to detail, quick but attentive service, high quality products and the newest colors are all what I've come to expect from Michael and all are already evident on opening day at his new salon.  Amazing!!!"
5,"Every time I would go ""back home"" to visit, I had to stop at Sanfratello's in Glenwood, IL.  I was so sad when they closed!  When I read Sanfratello's opened in Gilbert  I was thrilled!  I have ordered quite a few times and it is consistently good.  We like the thin crust with sausage and green peppers.  I haven't tried anything else yet because I just love the pizza."
5,"You need to come and try this bar that isn't on a normal street corner. The wife and I stopped in for late night dinner and boy did they deliver. I have not had bar food this diverse, unique, and tasty in a long time. I will be coming back for more."
5,Best Chiropractors around!  Have been coming here for years and would highly recommend.  They always resolve my pain and don't recommend unnecessary treatment.
5,"This place  is THE BEST place  to get all of your vape needs. Every flavor imaginable.  Top notch customer service.  If I'm out of juice or anything I need for my vape I REFUSE to go anywhere else. This is THE PLACE to go.. add a matter of faced you can sample flavors in there """"sample""""bar and chill and have a cup of coffee.  I recommend this place as the hands down place to go.."
5,"Wow! I must say this is the nicest dental office I've ever been to. The pictures posted dont lie. 

I came last minute during a Bach party because of the unbearable pain in my mouth. 

My friend recommended this place since it was a friend of a friend.  I called in last minute and the doc was able to see me.  Yay!

She was great and so sweet!  My toothache is gone and I wish she was in Cali so I can make her my go-to dentist!"
5,"If you're looking for a great place to watch all the games, you've found it! The service was great and the food was served hot, good and quick!
We both had steaks with vegetables and potatoes. The asparagus was cooked to perfection and the steaks were exactly the way we ordered them.
Great time, great food, great 
service"
5,"This is my favorite local bar. Great food, Great PATIO. Always looks packed but I think everyone just drives up separate there. Been going to rivals for years and never have had a problem!"
5,"Great place to eat. Fun atmosphere, extremely friendly staff, and very reasonably priced. This place is a diamond in the rough and we can't believe
we didn't try it earlier. We absolutely recommend this place.  Get the potato chips!"
5,"The staff at AZ Spine Disc & Sport is amazing! I've had back pain for as long as I can remember, maybe 2+ years. I decided to try chiropractic to see if it would work for me since I have heard many positive comments about it. It worked!!!  For the first time in years I know what it is to live without pain. It even felt weird the first couple of days to wake up and have no pain, kind of something was missing but in a good way. Dr. Rudd and Dr. Christopher are very knowledgeable. They both took the time to find the reason for my pain and used that information to come up with the best treatment for me. Because not every patient is the same or has the same condition, they look for the root cause of the problem and build a treatment based on those findings. I feel great and will continue with my treatments to keep my back healthy. If you have never been to a chiropractor or have had negative experiences with others, give AZ Spine Disc and Sport a chance, you will not regret it."
5,Amazing gelatos! I never tried a better ice cream in my life!! Everybody should try it at least once!! Very tasteful anything you will get will surprise you! Pistachio gelato is the best!
5,"If I could summarize Ed's in one word, it would undoubtedly be: yuummmmm! My cousin took me here for my first time a couple of summers ago. We got the raspberry white chocolate and it was so rich and creamy- which is never a bad thing! The next time I went was around mid-October. Although we were all freezing our bums off, we still made the trek to Ed's- it was just THAT trek-worthy! There is always a line-up but who wouldn't sacrifice 5 minutes of their life for Ed's?"
5,"The atmosphere here is different from every vape shop in the city. Scott is an incredibly welcoming host and their staff is exceptionally knowledgeable. It's a great place to hang out as well, and is quickly becoming my favorite place to go when I'm in need of vaping supplies."
5,"No one I'd trust more than the amazing team at Dee for Dentist. All the latest technology,  a beautiful office and friendly staff.....made my experience that much better!"
5,"Always a great experience! As bad as going to the dentist can be, Dr Dee and her staff make it as easy as possible to get through it.
Thanks you guys!"
5,Seriously the BEST salon around. Moving here from Florida I've tried several salons and every experience has been terrible. This is place is clean and friendly! Also the pricing is way cheaper than I paid for horrible service!
5,Pretty awesome. A real taste of spring. If bold flavours in gelato. Heavenly creamy  ice cream.   Super team for a special family outing. If my kids could give it 100 stars. They would.
5,Great assortment of yogurt and great tasting! They let you have a sample first to make sure you like the yogurt but there's not one yogurt I don't like!you are always greeted at the door with a smile.
5,"Homemade waffle cones! With a marshmallow on the bottom so the ice cream doesn't drip out. So thoughtful. You can choose 2 flavours regardless of what size you get.

Tried: 
Burnt marshmallow ice cream - caramelly and not too sweet. Caramel swirl throughout. Ice cream has a good smooth texture

Lemon sorbet - has real lemon zest throughout. Refreshing after a greasy meal but quite sour. 

Waffle cone is a bit thick but crispy and light. The cone is very big so with 2 scoops of regular looks tiny

French Mint ice cream - tastes like After Eight. Has shaved chocolate throughtout. Not artificial green like regular mint chocolate chip ice cream.

Banana Gelato - tastes like real banana! Just the right sweetness like a ripe banana. Creamy texture, light and not too heavy. 

Lineup grows as it gets later but it moves very fast. They serve one group of people at a time."
5,"I love my doctor (Joy Wolfe) - she listens to me, understands me, and is genuinely concerned about my welfare, not hurrying me out of the office to make room for the next patient... The staff at AZ Spine Disc and Sport is also very professional and friendly! I highly recommend AZ Spine Disc and Sport!"
5,By far the best spot in Nevada!  I've searched a lot of different places for the best juices and I've finally found it. They have a fantastic loyalty program and their juices are the best in the business. The lebowski custard is amazing!!  Their staff is so friendly also. I'm a beginner to vaping and they've really been patient with me to explain what everything means so I pick the best products that will suit my lifestyle.  I will only buy from puff vapors!!
5,"Fun and helpful staff. Upward of 100 flavors, but usually around 80 are out for you to taste. Always great specials on juices like buy 2 get 1, and the prices are great. Check em out!"
5,"I hardly ever write reviews, but I felt the service I received the other day was so exemplary, it deserved one. Dr. Stone had been treating my wrist pain, and I was in need of an injection. I was told Dr. Stone was working a half day Thursday, then out the office that Friday, getting married on Saturday and spending the next 2 weeks out the country on his honeymoon.  Needless to say most people preparing for a wedding / honeymoon, wouldn't be interested in some work related patient. However, staff member Angel, and the other staff recognized I was in pain, and arranged a same day late appointment with Dr. Stone at like 6:30 Thursday night. Top notch service and care right there. I would recommend this facility to anyone."
5,I've never had a bad experience here! The food is always delicious and the employees are so sweet. Their sausage gravy is a gift from God.
5,"I have been seeing Michael for all of my mani/pedi needs for over 2 years now. He is simply the best! His new salon is modern, state of the art, clean and spacious. He uses high quality polishes and products and his prices are reasonable. Highly recommend! You will not be disappointed."
5,Hands down the best vapor shop in town! The staff super helpful and friendly! BEST JUICE AROUND!!!!!!
5,"This dental practice is as good as it gets!!! Their fun, modern facility is well-equipped with all the state-of-the-art technology you'll ever need. I'll admit--I've always been one to be quite weary of seeing new dentists (my aunt has always been my dentist growing up!), so moving to Vegas and trying to find quality care was a bit of a daunting task. Finding this gem of an office was SUCH a relief! Dr. Dee and her staff are the absolute BEST! Everyone on the team is professional, competent, and extremely sensitive to their patients' needs. They definitely go above and beyond to make sure you feel comfortable! I had a tiny phobia of hygienists coming in, but after meeting Row and seeing how gentle (no silently writhing in pain!), but thorough, she was, I was sold. I was so impressed that I even got my little sister and husband to join the party!;) Needless to say, if you are looking for a dentist who actually CARES about you (and remembers every little detail of your life that you share) and genuinely has your best interests in mind, Dee for Dentist is the place to be!!"
5,"Mmmmmm Dole whip sooooo excited to get it down the street from my house without having to go all the way to Disneyland or to Hawaii to the dole plantation. Super fantastic, yay yay yay"
5,"Beautiful space, clean, quality polish that lasts, the entire staff her is wonderful.  They have great hours and are in a great location.  Plaza Midwood needed a high quality salon and we have one now!  Dont go anywhere else."
5,heard about this place from a fellow vaper on the strip and this place puts it down.  amazing customer service (thanks Kacey) and beautifully blended juices.  thanks guys! keep up the great work
5,"The ice cream is excellent, but at this location there is only two benches outside and I was there  on an evening when it was 34C and sticky and from one dog, within a few minutes there was SEVEN dogs outside with their noses up other dogs and barking and just getting in the way. There was even a dog underneath the bench I was sitting on and no owner around.

What is wrong with these people in the Beaches?

This store is very small compared to the one in the High Park area, so can get really crowded with a double line squeezed into the back. For some reason the one on Roncy tastes better. The sugar cones are a bit on the sweet side compared to other places.

Great ice cream, but take it somewhere else to eat it."
5,"My wife and I moved to Las Vegas about a year ago and are fortunate to have found this place. Alison, Mike and Dee are great. Nice environment, friendly staff and good service. I would recommend this place for anyone with dental phobias or anxiety."
5,"Very good pizza & anti-pasta salad, also the service was really good and can't wait go back!"
5,"Score!! Just went to my usual nail spot on the way home from work and walked in to a line out the door. Ain't nobody got time for that. Used ol' trusty Yelp app to find something close by. This place has only been open 3 weeks so I'm the only one here on a Friday, but I'm sure it won't stay like that for long. It is sleek, modern, CLEAN, plays good music, HGTV on flat screen, everything a girl could want. The massage chairs are fantastic. I'm a happy girl."
5,"After reading the reviews I had to try this place so I took a friend today. We had beef and chicken shwarma, kebob, and 3 pies. Everything was really good and very inexpensive. The pita sandwiches are $4 and the pies 69 cents each so everything including drinks was under $20. 

While your there you HAVE to check out the store. They have some awesome stuff for really good prices. I had to get some olive oil and lamb chops becuase I couldn't pass up such a great deal and the meat looked very fresh."
5,"Attractive, fun, and super helpful staff! Tried so many places and flavors...never was content until I discovered Puff Vapors!!! Highly recommend them.  Thanks guys!!!"
5,"Top tier e-juice flavors and friendly knowledgable service.  Customizable nic/pg/vg in any size from 15ml up to 120ml.  I have no issues driving all the way up here to get Puff's liquid.  Their Puff Vapors ""Strawberry Icecream"" is my absolute secondary all-day-vape flavor.  I never get tired of it and I never have enough of it.  I vape 10pg/90vg 3nic and always vape about 120ml a week.  The prices for their e-juice are easily affordable.

I've been doing this vaping for almost 1 year now and I haven't had a single ciggarette since day 1.  Trust me, I've gone through as many e-juices as anyone ever should to finally find out just which ones have lasting power.  Puff makes high quality liquid and flavors that are addicting.  If you need a specific coil build they have a few handy builders on hand usually.  Got my girl a sub-ohm clapton build there yesterday and it was set up and done in no time.

I like everyone's positive attitude.  They really seem unified as a team, which is something I'd like to see more of in the vaping community.  I peeked at the mod selection and it looks like they don't carry any junk or bargain bin mods or atty's.  Puff Vapors has the quality."
5,"The best vape shop in Vegas. Hands down. Every time I come here, the prices are at least 10-20% cheaper than most other stores in vegas on EVERYTHING. Sometimes as cheap as bulk discount online retailers. It's insane how they're able to charge so little for so many products. I've been having some problems with my tastebuds being shot. They made a custom Blueberry liquid for me that I can actually taste, is shockingly good and now my all day vape. Certain techniques and types of mods have been explained to me multiple times. Extremely knowledgeable. This shop is 40 minutes from my house, and it's still the only one I visit from here on out."
5,"I took my 88 year old friend who has alzheimers to TipToes for a manicure.  We were an afternoon walk-in.  The respect, kindness, service were outstanding!  The salon is very clean and professional all of the way around.  It will be my go-to from now on."
5,"I have developed a fear and absolute loathing of having to visit the dentist yet I have to say that my experience at D for Dentist was fantastic. The front office staff were friendly and helpful and the office itself was inviting and warm. I was offered coffee and water and was able to actually able to enjoy part of a movie while waiting for the dentist. My exam was thorough, painless and anxiety free. I would highly recommend D for Dentist to anyone and everyone."
5,"I came here on a visit to Vegas with my husband, who is a Vegas native who used to come here when he lived in Vegas. We had such a good experience that when we went back to Cali, we only order our juices online at Puff. I place an order twice a month and they always ship on time, well packaged, and the juice always holds up well in transit."
5,"Folks, do not settle for an office that makes you dread scheduling another visit.  I had to cancel several appointments with a previous office, because they weren't able to see me anymore without a 2 month wait, before I could even predict my work schedule.  And the hygienist reminded me of Nurse Rached (only with sharp pointy things to hurt my gums with).  

So, I read the great reviews on Yelp and decided to give Dee for Dentist a try.  They scheduled me very promptly, and saw me right on time when I came to my appointment.  Rowena did my cleaning today, and I can honestly say she is the best hygienist ever.  And I had a really good one before Nurse Rached!  I needed a below-the-gum line treatment, and Rowena performed it expertly and nearly painlessly.  If I could add more stars, just for her treatment, I would!  Seriously, she is the best.

Dr. Dee Dee only needed to see me for a brief checkup.  She was exceptionally friendly, very thorough, and genuinely concerned that I was satisfied with my visit.  Do not settle for a doctor who makes you feel like they are just getting you out of the way so they can move on to their next appointment!  I actually look forward to seeing Dr. Dee Dee again.

Finally, I noticed all the office staff were smiling and friendly - it looks like they enjoy working there.  I have not gotten that impression from other offices (particularly my last one!).  I highly recommend this office!"
5,Dr Christopher is wonderful. She is very knowledgeable and good at what she does. For a small female doc she is strong when necessary. The office staff is friendly and very interactive with the patients.
5,I have been searching for the perfect nail salon in Charlotte for years and finally found it!!! Michael does the best acrylic nails I've ever had. Wouldn't go anywhere else! I live in Indian Trail and it's still worth the drive.
5,"I don't know what the 1 star rating was about but that person must have been in a different office (and on a different planet for that matter) than I was in. Listen, when it comes to hitting any doc office I a as skeptical as they come. But last week I was trimming trees and I REALLY messed my back up. After enduring a week of excruciating pain (and gobbling down too may Alieve each day)  I broke down and went to see Dr Christopher to get some help. She x-rayed me, did a detailed exam, and performed everything from ultra sound with stim to giving me an adjustment. And boom. I walked out of the office with the first relief I had in a solid week. I have had MANY chiro adjustments in my time, and this was 'top notch'. Care and detail was given to listening to my issue and targeting the treatment to attack that. Thanks for the great adjustment!"
5,This is the best yogurt place I've tried! The flavors are amazing. The Salty Carmel is my new favorite I hope they keep it past this month. The staff is super friendly and this place is very clean.
5,"Puff vapor is the best  in town! They are awesome, they take great care of you. Ralph is such a nice guy really took care of me the other day.. All the guys in here are going to make sure you leave happy. Not to mention their juice is amazing,by far my favorite!!!"
5,"The best breakfast place in the area.

We have been coming here since 2011, we bring friends and visitors.

First, it's a nice location with lots of parking, in a new plaza next to the train tracks. The restaurant is large, very clean and includes a fireplace with chairs, as well as an outdoor patio.

I recently stopped in to have a baker for breakfast. It's a baked breakfast dish, straight out of the oven in a ceramic pot to your table. Eggs, potatoes, and a variety of meats, vegetables and then topped with cheese. I had the VegetaBle baker and it was delicious. It came with rye toast, which was buttered.

My wife had pancakes with blackberry brandy. She asked for the side order version as the normal portions are rather large. The side portion included two large pancakes with a warm blackberry sauce that looked and tasted homemade.

All costs are very reasonable, my dish was 6.99 my wife's was less than that.

As a final perk, when leaving they asked if we wanted another coffee to go. Who has ever done that before?"
5,"I rarely get mani-pedis but decided I needed to pamper myself. Found this salon via yelp and met up with a friend here. The woman who helped me with my pedicure was very attentive and nice, and after struggling to help me with my sandals (my dogs ate my flip flops haha) touched up the toes very quickly. She sent me over to the table for my mani and another woman helped me, also very attentive and nice. Both women worked on my cuticles without my having to request it, and both performed a great massage. Definitely a fair price for the quality ($45 non gel mani-pedi)

I would definitely come back."
5,"Today, I called the office at 8:25AM and I was fortunate enough to be seen by 9:30AM due to horrible and unbearable sciatica pain. The night before I could not sleep in any position and got a total of 3 hours of sleep. During my tossing and turning that night, I started to research chiropractors (I was extremely nervous to even go to a chiropractor because I've heard ""horror"" stories). After seeing the website I was extremely  positive about calling and hoping I could get in immediately. I was also very hopeful that I would get Dr. Christopher, and I did!! She was extremely informative and knowledgeable. I knew I was in good hands. 

WOW DID I HAVE THE MOST INCREDIBLE EXPRESSIONS AT AZ SPINE AND DISC SPORT!!!!!! From the moment I called...to when I entered the building, I was greeted with nothing but kindness. Due to 3 hours of sleep, while I was filling out paperwork, I accidentally spilled my water on the floor and a woman (I can't remember her name but I will update because she deserves the recognition) at the front desk was the kindest person to someone who was running on low sleep and in so much pain. She reassured me that I didn't need to worry about the spill. She came to clean it up, filled my bottle for me with ice and she said, ""relax, today is about you and we are going to take care of YOU."" I wanted to cry because that was so sweet and I was so vulnerable with all this pain!!  I will be back on Thursday for another appointment and I already can't wait!!! Thank you to everyone at this place for making my visit so welcoming and helping me with my pain. I look forward to actually sleeping tonight!

***I'm wrote this post because I know there are people out there like myself, who was extremely desperate last night for some type of pain relief. If it weren't for the reviews I read, I have been under someone else's care and not as satisfied as I am at this moment. I look forward to seeing my sciatica recovering soon."
5,"This has now become my go-to nail salon. I went here for the very first time a few weeks ago and was pleased with the service enough to come back for my fill-in. I was blown away the second time around by Michelle. Mary, Michael and Michelle are the only techs that handle powder (acrylic) sets so you'll need to be sure to make an appointment before arriving. This time around I worked with Michelle and she was VERY attentive and considerate. I was on my lunch break and she worked promptly and efficiently to accommodate my tight schedule. You are warmly greeted and offered water, wine or even snacks if available - upon arrival. This place knows the meaning of customer service. They are everything you are looking for in nail boutique!"
5,This place is the go to for my girlfriend and I.  Been here multiple times and have never had a complaint.  The food is amazing and the patio is a great place to have a drink.  Highly recommend rivals to everyone!
5,"It's been years since I've written a review on Yelp, probably because no business has blown me away quite like Dee for Dentist. I had been going to my wife's dentist since we started dating over four years ago, more so for convenience and because who thinks of a dental visit like planning for a meal...aren't they all alike? Apparently, the answer is ""no.""

Dee for Dentist is the equivalent of walking onto the Google campus. Everyone is friendly, has their role, and is good at what they do (at least the receptionists and the three ladies who worked on my teeth, Monica, Rowena, and of course Doctor Dee). The space is IKEA modern, surgical-room clean, and 1977 Star Wars technology, meaning they are light years ahead of others in their respective industries for their time.

This being my first visit, I was led on a guided tour of the facility, which included me stepping into a stand up 3-D X Ray machine, which was not only awesome but proved to me that my recent septoplasty surgery with my ENT doctor actually did open up my airways in my nose. Bonus! This plus the regular X Rays and photographs of my teeth gave me a complete picture (pun intended) of how my teeth are doing. All my previous dentists only took regular X Rays and briefly went over them with me. Doctor Dee sat down and explained every little detail of each one of my teeth, much like a doctor would/should, but not one dentist has ever done that to the degree that you felt he/she truly cared about what's going on with my dental health holistically.

Long story short (probably, too late), I've never viewed my dental health as I do my general health. Before Dee for Dentist, my dental visits consisted of cleaning and fire fighting what may be wrong. Thanks, Dee, for giving me a new perspective on things and for taking care of my teeth. 

Oh yeah, Mike the Office Manager, is one cool and funny dude too. They play movies while you're getting your teeth worked on and have put in enough thought to handing out sunglasses so that you're not blinded by the bright light they are shining into your mouth. You get to pick your fashionable sunglasses yourself (nice touch). The only thing, they didn't have the movie titles I requested, probably because they weren't kid friendly. 

Thanks again Dee for Dentist! See you again in a few months."
5,"This place is underrated! I love the food here, so amazing. After years of eating here I now get the same thing every time. The beef shawarma sandwich (a wrap with a crispy wrapping) with garlic and tahini sauce inside. And a large hummus! The beef shawarma sandwich is one of my ""last meal"" things. It is incredible and I find myself craving it often! The people are warm and friendly with great customer service. This is my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant in the Phoenix area! Do yourself a favor and go there! It is very casual as well."
5,"I feel a little funny granting five stars, since that kind of rave implies everyone will love Al Hana - and I dont think that's true.  It helps to leave one's Scottsdale or Camelback corridor preconceptions in the parking lot, in order to find treasure within the area blight, and indeed, within the gray, dreary walls of Baiz Market. 

If you approach Al Hana with a traveler's sense of wonder, however, this establishment is very cool.  The market is fascinating, especially the tiny bakery and butcher area in the back. The restaurant is more of a simple counter, no frills and limited menu, but rates an objective five stars based on food quality, value and service.  Delicious, cheap, and the young lady who helped us was very nice.  I dont need a sorbet course to give it five stars. 

Maybe it's different during lunch hour, but at 5:30pm we were the only Anglos in this fairly large neighborhood facility.  Many women in hijabs and abayas.  Young men of varied Middle Eastern persuasion. In most respects, it felt like a market half way around the world.  Iraq or Jordan maybe.  Not every Arizonan's cup of tea, perhaps, but for foodophiles and the culturally curious, definitely recommended."
5,First visit here & both Dr Stone & his assistant/scribe Angel were absolutely amazing! They were kind & had patience as my mom & I asked a million questions about pain resolution & options.  Thank you for your professionalism & educated efforts to relieve my pain!  Liz N.
5,"I love to gfrab a bite and then shop here.  The falafel wrap is great.   Price is amazing for such a filling item.  My husband and I like to eat a few of the items when they come fresh out of the oven.  Everything tastes homeade.  

The market has the best persian cucumbers, veggies, and fresh meat.  We like the Turkish jams and other Turkish products.  The soap assortment is also really neat!  I give these out as gifts and everyone loves them."
5,"When I checked in today I couldn't believe I haven't done a review of this place yet! I don't give very many 5 stars reviews because I really have to have my socks knocked for that! This place is the best pedicure in town they last super long, the staff are great, and they are open on Sundays! The only real challenge is finding a parking place now that things are getting so built up in the area. You don't usually have to wait but if you do go next door and get a glass of wine or a beer, they will even come over and get you when they are ready."
5,"Dr. Joy Wolfe is absolutely 5*. She is personable, takes time, listens, cares, and compassionate."
5,"wow. this place exceeded my expectations by far! no idea how anyone could give them less than 5 stars!? the front desk ladies were really sweet and i didn't have to wait any more than a couple minutes to get in to see the doc. i've been seeing a chiropractor on and off for the last 10 years and it was not until i went to see Dr. Cady that i left without feeling ANY pain. normally after seeing a chiro, i still feel some pain and have to do a lot of stretching when i get home but not with Dr Cady. he did an ultra sound on me, stim, heat and adjustments. after he was done, i seriously felt like i could do back flips out the door and into my car! i HIGHLY recommend him and this establishment to any and everyone! i will definitely be back!! thanks Dr. Cady!"
5,"To repeat what others have said, this is the nicest dental office I've ever seen. It's beautiful, welcoming, and the staff are amazing. They clearly value using the latest technologies, both as a way to better diagnose problems, but also to reduce pain and discomfort. I had a root canal, and could easily have taken a nap it was so painless. They text out your reminders. They give you access to your x-ray images. And they're just really nice. I don't think you'll be able to find any place better."
5,"I already love this place and I haven't even been here yet. I believe her name is Allison but she was extremely helpful on the phone today. I haven't been to the dentist in a few years and I have insurance through a step parent so I was a little confused on the process. I only had my medical insurance provider and was confused as to why she wasn't funding my dental insurance. After a few phone calls on each of our ends she finally found that I had dental through another provider. I don't know what lengths she went through to find this out or how she magically did it but I was so appreciative I even told her I loved her. She didn't even HAVE to do this and could have just had me figure it out on my own but she found this all out for me and I'm so happy to have made an appointment there. I'm excited for my appointment now because of making an appointment alone was this great, I'm assuming it only gets better from here."
5,Best Vape Shop in Vegas! All in house juices and the staff is very patient and helpful
5,"I hope no one takes David's review down the page seriously.. If you click on his name he has reviewed 4 dentists and called each one of them profanities !!!  Dr Dee is an amazing, professional dentist with the utmost compassion for her patients. She is so knowledgable and performs awesome work. I have been going here for 3 years now and will never go anywhere else!!! The office is impeccable and state of the art. All of the hygienists are friendly and great !  If you are looking for a dentist do not hesitate to go here, I am so glad I did !"
5,If you like a good salty (not too much though) pizza made from fresh hand tossed dough this is the place to be!  The staff is very freindly and the resteraunt very clean.  They use a special cheese blend you won't get anywhere else.  Great for a quick take out or sit down and enjoy the meal!!!!
5,"Best vape spot in town 
Every Time I come in always walk out with a new juice 
All the guys working very cool people and very helpful with what you are looking for"
5,"The burnt marshmallow ice cream is my favourite ice cream in the entire world. There is always a line up to get ice cream here, and it's no wonder why!"
5,"I know a lot of people have opinions about chiropractors one way or another - but you really have to put those feelings aside when going to Ahwatukee Spine and Disc.  Dr. Rudd and Dr. Christopher do much more than just crack you and say, ""See you next Thursday.""  Their goal is to make it so they don't have to see you next Thursday.  In addition to adjustments, they also provide decompression, active release therapy (a personal favorite), kinesiology taping, ultrasound, stretching, therapeutic exercises to help cure imbalance and weakness, facial stretching, and massage (with they run through insurance!!)

I am willing to even go as far to say that Dr. Rudd and Dr. Christopher DON""T want to see next Thursday.  Their increasing popularity makes them very busy.  In fact, they have recently purchased and designed a larger space, so that they can treat more patients and offer more services.  In the meantime though, they work through their lunch to accommodate patients.  I had that happen to me two weeks ago - I watched Dr. Rudd literally eat half of a 6-inch Subway sandwich in one gigantic man-bite so that he could give me the time and treatment I needed.

Dr. Christopher is an Ironman finisher, and Dr.Rudd is a lifelong runner (in his heyday, he even beat an elite track star!  She was a girl, but that is aside the point). The point is that they understand how it important it is to feel good and empathize with their patients.  Dealing with scoliosis my entire life has led me into the doors of many chiropractors.  Some where good, some were bad...but none of them left me feeling like they really cared about me.  However, that is how I feel when I go to Ahwatukee Spine and Disc.  I know that Dr. Christopher and Dr. Rudd want me to be pain free, running fast and feeling my best. In this day and age, it is hard to find people who truly have your best interest, which makes Ahwatukee Spine and Disc a diamond in the rough."
5,"I tried the Italian beef with mozzarella and it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The bread was PERFECT! Even though the meat was dipped in Au hi and I had a 30 minute drive home, it was still perfect and not soggy AT ALL! It was a great sandwich and if they were open right now I'd be having it for breakfast."
5,I just got home with my new flavors I  vaping the raze berry lemonade I asked for extra flavor to be added and this is the best e juice I have ever had. I have been vaping for a year and I am very happy that I stopped here today. I didn't get the girls name that made my juice but she is awesome she gave me exactly what I asked for. Everyone including Scott were super nice the young man at the counter was dealing with a difficult older customer and he handled it very well better then what I would have done I am going to tell everyone I know about how great you guys are keep up the good work and please don't change customer service is huge to me and you guys rank at the top
5,"I've lost count how many times I've been to Yogurtology! My son and I love the variety of new flavors every time we come in, even though he always gets the Dole Whip! Every single employee I've come across over the years has been helpful, courteous and willing to help with samples. This is by far my favorite frozen yogurt place I've come across in Phoenix!"
5,"I am from the region and grew up having Sanfrantellos. I just ordered it tonight and it was so nice to have a comfort food from home. It tastes and looks the same. I'm not shocked by the price of the food. Other consumers shouldn't be shocked either. You're getting a delicious product with quality ingredients. You're not getting a soggy, greasy pizza. 

I saw another review commenting on time. It's not fast food!! Appreciate that! This is the kind of place that Arizona doesn't have much of. Call in advance. Problem solved. Shoot, I've had to wait an hour and a half for pizza. If it's good, I'll wait! (Not here. I'm just saying it's worth the wait).  

I enjoyed my food and I will return.

Just a tip. Maybe work with your girls who answer the phones and run the registers. I wasn't very pleased with them whatsoever. Maybe she was new? I'm not sure. I speak clearly and concisely. I shouldn't have to repeat my name (spelling and all), phone number, and order multiple times. It was a little frustrating. In the end, everything was correct. Other than that, everything was great!
Thanks for coming to Arizona!!!!"
5,"So I found this place on yelp and I was excited by everything and I was not let down. My check up was amazing and the person taking caring of me(Kristen) was always warning of things that will be uncomfortable and always communicating what was next. This is something I really appreciated even though there was nothing that really bothered me. It showed that they really care for you.

Now, I knew coming in that I needed some work to be done, so it didn't come to the least surprise  that Dee Dee was disappointed in what she saw. Now saying that, people could take that as judgmental if you are so worried about what people think of you. I saw it as her being passionate about her job, that she wants teeth to be taken care of.  She didn't pressure me into anything and told me what ever sequence I want to do things, they will do it. This is something I also appreciated, having a choice in the matter. I mean its my teeth! I could go on about how great this place is.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I loved that I could watch School of Rock while I was getting the check up. I am definitely going to be staying here and working to get my teeth in a wholesome and healthier place."
5,The Brunch on Sunday is excellent! The staff is very friendly and helpful. I especially enjoyed the thick bacon!! It was real bacon. The omelette station had a good variety of toppings too. I would definitely come back.
5,Very clean place with the best flavors and toppings! The acai bowls are my favorite and the best price for them in town!  The staff is always pleasant.
5,"Perfection! I've gone a few times now before writing a review to look for consistency in excellence and I found it at Tip Toe Nails - they did not disappoint! This is a great salon, that uses top quality product. Everyone is thorough and takes great pride in their work. I've taken both of my daughters (11 and 16) and they were treated just like all customers - important. I highly recommend going to Tip Toe Nails!

Update: I moved further away and tried local nail salons out of convenience. No one is as clean and sterile as Tip Toe! Going to make the trek to their salon because I trust their high standards!"
5,"I've been a smoker for 15+ years (YEEESH). I'm tired of it...but I love it. This is the dilemma most of us smokers face. I've been toying with the idea of quitting since my 30th birthday, but haven't been able to pull it off. I heard about Scott and his store, Puff Vapors, from a friend, so I decided to check it out.

The first thing I noticed was that this isn't your normal ""smoke"" shop (or ""vape"" shop, as it were): nice, fluffy leather couches, aromas of exotic fruits, and lots of friendly people socializing. 

Brandon, the gentleman behind the counter was friendly. I told him what I was there for and he gave me several options for a first time vaper (sp?). Soon, Scott, the owner came out and happily talked to me about the advent of vaping. I had lots of questions (is it safe? can I lower my nicotine in increments? Is it more expensive than smoking?). Scott answered these with an affirmative and even backed his answers up with Harvard studies! This a man who believes in his product and it shows.

We then ventured to the part of the counter where you can sample all his flavors. There are a ton! They even have a cigarette flavored one, which was very exciting for me because I don't really like all the tooti fruiti ones...just plain tobacco. By the way, they have a ""Cigaro Cubano"" flavor which is delicious! Scott suggested that I get a flavor I'm used to and then something different that I can try. I chose turkish-menthol and coffee flavors. 

They have a variety of different vaping apparatuses at varying price points, but since I'm new, I chose the starter kit, which comes with two of everything (flavors, rechargeable batteries, etc). It's $70 bucks. 

I also want to add that you can buy any of the flavors nicotine free which is nice.

I'm sold. I loved this place. If you're trying to quit smoking, but can't seem to, this may be the option for you. Don't take my word for it though. Go see Scott. He'll be happy to tell you all about it."
5,Steve N was one of the best servers I have ever had. Food was amazing and drinks were cold! Can't wait to come back.
5,"I came in an hour before close and although some staff were cleaning, I didn't feel rushed to get my froyo and get out. Everyone was really friendly and the place was amazingly clean!"
5,"This my new favorite nail spot! Fantastic  customer service from the nail technicians, attention to detail, clean environment, and all around wonderful! I had an issue with my gel on 3 of my nails after only 6 days, and the owner was happy to take care of it. I will keep coming back here to get my mani/pedi's."
5,"I've been a client of the owner (Michael Tran) for 8 years now. I've followed him to 4 different salons in Charlotte over the years because I think he's the best. I've been to all the popular salons in town & no one else compares to the quality of service and respect you get from Michael. There's a reason he has such a loyal following of clients that have stuck with him for so long. He loves what he does-he treats clients like family, he only uses top quality products & he works harder than anyone I know to keep his clients happy. I'm so proud of Michael & his wife Becky for finally having their dream of owning their own salon come true. All his hard work over the years has finally paid off & I couldn't be happier for him! Congrats, you guys!! So excited you're in my neighborhood now!!"
5,"Hands down THE best nail salon you will find in Charlotte. Michael and his staff do amazing work. Weather you're coming in for a full set or a pedicure, you're sure to enjoy your time. They have excellent customer service and a relaxed, fun atmosphere. I will never go anywhere else!"
5,"GET THE DEEP DISH (Pan)!!!!!!!!!!!!

My family is from south side Chicago and we all drove from various parts of the valley to check this joint out.  We quickly realized they don't have Indoor seating so we made the best out of sitting out on the patio.

We ordered 2 large thin crust pizzas - one sausage one pepperoni.  It was fresh, hot and had quality ingredients.  I would give the joint 4 stars for their thin crust.  It was really good for AZ, but in Chicago I would put it middle of the pack.

Now their DEEP DISH on the other hand is incredible!!!  If you've ever had Gino's East in Chicago, I would say this is very similar.  So damn good!  The tomato sauce is fresh and tastes perfect - just like home!  The sausage is excellent!  (That's what she said)

Get the deep dish damn it!!!"
5,"I seriousy love these guys. Who knew I could enjoy going to the dentist??  Dee and her staff are amazing!  Kristen is one of the best hygienists I've ever seen. They have state of the art equipment, a beautiful office and friendly staff. If I could give 10 stars, I would!!"
5,"What a gem!!!! I tried this place for the first time yesterday, and we ended up going back again today!!! The Chicken Schwarma sandwiches are awesome. The hummus is great, and the Chicken Tahook with garlic sauce is going to be the death of me (in a good way)  The food is in expensive (we paid 15 bucks for a chicken tahook plate (great chicken skewers served with pickles, hummus, pita and garlic sauce) a chicken schwarma sandwich, a small lamb meat pie, small cheese pie and a large spinach pie. Needless to say I""m speaking from a bread coma right now, but it's well worth it!! Do yourself a favor, this place is great!"
5,My family and I have been going here for years! They have great yogurt and all the best toppings! They are also the only yogurt place that has the peanut butter squeeze bottle for topping! My favorite! I recently realized they have Acai bowls there and have found my new favorite! I am obsessed! The PB bowl is great! It is healthy and so so good! I could eat one everyday! Service is always great! Workers are always friendly and they make the Acai bowls very consistent! So glad this is so close to my home!
5,"LOVED my experience at the nail salon... attentive staff, clean environment and just a cute really modernly designed salon.... michael and his wife (owners) were great as well!"
5,"I think I'm addicted to this place.  

The yogurt is delicious, the toppings are incredible, the owners are very friendly - I can't say enough good things about it! 

If you've never been before, try the Oatmeal Cookie flavor - it is amazing.  This is not your run-of-the-mill frozen yogurt.  

If you're new to this store, be sure to sign up for their loyalty card and visit on a holiday - they often give 50% off to card members and are offering a unique flavor that day (example: today is Cinco de Mayo and they had Margherita-flavored frozen yogurt... so good!).  They tend to be busier on these days, so sometimes the lines can get long, but I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes to get completely through the line and to the cashier.  

They also have yogurt cupcakes, which are kind of like your own personal ice cream cake.  Good when you need a splurge."
5,"you have to try this place if u vape. Crunch berries , Carmel Apple  code red Mountain Dew and they taste like they should try them all I will NEVER go anywhere else!!!!"
5,We have ordered from here a couple of times for work lunches and it is SO good every time. MMM!
5,Always clean and fresh and employees are very friendly. The yougart selection is good
5,"Let me start off by saying that I love this place. They have wonderful food, fantastic prices and are located within the Baiz Market (which I also love).

I grew up pretty spoiled in Chicago when it came to Middle Eastern food, and I was a little sad when I moved out to Phoenix. Don't get me wrong, there are some great spots out here for Middle Eastern grub, but it's nothing like it is back in Chi. Al-Hana though is where it's at.

There Baba is probably the best I've had and I love that they had fresh bread from the bakery to serve with anything you order. I was blown away by their sandwiches as well. I've always been used to the pita boat style of sandwich, but at Al-Hana they prepare it like a wrap that's then grilled for a bit to make it crispy. That was new and an incredible treat for me.

If you're a fan of Middle Eastern food and can make the trip, you kinda need to pay your respects to this place."
5,"This hip, friendly dental practice has it all. Super convenient, and very modern. I get email and text follow ups reminding me of appointments. Everyone who works there is very upbeat and easy going. They've got interesting movies playing all the time in just about every room on big screens w subtitles on so there's something to do while they're ""doing their business in your mouth"" (one of their slogans). And, did I mention, they're funny!

Also, Doctor Dee has the best bedside manner - very competent yet warm and easy going. I knew I was in very good hands as she was touring my disaster of a mouth. Without hurting my feelings at all she let me know how I need to straighten up and fly right as it pertains to my flossing, and getting acid reflux under control.

These guys take care of my whole family - my wife and four boys - and everybody loves Mike & DeeDee and their whole crew.

Did I mention that they throw one helluva customer appreciation party at the end of the year, too? Oh yeah. Drinks, gaming, killer food, entertainment, photobooth, DJ - very good time.

Like I said, these guys are hip, modern, very competent, very attentive to their clients' comfort.

I cannot recommend these guys highly enough. If you're looking for a dentist go here. If you don't love your current dentist, go here."
5,"I cannot say enough good things about this clinic! If you are reading this because you are looking for a knowledgeable, skilled, trustworthy and caring healthcare team..look no further.  I HIGHLY recommend AZ Spine Disc & Sport. My only regret is I wish I found them sooner. I have been going here for about 2 months and absolutely love Dr. Christopher and Dr. Stone. I originally started out in a lot of pain and within a few visits I was already feeling a big difference. They have several different treatment options such as; electrical stim, ultrasound therapy, kinesiotape, decompression machines, chiropractic adjustments, the Graston Technique, trigger point injections, exercise machines etc. They have licensed massaged therapists and acupuncturists on-site and they are great at what they do too.  The clinic has Saturday and evening appointments that are convenient and when I was struggling with extreme pain from a pinched nerve they fit me in theur schedule EVERY day until I felt better!  Dr. Stone and Dr. Christopher are both very knowledgeable and empathetic and really take the time to listen to you. I have seen Dr. Rudd and Dr. Kady here as well and they both are very good at what they do.  The front desk and rest of the healthcare team are helpful and friendly. When I first went here, they were up front and clear about what my insurance covered and didn't cover and outlined any possible costs etc.  This clinic has the kind of integrity that all other clinics should strive for.  I completely trust AZ Spine Disc and Sport, feel my comfort and care is genuinely very important to them, and trust any decisions they make regarding my care because it is obvious they want what is best for me.  Don't pass this place up!"
5,"This place is great! Excellent service, their massage chairs are amazing, they recently opened a new location so everything is new, comfortable AND a glass of wine. A definite regular place for me for a Pedicure!"
5,Extremely friendly staff and wonderful service. Came here from out of town and got more than I paid for. Extremely happy they still have the bombcicle flavor. It was a flavor I tried in California that drew me to puff. Made my trip well worth it. Thank you so much Ryan!!
5,"I live on the South side of phoenix. Work in the west side. But I eat my frozen yogurt on the North side. I will go out of my way to have frozen yogurt here. The atmosphere is upbeat. The service is outstanding and always on point--I've never been without someone offering a sample every time I stop in. They are on task in their attention to detail when it comes to the display of their fresh toppings. 

The flavors are always changing, but the coconut is my ultimate favorite. I just wish they were better staffed. They always seem like they only have one person running the store--and that's not fair to that person at all."
5,Minute we walked in to minute we walked out A+++. Kids loved Food.  Adults loved Food.  Will be back 100%.  Great service.
5,"If you are fortunate enough be there when they have Butterfinger Crunch, you are in for a treat. Try the hot fudge and hot caramel toppings too. The waffle cones are great."
5,"Dr. Christopher, and Dr. Rudd are the best chiropractors I have ever worked with! I have been going to Dr. Christopher for almost 2 years now and she is amazing! Never gave up on me! These two doctors combined have helped improve my pain by actually caring about me as a patient and figuring out what was the next step. Because of them my lower back pain level went from a 5/6 to a 2/3, which is the most amazing feeling! All because they both genuinely care! I swear by these two, and I recommend them every single chance I get! Love you guys!"
5,"I have only the best to say about Dr. Meevasin (Dee) and her amazing staff! In a world where people are afraid to choose a dentist because of fear of being misled, this office shines with integrity and respect for each patient. We are so grateful to them for all the care and love they pour into every patient! We cannot say enough for them! Oh...and their work is amazing and speaks for itself! They are a 15/10!"
5,"This is hands down the best dentist I've gone to.   They provide appointment reminders via text and email save the dates,  making it easy to sync it with your phone calendar.  The staff are friendly and professional,  the equipment is state of the art, and they offer bottled water, tea and coffee in the waiting room, not that I've ever had to wait long."
5,"Puff Vapors is the vape equivalent of the Apple Store. This is the only place I go for all my vape supplies now, they're simply the best. Every time I come here I'm greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff. The tester bar has 80 flavors that you can either test in a tank or drip. I drive across town for this place all the time and it's always is worth it!"
5,"Best Ice cream in the city. Hands down. Located in the beaches- Ed's real scoop delivers flavours true to their flavour name. I had Apple pie & burnt marshmallow (most popular flavour) and my boyfriend had burnt marshmallow and creams brûlée. First- you get TWO scoops no matter what size you get and decent pricing , 10$ for two, I got kiddie and he got regular. The Apple pie had REAL Apple & crust in it, amazing. The burnt marshmallow SERIOUSLY tasted like burnt marshmallow it was unreal. All flavours were extremely creamy. They do have vegan options btw (sorbet). 10000% recommend !"
5,"I had never been to a chiropractor before going to Ahwatukee spine and disc. I was skeptical to say the least. Dr. Christopher and the staff there were efficient, knowledgable and kind. I went for the first time when I hurt my knee in a road bike accident. The care was great and the treatment helped. I also went through my pregnancy for adjustments and messages with the great massage therapists. I think it will be even better when the practice moves to Ray Road and expands to offer more services."
5,We had a fun time at this restaurant. The beer was cold and a great price for happy hour. There are lots of TVs to view sports. Our server was very nice. The food was standard grille type food. My husband had a Rueben sandwich and he said the corned beef was some of the best he has ever had.
5,This was my first time here and it's now my new go- to spot! I was greeted immediately as I walked in the door and taken right back. The place felt very clean and I loved the industrial chic design. The girl who did my pedicure was so sweet and she definitely took her time and didn't rush through. It was definitely a relaxing experience and I will be back!
5,"We have been going to the cafe since it opened,  The food is great, the waitresses are very and know the menu.  I love the homemade soups !!"
5,"Great food, large shareable portions, nice taps. I'll be back!  The rosemary garlic tots and chorizo mussels were worth a shout out. My friends had burgers that looked fantastic. In my best Schwartzeneger ""I'll DEFINITELY BE BACK!"""
5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this dental office. The staff is very welcoming and my hygienist, Row, was very gentle on my teeth! Whenever I had a question about anything she was quick to provide information about any of the procedures being done. The surrounding areas were very clean (this is a huge plus for me!) and they even had a movie playing in my room! Thank you for the goodie bag and t-shirt Row & Monica! You ladies rock. See you soon!"
5,"My son suffered a debilitating back injury around the age of 8 years old when he and another player collided helmet to helmet during a football drill, causing Chase to suffer four popped discs in his back. Prior to being sent to a surgeon, he was treated and relieved of his immediate pain here at AZ Spine Disc and Support. They listened to Chase explain his symptoms and heard my concerns and then came up with a treatment plan we all agreed on. Highly recommend these folks! A+"
5,Michelle is the best! Such an enjoyable experience whenever I walk in. Becky is so kind and the place is low key and relaxed. You know you're going to get a great mani/pedi!
5,"Ive tried several chiropractic offices in the valley, and Naomi with massage therapy and Dr Ryder are the best!"
5,"Never complain when I come here! Came again for dinner tonight and it was BOMB!!!! ""I'll be back"""
5,"AZSDS is comfortable, private and extremely professional. I have been going to AZSDS for my neck, shoulder and back tension and in the initial session, Auden was extremely attentive to my needs and expectations- focusing on the areas that have caused me the most trouble. Sometimes you just find a massage therapist that ""gets"" what you need and you have have to stick with them. As such, I have been back to AZSPS several times and will be going again in a few days. We have already made tremendous progress in dealing with all of the immediate ""kinks"" that need to be worked out. Once that is accomplished, I will most definitely continue seeing him for ""maintenance work"". HIGHLY recommend Auden-massage therapist!"
5,Love Sanfrarellos and am so glad they are in Gilbert.  We order take out sometimes and it looks like the are expanding for dine in a have applied for a liquor licenses.  Happy to support this local edition of a Chicago favorite.  Staff is friendly and food is always good.  Will be back for sure.
5,"This place has excellent shawarmas for a low price of $3.99.  I go here almost weekly and they are consistently good.  They have a $10 minimum for debit so bring cash.  Also, the store that they are connected to, Baiz Market, carries hookah supplies.  Phoenix needs more places like this."
5,Giving them 5 stars - Food is fine.. no complaints. I have found service at Perk Cup is best when served by Kim M. or Stacey. These two will make your dining experience very enjoyable.
5,"Out of every yogurt place I've ever been to, Yogurtology Glendale is by far the best! If you're looking for quality fro-yo and fresh toppings, this is the place to go. Their staff are some of the best and always quick on their feet when it comes to picking up the topping bar, cleaning and making sure the toppings are filled fresh at all times! Way to go Yogurtology Glendale!"
5,Best dentist in town! The staff is great and the work is even more amazing. I was about to get two root canals finished and covered with beautiful crowns. I don't plan on going anywhere else for my dental work.
5,"I went to Puff vapors for juice . I had a very pleasant experience,  very knowledgeable and customer service.. one satisfied customer here.  Will definitely let my friends and family know about this place.   ROCK ON PUFF VAPORS !!"
5,2 thumbs and 2 big toes up! A little expensive but when you consider the ice cream is handmade it's worth it.
5,"What a difference location makes!  Yogurtology Glendale has great service,  great yogurt,  clean shop and friendly employees!"
5,Best patio! Dog friendly patio too! Wife and I eat here often. Usually three or four times a month. Hamburgs and wings are great! And the food preparation and service is very consistent. Which is very good. Managers usually can be seen walking around talking to guests. Just a great place to enjoy a summer evening.
5,"By far some of the best frozen yogurt I have ever had! I dropped in to Yogurtology on a hot summer day, looking for literally anything frozen to save me. After I went inside, the employee behind the counter came out and helped me grab some samples and explained a few of the menu items to me like the dole whip float. I ended up getting the dole whip and another fruity flavor and both were super delicious. Next came the toppings! They have such a good variety of toppings here from fruit to popping boba to chocolate. I got strawberry, kiwi, and mango popping boba, yum!! Overall, the flavor of the frozen yogurt was great and customer service was exemplary. I will definitely be going back to grab more yogurt here."
5,"I am 37 years old and have 3 badly herniated disks, been to a few Drs. for help with the pain and the worsening condition, to no prevail. I was going through my Physicians directory for the right Dr. when I came across AZ Spine and Disk. 

It's about 50 miles from my house in Glendale, I thought I would give this Dr. fair try at my condition.
This was the best decision I've made medically for my condition!! Dr. David Stone actually listens to exactly what you have to say without fear of running you out in a rush. Dr. David Stone is the best Dr. in the business, hand down. 
I strongly suggest Dr. David Stone to anyone with bone and Spine issues. This Dr. will give you the undivided attention that patients don't seem to get these days. I gladly commute the 100 mile round trip each month. His staff is excellent and super kind, the facility is very clean.
Everyone in this office is professional, prompt, and very caring. No wait times.
Since seeing Dr. David Stone, my career is back in action because I am able to take charge of the pain, and move forward with life. Dr. David Stones advice, suggestions, and rehab programs are the best in the biz! I have suggested Dr. David Stone to any and all I know in my industry. I work in the entertainment industry and must travel a lot. Without the help and healing methods of AZ Spine and Disk, my finances would struggle tremendously, thus making my wife and 5 children suffer as well.

Thank you Dr. David Stone and staff!!"
5,"One of the few places that I don't need to write much about... Simply put it's the BEST ice cream (and gelato and sorbet) you'll find in TO! :)  Try it! And if you did, go back 'cause an ice cream is good any time of day or night."
5,The BEST vape shop in Nevada. I don't even smoke and I drive 45 min. across town to come here. Top shelf liquid and masters in the art of rebuilding. Shane keeps it G-real.
5,"I love this place! I have a 6 year old and a 16 year old, and they both go here for all things dental. I wish my insurance covered me here! The office is beautiful, serene, clean and completely accommodating- they have a Keurig coffee machine, LCD TV, even a 3 way smartphone charger... In the waiting room. Awesome. Even the restroom is amazing! 4 different Hemp lotions, mouthwash, books, toothbrushes and a super cute restroom guest book (for those people with a sense of humor). 

I guess I should talk about the staff too! Who  are wonderful, courteous, polite and helpful- every time we are there! My 6 year old was supposed to get cavities filled, and was fidgety and uncomfortable for the first 15 minutes, and saying that it hurt. Without hesitation, the dentist suggested a referral to a sedation pediatric dentist. So rather than push through 4 cavities- she saved him (and everyone involved) a stressful traumatic experience. Which I appreciated immensely! The assistant is always amazing as well! (I can't think of her name- younger girl, beautiful, long dark hair) Every time I've been there, she answers my silly, random questions, and tells me the truth.These people always go above and beyond, and are not ever rude, condescending or make you feel unwelcome. Which most dentist offices do- in my experience. Whoever your current dentist is, even if you think they're the greatest there is- trust me, this place will blow them out of the water!"
5,"Best place to go for all your vaping needs. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable   They are also willing to answer any questions that you may have. Scott and Conrad made me feel very welcome from the second I walked in. 

Please stop by this place and support them."
5,"I see Dr Christopher and she is amazing. The staff is always nice and welcoming and of course after my frequent visits they have gotten to know me well. 
They have a huge area for therapy, treatment etc and exam rooms as well which I like. 

Pretty soon to be getting my husband in for a visit and adjustment. I have had no issues and have been here many a times. And will recommend the greatness and magic here!"
5,"I loved their pan crust pizza! The pizza had a great crunchy bottom followed a thick layer of melted gooey mozzarella cheese, a delicious sweet pizza sauce and then our fresh toppings. Also, try their mozzarella sticks which are fresh and never frozen. Super friendly staff."
5,"After a very rough day at work, my partner and I were finding ourselves in need of a drink... Or three!! Being on a business trip we were very unfamiliar with the area. We drove for a couple of miles searching for the right venue, and when we found rivals, we knew it was going to be a great experience! It was a nice day and their outdoor patio seemed to call to us. We sat down and were immediately greeted by friendly faces from all of the staff. Then came our server, Holly. Where to begin!? Holly was exactly the kind of server every restaurant strives to have. She was personable, funny, and when we asked for drink suggestions, she was more than happy to help us out! Not only did she provide the type of service you would expect when you are out, she just seemed to go above and beyond! After we ordered our drinks, they quickly were brought to our table, and her suggestions were spot on! Just what we needed! Not only that, but our drink never got to the point of empty before we were asked what else we needed. We can't really give an opinion about the food, because we only had a few drinks, but based off of the drinks, and the amazing service, Rivals is definitely a place we will be stopping back everytime we are in the Cleveland area!"
5,"Amazing Ice Cream!

This place is great, I sampled a bunch of favors before deciding on the French Mint in a waffle cone. The ice cream was creamy and delicious. I loved it. My daughter had the milk chocolate flavor and was equally impressed. 

This is probably one of the best ice creams I've had in a long time. Definitely home made with a lot of care. The fresh waffle cone put it over the top for me. 

I laughed when I saw the display on the counter the showed the ones available including sugar, wafer, waffle, and pine. Get it, pine cone, ha ha!

A kidding aside, this is a great place for ice cream. If you in the beaches area of Toronto you should add this to your must see list."
5,"BEST FRO-YO in the area. No doubt! You must get the oatmeal cookie fro-yo, its the best. My hubby likes the cookies to put on the bottom and they have an excellent topping bar. Its very clean and modern inside and the staff are always very nice. Prices are about the same as every other place but the quality of the yogurt is on an entirely different level."
5,"Best yogurt in the world. Honestly, I don't think I've ever tasted such creamy yogurt in my life. The owners are amazing and do so much for the community."
5,"I will never go anywhere else.  Polish on a pedi lasts 3 weeks or longer, and not a chip!  TipToe is a dream for hands and feet."
5,Our waitress was really good and paid great attention to our needs. The potato spirals were awesome and my burger was cooked exactly how I ordered it. Fries are extra crispy.  They got us in and out pretty quick. They always look busy from the outside but has plenty of seating and tvs.
5,"The ice cream here is amazing, every flavour you can think of and so delicious
The staff are really friendly and are happy to give you free samples in you are unsure! 
A must visit!"
5,"Best decision I ever made to move my kids and myself to Dee for Dentist!!
We love the incredible care and compassion we receive !!!
Thank you"
5,Dr. Rudd is one of the best chiropractors out there. He is very hands on and doesn't just get you in and send you on your way. He takes the time to figure out the problem and try to ease your pain. I have herniated disc and he helps manage the areas around the disc to help me be more comfortable and not be so stiff or tightness of muscles. I would definitely recommend him
5,"REALLY good ice cream.  16 previous reviewers, averaging 4.5 stars, can't be wrong.

Two points...Ed is a very nice guy (talk to him about ice cream if he's not too busy), and he CARES about his product.

2nd, they have a system!  One server will serve your group.  Don't try to get a second server involved in your party...it will just slow things down - and it won't work. ;-)

We all scream!"
5,"I can not tell you how incredible this place is. I am a girl who HATES the dentist, I dread the thought of even going. I am new to the Vegas area and didnt have insurance, didnt have a dentist, and I had a cracked filling. I needed to fix it right away so I found the closest dentist to me. I called and Mike the office manager fit me in that day.  I paid out of pocket for xrays an exam and a cleaning. After the exam was complete the doctor found some work that needed to be done.  Since I did not have insurance I was freaking out about the cost!  Well, Mike helped me and was giving me as many discounts as he possibly could. I went home, found a dental plan and called Mike and he gave me the prices an hour later. I made my appointment and in 3 days was back in the office dreading getting in the chair!  Dr. Meevasin made the procedure easy and fast.  She was so gentle, always making sure I was comfortable and doing okay. She told me everything that was going on and was so patient with me when I wanted more numbing medicine!  
The next day after my teeth had been worked on I got a call from her assistant making sure everything was okay.  NOT ONE TIME IN MY LIFE HAVE I EVER GOTTEN A PHONE CALL FROM A DENTIST OFFICE CHECKING TO SEE IF I WAS DOING ALRIGHT. This was exceptional service and worth every penny. I would never go to any other dentist. 
I have had the worst experience with dentists and this has made me hate them, made me dread going, but coming to Dee For Dentist has made me change my mind. 
I am incredibly grateful for how kind they were to me when I was terrified to be there! 
Besides how amazing they are the office is extremely clean and decorated beautifully."
5,"I suffered from back pain for years, to the point that getting up in the morning in pain got to be my normal. I decided to give chiropractic a go and thanks to Dr. Rudd and Dr. Christopher I can now say I am pain free. Waking up in the morning and not feeling any pain at all is a new experience for me. Dr. Rudd and Dr. Christopher are awesome! It feels great to exercise and do every day things without feeling pain. I was also referred to Jody for acupuncture to continue my treatment and it has been amazing. Jody is so knowledgeable in her field and explains everything in a way that is easy to understand. I have continued doing both chiropractic and acupuncture and I know it has helped me with my overall health.  Thank you!!!!"
5,"Ed's Real Scoop is the real deal!  And here I foolishly thought that doling out $4.99 for a tub of Dazs or Ben 'n Jerry's was an indulgence... Move aside and make space for Ed's!

Originally I was going to opt for a Pistachio Gelato because that is one of my favourite flavours; in fact anything with nuts in it are my cup of tea... That's what SHE said!

But then I thought I should probably venture out of the nut sack and experience different flavours - ones that I've never tried before.  Seeing as they didn't have an extensive selection of gelato flavours, and seeing as I am a woman who likes variety, I wandered over to their ice cream section - NOW we're talkin'!  After having perused the many flavours, and having been offered a taste test of the Tahitian Vanilla Bean and Burnt Marshmallow... I opted for the Burnt Marshmallow... And I never looked back!

Although it didn't really encompass any hint of marshmallow flavour, it was the creamiest, smoothest, ice cream I have ever tasted.  The caramel was to die for and I don't usually like caramel... I would say that this should've been named Caramel Flan or Creme Caramel instead of Burnt Marshmallow.  

All in all, even though there was nothing marshmallow-y about the ice cream I had, I still loved it.  I will definitely be coming back for a rendez-vous with Ed on those lonely summer nights when a gal just needs some ice cream to feel all better!  Who needs men when you got ice cream, lol."
5,Absolutely love Pooh! Amazing nail salon and there is wine! Highly recommended! And they take there time!
5,"BEST Dentist in town!  Everyone is super friendly.  Whole office feels great.  The sunglasses is a nice touch.  Doc is super skillful.  Had a few procedures done, no pain, no drama!"
5,"I first dropped in a few months ago because of the high reviews from different customers. Since then I have been a regular customer, returning for new juice and replacement carts/atomizers.  I had defected items with name brand products in the past and Scott replaced the item with no questions asked (talk about customer service) and provided an alternative item at the same time. 

Pros: customer service, knowledge, fresh juice brewed in house, no feeling of being rushed to shop, friendly atmosphere, friendly staff, willing and able to accept suggestions, variety of juices, variety of mods and batteries. 

Cons: currently n/a

5/5 stars"
5,Amazing group!  If I could give them 10 stars I would.  I hurt my back and saw Dr. Christopher.  I can not say enough about how amazing she is.  Not only does she do amazing adjustments she CARES about causation and solving the problem!  I was beyond thrilled she took the time to talk to me in depth about the issue and what I need to do to correct it.  Today I saw Dr. Stone for Pain Management during treatment and he is also AMAZING!!!! He also took a great deal of time talking to me and working on my treatment plan.  I have physical therapy starting at this location tomorrow (so convenient you can see multiple providers under one roof) and I have no doubt I am in excellent hands and will be on the road to recovery soon!  If you need Chiropractic or Pain Management this is the only place you should look!
5,"We live way too close to this place.  We love it!  The yogurt is so good!  I love that they have whole cookies and brownies to add to your frozen yogurt.  The assortment of toppings is better than any other fro-yo place I've been to- and that's saying a lot! Haha But yes, one of our favorite places.  I go at least once a week and I'm not ashamed of this fact. :)"
5,"We had an excellent visit and it was our first time as well. Extremely professional staff and very clean work stations. Will be returning for sure, in the near future."
5,"Wow! During a bi-annual allergy induced laryngitis, I went in search for my favorite tea- dry desert lime. Apparently, I am the only one in PHX who knows it because no one is carrying it this year. Next best thing? Find dried limes. This quest led me to Biaz Market. The neighborhood it is in is rough, but it's more poverty than unsafe. The parking lot, though, was full. Walking in I decided to spend some time wandering the aisles. Within 30 seconds I was blown away. They have rose water and orange blossom water for 99 cents! The only place I had found it before sells it for $4! Fresh produce, cheeses, meats. Fresh herbs that I can't find elsewhere for only 89 cents! What? Am I dreaming? An entire aisle of spices- so many that I missed my limes I originally came here for. The very, very nice employee didn't just tell me what aisle, she walked me straight to it and when I commented about a ground version, she helped me search for that. Dolmas in cans and jars for under $3 (and they're freaking delicious!). Pita bread 50 cents. So much yummy stuff priced so well. We don't often get such gems of ethnicity in Phoenix, but this hidden treasure made me feel sooooooo good on a sick day. I can't wait to go back and try the restaurant, buy more groceries and test my cooking skills, and get get my fix of the world abroad without having to buts out the bones for an international flight."
5,"I absolutely love this nail salon! As someone who has tried most of the salons in Plaza Midwood and Dilworth, I can confidently say that Tiptoe is top notch! I have had many different nail techs do my nails and I can only think of one time I was remotely unsatisfied. Even still, they apologized and asked if I wanted it fixed.

Michael, the owner, and his wife are incredibly kind and you can tell people enjoy working there. The nail techs are always friendly. Michelle and S do a FANTASTIC job every time I see them. These ladies listen to your concerns, check in as they're doing your nails to make sure you're satisfied, and they spend their time making sure you feel pampered. Would you believe Michelle even said she likes that I'm picky because she learns more? There are other great techs whose names escape me.

The space is large, open and airy, giving a great ambience. It's never too loud or too crowded, something I really appreciate as I like to RELAX! They take walk ins and appointments. Although the parking is minimal, I have never had trouble. There is pop music playing most of the time and the two large TV's are typically playing HGTV and Food Network. They have snacks as well as red and white wine free of charge. I love the color selection and the fact that the gel color is right behind the regular color, neatly organized. The massage chairs are new and comfortable, complete with a purse hook. My only wish is that the bowls had plastic wrap for sanitation purposes that could be changed out between clients.

The pedicure is heaven. Sugar scrub, hot towels, dead skin removal and the best massages. My last pedicure came with the longest massage because my tech knew that's why I keeo coming back. Once I was reading a book while my gel nails soaked off, and my tech reached up and turned the pages for me because I couldn't! Not that I would've ever asked, but you can't deny that kind of customer service! These ladies are so intuitive and know what it takes to make an experience great. Plus, they don't talk about you right in front of your face - a pet peeve of mine. They actually engage with you if you want to talk. Extra bonus: they have never once made me feel like a pain for changing my mind about what color I wanted after seeing it on my nail - a problem at a lot of salons.

The one time my gel polish chipped a few days after my manicure, I went back and Michael prioritized my fix, doing it himself so I was in and out quickly. My last gel manicure lasted from Michelle lasted AN ENTIRE MONTH!

I am always getting compliments on my nails when I get them done here. If you're looking for a great, comfortable, clean, friendly nail salon who will do a great job, visit Tiptoe."
5,"Michael is the BEST! I have followed him to a few locations since I moved to Charlotte 2 years ago. He has always provided great advice on trendy colors. In addition, he ALWAYS has the latest colors from OPI and Essie. I always get a gel manicure and love it. It lasts a long time and I don't have to worry about it chipping unless I do something silly like slam my nail in a drawer or something! :/
About the salon, it's very spacious and has lots of modern decor."
5,"Um, wow! For $27 my wife and I ordered way too much delicious food and ate way to much of it because we just couldn't decide which incredible flavor to end on. The babaganouj is to die for! And plan on taking home a sample platter from the dessert counter at the back of the store. 

It's inside the Baiz market.

Bad neighborhood? Sure. But it's an immigrant neighborhood and the food is obviously targeting its market and not the white-washed American palate. Positively divine!"
5,"Very pleased! Searched on Yelp for a salon while visiting family in Charlotte. I loved the ""Pedi in a Box"" choice which allows you to pick your aroma therapy. My daughter and I appreciated how nail polish bottles are displayed with the gel color match directly behind on the shelf. I got a regular pedi polish with a gel manicure - perfect match with no problem. I enjoyed a glass of white wine and the luxury massage chair too."
5,"Perfection! I've gone a few times now before writing a review to look for consistency in excellence and I found it at Tip Toe Nails - they did not disappoint! This is a great salon, that uses top quality product. Everyone is thorough and takes great pride in their work. I've taken both of my daughters (11 and 16) and they were treated just like all customers - important. I highly recommend going to Tip Toe Nails!"
5,"Totally impressed with this little frozen yogurt shop! Delicious frozen yogurt, large array of toppings, clean environment, and friendly staff- what more could  you ask for! Will definitely be coming back often."
5,"I have been coming to AZ Spine, Disc, and Sport for several months now, and every provider that I have seen here has been AWESOME!  

I have seen just about everyone including (but not limited to):  
 
Dr. David Stone, M.D.
Dr. Angela J. Christopher,  DC, A.R.T, M.U.A.C.  FAKTR
Dr. Ryan Rudd, DC, A.R.T.
Dr. Michael Cady, DC
Dr. Tracey Rider, DC
Dr. Lindsay Whipple, PT, DPT
Dr. Ryan Niedzielko, PT, DPT
Auden Leyva, LMT, A.R.T
Breyana Scott, LMT

Each of these providers provided me with very thorough individualized care and put me on a customized treatment plan that was tailored to the severe chronic injuries that I continue to suffer from.  This is by far one of the most impressive integrative/holistic health care offices that I have ever seen, and they truly have everything here from Acupuncture to PT to Pain Management to Personal Training, so they can virtually treat just about any condition - it is the complete one stop shop!  

It should also be mentioned that I too am a Chiropractor, so I am very selective regarding what providers I see.  I found AZ Spine, Disc, and Sport on yelp, because I wanted to seek out the best possible providers to help me out.  I chose this establishment because it had the best yelp reviews in the area closest to my house, and I have not been disappointed.  

So what REALLLLY makes this place stand out from the rest?

The quality providers, the multi-disciplinary approach to healing the WHOLE body, and addressing the root of the problem (not just treating symptoms!) ... I wanted to go to a caring patient based health care office that treats most similar to how I treat at my own practice, and this office has been a great fit for me!  They go above and beyond the call of duty to try to help you out ... 

The Chiropractors here do far more than mere manual Adjustments - they do manual therapy/muscle work/myofascial release techniques, they have spinal decompression machines, as well as all sorts of other modalities that the standard Chiropractic Practice does not offer.  

The Physical Therapists also do much more than simply show you exercises, then have you do them in an assembly line type fasion... they do will do extensive hands on muscle therapies, which is what distinguishes them from the average PT clinic.  The PT technologies here are also state of the art and most office do not have a cold probe or a treadmill that can be used in an aqueous environment.

The Massage Therapists here are also TOP NOTCH ... very therapeutic and this is not your typical spa or massage envy like place where all they do is rub lotion on you.  You will feel like you are getting worked during a therapeutic massage session here, and you definitely may be a bit sore afterwards!

The staff here is very attentive, cool personalities, fun, happy, good people who really care about trying to help you get better.  The facility itself is amazing... this is probably the biggest Chiropractor owned office I have ever seen (Congrats to Dr. Christopher for putting an AMAZING establishment like this together.... a lot of hard work, sweat, and tears goes into organizing a facility such as this one!) - it is very clean, spacious, and as I previously mentioned they have everything here!  Also, the support staff is very accommodating, and the prices here are very reasonable for the type of service that you will receive!  Plus, they offer extensive office hours and many providers are even available on Saturdays if you are too busy to get in to see them during the work week!!!

I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends and family members looking for a top notch Integrative/Holistic Health Care practice in the Southeast Valley!  I have already recommended my own mom to come here for treatments :)"
5,"Love this place! We frequent Yogurtology often even though there is a froyo place closer to home. The place is clean, the yogurts are good, the staff is helpful, the toppings are fresh and the prices are reasonable. They also have a rewards program for frequent visitors.

My only request is that they switch out the No Sugar Added flavor a little more often."
5,"If you are lucky enough to become a client of Micheal's, you won't regret it! He has been taking care of my nails and toes regularly for two years. I am so excited for him to open his own salon, and know he would only hire the best to take care of his clients. He only uses the best products, and has a large selection of colors and matching gels. Do yourself a huge favor, and make an appointment here ASAP!"
5,Scott runs an awesome shop. I could go in there and kill hours just chatting it up with Shane and Justin. Awesome place with awesome employees.
5,"Their ad doesn't lie: Upscale food for a fair price! I had the Homerun Ribeye and can honestly say one of the best steaks I have had anywhere! Casual/sports bar atmosphere, which we enjoy. Service was superb!"
5,Great customer service from entry to departure. One of the few good experiences I have had Goin to the dentist. Didn't feel like they were just Would recommend them to my family and friends.
5,"Dr. Vicente Chavira is a fantastic chiropractor. Both my wife and I have visited AZ Spine Disc and Sport in the past month and he was very patient with diagnosing our issues and treating us.

I have been to chiropractors before and they were in a rush to get us in and out. We had the complete opposite experience here. I highly recommend them."
5,I broke my collar bone and right ring finger over a year ago from a bike crash. After 8 months of therapy I was referred to Auden for active release massage from a friend. I went there to prevent future issues in my right shoulder. To my surprise he was able to get more range of motion in my hand. He is a like minded athlete and the environment is very welcoming and comfortable. I am so glad I got referred to Auden and AZ spine and disc.  If you belong to the monthly massage club it is only $40 a massage. Usually you get what you pay for. Not in this case. Amazing price for an amazing massage.
5,"I cannot express how much I dislike going to the dentist. I always get along with them, the pain is never unbearable, but I just don't like someone rooting around in my mouth. I always feel uncomfortable and slightly violated. With that being said, this experience was pleasant, and as comfortable as a dentist visit could be, from start to finish. The reception/intake representatives were polite, professional, and chipper. My x-rays, while awkward, we're done with minimal discomfort and correct the first time. Dee was very welcoming and warm to talk to. She was thorough and explained everything to me perfectly in a relatable manner. My dental hygienist remembered my daughter (who is also a patient), was genuinely interested in my small talk, and was very attentive. I scheduled another appointment and used their referrals for specialists. I will be going back and would recommend them to anyone who is going to see a dentist! :)"
5,Best vape shop ever! They make you feel welcomed and have the answers to any question you have. I ended up buying Dew In the Pink and CT Crunch. Best flavors I've ever vaped and great staff
5,"My ""local"", as it were, had caused me to lose faith that ice cream is really anything worth bothering much about.  Ed's has restored that faith.

Over two visits I've sampled:
Pumpkin - Excellent (who knew?)
Coffee Toffee - Very Good (coffee part is excellent, would prefer more, bigger chunks of toffee)
Pralines and Cream - Its ok.... but its a delicate flavour and I'm not a delicate eater, haha

Something no one has mentioned is that Ed's has clean washrooms available, this is key after being outside for a long walk on a hot day and wanting to attend to business and wash your hands before enjoying your ice cream.

Also, it is freezing cold in there, which is an awesome option on a hot day...  and they have some seating as well.

Service was very nice, more than happy to provide multiple samples, for instance.

Finally, yeah, its a bit expensive but I'd say more or less in line with the competition."
5,"Between the excellent work of both Dr. Rudd and Auden, my body is being put back together again!!  Thanks guys!"
5,Been coming here for over a year now and I'm so glad I found this place! I really like how high-tech and advanced in technology they are. They beta test for everything! The staff is friendly especially my hygienist. She's gentle and thorough! I'm so glad I found my new dental home. I recommend anyone looking for a dentist to give Dee for Dentist a visit!
5,"Excellent ice cream, gelato and sorbet.  A great spot to satisfy your sweet tooth."
5,"Ed's Real Scoop or ""Scoops"" as locals call it is part of the tour that we offer our out of town guests.  We have yet to have someone say they were disappointed.  We have tried the majority of the flavours over time, so feel free to push away from straight chocolate, strawberry, etc!

Heading there mid-afternoon on a weekend in the summer and you will see a line-up out the door, but early evening is usually not a problem."
5,This is by far the best yogurt place I have ever been to! I am a yogurt snob and I am glad that I ran across this place. The first thing I notice is that the owners keep pride in making the place spotless! Secondly the workers are very friendly (couple cute ones) and always willing to give you a sample cup. I recommend trying a couple sample cups to see what you will like. The flavors are awesome and some are switched out every so often. Some yogurt places have a weird chemical taste to it. This place does not have that taste at all. The price is also by far one of the most competitive in yogurt industry. Yummy tummy!
5,Dr Dee is fabulous! Dentists are never my favorite appointments as I have the worst teeth my entire life. It the crew/team and Dee Dee make me feel as comfortable as being in my own home! Thank you for always caring in so many ways! Would refer them to anyone at any age! I'm also a Broker in the industry so I'm very very picky! 100% quality!
5,"Great ice cream, amazingly rich chocolate gelato!"
5,First time coming in and I have to say the place is very clean. The person working that day was on point with everything making sure everyone was feeling welcome and help. On top of cleaning immediately after every person. He went on and beyond with every single person that came in that day and let me tell you their was a few parents and kids in there. Will be coming back!
5,This is the best vape shop I hav been to in Vegas!!!! Great flavors !!! Great customer service!!! I will be back !!!!
5,"Welp it finally happened, I went and got a pedicure. 25 years and I'm glad I got it done here from the great owners Michael and Becky Tran. Great establishment and even better people."
5,Dee for Dentist is awesome...I highly recommend this office...the staff is kind and courteous...the office is state-of-the-art...everything is done in-house...
5,"I've been coming to Dee for Dentist for several years . 6 years to be exact. A close family friend recommended her and I've been going to Dee ever since . Not only is her staff amazing. Susana in particular helps break down every detail for me, when it comes to my insurance coverage and payments . As I am overly detailed and organized individual. The practice is super clean and comfortable. I love coming here and enjoy coming to get my Teeth cleaned and fixed . She has everything you need there when it comes to making crowns etc . She's made my mouth clean and clean !! Thanks Dee ! Your the best !"
5,"Came in to cop some new juice and coils for my Atlantis tank. Prices here are good and reasonable. The Asian guy (jerico?) was friendly and recommended some juices to my taste. Got the bomb pop, strawberry ice cream, and caramel apple. Loved these!! This place seemed to be a good hangout spot as there seemed to be regulars hanging out. What interest me is that I was serviced from when I came in till I left. I've visited other vape shops and was ignored due their sucky cust service but not this place. Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back."
5,"This office is amazing! I went to another Chiropractor before seeing them about back pain, hip pain and numbness in my hands and none of my problems were fixed. After seeing Dr. Turner and Dr. Rudd for a couple months I am pain free! I would recommend this office to anyone that is looking for pain relief and good genuine Doctors. Also I get a massage every week from Auden and he does a great job and I always feel amazing after leaving!"
5,"I give this place five stars. Best shop I have ever been to.  the customer service was great! I highly recommend this place to everybody. not only that but they make their own juice and it is the best juice by far that I have ever tried.  I am hooked on banana nut bread. Another really cool thing is that the shop has a very nice look to it nice furniture and pictures on the walls. Great place to just come and hang out.. They also have a great website with tons of flavors, amazing prices and fast shipping if your not local.. If you haven't checked them out yet, your missing out!"
5,Wonderful breakfast we  loved it! Will return for sure.. Homemade Corned Beef Hash & he had an omelet... Yummy!
5,"The best ice cream in Toronto bar none. Burnt marshmallow, coffee, and pumpkin in the fall are my favourites. Don't be fooled by all the new trendy ice cream places popping up, Ed's is the real deal."
5,"Had crown done today and as usual great work done.  The office is so modern, sanitary and unlike a typical dentist's office.  I am usually nervous at the dentist but not here !!!!  They get you back on or before your appointment time ( I have never had to wait). Overall if you are looking for a great knowledgable dentist with friendly competent hygienist's this is your place !"
5,I came in before 11 and they weren't open yet but instead of turning me away they encouraged me to come in and order. They have amazing customer service and are very accommodating.
5,"This place is amazing!! The pizza is delicious and super fresh. Have been there twice and both times we received great service and great food!!  TRUE Chicago pizza, this is coming from my boyfriend who was born and raised in south side Chicago, who grew up eating Sanfratello's in Chicago!! If you can't wait 30 minutes for an awesome, delicious pizza, walk your butt to little caesars!!"
5,This place is a gem in the Beaches! Loved it! I had the cherry gelato in a cone....so good! I want to try the blood orange next time as it had caught my eye as well. Perfect ice cream place on a perfect summer day
5,I am very happy I stumbled upon Puff Vapors! Conrad and the staff are very knowledgeable on the subject of vapors! Definitely check this place out first before going anywhere else. The prices are right and all your questions will be answered.
5,"So. Good.  So so so good.

The ice cream is absolute perfection.  They get it just right, the creme brulee, not too sweet or heavy, refreshing and tasty.  The milk chocolate tastes just like chocolate milk.  They make their own waffle cones on site, and it's definitely worthwhile to get it in one of those.  

If you are down on the beach you *must* have ice cream here, if it's the one thing you eat.  Yum.  Staff is friendly, and it's not dirt cheap, but ice cream never really is anymore."
5,"We love Yogurtology! Especially on a hot summer day like today! It's such a clean, cool atmosphere and the employees are so courteous and friendly. This will be a weekly staple for us! No froyo place can compare!"
5,"It's hard to think about ice cream in the middle of winter... but I dream about Ed's Real Scoop! There is nothing better than wandering along the Beach on a hot summer's day and finding yourself standing in front of Ed's. The smells wafting out of this place are INCREDIBLE! (all ice cream is made inside!)  I totally agree with Abby, the waffle cones are to die for."
5,"Auden Leyva at AZ Spine Disk and Sport has made it possible for this 43 year old to continue my new adventure as a member of a local roller derby team. Over years overuse- volleyball for 17 years, snowboarding (multiple concussions and neck issues) mountain biking-) my back and neck have really suffered. During my first roller derby scrimmage I got hit hard and hit the floor even harder, leading to whiplash. I though I might need to give up my silly dream. And then my friend told me about Auden. Through his knowledge and skilled care, I am mobile and a new member of the Brawlerinas RD team with AZ Roller derby. He is a miracle worker! (And super nice and funny) Thanks Auden!!"
5,"Where do I even begin? My wonderful experience started on the phone when I was calling to place an order. I forgot the woman's name who helped me which is upsetting because I called twice based on my indecisiveness on my order ha! She was so friendly and helpful as to my order. When my boyfriend and I arrived we picked up our pan pizza with pepperoni and sausage. We were greeted by all of the staff including the owner. The owner educated us on the different styles of pizza and their appetizers. It's so refreshing to arrive at a restaurant and receiving such service! It made me so much happier we had come and ordered from this local establishment. 

We chose to sit outside based on the beautiful weather at night here in Arizona. The patio area is very pleasant and I love the lightning. Everything both inside and out was so clean! Now to the food. 

The pan pizza is AMAZING. The sausage was so flavorful! As we were shoveling our faces with food the owner came out and asked us to try the fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks. Holy amazingness! They make everything fresh on site and you can taste it from the special cheese to the breading. I HIGHLY recommend you try an order of these. They are so good. Now the pizza fritz. I probably over indulged on those. It's soft and doughy sprinkled with powdered sugar. It's feels soft and pillow as you dunk it into a puddle of dark chocolate. Yes yes yes!  

I can't wait to come back here and try the thin crust. Thank you guys!!"
5,The homemade kettle chips are amazing! The Red Filet is the best steak I have ever had.
5,"Fresh ice cream, try their rotation of seasonal flavours, pumpkin, Guinness, bacon, (not sure what season bacon is, but let's say they experiment). Go with the standards like pralines and cream, burnt marshmallow, or apple pie. Whichever you opt for, you will not be disappointed. they make their own waffle cones. Line ups may be long but they move quickly."
5,Great service every single time we've stopped in! Food and drinks are both delicious! Patio is awesome and a great friendly Atmosphere! Definitely has become a go to place to eat!
5,"I am new to the area and hurt my back moving. As a Pilates teacher and certified Rossiter Practitioner, I work with lots of clients in pain- unfortunately this time it was for me and there are no other Rossiter Coaches in Phoenix to help me! I was able to schedule an appointment with Dr. Chavira for the next day. He listened to me, explained his treatment plan, was gentle (no ""back cracking"") and did not make me feel rushed. The treatment was in many ways similar to a Rossiter Workout with deep fascial stretching plus he added a guasha-type connective tissue modality. The treatment was effective because I felt much better leaving than when I arrived. I have scheduled a follow up appointment with him to continue to improve my back pain. As someone who has gone to chiropractors for over 30 years, I feel fortunate that I found someone like Dr. Chavira. AZ Spine and Disc also offers physical therapy, personal training, massage and has primary care physicians on staff- I hope to take full advantage of all of their services. So convenient having all of those services under one roof. The front desk staff could use a little help- I sat for 10 minutes once I checked in and finally went to the window to ask for my new patient paperwork. They didn't have it ready and as a result I got a late start on my appointment."
5,"While no one actually enjoys going to the dentist, I can honestly say I never have a bad experience coming here!
The staff makes your dental visit the best possible! They are always smiling and genuinely happy to see their patients. 
Dee for dentist also has all the most recent technology, so they are very efficient. This is a plus for me because they respect the time I am taking away from work etc to be there! I never have to sit in the lobby or dental chair for hours to be seen either!
I will not see another dentist as long as I live in the Las Vegas area!"
5,"Location: 5/5
Right off the freeway. Near restaurants and close by the freeway.

Ambiance: 5/5
Clean and organized. Very comfortable lounge area.

Service: 5/5
Always great customer service. Always greeted when I walk in. They do what they can to help and they take the time to explain everything to you. You never feel rushed.

Ninja Stars: 5/5
Staff is awesome. Owner is always great to talk to. Great juice selection. 5 ninja stars."
5,"This deli/cafe is excellent.  In my opinion, the most authentic place in town.  It's located inside of Baiz Market.  The pita is fresh, the shawarma is cooked on a rotiserie.  No complaints with the quality of food.

However, you will have to put up with some chaos.  They do not take orders in an orderly manner.  You just stand near the counter and eask the patrons ""are you waiting to order or waiting for food""  There is no line.

What is worse is the parking lot situation.  It is too small for the volume that they do.  So people make up parking spaces or wait for someone to leave.  The last two times I was their there were minor accidents in the parking lot.

They are supposed to be opening a new Baiz Market on Dobson/Baseline.  This needs to happen sooner rather than later.  They have out grown their old location."
5,"My first visit and had a fantastic relaxing pedicure.  I will definitely be back.  Only complaint was parking, but worth the search."
5,"This is a great laid back atmosphere with an outside patio, awesome food, and really reasonable pricing. Love it!"
5,Good service and good juice  I get frosted crush in 3 nic. Stop by give em a good review they also do buy 2 get one free on Fridays
5,"Dr Christopher is truly amazing.  She has helped me lose weight, manage my pain and reduce my insulin.  Thank you for being such an amazing, intuitive and caring practitioner and business woman!"
5,"I always go here with my mom and it's one of the best frozen yogurt places her and I have been to, the workers are very nice and greeting as soon as you walk in the door, very clean and price is by OZ so it just depends on how much you get. If you go your be addicted and want more lol"
5,Love their Blood Orange sorbet with Pistachio gelato =)
5,Want to know who the real knuckleheads are?   Well it's anyone that didn't give Ed'd 5 stars!
5,"I love this place!  My family comes here once a week, it's become our tradition.  The Pomegranate Raspberry is my absolute favorite.  I think more fruit variety would be nice, but it's not a big deal.  The location and deliciousness are more than enough! : )"
5,"Ok - this is why I live in the Beach:

Guinness ice cream  from Ed's (no, seriously - it's really good!!)
... on a bench
... in the middle of the Jazz Festival Streetfest
... with the Imbayakunas (theimbayakunas.com) lighting up the street!

This is what summer is for!"
5,"Super impressed with this fro-yo shop. The place is so clean, I am positive I could eat off the floors, the tables or even the cool looking highchairs for the kiddos. Its kinda funny to see them vacuum up any messes or crumbs after someone goes through to select toppings, but they must mean business when they try to stay so sparkling clean and bright.  

The staff is so friendly and attentive as you walk in the door and explain the concept and flavors, including allowing you to try a little taste of the various kinds of yogurts. I always want to know what the most popular / best seller is and they said its been the oatmeal cookie. It tastes just like an oatmeal cookie. So good. But, I don't have a super sweet tooth, so I ended up doing the tart flavor and added some fresh fruit on top. 

I have nothing bad or negative to say about this place. Its really good.  Its right next to Treasures Jewelry shop on 67th Ave (north of the Safeway in the strip mall there.)"
5,Great food! Good beer specials! Love swinging by for lunch or dinner. Have to try the Cajun salmon meal. Best salmon meal I've had in Cleveland.
5,Dee for Dentist is a great place with great people. Very caring and personable. Wonderful service. Thanks!
5,"The team at AZ Spine Disc and Sport has helped me stay on the dance floor and behind the camera.  Thanks to Dr. Stone, Dr. Warren, Dr. Rudd and Auden."
5,"As a competitive cyclist/athlete, recovery and treatment are one of the most important aspects of being able to compete at the highest level every day. Dr. Angie, Dr. Stone, Dr. Rudd and Dr. Courtney have been so helpful in aiding in my recovery. I highly recommend them for all athletes looking to get extra recovery and those looking to just seek treatment from injuries or pain."
5,"Awesome, fresh waffle cones. A perfect complement to amazing ice cream. I only wish they had a bigger space so that it's easier to look at the ice cream flavours when there's a huge crowd every summer."
5,Being originally from Iowa this place was spot on! They had the Midwest hospitality that no place out here has! The pork tenderloin tastes just like home! Service was amazing and all the staff were spot on! Will definitely return here!!
5,"As of this post there are 5 different vape shops on Rainbow within a 1.5 mile stretch from Windmill to the 215. However this is were 75% of my juices come from with good reason.  Most places it's just hit and miss finding one good flavor for every three you sample, but this place I just like them all.  I've delt with all the staff and everyone is so helpfull. YES even the asian dude.  

The carry a variety of attys as well as your latest trendiest clearo tanks. Subtanks and Atlantis being the latest trend. I like the fact that they're prices are so close to dealing online when it comes to tanks and replacement coils. I asked about their Sigelei 50w V2 box mod this evening and it was only 3 bucks more than my favorite online retailer (awsome!).  
They will work on your builds if your not into DIY, and they have supplies if you do like to build your own.
On my previous visit i purchased two 30ml bottles of e-liquid and got another free. However i tasted their Jagger juice that I couldn't decide weather I liked or not (jagger) so the dude gave me a free 10ml bottle to sample more on my own. BOOM! Jagger is freakin awsome to wake up to and enjoy with coffee.
One last thing. If you love Mountain Dew than you'll love this place. They have all the mountain dews from the original and tacobell's baja blast and even more Dew's that they've created. Try the LAMBO!"
5,"I've been buying their juice from a vape shop in Anthem. For the last week they've been out of stock of a specific flavor. I took to their website to see who else in town might carry it...long story short I was led back to Yelp only to learn they have a store. Not far from my house...

In the car I went down to Warm Springs & Rainbow and after getting lost in the shopping center I found them, hidden behind another business. Justin helped me out & was a delight. He turned me onto a few new flavors I'll check out on my next trip in & hooked me up with the atomizers I needed.  I left happy & satisfied. 

They earned my business."
5,"I've been getting chiropractic care for almost 25 years, and this office is truly one of the best.  The entire staff is outstanding, and Dr Christopher is an extremely skilled chiropractor.  I highly recommend this office!"
5,"Been going to see Dr Dee and kristen for the past 5 years and have nothing but amazing things to say. They make me feel like family and explain everything so well. I know They are also great with my 3 year old and he LOVES going to the dentist. I know we're in good hands, I will never trust anyone else with my or my family's teeth."
5,"In love with this salon!! Modern, chic, great service and Veronica nailed it! I love that they carry OPI exclusively, massage pedi chairs fab! Doesnt hurt that i live in apt building across street! Im picky about mani/pedis and they even did a superior job compared to services in miami!!"
5,"One of the reasons I visited this location is because they are open on Sunday's; This is a plus in my book. My weeks are busy and Saturdays at any nail salon can be busy as well. 

The salon is very clean and inviting and the staff are super friendly and accommodating. They do great work and the prices are reasonable; my favorite tech is S. She does great work and is fun to talk to. 

Highly recommend."
5,Dr Rudd was awesome. Took tome to hear what was bothering me and I never felt rushed like you do with most health care facilities. Plus I feel great after leaving!!
5,Best yogurt and the toppings are awesome!  Staff is great and the flavors change often.  I only rate places that I give 5 stars...
5,"I am adding a little update to my review.....In my last review I told you all how great this office is and this past week when I was in pain and distraught over swallowing my crown they really proved how compassionate, caring and honest they truly are.  I had my horrific accident of swallowing a crown over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, just a few days before we were about to chow down on dinner.  I was in panic mode and called the emergency line on a Sunday afternoon, I left a message and 30 minutes later I was called back and reassured I would be fine and they would get me in ASAP to fix it, but unfortunately I was out of town and couldn't rush home.  The following day I was called back by the wonderful Doc herself to check in on me and make sure I was doing okay.  As soon as I got into town I was seen and all fixed up.  
Everyone at Dee For Dentist is incredible.  They are a big family and they treat all their patients like they are apart of the family.  
I couldn't be more thankful to have found them a few years ago."
5,"Long time customer of Tinley Park,  IL location. 
Dinner tonight was just as good as I had hoped!  Mostacolli with meat sauce and chicken parm sandwich. We'll be back FOR SURE!"
5,"Perfection! I've gone a few times now before writing a review to look for consistency in excellence and I found it at Tip Toe Nails - they did not disappoint! This is a great salon, that uses top quality product. Everyone is thorough and takes great pride in their work. I've taken both of my daughters (11 and 16) and they were treated just like all customers - important. I highly recommend going to Tip Toe Nails!

Update: I moved further away and tried local nail salons out of convenience. No one is as clean and sterile as Tip Toe! Going to make the trek to their salon because I trust their high standards!"
5,"I broke 5 thoracic vertebrae in 2012 and I have seen more doctors then I can count and have done every treatment and procedure that was suggested to me within reason to alleviate discomfort and pain. Dr. Komar reviewed all of the records I provided including a recent CT scan prior to speaking to me. After a thorough physical evaluation he informed me of a procedure that I have never heard of from any of the spine doctors I have seen and I was really excited. He gave me hope that I will eventually, quite possibly not have to live with the pain and discomfort that I have to endure on a regular basis. 

I was very grateful and so happy I chose to go see him. Everyone was friendly and helpful and I can't wait to see what the future holds for physical well being thanks to Dr. Komar."
5,"Love this shop!
Great atmosphere!
Perfectly clean. 
Skilled staff. Very accommodating.
The massage chairs are the best I've ever planted my fanny in. 
Really would like to keep it a secret, but I won't!"
5,"How many curse words can I say in one sentence to describe how good this place is?

Holy f*****g hell, this is the best g*****n thing I've ever f*****g eaten that only cost $4 and s**t, b***h, it is good!

oh, seriously though, anyone who is a friend of mine knows I don't mind eating in a market in a neighborhood bordered by the projects. This place definitely fits that criteria. It's about 3 blocks north of Van Buren, on 20th street, across from the county hospital, and one of the most drug ridden project housing developments in the city. I don't care. The food here is absolutely delicious, and it is cheap cheap cheap.

I just got home from another visit, and for the first time, I found something negative to say. The cute little hispanic girl that was running the cash register, said to me at 8pm, ""we are closed dude"" as I was finishing up my last bite and starting to get up and leave. Maybe next time I'll try to get there about 17 seconds earlier so I won't inconvenience you. 

Shwarma, hummus, kebab, kafta, etc. it doesn't matter, everything is all made from scratch, and when you order it, is amazingly delicious."
5,"This place was absolutely amazing, and I really needed amazing. I was kind of traumatized at my last visit to a dentist, I have always gone every six months but it's been over 12 because I was so anxious. 

I have super sensitive teeth and my last dentist said I would need Novocain to have a cleaning. Kristen was incredible though, she used the gentlest technique and the gentlest approach and took a lot of time with my mouth to really get my teeth clean and we did not have to use Novocain. My teeth are still super clean, but she really took the time to do it right. We have definitely found a new dentist here."
5,"Auden is a phenomenal massage therapist! I see him every month, sometimes twice/month. He's gotten me healthy and ready for all my races and long runs. Love it and highly recommend it!!!"
5,This place is great. Hummus was awesome. Just a great all around place for Middle Eastern. The market is great too. Great to pass the time looking around while you wait for your food
5,"Stop in here today and wished I lived closer,  such a wonderful place.  Great coffee and delicious food."
5,"$25 for the quick In and Out pedicure, but for $5 more you can get a lovely sugar rub followed by a lotion massage. Pedicure is long-lasting too."
5,One of the very few places one can get a breaded tenderloin sandwich. I used to have favorite place back in Iowa for tenderloins...this is better. If anyone reading this is from Des Moines and knows Smitty's Tenderloins on Army Post Rd they you'll love this place. The tenderloins taste the same but they're thicker. I have yet to have a pie there but I hear they're to die for.
5,"My goto place for anything Vape related. Eliquids are always top notch and consistent. Staff is friendly and helpful. I usually go on Fridays when I need more since they have a promotion that offers buy 2 get 1 free on their Eliquids. Depending on your taste palate there is always something for everyone. I don't really like custard flavors so I flavors like pina colada, baja blast, and bombsicle."
5,"Two words, super awesome.  Slightly more west of the 51 than I am normally comfortable traveling, but I was feeling adventurous, so glad.  So it's this little eatery tucked inside a market, no frills.  You order at the counter and they call you when it's ready.

I had the whole rotisserie chicken which comes with pita, garlic sauce, and a huge plate of lettuce, pickles, and tomato.  Since I was being so adventurous, I opted for a soda.  Altogether, about $9.  The food was great, almost spectacular.  I literally ate the ENTIRE chicken with most of the extras.  It was that good.  My dining partner has the Iraqi Plate, which looked amazing, and judging by the amount of conversation (nil), I can only conclude that it was delicious as well.

I can't wait to try more things here and eagerly await my next visit!  Oh, and if you're looking for desert, you can walk outside the market and hang a right or left and pick up some crack, heroin, or maybe even a lady-friend for a few minutes of after-dinner relaxation in a nearby alley."
5,My favorite breakfast hangout ... You have to try their new Eggs Benedict. Yum! I love the Iowa hometown feel where the servers know your name and care about you.
5,"This place is inside Baiz Supermarket.
If you are in mood of middle eastern food, this is the place. They have the most popular dishes. I highly recommend this place!"
5,Love this place!! Great atmosphere and amazing yogurt! They update on Facebook their seasonal flavors so make sure and check. Oatmeal cookie however is a constant flavor that I can't get enough of. I definitely recommend this place especially for kids because they can choose their own flavors and reach the toppings. Much much better than any other yogurt shop I've tried.
5,Always refreshing. Always good. I love this place. Their açaí bowls are huge.  Very filling and delicious. Worth the $8.50.
5,"Auden is a phenomenal massage therapist. I came to him about 3 months post op major hip surgery for range of motion improvement and pain management of the other hip while I finish rehabbing surgical side and prep for next procedure. With his help, I've been able to return to doing short walks and have experienced improved quality of life as a result. I would recommend him to a wide array of people with various activity levels, from sedentary to elite athletes."
5,I've been seeing Dr. Dee Dee for a few years now and I love it there. She is a caring and friendly doctor with an equally caring and friendly staff. I also really like that they definitely put your comfort first by using the best equipment and keeping you with the same tech(?) for your regular cleanings. I always have Kristen and she is so sweet and gentle. She's great at giving breaks when needed and makes a not so great thing like getting a cleaning not so bad. It's nice to know that I'll be having my cleaning done by someone who knows about my dental health/needs that I can trust.
5,"I see Dr Christopher and she is amazing. The staff is always nice and welcoming and of course after my frequent visits they have gotten to know me well. 
They have a huge area for therapy, treatment etc and exam rooms as well which I like. 

Pretty soon to be getting my husband in for a visit and adjustment. I have had no issues and have been here many a times. And will recommend the greatness and magic here! 

Update: recently visited the family medicine side with the NP Tina. She's amazing. 
Started working with Dr Vincente for Chiro when Christopher is not there and he is amazing as well! Love it all!"
5,"Expect a line up Ed's lives up to its reputation as a classic ice cream joint. 

We tried burnt marshmallow, raspberry white chocolate, cookies n cream, and French mint. My favourites were the burnt marshmallow and raspberry white chocolate! French mint was a surprise as the mint flavour really came through. 

A excellent way to cool everyone down after a hot day at the beach."
5,"I can't say enough good things about their staff and juice! Everyone there is super friendly, knowledgeable and laid back. They have some of the best tasting juice and they'll customize the nicotine mg. My two favorite flavors are Bomb Pop &  Tidal Wave (Tastes just like Ocean Water from Sonics)"
5,Can't say enough good things about this team! They have seen me through my injuries and helped me recuperate. Back to long runs and lifting thanks to them. Thank you Dr. Stone!
5,"Rivals is an all time favorite for my husband and I. We love their burgers and chicken sandwiches! The owner John is a super nice guy and you can tell he really cares about his restaurant with how well it's doing. We stop in 2-3 times a month for dinner and we are never disappointed. Their outside eating area/bar is very nice and we frequent that in the spring/fall on the cooler nights. All in all you can't go wrong at rivals!

Update: We have also tried their breakfast menu now and we are hooked, it's so good for such a cheap price!!"
5,"The store is very clean, the staff is always exceptionally friendly and helpful, they have a wide variety of flavors and toppings and their yogurt has a smoother, thicker consistency than others I have tried. It is a great place to go with large groups and children. The kids enjoy playing in the grassy area out front. It is expensive but worth it!"
5,"Micheal  is by far the best at what he does, I have been following him for 9 years and no one but him will ever touch my nails. Now he has a beautiful salon that he can call home."
5,"Really enjoyed the pizza. Had the deep dish with sausage and pepperroni. I am from Chicago but never heard of this pizza place. Tastes different (in a good way) than Gino's East, Lou's or Giordano's. Most people from Chicago always compare deep dish or stuffed to Lou's. This pizza was very tasty. Not sure why some people gave it bad reviews. My advice is to try the pizza for yourself. You will not be disappointed."
5,"I've been to many many dentists and I can finally say ""I love my dentist!"" Dr. Dee is very professional, thorough and honest. I trust her 100%! She has the best staff any dental/medical office I've ever been to. They're so nice and welcoming, even on the phone. I love that they always remember my name, without introducing myself. Really awesome customer service! 

I also love my hygienist Rowena! She's so gentle and light on her hands but gets the job done! Thanks for cleaning my teeth, it feels so good! I wish I can see you every week!"
5,"Been a customer at Yogurtology since they opened! My family and I love to go if we're wanting something sweet or cold on a hot AZ day! Friendly staff. Fairly recently they started serving ACAÍ BOWLS! Which is my obsession. (If you haven't had one, try one ASAP!) they serve huge acai bowls for an average price. Definitely my go-to over any juice bar, as they're typically overpriced at those places. Wonderful, family friendly area outside as well! Never fails us!"
5,Dee is awesome and has very friendly staff. She has some really cool technology/equipment that I've never seen at a dental office before - makes going to the the dentist kinda cool. I highly recommend her!
5,Great vape shop.... Scott is always welcoming and helpful and his staff is the best. They make their own juice... the best in Vegas!!! They also have a rewards program so everything is affordable. Highly recommend to all you vape smokers!!
5,"Dr. Christopher has been simply amazing, the guy that assists and the front desk ladies are all super nice and friendly. They make you feel like a person when in reality we are grumpy and in pain haha I've only been a couple times and it's still early on but I notice a difference. My hips were rotated making one leg longer which I kind of already knew but didn't thing it was playing a role! My back pain is pretty severe with Dr. Christopher and her team of super awesome people I have no doubt that I'll be up and about in no time. Also, I feel like I should mention this; I am not a paid commercial spokesmen. :)"
5,"Nicest dentist office I've ever seen.  They have TV's above you so you can watch movies while getting your teeth cleaned!  It's perfect.  Takes the edge off. 
I love the decor!  
The staff is so nice and  Dr. Meevasin is so gentle.  I just love coming here!  It makes you want to go to the dentist!!"
5,"Everybody hates going to the dentist as much as the DMV. I was recommended this place by a friend. I have to say I have never experience such an amazing and caring staff. They take the time to explain everything to you. I had an extraction done and left the office thinking that was the end of the interaction, the dentist actually called me personally to check how I was doing and if the numbing wore off. I thought this touch of personal attention was very nice. I recommend this dentist office to anyone. They almost make going to the dentist enjoyable. Highly recommended."
5,"I have been with Dr. Dee Dee and Mike for years. They are professional, prideful and downright hilarious. You can't ask for much more than that. If you live in Green Valley or Henderson, you'd be a fool not to go to Dee for Dentist. It's clean, modern, people are great, what else do you need? Go there. Now."
5,"When this place opened, I kept seeing all these reviews coming in on my feed. Michael this, Michael that, I've been following Michael for years, etc. I had to find out for myself, WHO IS THIS MICHAEL?!

Did he live up to the hype? Oh hell yeah. I was a fan from the first time I walked into the salon. He's so nice, so personable, but more than anything... he's real. He takes a lot of pride in what he does. Michael worked at a few salons over the years and this is his very own place. Him and his wife are always there. All the girls who work here are super sweet. 

The space is very industrial chic. There's a nice waiting area in the front that's separate from the salon portion. They take both walk-ins and appointments. The polishes are super organized on shelves that look almost like spice racks. Polishes have their matching gels behind them. There's nail swatches as well. It all makes it easy to pick colors. My obsession color all summer has been the Hello Kitty OPI pale pink. Nice massage chairs. Two flat screens... E! on one, HGTV on the other. They offer drinks- water, soda, wine, and coffee. There's always a good mix of music playing. The parking lot is kind of small, but I've yet to have an issue coming here. 

I always get a gel manicure ($35) and regular pedicure ($30). The pedi includes trim-file-cuticle treatment, buff, sugar scrub, dead skin removal, lotion massage, hot towels, and polish. For $5 more, aroma therapy pedi boxes. There are eight different scents and they are made without all the harmful chemicals. I think everyone who works here has done my nails at least once. My last gel mani with Michael lasted me more than three weeks. 

One of my last visits here, there was a group of girls celebrating a birthday on a Saturday. They drove over an hour to come start their festivities at TipToe. They even gave me a crown to keep in my car and wear whenever I am feeling down. To those ladies, I thank you. Love, Princess Nikki."
5,"The home town go to for breakfast, great food and great prices.  The servers are friendly and it feels like home.  Try the waffles and blackberry Bourbon sauce."
5,"This is probably my new favorite breakfast place.  We called and placed our order for take out, and were told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes.  They were right.  My husband had ""The Berea"" and said that the bacon was his favorite part, as it was perfectly cooked.  I had the ""Eggs Benedict Florentine,"" and without even having to ask, they put the hollandaise on the side.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly, and the turkey sausage was fantastic.  I definitely will be recommending this place to my family and friends."
5,"I loved my experience at Dee for Dentist. I was impressed my Kristen, the dental hygienist, who was very thorough and gentle as she cleaned my teeth. She was very nice and a great conversationalist. She made me comfortable and at ease. Also, I had to have a dental implant put in and the Dr. was fantastic. There was no pain and the doctor made the procedures fun and entertaining. I love this dentist office and would recommend them to anyone."
5,"My girlfriend and I love this place. The tasting bar is really nice and there's always someone sitting behind it helping out and recommending different juices. Super nice guys, great prices, and convenient location. They've even got a rewards card. My favorite juice is their Puff Butter"
5,"This practice is absolutely phenomenal. EVERYONE in the practice a pleasure to be around and they take such great care of me and my family! If I could, I would give them 6 STARS!!!"
5,"What a great pizza joint--I've had my fair share of pizza in the Valley including other Chicago based chains, and thought, how could this be any different?  Well it definitely was!  The thin crust pizza is to die for, it's crispy yet puffy and a little buttery, the sauce is the perfect mixture of sweet and spice and the sausage is brought all the way from Chicago--delicious!  The staff was super friendly and answered all of my questions when I ordered.  The pizza was made hot and fresh to order and was quickly devoured by my kids.  If you're looking for a truly unique and high quality pizza, I recommend trekking out to Gilbert, I can't wait to eat through the whole menu."
5,"Al-Hana has only gotten better over time.  The real star of the menu are the wraps, and I've found that the all time winners are chicken shawarma or the falafel.  There's just the right amount of beets and pickles and garlic sauce... absolutely awesome.

The pies are good too, and the Iraqi kebab is another favorite of mine.

If you've never had it before, get a can of Uludag Portakal from the cooler.  It's one of the best orange sodas there is.  It might be a little weird to down a Turkish soda with a Lebanese-esque wrap but it's a totally awesome combination.

Very good food at a decent price, with nice people behind the counter."
5,"Best place to come for a massage or an adjustment.  I love Dr Christoper. Best Chiropractor ever.  She really cares and listens to her patients. After a bad car accident, the place I was going to before was not helping me get better.  In just four weeks at AZ Spine Disk and Sport I am getting better by leaps and bounds. Geneva at the front desk is amazing and Cody and Mac in the therapy area are fantastic. Bree gives the best massage ever.  She is the Mozart of Massage.  I love this place! If you are in pain, these are the people to see."
5,"This is my favorite vape shop in the Las Vegas area by far.  Scott and Conrad are very knowledgeable and super helpful and friendly.  There is always a pack of guys hanging out(like any vape store) that are super cool.  They're constantly coming up with new fantastic flavors and have tons of facebook specials and giveaways all the time.  If you have an RBA you need help with, these guys will hook you up."
5,The best yogurt shop in town. Thanks for all your hard work Angie.
5,"I usually get the shawarma sandwich, it is awesome! Their garlic sauce is divine as is their hummus. Today I had the chicken shawarma plate. Juicy and tender and full of flavor. Love their little meat pies too and one must always leave room for desserts! Customer service is good."
5,"Auden Leyva has been awesome! I workout at Origins CrossFit 4-5 days a week, and my appointments with Auden have been extremely beneficial. I was barely able to lift my arm overhead from an overuse injury, and after 1 session of ART with Auden, I had major improvements. I plan to continue these maintenance sessions at least twice a month with Auden.

Nicole"
5,"If your a Browns Fan this is a place for you. Full bar food menu with selections of Chicken wings, burgers, fries, pizzas, salads. The selections of Beer, Whiskey, Vodka and Gin are decent. Kid friendly but the F word slips sometime when the Browns are losing. Looks great inside and there's plenty of seating. Taphouse!"
5,Dr. Christopher and staff are true professionals and provide excellent care for their patients. The atmosphere is fun and professional and the equipment is state of the art.  Absolutely recommend anyone to come to AZ Spine Disc & Sport.
5,Killer food and great service. Came in at end of the night and still got the same quality food and service as middle of the day. Keep it up. Burger especially cooked excellently. Would recommend rivals to anyone
5,"LISTEN UP ! I found them on yelp and my life changed! When I first walked in everyone greeted me as if I've been going there for years. When I was getting my check up the dentist ( I forgot his name ) was the nicest person ever! He made me feel like we've been friends for years ! Lol he walked and talked me through every step and he explained the steps I didn't understand, and when he explained them he didn't make me feel as if I was dumb or less than. The assistants are amazing they always greet you with the most welcoming hello !! I've been to a lot of dentist offices and this one by far is my favorite! I will stay with them for the rest of my life! They go above and beyond. They are professional, nice and they make you feel like family. I appreciate Michelle so much she is outstanding. All of you that work there are a blessing"
5,Auden is absolutely amazing! If you are looking for a massage where you lay there and go to sleep he is not your guy. But if you are looking to feel great and be stretched while having a few laughs and being relaxed he's definitely your guy! You do movements while he helps get those knots out and improves your flexibility to be able to do your everyday activities such as chasing after your kiddos or training for your next athletic event. I can't say enough about how he's helped improve my quality of life!
5,My husband and I have been coming to Puff Vapors for a while now.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They carry a wide variety of mods and other vaping necessities.   Puff also makes their own juice and they are constantly adding new flavors while still keeping their best sellers.  We love you guys!!
5,"You know you have a sustainable business with high demand when you can weather the winter, and you are an ice cream shop! Ed's Real Scoop smells ah-mazing, probably because the ice cream is made in house and so are the waffle cones. The staff are very friendly and genuinely seem to love the product and allow you to try as many flavours as you need to in order to make your near impossible decision. Each and every kind of ice cream and gelato matches its description to a tee, tastes like it sounds, no wimpy weak flavours at Ed's. Noteable favourites for me are as follows:

-Blueberry Pie ( I was told there are 2 (or was it 3?) whole blueberry pies in each batch, yumm!)

-Burnt Marshmallow, which tastes so true to it's name you have to try it to believe it. 

-Mercury Espresso, smooth java heaven

-Passionfruit gelato, wow, tangy, sweet, packing a serious passionfruit punch, plus its such a pretty yellow.

-Dark Choclate Chili gelato, spicy and chocolatey, making Myans proud.

One more that I can't include in my favourites just yet but must be mentioned is -Maple Bacon, I kid you not, its real. Note the actually bits of bacon from Rowe Farms. Tastes how it sounds, like breakfast.

Ed's has great hours so after dinner in Leslieville you can take a leisurely stroll and wind up at Ed's on a no fail dessert excursion.
They have sundaes too and lots of toppings;)"
5,"Ben B. and I visited Al-Hana after a tiresome IKEA outing and BABA-GODDAMN this stuff is YUMMY AS HELL. We nearly stuffed ourselves to capacity on the smoky babaganoush and hummus. We had the chicken shawarma and Ben had something with spiced beef in it... the name lasted on my tongue about as long as the food, can't remember it, so sorry.

Nothing over 3.99. Seriously. You must."
5,"5 stars for customer service! Cindy (?) I believe that was her name, she was a little soft spoken, but completely amazing! She spent so much time truly working on my pedicure. She massaged my legs and my feet very well. I felt amazing afterwards and very much cared for.  I did the organic pedi, and I couldn't have been more pleased. I work on my feet - and they feel better than they have in so long. I opted for a simple polish, no complaints there, I felt like they had a good selection to choose from. There were a lot of very on trend colors. Thanks again Cindy! I'll be back to see you!"
5,"I found Dee for Dentist on Yelp after suffering through a year of torture with another dentist in town.  I have had one routine cleaning and three fillings.  All the reviews are true:  this office is friendly, caring, gentle, always keeps the patient informed of possible discomfort, and punctual.

All the reviewers mentioned a great thing about Dee was ""the latest technology.""  To someone who is all too familiar with dentists I thought:  digital imaging, ability to make their own crowns, TV in each appointment room, email/text appointment reminders and all things IPad.  Yes, Dee has all these, but none of that is new, I've been to more than one dentist that does all that....the crowning jewel of this office's ""latest technology"" is the use of the Isolite.  I have never had the privilege of using one before and it is Fantastic!  This contraption is the new millennium's answer to the old dental dam.  It comfortably holds your mouth open, keeps your tounge out of the way and has built in spit suction.   I have never been so comfortable while getting fillings.

 I'm telling you, if you go anywhere else to get a filling, you're missing out!"
5,"I'm rarely disappointed when I come here, you know it's good when you can't decide on a flavour. There are plenty of times I go to other places and I can't pick a flavour for the opposite reason, because they all suck hahah

Honestly, I don't care too much about toppings and bottomings but if I did this place would be the best at it! So many options, I don't think you'd want for anything. If I do get a topping it's Mochi and theirs is always fresh and soft so yay! The place is always in spit spot condition, they are constantly cleaning and organizing which is great. 

So it's all about Yogurt Flavours for me and whether it tastes like Yogurt or not, because I'd rather it didn't, there are some that do but it's not overwhelming. They make some of them so creamy and delicious that it tastes like Ice Cream :) They also have a good variety of Tart, Sorbet type style and more Yogurty ones too. A really great variety of everything including healthier options so that everyone can enjoy! Oh and it doesn't hurt the wallet, join their loyalty program and save even more!"
5,"This wonderful restaurant inside of Baiz Market hit a home run today!  I catered a full dinner with appetizers for 35 people for an extremely reasonable price.  The food was fresh and delicious.  All of my guests raved about the food quality.  It was truly extraordinary!

Peace be upon this wonderful establishment.  I am very impressed!   Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
5,"""Do you like Middle Eastern food?"" 

This question started my impromptu tour of Cool Places I Didn't Know Existed in Phoenix.  Uh, wait... where are we?  A grocery store?  I like it!

Al-Hana is located within Baiz Market - if you didn't know that, you would probably never find it.  Walking inside, I was immediately taken with the scent of exotic spices, and the interesting combination of hookahs and religious artwork for sale.  I could have spent way longer lingering in the aisles - they have items that I haven't seen elsewhere, and at very reasonable prices. 
   
The dining area is a simple order-at-the-counter setup, with a small collection of tables and chairs.  It is easy to see that everything is made fresh on-site, since the brick oven is right behind the counter and you can watch the goodness happen.  

Ooohhh... the food...  babaghannuj with fresh pita, chicken shawarma, and adorable meat pies.  Oh yes!  The more I ate, the happier I was.  By the end, I was smiling and waving at the guys working the brick oven.  You are awesome!  Oh, and the whole table full of delights was only $12...  

Too bad I ran out of stomach real estate (and was actually stuffed for the rest of the day) - so many other things I want to try and buy...  little pies that look like pizza... baklava (OK, actually the entire dessert case in the back of the store)... and the cheese, glorious cheese!

This makes me wonder, what other hidden gems are out there, waiting to be found?"
5,Born and raised in the Chicagoland area. Tasted just like home!! It's nice to have a good Chicago style pizza in the southwest. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The owner even gave us free dessert on the house. We will definitely be visiting again! Worth the drive!
5,I cracked a tooth over the weekend and despite having no appointment I was seen within an hour. My tooth was quickly repaired in short order. Very friendly and kind staff. I highly recommend .
5,"I've seen Dr. Rudd off and on for back pain and knee pain.  He has been incredible at fixing my issues in the short term and more importantly long term.  His hours are great, he is knowledgeable, gentle and empathetic.  I've been to a couple Chiropractors and they have been good but I recommend Dr. Rudd over any of them."
5,"Absolutely love this nail salon! Elegant, spacious, and perfect for large groups. A group of girls came to get our nails done for our friend's wedding and it was very accommodating and we could all get it done together. 

Very clean nail salon, have multiple TVs, and they offer complimentary drinks for customers. I was able to get a french mani/pedi for $50. They have a great selection of colors to choose from as well. Loved getting my nails done by Tina, she was fabulous. I would highly recommend making a reservation!"
5,"I only wish we had found this place sooner!  My husband and I moved here from Michigan 5 years ago, the Middle Eastern food in MI can't be beat!  One of the things I missed the most was chicken shawarma sandwiches.  I spent almost 4 years searching for a good Middle Eastern restaurant but it seemed every restaurant I found around the Phoenix area was Persian style which I personally don't like.  

One day a friend recommended Al-Hana inside the Baiz Market.  My husband and I decided to give it a try and we were blown away!  This is how chicken shawarma should taste, and the garlic sauce is perfection.   The meat, cheese and spinach pies they sell are also incredibly good.  I think you can get a dozen for $9 or $10 dollars.  We usually buy a dozen to take home and eat them for breakfast over the next few days.  

The best part is they're located inside a Middle Eastern market so you can buy specialty items for a really great price while you're waiting for your food!  You can buy jars of tahini for less than half the price you would pay in a normal grocery store, and get specialty spices like Sumac for a very cheap price ($1.99.)

I also have to add that both of the girls that are usually behind the register are very sweet and always strike up a conversation with me, and if I ever order anything special the cook always double checks with me before making my order."
5,Deep dish with sausage and onion. Great flavor and will definitely order again.  The girl who answered the phone was professional and helpful. Already recommended the pizza to some friends tonight.  Thank u.
5,If you're looking for a midwestern style place or some pie this is the place to go.  Definitely a small town feel.  Nothing fancy here but sometimes that's just what your stomach wants!
5,"If I'm craving Middle Eastern, this is where I go.  Like so many others have noted, moving to PHX made me realize how good I had it in Michigan with an abundance of solid choices for Middle Eastern food.

The hummus rocks, as does the falafel sandwich, as do those little cheese pies!  It is all pretty reasonably priced, also.

Other randomness:  They randomly take to-go orders when the manager isn't upset that someone did a no show on a previous to-go order.  They had a laminated menu for awhile, but other than that, there is just the giant sign to try and order from.  

Love.  Go."
5,Tried the classic Açaí bowl and was so delicious!! FYI... can definitely feed 2-3 people off one!
5,The best pretzels with cheese you will ever have! The service is good and fast. I like the environment and the restaurant overall. Long Island were good!!!
5,"Best gelato outside of Europe that I ate so far. I'm craving now the hazelnut and raspberry yogurt. Fresh and creamy. They will let you sample as much as you want if you're indecisive. Little bit overpriced but that's the price of having the real thing in North America :) 
Oh and I prefer their sugar cone over the waffle and also the beach location over the Leslieville one!"
5,I no longer vape and I haven't for a few months now but decided to leave a review because of the service and quality of juice that this place provides. My personal favorite was the bomb pop but I have never have had a juice from Puff that I didn't like and have easily walked out of there with more than half of them. Awesome little shop!
5,"This is a Nice Cozy Cafe.. Warm Waitress made me andd Husbands first time there special ,can tell she haf regulars.. The food Was awesome, service was great, prices are what to be expected for breakfast.. Warning to small eaters.. I ordered the two pancakes!!!! OMG took up my whole plate that is how BIG they were.But they were very yummy took the leftovers home.. Will be back.. I love finding little gems hidden..And cannot wait to try her famous pies..will have to come for lunch or dinner.. Thank you"
5,"AZ Spine Disc and Sport is amazing!! My husband and I both come here and we love it, and love everyone who works there! Especially Dr. Rudd who is a rock star. I have had ""treatment"" in the past from a few different places for my lower back, but this place had exceeded my expectations! They do so much more than just the normal adjustments. There is so much more involved, and they really do care. I have learned so much about my body since I started coming here! Love them!!!"
5,"So let me premise this post by saying that I have never received such a high quality of genuine customer care from a nail salon before. 

I came in last Friday for a mani/pedi after reading the raving yelp reviews, skeptical of how my manicure would turn out. (I have very thin, weak, short nails and the kind of work I do definitely does not help.) I received a beautiful pedicure followed by my first opi dip manicure - both nail techs did a wonderful job and I left a completely satisfied customer, excited to return for my next visit. 

Fast forward to this morning (a week after my initial appointment) where I accidentally ripped my right pointer fingernail off. I called tiptoe salon in a panic, and Michael patiently listened as I tried to explain what happened. He kindly offered several options to fix my broken nail (a problem that I created/was my fault NOT theirs) and told me that I could come on to get it fixed that same morning! 

I am honestly so pleasantly surprised/impressed and truly grateful to have found such an amazing salon with the most kind-hearted, dedicated, understanding and all-around incredible staff! Thank you tiptoe salon for all that you do! I wish I could award more than 5 stars!! 

If you're looking for the best place to get your nails done, where the staff actually cares and really takes care of you - look no farther and book an appointment at tiptoe salon! You won't be disappointed!"
5,Best Chicago Pizza in the East Valley!  I grew up on the south side and they definitely nailed the sausage and sauce!  Call ahead to pick up pizza and confirm what you order as well as time to pick it up....the place is crazy busy.
5,"We enjoy going to rivals! Food is great, lots of variety and never disappointed. Everything is great from entrees to burgers. There is always a drink special going on to enjoy."
5,"Dr Chavira is amazing! He's very friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and cares about your well-being. He explains everything in a way that's easy to understand and wants to make sure you are feeling better. I highly recommend him as a chiropractor!"
5,"Thank you so much for opening in such a convenient location!  Close enough to enjoy, but far enough from my house so that I don't eat this everyday!

I have so far only had the chance to enjoy their gelato, because it looks so damn smooth!  The flavours are absolutely divine!  I've tried mango, pina colada, raspberry and dark chocolate.  My favourite is the dark chocolate.  I love how they allow you to ask for half scoops of stuff!  

I got the regular size one time but it was too big, so the next time I got the junior size and it was perfect.  The service is friendly and quick.  I wish there are more seats, but I'm a happy camper regardless of whether I eat my ice cream standing up or sitting down.  Hey, I guess if I'm standing I burn more calories and get to eat more ice cream right?  I know, not really... but that's okay, I'll just keep believing that."
5,"Had an amazing experience when I went here with a local friend. She hadn't been before, but I suspect she'll be going back! This salon looks like a hole in the wall, but once you pass through the cashier and waiting area, it opens up into a huge space with tons of high-quality pedicure stations and a long bar for manicures. My friend and I did pedicures, and I upgraded mine to shellac. It was a wonderful, relaxing experience, and the polish was expertly-done, which I can't say of most of the pedicures I've had. The staff was all super friendly, which is a huge bonus, and I got a complimentary Coke with my service. This place is definitely worth checking out if you're in Charlotte."
5,"Walked into a large testing session so this place was a HAZE! The front door was rightfully wide open as you could hardly see through the cloud. My friend and I met Scott, the owner, who was very knowledgeable and friendly. I live nearby and first impressions mean a lot when you are buying any sort of products in person and I was impressed with the employee i dealt with, the owner, the selection and the layout. So far the best price I have found on 28g wire and wick also. Didn't have the time to sample any of the in-house juices, but I will be back!"
5,"Everyone in this office has a genuine concern for their patients! My first visit was amazing. My hygienist, Kristen, was so detail oriented and extremely thorough. She took all of my X-rays and pics and gave me one of the best cleanings I've ever had. Dr. Browne was also great! He spent so much time with me going over my X-rays and addressing all of my questions and concerns. Dr. Dee also stopped in to see me and to make sure my visit was going well. Their office is very high tech and clean. Everyone is professional and truly cares about their patients. They went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and they provided great dental care and service. I HIGHLY recommend this office to anyone looking for a great dentist in Las Vegas! You will be in great hands!!"
5,"Dr. Vicente Chavira (Dr. Vic!) is fantastic! I have seen him off and on for years and I have to say it the most effective chiropractors I've ever encountered. He is patient, precise, and persistent. Really, what more could I ask for. He takes his time to make sure my pain is addressed thoroughly; there is never a rush. He provides advice on how to prevent future pain. And, his bedside manner is just above and beyond most doctors. I cannot recommend him more highly!"
5,Dr love is awsome. He took his time and explained my condition to me and my wife. He told us what to expect moving forward he also explained my options in detail.  He did not force a prescription on me and send me on my way. He made sure we knew all of our options and he helped us make a informed decision on my next stage of treatment. If your are in pain and you are truly in need of help. Look know further.
5,"My experience with dentists have been bad for many many years. Most dentists usually destroy my mouth and make my gums feel like they have just gone though a blender; however, Dr. Meevasin is one who does not fit this description.

She is very gentle on the gums when she cleans, at first my gums bled from my poor brushing, but she referred me to use a sonicare and now I never bleed from my cleanings anymore. I love getting my teeth cleaned from Dr. Meevasin because I get the same clean feeling without all of the pain.

The whole office, itself, makes you feel welcomed when you enter. They have tea and coffee in the waiting room for you in MUGS! Honestly, I've never seen a dental office that actually takes the initiative to clean each mug every customer drinks out of. That is customer service at its greatest. 

All in all, this office is as good as it gets. If you want a reliable, professional, friendly dentist then you are in luck."
5,"Just off the 10 freeway in Phoenix, past the Cheech n Chong looking chop-shop, beyond the unsavory, indigent-from-poor-decisions addict looking for a quick fix, ahead of the prison like barbwire engulfing the area, a little further then ""Alamo (and yes, probably a bullet hole or many) Beer & Wine"" quick shop, rests an unseemly building: Baiz Market. 

The inside of this establishment is not any better so disregard any hackneyed phrases--""don't judge a book by it's cover""--for now. There is a lite smell reminiscing one of there grandparents cold, dark, musty cellar; and do not expect a warm greeting like the one received from former-convicts at the entrance way of Fry's. The floors match the smell, looking like they have taken a fifty or sixty year beating; and, yes, on the non-perishable items there is some dust. But their ripe produce, tasty deserts, just-chopped meats are definitely worth the trip; also within this repelling at first hub for commodities, sits an eatery to the left from the entrance: Al Hana, the orgasm in your mouth.  

Once free of unfavorable feelings, casually walk (nothing to fear, unless you are afraid of rockin' taste) over to the counter of Al Hana's; and order some unforgettable Mediterranian cuisine. We recommend the Shafta or the Shwarma (beef or chicken) with the garlic sauce, wow! Their pitas are made fresh in the ""red-brick"" (you'll get it later; but you have to try it) oven; their hummus tastes how really Hummus should. Also, try their pies (basically pita pizza)--cheese or meat. 

Everything we ate--shafta, shwarma, hummus with a grip of pita, 1 large cheese pie, 1 small meat pie, a can of pineapple soda (with really sugar) and a can of grape soda (also not corn syrup)--totaled to only $17.46. True story. So word to the wise, let go, try it, wolf-down a shafta or shwarma pita burrito (for only $4.99 each) because haste does not lack taste. 

Side note: their saffron is $24 for 4.5g (best deal around here we have seen)."
5,I highly recommend this place! The service was amazing! Scott and Randy overloaded me with info on vaping. I am new to vaping and they steered me into the right direction. They were not in a rush to make a sale and they genuinely want the customer to be satisfied and to become regulars. I will going back for sure!
5,"Great team of professionals, they all work well together to assist their patients with their needs. Dr Stone was attentive, he listened well, answered questions & explained his diagnosis. Have had Ryan in the PT area, Naomi for massage therapy and am starting chiropractic care. They have all been super in their practice of their profession."
5,We went here 15 minutes before closing when alot of businesses aren't really wanting you to walk in but the employees greeted us and asked if we needed to taste anything to just let them know. My son and I had the raspberry pomegranate...it was tart and delicious. Definitely be back.
5,BEST breakfast and bloody Mary's around! Also highly recommend dinner there too! Their chips and dip are great with a beer on the patio in the summer!
5,"I'm writing this update on Al-Hana to let everyone know they've made some changes recently and for the BEST! 

The Baiz Market is pretty much the same.  It's a wonderful Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food market and THE BEST place to buy olives, oils, middle eastern spices and pita bread!!  2 for $1and it's fresh daily! 

Al-Hana~ ""take a deep inhale as you enter the Baiz market, awe...."" It's the same wonderful aroma and quality of food but they've made some changes to their menu.  Yes, that's right I said menu.  They have menu's now!  They are nicely done with full color pics of most dishes so no more guessing and no need for an interrupter!

Their dishes have changed.  They've added rice to most of their dishes at no extra charge. In fact they lowered their prices on a lot of things and changed up a lot of their entries to include rice, hummus and garlic sauce! 

The chicken and beef schawarma are both some of the best in town but I prefer the Shish Taook ~ two huge skewers of grilled to perfection chicken seasoned in taook spices on top of a large bed of seasoned and delicious rice served with hummus, mixed pickles, tomatoes and their garlic sauce.  It is a HUMONGOUS plate full of tasty goodness that comes with two fresh pitas on top.  It's enough food for two people, people!  So be ready to share.  Their garlic sauce and hummus are as good or better than anyone else's their Shish Taook will leave you wanting!

I also recommend getting some of their small meat, cheese or cheese with spinach pies, the small square ones that are folded, heated for an appetizer and share a plate of hummus.  Their small pies are full of flavor and the pie dough is awesome!! 

Plan to par-ooze the market while you wait for your food.  Skip the pepsi coolers near the Al-Hana counter for your beverage and pick a beverage from the large coolers on the first aisle leading back to the produce.  This is where you'll find just about anything and everything from the middle east to drink.  Yes!

They still have the same wonderful team of two guys cooking and the young lady running 100 MPH taking orders and serving everyone all at once.  They have made some fantastic changes and they one of THE BEST places to go for your Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food fixes.  I hope to see you there!"
5,"Love, love, LOVE! The Mango Tango ice cream is my savior. I spent 10 years of my life down in The Beaches, and Ed's MAKES the Beach. The humble little store makes their own ice cream with quality care, and trust, the difference is there. Once you have a scoop, you'll forever feel guilty if you should ever eat any other ice cream. Okay, maybe with the exception of emergency Hagen Daaz."
5,"The yogurt is fantastic and the service is even better!  If you're not a yogurt fan, the sorbet is awesome! Would definitely go again!"
5,"These guys are so good that I don't want to eat Ben & Jerry's anymore.  Turned me into a freakin' icecream snob.

Best Flavours:  Apple Pie, Coffee Toffee Almond Crunch

And there is only one way to have it, and it is on one of their fine in-house made fresh waffle cones.

Marshmellow on the bottom of the cone to plug the drippings?  That is professional."
5,Excellent doctor!!!Very thorough and caring. I'm terribly afraid of the dentist and she's very sensitive to that and goes the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. Love her and her staff!
5,"Had breakfast with the husband and we both loved our meals! I had eggs Benedict  (added spinach) and he had the Sweet and Savory. Holandaise was delicious, bacon was perfect. The server was sweet and attentive and the place is very cute, even has a two sided fireplace to have a drink and a snack by."
5,"I highly recommend Tina Tretter, NP-C. Came to see her with some health concerns and she was awesome. Took the time to not only do a full exam but also talk to me and listen to my concerns. Very knowledgeable in her field, very sweet and easy to talk to. If you are reading this and need a PCP go see Tina. You will not regret it and will have a new primary care provider that you can count on."
5,"I travel all over and it is hard to find a great local sports bar with equally great food. Rivals; however, is the exception!  The food was fresh, prepared to order, and bursting with flavor.

The jumbo shrimp app was a perfect starter. I followed it with The Clevelander Steak: an 8oz fire grilled sirloin with sautéed mushrooms, onion, and garlic!  It was cooked perfectly. 

If you are in the area, check it out! You will not be disappointed!!"
5,"One of the best! Fantastic staff, and lovely Dr. Dee care for patients passionately. Extremely clean environment with top of the line technology."
5,"Well, where do I start! Allow me to give a brief description of myself. Growing up I was not fortunate enough to go to regular dental checkups. As a young adult I needed a root canal back in Texas , and that one visit was my only visit to a dentist. Moving to Las Vegas years later I was blessed enough to (thanks to you, Patty)be treated by Dr. Dee! What can I say, she's amazing! I've had to have several work done and not once have I had a bad experience! It's not too often one finds such a knowledgeable person with such humility! I've been witness to conversations between her and her assistants and it's obvious that not only is she a fantastic doctor with incredible knowledge of dentistry and a passion for it, but she's quite a woman!! Once you go to Dee for Dentist you'll walk out happy that you did!! 

Suzanne C."
5,"I dropped in for my first visit on a Thursday at lunchtime without an appointment and was immediately seated. I tend to stick to regular manicures instead of gel, and my manicurist was fabulous! She was very thorough and it was one of the best manicures ever. Two weeks later and it had barely chipped. On top of that, it was only $15! What a steal. I will definitely be returning to try out the pedicures."
5,Ryan is a great employee. Today I went in and purchased a mod to replace my broken one. I got it and after playing with it at home I didn't like it. So then I went back to puff and explained to him why I didn't like it. He willingly swapped out the device for a better one and on top of that gave me a box of free coils for the new mod. I've been going to this shop for years and it's for reasons like this. Their customer service always exceeds expectations thus why I recommend all of my friends to this shop. Thanks again Ryan. This green Smok pen is just what I was looking for.
5,Best vape shop in las Vegas hands down
5,LOVES IT!!! always great. wont go anywhere else for my froyo... and we live 15 mins away ;)
5,"If you're a wing lover, you can't go wrong here.  They have 25 varieties the last time I visited.  This place is ALWAYS packed!  The prices and service are good.  It's in a cool little location.  They even serve breakfast.  A great choice for a Sunday morning Bloody Mary and breakfast to help you bite the dog that bit you the night before.  The atmosphere is awesome!"
5,"I just went here for the first time and had an awesome experience. Everybody was friendly, the salon was way more spacious than I thought just from looking at the outside, the technician did a great job, and they gave me a glass of wine and even let me charge my phone right where I was sitting! So convenient and fairly priced."
5,I work down the street at ecowash and I was told this was the best vapor shop by far by a guy named troy.  He gave me a puff vapors card and said to come down and I'll get hooked up with the best vapor device for my current needs.  Thanks troy and I'll be heading down to your shop on my next payday.  And fyi  Ecowash is the best car wash in the entire city I do believe.
5,I am THRILLED to have such a high quality vapor store by my house!  Their liquids are AWESOME and they don't add alcohol!  Their staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. The store is chic and clean. I highly recommend their Red Vines flavor. Delish!!!!
5,While on my journey to find the perfect vape I stopped at 2 places before Puff Vapors.  They were by far the most helpful and such a great selection.  They let me try any flavor I wanted to make sure I was happy with everything.  This is my first time starting this so they really went out of there way to make sure I had everything I needed and I was extremely happy with all my flavors.  I will definitely be back for more items.  Thanks again!!!!
5,"This is actually my first Yelp review. After strongly considering leaving poor reviews for some other vape stores in town, my experience at Puff Vapors compelled me to just write this glowing one instead.

I  originally purchased a clone from Puff Vapors, and attempted to have it built at some other vape shops due to Puff not having the specific atomizer I was looking for. There was an issue with the clone (faulty spring) that prevented it from working with the setup I was looking for. I brought the clone back in, and after they were unable to get it working, was immediately offered store credit or for them to order me a new one. After basically being told ""Sorry bro it's a shitty clone"" a few times, it was awesome to have a store actually try to remedy the problem, and allowing me to return it was of course great. 

I stopped back in another morning to ask some questions and get a new build on my atomizer. They had just opened for the day, and every single employee chimed in on my questions and gave me some good advice as they went about their morning. I ended up with a great build that blew away the other 2 I had done in Vegas, free of charge none the less. 

I'm pretty set on my vaping supplies, but when the time comes I won't consider giving my business to anyone else."
5,"I've had the opportunity to be treated by a number of the awesome providers at AZSDS and I must say I was super impressed, figuring I have a ton of issues.  The chiropractic treatments were so much more than just a sit or lay here, adjustment, and a ""thanks and see you later"".   The entire experience consisted of a comprehensive exam, X-Rays, e-STIM, soft tissue work (ART specifically), and THEN the actual manual adjustment which made my lower back pain go away completely.

I also received treatment from Jody Murray, the office's Acupuncturist and Athletic Trainer, which was another awesome experience.  Since I've never had acupuncture done to me before, I was unsure of what to expect.  Needless to say, I will be going back.  Jody conducted an examination on me prior to treatment using a neat little device that gave a detailed report on areas of my body that were not functioning at optimal levels and highlighted issues that I hadn't even told her about yet.  After the treatment, for the first time in I couldn't tell you how long, I actually felt like my feet and lower body were connected to the ground and ""on"".  Later that day I went to workout and felt like a whole new person.  Would highly recommend meeting with Jody.  

The PT department was also great.  I learned a ton of what my body was NOT doing and the compensations that I had created to make up for weak and non functioning parts of my body.  Being an avid lifter, I thought that I had pretty good control of my body, but apparently not so much (thanks Dr. Whipple).  And the best part; I actually saw the PT unlike so many other offices that I've been to in the past.  

Over all, AZSDS is a great office.  If you're looking to relieve pain and get back on the right track, I would highly recommend it."
5,"Dr. Christopher is the best!  I have been to chiropractors all over the valley and Dr. Christopher is the only one to really become determined to help me find the source of my pain.  I have scar tissue, car accidents and liposuction behind me, all of which have caused problems over the years.  I am doing so much better finally!  We are working on strengthening so that I can become strong and out of pain, no other chiropractor has ever done this!  Plus her staff rocks!!!  Give her a try, she is smart as a whip and will do all she can to help you!!!"
5,"I signed up with a fitness coach for the first time ever. I just thought maybe, after 20+ years of dedicated exercising on my own, I might learn something new and benefit by an expert's advice. Best decision I've made in a long time! Daniel Chanko is an exercise physiologist and definitely knows what he is doing. I've been seeing him weekly for two months. He has a great style, starting by discussing my goals with me. No judging, no pushing. Just consistent, sincere support. Daniel works with me one-on-one. He's always encouraging and his enthusiasm when I reach a new level of strength or flexibility is obviously genuine. The work-out area is clean and set up with all the equipment anyone could need. As opposed to intimidating, it's motivating. I'm having lots of fun and feel so good knowing I'm doing something important for myself: improving my health. Thank you, Daniel, and AZ Spine Disc & Sport!"
5,"So much more than a coffee cafe. Super friendly staff, nice atmosphere,  and great food at a great price.  Everything we've ever tried has been delicious!  They use top quality ingredients and it shows. Open,  clean,  and inviting with a fireplace."
5,"Since I'm a writer/editor by trade I've been wracking my brain for weeks trying to think of a description that would do justice to this excellent, family-run dental practice. But the best I can do is just recommend that if you're looking for a personable, professional, and price-competitive dentist here in Las Vegas, stop reading my blather right now and give Dee for Dentist a call.

Dr. Dee Dee and her staff bring the most up-to-date techniques and resources to this practice, as well as a sincere appreciation of and consideration for her patients. (My wife is the world's most dental-phobic human, yet Dee Dee has found a way to set her at ease.)

Dr.Dee Dee's husband, Mike, runs the office, which is tasteful and comfortable with beverages available (and offered when you sit down), along with WiFi, and Netflix in every room! (Like me, Mike is a TechHead.)

Furthermore, this is one dental office that doesn't have any promotional advertising littering the walls, a common and unwanted aspect of SO MANY dental practices these days. (I can ""forgive"" the Sensodyne toothpaste in the waiting room because it has Dee Dee's picture ON THE BOX!! Cool.)

In those ad-ridden offices where the signage urged me to brace-this or whiten-that, I felt like a walking dollar sign as I came through the door.

At Dee For Dentist, I walk through the door and feel like family.

I'm sure you will, too."
5,"I haven't visited their location yet but I've tried Frosted Dew, Bomb Pop and a few others,  they sell it at the Silverton Hotel and Casino.  I normally don't take a chance on Liquids without trying it but I was out late and needed a fill.  I'm glad I did!  Great juices Puff Vapors!"
5,Really good stuff. Authentic. Wide variety of food on offer. The staff is small so sometimes they can get really busy and you see the staff working really hard right there. The restaurant makes the knefah dessert right there so it's fresh (and good) - very few restaurants make their own.
5,"Probably the cleanest eating establishment in the entire Valley, it's obvious when you walk in that somebody CARES enough to make it this way! From the people working there, to the yogurt, to the toppings and fresh fruit (which some of the other places have discontinued due to cost), it's all five stars all the way. The tart apple and some others have me going in almost every day. The slightly higher cost per ounce than some other places is offset by their ""loyalty card"" which gives you back $3 after eight purchases, so the cost is not a biggie.....and.......you'll be back, I'm sure.
Nobody even comes close to this total package, and it shows. Great job guys!!!!!!!!!"
5,Finally REAL pizza!  The sauce and sausage taste just like Chicagoland! Thanks for coming to Arizona!
5,I drive across town to get my regular cleanings here. The staff is great and professional. The environment is clean and inviting.  Definitely been happy since I started coming here.
5,"First ""Vape"" Store in southwest.  About time!  Prices are cheap and competitive!  Good selection of products - They keep adding more every time I go there.  

Awesome selection of e-juice flavors!  Staff is very friendly and informative!"
5,"One of the best places to get your nails done. I'm always taken care of from the moment I step in the door until the moment I'm stepping out great polish choices, best price for a GREAT gel mani every time (no appointment),no wait during the day and these are just a few reasons why I definitely recommend TipToe the staff is great and treats you like family from the first appointment. Great Plazamidwood location !!!"
5,"For some reason every time I come to Arizona I NEED together froyo...must be the heat! 

Yogurtology is conveniently located in a plaza near Safeway and the decor is pretty similar to all other froyo places. What set it apart for me was the section in the back with cookies, brownies, and other goodies that they suggest you put on the bottom of your yogurt cup. I had a brownie under my oatmeal cookie froyo and it was delicious! Yogurtogy also has a wide variety of toppings and even has baklava which I've never seen as a topping before. I got one just so I could eat it separately and it was great!

Five stars for the great flavors and for adding a little twist to the froyo fad!"
5,I have been going to Dr.Christopher for the past few weeks and couldn't be happier. My pain is getting better and better with each visit. They listen to everything you have to say and target your pain areas everytime. They have a very open and flexible schedule and the front desk staff is very accommodating. All of the staff that has worked on me have been friendly and attentive. I'm so happy that I choose to come to this office it has been nothing but a pleasure. The office is always clean and always has clean bathrooms too. I had to bring the kiddos with me for one appointment and they were so sweet and so helpful. They brought them coloring books and answered their 100 questions about all the equipment. Thank you guys for making every visit great.
5,"The best pizza I've tasted, the bartenders are super knowledgeable ask them for the perfect beer from their huge selection to pair with your pizza. 
Other highlights included the Caesar salad, the pappardelle bolognese, the arancini served with their amazing tomato sauce, and the Saluki and cheese selection.
If your in the area do yourself a favor and stop in for dinner and if your not in the area totally worth the trip."
5,"Never been to a Waffle House until today and I am impressed. The two women who worked here are friendly and courteous! I was about to order to go but there was no need as my All Star meal was cooked in less than 5 minutes and delicious. Hash Browns are unique here as they are mixed with other things like mushrooms, onions, ham and cheese. I did that and put my eggs on top (Very delicious). Also it us the WAFFLE HOUSE you should get WAFFLES there too. All of this and a soda for less than $16 with tip. I highly recommend."
5,"We bring our two dogs (German Shepherd and Golden Retriever) here all the time! Usually on the weekends, we drive 45 min just to come here!
We love it & so do our pups!
Great drink deals too!
Kiddie pools in the summer to keep your pup nice and cool!
Great atmosphere! but you MUST be a dog lover!
Never seen a fight or anything. Sometimes you see one or two dogs trying to boss around others (there is a grey pitbull, that I think belongs to an employee that always does that) but nothing serious. 
Wish there was one of these closer to Gastonia/Kings Mountain!"
5,"Evolve Wellness Spa provides exceptional service! If you're seeking spa services, Evolve Wellness Spa should be on the top of your list! Book your appointment today! You'll be glad you did!"
5,Tried this place out on the recommendation of a friend. WOW! What a find! Lots of great choices on the menu & the food is delicious. Generous portions for a reasonable price. Nice place!
5,"As a Healthcare professional, I have received many massages in my lifetime. I can honestly say that EVERY massage therapist that I have seen at Evolve has been wonderful! There is just something so great about a massage therapist that asks for and listens to your feedback. 
The atmosphere is also wonderful. The place is beautiful, calming, and always smells great. I'll definitely be going back!"
5,"This is my favorite dog bar in the area! I miss living closer to it. The staff is super nice, and atmosphere is very laid back. My dog has a blast here. It's wonderful!"
5,"Tried again and this time we had good service!The atmosphere and service was great as well as the food. It's a very nice location with lots of variety. Langtree is a great area and it's nice
To have a pizza place close to our house."
5,This place has made a complete 360 from the previous owners! Had a delicious steak shawarma with fries and some excellent hummus. Their baklava was also amazing! Service was very friendly and attentive and the prices were very reasonable. They even have a discount for students. Will definitly be back!
5,"Conveniently located across the street from the Wynn Resort in the Fashion Mall, this joint is hands down the number one lunch spot for me.  After a heavy night drinking and partying, what's better than to fill up again with a cold pitcher of black raspberry sangria and small plate-size tapas to re-energize yourself for another round at the pool or craps table.  The menu is quite extensive and divided into cold and hot dishes.  I recommend the following:

HOT DISHES:
-Chicken and chorizo sausage skewers (this is the bomb)
-Squid a la plancha with olive oil and garlic (dip your table bread in this oil as well)
-Roasted dates wrapped in bacon (this is a must have)
-Fried padron peppers and course salt

COLD DISHES:
-Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego cheese
-Roast eggplant salad with goat cheese
-House marinated olives

DESSERT:
-You have to try the almond and banana ice cream desserts....and I don't care how full you are cuz they cost almost nothing and are damn good!

I came here one night to have the paella and thought it was good but nothing to get excited about.  I recommend you order the tapas items I suggested above instead if it's your first time.

The website includes the full menu if you want to explore for yourself:

5,"Coffee is exponentially better than Starbucks, Peet's, etc.  And the food is very solid for breakfast, even beyond their donuts.

Everything is done with a great attitude.  Call out to JOE C., who is friendly and super efficient.  Also, a killer name for someone who works in the coffee industry."
5,Pizza was excellent....reminded me of when I was in Italy.  The salad was delicious and the portions perfect.  The service was phenomenal and the decor exceptional.  Will definitely return.
5,hands down my favorite place. im from Chihuahua and this place is the closest it gets to tortas down there. everything is authentic which is what we are needing in the valley. the paquime and milanesa are amazing. the aguas frescas are just like in mexico. I honestly have nothing but nice things to say about this place.
5,The Italian dishes are just wonderful. I love dipping the garlic bread in all the extra marinara sauce they give you! Go on a weekend and ask for Harry. He will treat you right!
5,"As a guy getting a wax, it's really hard to find a good place. But let's be serious those straggler hairs on your back are worse. This salon is extremely clean, and modern. The owner is extremely accomodating, and got me in for a same day appt. Level of friendliness was outrageous. That said it's not an in your face type of place, quite the opposite. Calm and serene. Not every dude wants to be seen going in to get a wax (I used to care) and you could just pop in here and out and no one would ever be the wiser. It's a touch pricier than my old place, but well worth the money and they do an awesome job. Thanks, I'll definitely be back!"
5,"I would return to Montreal just to eat at this restaurant. The food and service are excellent. We had breakfast here the second day of our trip and each day thereafter because it was that good. Whether it was the lobster benedict, lobster omelet, American breakfast, steak and eggs, high rise pancakes, s'mores French toast, coffee, cappuccino, cafe au lait, espresso...everything we ordered was delicious and brought quickly and with a smile. 

While all our servers were quick, courteous and efficient, Xuan was a standout with his outgoing personality. Another server could see that we were tourists and offered us walking maps of Old Montreal. 

There is more than one location in Montreal; I can only hope one day one will open in New York City."
5,Have been eating there since college in the early 80s. Have always gotten sandwiches till just recently. Pizza is good but I'm more of a sandwich lover.  Beef sandwich has always been a big winner!  Love this place!
5,"If you are craving for some shrimps and crabs...this is the place to go. I go here all the time with my family and the place has all the chinese menu you can think of. The salad is great and the fruits. Very tasty pineapples on the side. For all the food you will be eating...it's worth the price.
That only thing I noticed is that the floor is kinda needs some attention. Like...vacuum or sweep it up..."
5,Stephanie is amazing! So thankful to her for rescuing my skin. Everyone at Evolve is super nice. Great service & great atmosphere. Highly recommend!
5,This place is awesome! I'm a regular and a huge fan! Hibachi Place and regular buffet bars all have great options and hibachi is included! Sushi selections are great too with sashimi! So many types of fresh fruits in the desert bar! All for a very reasonable price!
5,"This is literally my favorite place on earth. I started brining Rocky when I first got him a year ago. I try to bring my pup at least 2-3 time a week. The owner and staff are so so friendly and I love the small atmosphere. Though they don't sell food, there are so many restaurants around you can grab a bite and bring it back. The parking isn't the best but honestly I don't mind it one bit. I trust this place more than the dog park."
5,I have got to Kerri for a year for waxing and she does an amazing job!  The spa is very peaceful and everyone is super friendly!
5,"We went here Thursday for some evening drinks and entertainment. They have great drink specials and no cover on Thursdays. If you get there a bit earlier (like somewhere between 7 and 10), the music is a bit better. The music is great....I love dueling piano bars. They usually bring out the full band with a guitar and drum player. 

Love this place."
5,"My wife and I ate lunch there. 

She had the Torta Paquime and it was really good. The pork and avocado were the stars of this simple tasty sandwich.

I had the Torta Ahogada with spicy red chile sauce. It was really good and super nice flavors."
5,"When I first moved to Vegas I yelped this place and I'm glad I did because this is the best Middle Eastern food I've had for their prices. I'm very picky since my family makes the same dishes but this place is so good it reminds me of home. I've become a regular now and I like this place so much I decided to write my first yelp review. I love their lunch specials. They have awesome lamb, beef, and chicken kabobs. I always got to get their rose water tea when I'm there. The owner or manager there is so friendly and always makes sure my order comes out great. This is by far my favorite place in Vegas off the strip! Oh ya and no large crowds so I could enjoy my food in peace without a long wait to get my order! I just had lunch their today 10 min. ago and now I'm ready to start my day!"
5,"Had a wonderful dinner with my out of town work team here on 8/22. Atmosphere was charming, food was great (pizza and salads). Relaxed and fun experience. Everyone enjoyed themselves and left full. Realized today (a week later) I forgot to pick up the detailed receipt for dinner and the amazing staff was able to pull it up for me and text me a photo. I'll be back when I'm in town again. Great dinner and customer service. Thank you!"
5,"Very modern looking and ""eggcellent"" food and service. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and the food was very filling and tasty. I especially liked leaving the restaurant not overly full."
5,"Great food and even better service.  Located just a couple blocks from the Notre Dame Basilica a quick check of Yelp had us on our way.  As this is a chain, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was really impressed.  To be honest what moved the needle to a 5 star review of this place was our waiter.  I wish I could remember his name because quite simply he kicked ass in every respect.  He was quick with getting us drinks, and answered any questions we had on the menu as well as provided us with some recommendations.  In addition he offered up the WiFi password since we were on our phones searching out where we were going to explore that day.  He then proceeded to bring over a small map and give us some ideas as well as helped us with the times some places were open.  Over the top GREAT service!!!  

On to the food.  I had the High Rise Pancakes which consists of three Pancakes with bacon and sausage between each layer along with a side of their home fried potatoes.  My wife went with the Eggs Benedict and my daughter Pancakes and bacon.  Everything came out nice and hot.  The Pancakes were nice and fluffy, the bacon thick cut and the sausage delicious.  Pretty much a perfect diner'esque experience s to start off our day.  Luckily we did a lot of walking that day to help offset that carb bomb I so happily consumed!"
5,Hilarious.  It's like you're drinking in a live action youtube video.
5,"I highly recommend Evolve Wellness Spa. 

I have repeatedly seen Nora for massages. She is amazing! I always feel completely relaxed and rejuvenated after receiving a treatment from her. 

The spa atmosphere is awesome. The lobby area feels upscale but homey at the same time. The background music is soothing and enjoyable. Moreover, the staff are very professional and helpful. 

The spa also often give out great deals for a variety of treatments. I think I have yet to pay full price for a massage because I keep getting coupons from them. 

I have tried many other spas in the area, this one is by far the best."
5,"For those of us who actually enjoy breakfast, will love this spot! I've personally never had a complaint. The staff is incredible and super on point with service. The food is ALWAYS hot and fresh and very quick. I mean I usually come here for breakfast, however they do have a lunch menu as well. Although I've only tried a handful of items on the menu, my experience here is always at its best!"
5,"This place had delicious food and the waitress was very friendly. 
I ordered the French toast and it was out of this world."
5,"Evolve Wellness Spa is beyond professionally and truly a representation of what I look for in high quality spa. Having traveled to many spas in Pittsburgh and across the world, I highly recommend my own clients there due to my experiences at Evolve Wellness Spa and especially as a professional hair designer in the industry."
5,Don't mind the area friends.  This is a great authentic spot to get a Torta.  They have a large selection of Aqua frescas and baked goods.  Tacos are delicious as well.
5,"I'm giving it 5 stars because the place has so much potential. We went in November and it was slammed.  The people playing the pianos were really talented and played music everyone likes.  It would have been better if we'd gotten there earlier and could have sat at a table.  Next time I'm in town we'll go back there for sure.  This is coming from an early 30's white chick, but the crowd was all ages and lots of fun."
5,Great overall atmosphere. Had a great time last night. Need to get some more bar tenders but otherwise no complaints.
5,"I made a reservation here for my sister's bachelorette party and it was incredible! The musicians brought her on stage twice, along with our whole bridal party. They played every song we requested (and are very talented!). Everyone was dancing and singing along. I had been worried about the crowd on a Thursday, but there were a lot of really fun people there and the Howl staff were fun and welcoming!  Highly recommend!"
5,The atmosphere is very serene and relaxing. The staff was very professional and my massage was worth every penny. Fantastic experience! I hope to be back soon! :)
5,"I have been going to Evolve for almost 5 years and have never had a negative experience. The staff is gracious, professional, and extremely competent. 
I am a Helen junkie for her energy based massages. She is always able to take me from grumpy to happy in 90 minutes. 
She was unavailable yesterday when I was desperate for bodywork so I chose Kalina. 
Wow!
This woman can really deliver. Sounds bad...it's not that sort of massage spa. What I mean is that she can work specific muscle groups and destroy tension and tightness like no ones business. She spent 90 minutes on my upper body and left no stone unturned. Her techniques are solid and she can accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. 
She's my ""new best friend""."
5,"Stopped here on our way out of LV. Service was friendly, smiley and helpful. He ordered a lot of food and iced coffee. All our donuts and bagel sandwiches were soft and soooo fresh tasting. Coffee was rich, creamy and perfect. Facility was clean and comfortable. Bookmarked this location so we know to come back the next time we visit!"
5,"BEST PLACE ON EARTH.  

Owner and bartenders are amazing!... I always have THE BEST time when I am there with my pup!"
5,"The service is always friendly and pleasant. I've never really have to wait for a seat... I like the bat area the most it's were all the action takes place... the food is amazing... first time I came I thought ""that's not enough food"" oh, YES it is... more than enough and at a fair price... I have made this my new breakfast spot no matter what time of the day it is ... you should come check them out if you're in the area!!"
5,"Puppies and Hop Drop and Roll... I was in heaven. 

We saw this bar while we were walking around exploring the cool neighborhood of NODA. We decided to check it out even though we didn't have our puppy with us. It was so fun. We had so much fun sitting in the big chairs on the outdoor patio, playing with the dogs that put a big smile on our face. Of course, the bar smells like a place would with 20 dogs running around, but owners are really great about cleaning up after their furbabies. Happy dogs, happy owners. Can't wait to go back, this time with my dog. She'll love it."
5,"I went to Charlotte NC to visit my family. We were told about Howl at the Moon. It was AMAZING AMAZING. The Entertainers / Singers/  Did it all. They played piano drums guitar sang. It was truly spectacular I was in AWE.  Thank You Rani for all your help and Tickets. I will be back many times from Florida and will tell many people about Howl at the Moon. Trent I believe was one of the singers he was so great with the crowd then again they all were. I will be going to Orlando to visit my son and will definitely stop by... Thank you for such an amazing time with Family and friends
Ken I
Hollywood Florida."
5,"Their colita pavo changed my life. Deep friend turkey, avocado, great bread... Their tortas are a revelation--they have pickled onions, peppers, and salsa to pile on as well. The food is authentic. You can't leave without getting some of their cheap and tasty pan dulces either. I wouldn't get the elotes here though--you can get much better elsewhere (the one letdown here). Their amazing reputation is well-deserved."
5,"This place is fantastic. I'm living on the road and have had six facials in six different cities - this might be one of my favorites. 

First, they were running fifteen minutes behind and out of courtesy called me about a half hour before my original appointment time to let me know. I really appreciated that. 

The facial itself was pretty much everything I want from a facial but don't always get - an attentive esthetician (in this case, the lovely Keri) who gives a lengthy décolleté massage as well as a hand and arm massage while the mask sets (too many times in the past my technician has cleaned her tools while the mask set or even straight up left the room for ten minutes). And especially considering my 50-minute facial was $85 (the least pricey facial I've ever had), this is total top-notch service. 

Huge bonus - not a single product was pushed on me. The only thing she recommended was to get myself some exfoliating pads. Love that. 

When I got to work afterwards, people were telling me I was glowing. I felt it, too."
5,The bartenders here are always friendly and have great drink suggestions. Steph and Adam are especially fantastic. It's a great place to let your dog run around and play while you hang out and drink. One of my favorite places in Charlotte!
5,"Took my brother to Waffle House on our trip back from Texas to California. He's never been to a waffle house before and he was a little nervous about going in. Once we were seated and he looked at the menu he was amazed.

Our server Kevon and his sidekick Karee we're the best funniest servers I've ever had the pleasure of waiting on me. 

Karee Carrie wanted my brother to put on one of the Waffle House hats. When he went into the bathroom I placed a bet with her that she couldn't get him to put it on. I let her know I would buy her breakfast if she could get him to do it. Without telling him that she and I had placed a bet with each other.

That kind of tweaked her a little bit she had to think. At the end of this amazingly good breakfast. I asked to take a picture of my two servers. That was Karee's to get my brother to put the hat on and take a picture. This girl thinks very very smart she won the bet. I paid her we left I laughed.

Thank you so much for making a fantastic breakfast experience for us."
5,Fantastic spot! Sam is as friendly and helpful as a person can be. Anything you try is going to be good. I'm addicted to their gyro. Addicted. The food is made fresh to order with Persian ice cream and rose water and even taftoon bread as sides. Great for a good quick meal or a sit down with the family!
5,I had a wonderful experience at Evolve. Darius gave me a super relaxing massage and Olga gave me the best facial I have ever had!  I will definitely be back!!!
5,We love this place and have lucked out in that we live so close.   The main point of enjoyment for this place is being able to watch the dogs play and run around while you kick back a few drinks (which are much more reasonably priced than most of the bars in Charlotte).
5,"Fabulous food, helpful and friendly staff.  I have enjoyed everything I have had here, and am particularly happy that they have sashimi!  I have not seen that at other buffets.  It's an enjoyable experience overall, but first and foremost is the delicious food."
5,"For the longest time, I ignored this place thinking it's just another Asian buffet. Then I read the reviews on Yelp and the photos made me want to try this place ""right now!""
So husband and I went here for dinner that night. We were amazed at how much seating and food choices they have in here! We were promptly seated, and the server took our drinks order. Husband headed to the sushi bar (it was surprisingly good!) and I loaded my plate up with crawfish and stuffed crab and frog legs and shrimp and what-not. It was ALL delicious! Husband loved the sushi. Soups are good too.
The very uncommon (in a good way) thing I noticed was that they have a wide selection for every palate. Lots of Chinese, Thai, Japanese (Hibachi too) choices, but also have pizzas and American fare for the non-Asian palate. They also have a huuuuge number of dessert offerings and fruit and salads. 6-8 different flavors of ice cream too. I only wish that they would label their desserts better for people with allergies/sensitivities.
Even if you find yourself here on a day when it's super busy and they tell you you have to wait, go ahead and wait. The restaurant is very efficiently managed and usually your wait time will be much shorter than what they tell you. On Valentine's Day they told us the wait was 20 min, but we got seated in under 10."
5,"I experienced the rejuvenation of all my senses: cucumber lemon water upon arrival, a fabulous deep tissue massage and reflexology with Darius, pleasant aromatherapy throughout the building, relaxing rooms with comfy furniture and therapeutic music playing during my session. What a great treat-myself spa day."
5,"I am so happy that I found Evolve Wellness Spa for my acupuncture. Karen knows exactly what I need and how to help me.
The staff is friendly and helpful. Prices are good. Calming atmosphere"
5,"The best brick oven pizza in the area! Pasta was delicious and the atmosphere is great! We needed a restaurant like this in Mooresville!! Upscale yet casual with great food. We had 2 different pasta dishes and a brick oven pizza. We were very pleased with everything we ate and are looking forward to our next visit. This will be my new ""go to"" restaurant!"
5,"Please come back!!! This is by far the most tragic thing that's happened to Vegas! This place is the best tapas place with the best white peach sangria EVER! My hubby and I used to go there every time we go to Vegas (which is a lot). I mean, there were times when we craved BabaReeba so much that we took a trip to Vegas because of it! We would order pitchers of the white peach sangria and I would get tipsy and then go shopping at the fashion show mall! How much better can life get? :P

anyway, please please reopen it or open one in LA!! The new restaurant in place of it sucks!"
5,HMMM. Very Different and I LOVED its good for dogs good for people! Bar tenders are super friendly I love my dogs and they loved the DOG BAR. Great way to meet new people if your new in the area.... If your not a  dog lover don't go its that simple.
5,"Fantastic tapas. We ate some cold and some hot dishes and they were fantastic. Good sangrias, too."
5,I just love this place! I always go to the dog bar like every weekend with my dogs n friends. Adam and Stephanie have always provided us the best services!! My dogs got so comfy by hanging out there as well. The best thing is that you can bring your own food to eat there and drink your favorite drinks with affordable price while your dogs are playing with others. Who needs a doggie day care when you have this place to go? Love this place!!
5,"This was our 2nd time at Novanta. We enjoyed the food, the lasagne and the spaghetti squash dish. Both were great. We brought our 3 year olds who enjoyed the pizza dough they got to play with compliments of Lucy."
5,"I travel for a living all over the World.  House of Hunan, located in my hometown, has proven to be my favorite of all for almost a decade.

I'd highly recommend the green or red curries."
5,Awesome facial and so relaxing!! Keri was amazing. Highly recommend! Can't wait to try other services!!
5,"My dog, Thor, and I love The Dog Bar!

Before you venture out this way though, you should know what you're getting into... Like other Yelpers reviewed, you must be a dog person.  The dogs will come up to you, sniff you, kiss you, and sometimes jump on you.  The first time we went out here, everyone seemed very on top of their dogs' behavior.  If one dog was causing too much trouble, the owner took them home.  Yesterday's experience was not so efficient.  There were a few dogs that blurred the lines between playing and fighting, and the owners did nothing except, ""Sparky, no.""  I have problems with this, but the trouble making dogs didn't mess with Thor, so I just kept him occupied with other dogs.  

They don't do food here, but you can bring food into the bar.  Just prepare to have a lot of well behaved dogs showing off their tricks for a bite of your quesadilla. (Get your food from Cabo Fish Taco - nom nom nom).  I'll be back time and time again, but please - if your dog is not having fun, just take him home.  Don't make the other dogs (and owners) deal with him."
5,"Evolve Wellness Spa is wonderful. I called and left a message about booking a same day appointment before the spa opened and received a call back within the hour from Beth.  She was able to fit me in the same day and was very gracious on the phone.  Upon arriving to Evolve, I received a warm and prompt reception from Gabrielle. Darius is one of the most expert massage therapists I have encountered----and I have received massages around the world.  The massage left me feeling a million times better than when I first arrived. He is knowledgeable and very clearly explains his technique and treatment suggestions.  Following the massage I was welcomed into the relaxation room where the dim lights and comfortable reclining chaise lounges were a perfect accompaniment to my treatment.  Gabrielle also provided some delicious relaxation tea, too."
5,"Best Spanish Restaurant in America (that I've found thus far).

Seriously everything is to die for and the Sangria is amazing. Lobster Paella, Garlic Shrimp, Dates wrapped in Bacon... EVERYTHING!!!

Seriously I LOVE everything about this place... the ambiance, the music, service, the food and the wine list! 

Another great plus: PAELLA COOKING CLASSES
About once a month on Saturdays they have this class where they teach you how to make paella and various tapas. You get to try everything they make for you and you get to take a cookbook home with all the recipes. The class is at 10AM... it's hard not to go hungover from the debaucheries of the night before in Vegas, but it's well worth it!!"
5,One of my favorite restaurants in Lake Norman!  Vincent and Lucy have built a great atmosphere and amazing menu.  The service is outstanding!  You are missing out if you haven't experienced it for yourself!
5,Hands down this place has the best vegetable lasagna and eggplant parmesan. The prices are cheap and the food is plentiful. When I need a carb hangover this is where I go.
5,"My boyfriend and I were in town from San Diego and we're desperately missing our two pitty boys. We stumbled upon The Dog Bar after walking around in NoDa and we're so happy to see all the wagging tails! They serve beer in plastic cups and it's a great place to take your dog and have some drinks. All the dogs there got along great and we even made quick friends with the owner of a precious pit that was there. 

Great place! Wish they had one in San Diego!"
5,"I love this place.  Have limited time, feel guilty for not spending more time with my dog.  Guilt free drinking!"
5,"Great buffet.   The food was awesome.   I loved it.  The seafood was delicious.   The staff was kind and real nice.  AWESOME



."
5,"It was the best Tapas in Vegas and for the price, would probably still be(even with the addition of serrano and Jaleo).  I miss this place!"
5,"By far the best tasting tortas hands down, authentic mexican taste GUARANTEED! ..........................      

................"
5,"This place is AMAZING! I couldn't love it more if I tried. The beer selection was great and the owner knew all 16 taps of craft beer by heart. He was extremely nice, welcoming and a good source of knowledge for things to do in the area. All of the dog owners were welcoming as well and the dogs were having just as good of a time as we were. I love that a place like this exists and here's another vote for him opening one up in New Jersey!"
5,"I love this place! Some say the pizza is too cheesy, not crispy enough, but I think it's great. I always get a medium pepperoni pizza and the pizza is huge so there are always leftovers! Cheesy garlic bread is awesome, it's basic garlic bread with mozzarella on top....but it's delicious. My boyfriend really likes the Hawaiian Pizza and gyros. It's a family owned place, been around for years, since I was a child."
5,"GREEK PIZZA. You must try it. I am obsessed with it; I moved to the East side a few months ago and was intrigued by the packed parking lot HOP always seems to have going. Then I tried the Greek Pizza and learned why.
The crust was a bit thick but perfectly chewy; the feta cheese, if not house-made, was at least made by someone who knows what they're doing. Creamy, a bit of that rind taste I love, and the fresh onion, fresh green bellpepper toppings were the right note to play off the grilled lamb gyro meat. It's the only pie I've tried so far, because when I walk in the door I can't make my mouth say anything else. I may be able to see other pizzas soon, but right now I am completely infatuated.
Oh yeah, old school decor, blah blah blah. GREEK PIZZA."
5,"the house is a very good place for italian food at it's best ,and the subs omg!!!!!!!!!!,you can't go wrong give them a try i bet you will go back!"
5,"I have been going here since it opened and I have never been disappointed in any way. The pizza is terrific with an excellent variety of unique flavors from the wood fired ovens. The salads are great. If you want something more than pizza, the have just added a few traditional Italian entries. 

It have tried the Osso Bucco Chicken Parm, and their special single portion lasagna... can't say that I have had it better any where else. 

My favorite Pizzas are the Sweet Heat and the Mama MIA.

Service is always great and the food comes out quickly. Some nice homemade deserts as well. 

Perfect place if your local but well worth a trip if your not!!!"
5,I have to say that the Falafel wrap is amazing!  The seasoned fries were crispy and delicious. They have recently revamped the dining area and the decor is laid back and comfortable for a leisurely lunch.  They have several lunch specials which provide plenty of bang for your buck. I highly recommend giving them a try for lunch or dinner.
5,Best shawarma in town. Very nice owners. Food is very carefully served. These guys operate with love.
5,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  Great food, great people!  Keep up the good work and promise to not to eventually lower the food quality like a lot of buffets do.  I would much rather pay a few dollars more and keep the quality of the food!"
5,"This is one of my favorite places to go in Las Vegas.
It's got easy access, in spite of being on the strip.

They have awesome sangria, good food - and a handful of vegetarian and vegan options. It's moderately priced (good for being on the strip).

I love their spicy potatoes!"
5,"Had to try this place as it is always well reviewed...

Came in at around 3pm..so was given the hote menu...or happy hour menu i guess...

Ordered the montreal burger....juicy cheese burger with ( you guessed it) smoked meat on top....what an enjoyable experience...lol.  the order came with coffee and soup of the day, and fresh green salad or fries if you like...

Next, had the smoked meat poutine...another job well done. Fries were just fried and came.hot and crispy...cheese curds were amazing and the gravy as deeeelicious....again the best part...smoked.meat was the topping....

Theres so much to try in this place like their bennys and bagels...u have to keep on coming back...lol..

Next time.im.in town, im coming here for brunch!

Happy eating!"
5,"Yummy euro style pizza, family friendly dining area, quick service. Outdoor seating available."
5,"Took my team to lunch today at Tortas. I was impressed at how busy it was as the line was out the door. We moved quickly through the line and had our food out relatively fast considering how many people were there. I had the fish tacos and they were fantastic. Just the right amount of food. Fish were seasoned perfectly and lightly breaded, unique and fantastic. I can honestly say this was unlike any fish taco I've had at any other valley restaurant. Well done"
5,"The food here is authentic and delicious. I recommend the tacos, tortas, aguas frescas, and burritos. Worth the trip."
5,"Excellent experience. Pizza was outstanding! Great service and great recommendations on beer and pizza. We has the sweet honey hot pizza. 
Yummmmmm."
5,Best pizza in Mooresville so far. We love everything there! Looks like someone really knows in Italian cuisine and do most of dishes following original recipes. They even use semolina and ricotta in their donuts! And salads are awesome. But the best part is live music.
5,Came here for breakfast the other day with my boyfriend and were seated immediately. We were also greeted by our server quickly and we ordered. He got a triple hash brown with ham and mushrooms. I got a waffle with bacon. It took about 10 min at most to get our food. If that! When we got our food everything tasted amazing. Server was there if we needed anything and overall amazing service.
5,"I love this place. Only downside is it can be difficult to find seating after 10, but my friend and I hunted for bars all over Charlotte and came back here every night. The music is great, the people are nice, service is good, and those 86 oz buckets of alcohol are hilariously big. We drank quite a few of them. We regret nothing."
5,"Seriously excellent authentic Mexican food! I had their original Torta and it was delicious. The Horchata was top notch and I got a huge scoop of  Pecan Ice Cream for dessert which was DELICIOUS.

I highly recommend this place for it's excellent staff, great prices and outstanding food!"
5,"Soooo good! Started off with a beer flight, followed by Rustica salad so flavorful then the main attraction a pizza perfection ""Sicialiana"" baked in authentic made in Italy wood fired ovens- 90 seconds to bake this masterpiece of light airy crust, nicely charred and again such flavors that meld together. Heaven and to top off our Valentine's Day dinner we had their dessert trio special of 3 mini desserts: tiramisu bread pudding (made in house), blood orange gelato and cannoli in a unique deconstructed style- delicious a great finale. We sat at the pizza bar to watch the ovens but seating was plentiful and varied from counter seating like us to pub style seating on high top tables, bar seating and of course cozy more initiate tables and booths. Our entire meal was $42 without tip and both of us were stuffed. We will be back! Loved it"
5,"This place is the BOMB! We had a blast in here, it was a nonstop party from the time we walked in."
5,"Much better then the other place in old moorseville. True Italians great food, try the goat cheese salad, and meatballs."
5,"I am here from Los Angeles CA, I came here to paint at the Paint PHX art event... This is by far the best place we have eaten at since we been here! Real Mexican Good Food!
Stan ""Saints"" Nuñez"
5,"We loved this place!! Great atmosphere/decor/high ceilings. 

We shared the sushi (mozz, prosciutto, pepper) dish to start and split the meatball pizza. It was amazing! It was a nice change to have peppadew peppers. 

The kid plates are $7-8, and we got the orecchiette with Alfredo for our toddler, but duh, he wanted our pizza. What was I thinking. We were happy to finish his dish for him. 

Would love to come back for their tiramisu bread pudding...and several other things on the menu!"
5,Our first experience was very good.  We had the Orechiette and the Bolognese.  Both were excellent.  The portions were large and the price very reasonable for what you get.  The staff was friendly and the place has a relaxed feel.  We'll definitely be back.
5,"Been YEARS since I ate at House of Pizza until they reopened after the remodel. Our party had a pizza, bacon sub and lasagna. (Keep in mind they have been packed since reopening and our wait was long).  I give the bacon sub a 5 Star all the way. Bread was good and tasty. Cheese was ample. Bacon was good and done (not limp) but not too crispy. Had good flavor. Loved shredded lettuce on it. All in all a great sub. The lasagna was thick, with lots of noodles, not overly sauced, might could have used a touch more shredded cheese. It had a good flavor - not the beat I have had, but better than many. The pizza - well here ya go. Crust was flavorful, done just right and no grease seepage from the sauce or toppings (I like that). We asked for lite on the sauce and they were spot on. Plenty of cheese. We ordered pepperoni, sausage and black olives. Plenty of black olives. I'm not convinced I care for the sliced sausage. Pepperoni was flavorful and good. 
As with all restaurants, there will be good and bad. We enjoyed it enough we will be returning soon."
5,I love this place ! I always get a torta and an amazing delicious AGUA De MELON !!!! Delishhh !!
5,"I can't believe I have never given a review for this place. This is one of my favorite restaurants in all of Charlotte. My girlfriend tried it, and she literally gave up the Olive Garden. Our favorite dish there is the egg plant Parmesan with a side of spaghetti and a salad with Greek dressing. And of course garlic bread. Believe it or not we've never tried the pizza, But it's definitely on my list. They have been remodeling the restaurant for at least the last year. I can't wait to begin going again once they reopen. Every month or so I try their phone number, and it still says out of order. Please, please, please hurry up and finish the remodel."
5,I've had gyros in many places but I can sincerely tell you that this place makes the best gyros I have ever tasted and The Baklava delicious I will definitely return to this place and recommend it to anyone.
5,"This place is a hidden gem!!  It doesn't look like much from the outside they have a very casual inside decor!  However, the food is amazing and delicious!!!  The owner is very hands on from what we could tell taking orders and going over menu items if you have a question, will recommend items based on your likes!  
I ordered the kabob combo of Kubideh  of lamb and chicken!  It comes with persian rice and salad and pita bread,  The lamb was fantastic great taste the chicken was good but the lamb was better I will try the steak next time.  We also ordered a side of baba ganoush.  It was delicious and fresh made.  Great roasted taste to the eggplant and the pita bread is made fresh.  
They have plenty to choose from and a good selection if you are vegetarian!!  Will definitely be back, plus they are going to be opening more one in Henderson and one in Summerlin!!"
5,"This is the BEST Chinese buffet I've been to.  If you're doubting me, then take a look at my profile picture.  The ingredients are better quality that most buffets and there is a large variety.  Their sushi is amazing (I was expecting buffet quality) and their hibachi grill is pretty good too."
5,"My family and I come here often when I don't feel like cooking. There's a large selection of food that pleases everyone in my family. My daughter gorges on sushi, my son eats up the appetizers and my husband eats everything in sight. Me? I prefer the hibachi. We've been coming here since it opened and it's the same guy doing hibachi by himself EVERY SINGLE TIME! The hibachi line gets super long but he never gets any help. I've heard people make stupid remarks to him and about him. Some complain about the wait time or there's not enough seasoning or whatever it is that stupid entitled people complain about. But the guy always smiles and continues on with his job. Maybe one day he'll get someone to help him. In the meantime, I make it a point to always tip him well (there's a cash tip jar) and talk to him if it's not too busy. He's not the only hard worker - the waiters are all super attentive as well. But the hibachi guy is the man! He's the main reason this mama picks this place for dinner cause let's face it - mama always gets what she wants!"
5,"I'd 100% recommend going here. Our server's name was Nadine and she was extremely nice and amazing! Super fast and always checked on us.

I got the Uneggspectation which was steak with eggs. I got poached eggs and white bread. 100% percent delicious and came with some fresh fruit. The food was great and worth every bite. I asked Nadine for some steak sauce and she brought me the steak sauce + 4 other hot sauces in case I wanted it! 

I would definitely come back when I visit Montréal!

On a side note they have free wifi!"
5,I just left evolve after getting a facial with Stephanie. I feel a million times better. My skin was extremely dry and red before going into see her and now it is absolutely glowing. She is so knowledgeable and uses products according to your skin type and what works best with your skin. She also recommeneded products for me to use at home. Highly recommend.
5,"Had a wonderful day at Evolve Wellness Spa.  Enjoyed a Serenity package, massage and facial.  Will definitely be back in 2018!"
5,Very accommodating. Easy booking. Staff nice and attentive. Can't go wrong going here! Very relaxing!!
5,"I loveeeee this place. I eat there at least twice a week & I'm still not tired of it & don't think I'll ever be! I'm a regular now, that every time I call to place my order they already know what I want & get it ready for me! I recommend Flame Kabob to everyone! I'm vegan so they cater to us! 

*** I had to come back to update my review because their baklava is AMAZING!! I tried it for the first time yesterday it was soooo delicious & its vegan! So if you come here you deff have to try it, it's a must! Vegan falafel is still delicious as ever. As well as the veggie Kabob plate!****"
5,This newly opened pizzeria is a great place addition to the Langtree community.  We tried it this weekend and thought it was great.
5,This place was awesome. all staff were so friendly and l loved their chicken and beef kabob. The baklava was homemade. the best baklava l have ever eaten in the Us.
5,"This could be may new favorite hang out. I have no idea why it has taken me so long to get to The Dog Bar- I've owned my pup for over a year and I always feel guilty leaving him for a night out. Now, I can bring my little guy out with me! You can bring your own food to The Dog Bar- we grabbed pizza slices from Revolution around the corner. Drinks were reasonably priced, there was a fire roaring in the fire pit and my friends and I brought our dogs- really what's not to love for a low key night out."
5,"Dog bar is amazing. Great drink specials and tons of PUPPIES!!!!!!!

It's a perfect place to let your dog tire themselves out while enjoying a delish adult beverage."
5,"Best sushi in the Cleveland Akron area hands down. The Futomaki rolls are gigantic sized and excellent fresh quality. The rolls are bigger than any sushi place I've ever visited across the US including NYC and San Francisco. My friend and I have girls nights here and we always enjoy the food. Beef fried rice is also excellent, the beef is soft like butter. The service could be better in terms of more friendly and attentive waiters. They are slow, don't bring refills of water or mixed drinks or ask if you want dessert which is only going to hurt business, however, it won't stop me from coming here. I adore their sushi."
5,Amazing service entire crew was great fast service mozzarella's cheese sticks and cheese steak was super good sweet tea was on point
5,"I asked the gentleman that helped me (I think he's the owner) for a lo-carb plate.  He made a nice falafel, hummus, green  salad with olives and he even added a grape leaf with rice.  It was all yummy!  He gave a slightly spicy green sauce they have available at the counter.  Delicious.  I work across the street and it was very quick for a lunch hour.  They have a kinds of other specialities I want to try like wraps that look tasty and good deals."
5,We loved the new pizzeria and glad they came to our community.  They have developed a nice atmosphere except that the lighting is a little too bright.  It would be a great place to watch the games on the weekends if they add a few TVs.
5,"Torta Paquime is a big hit.  I got their pork Tortas and it was huge and delicious.  They also go above and beyond with an ice cream bar, fun Hispanic music, and a bakery in the store.  Definitely worth a stop!"
5,I went through the drive thru and had three orders by time I got to the window I change my mind and wanted another drink. I was helped by Devin who was extremely courteous and didn't mind changing my order he had great customer service and very friendly. Thank you Devin
5,"The atmosphere in here was very pleasing, not bad drink specials and the live music was very entertaining. I was able to walk right up to the stage and request a song that they executed immediately."
5,"Just checked it out for the first time, it was amazing.

The only reason why I say this is because, it is under new ownership by a coworker of mine.

He is very good and please regime flame kabob another chance with him. He loves feedback so he may know how to improve and to do better.

Also he is giving 20% off to college students just show your student i.d.

Please give them a chance and watch how great the place can become."
5,"Food is fresh and authentic. Great beer and wine selection. Nice warm and welcoming atmosphere. Owners and staff are friendly and helpful. Quality ingredients and cooking methods, which helps justify the price.

If you respect quality ingredients and fresh food it's a must try!"
5,Always Delish!!!!!   Ask for the Happy New Year ....... It's not on the menu !!!!!   It's my little secret and I'm sharing it with all of you!
5,"If I could give 10, I'd definitely do it!! Our first place while visiting Old Montreal with the kids, and it satisfies all ages. Just keep in mind they close early. Great taste, and very friendly servers!"
5,"It feels great knowing that the owner remembers us from the last time, super friendly and amazing food at all times. Great place to study and to step out of the campus for a bit."
5,"Fantastic breakfast right down the street from our hotel. Our waiter was great, and even had a map and plotted out things to do for us which was very helpful. Nice selection of food. I tried a Russian themed egg benny that was absolutely delicious. Portions were huge. Definitely a good place to eat breakfast if you're staying in the area. We'll be back on our next trip!"
5,"After my first (bad) experience (and yelp review), Robyn, (one of) the owners of Evolve Spa reached out to me by email, thanking me for the review and the information I provided. She told me that she talked to the esthetician about the experience and that they sent her to a one-on-one retraining in Philly. I thought it was nice of the owner to contact me and to take my bad experience seriously. She sincerely seemed very concerned and asked me to give the spa another chance. I was a little reluctant at first, but decided to go for it. Today, I had facial by Keri. 
Keri truly was as good as they make 'em. I have been getting facials here and there for over 10 years and this was definitely one of the best experiences I had. She was personally very pleasant but most of all, she really seemed to know (and convey) what she was doing. Did a skin analysis, talked a little bit about the products but without a sales pitch,... it was a very pleasant and relaxing experience. Afterwards, Robyn was there, asking me how it all went, again apologizing for the first experience and thanking me for coming in again. I left feeling happy, healthy and perdy :)"
5,"If you are trying to impress a date with the ""decor""... This is not the place.  If you want amazing flavor... You have found it!  If you want ""fast""food. This is not the place.  If you want ""fresh"" food... This is the place!  Pay the extra 3.00 for the tenderloin (ground meat is just not as good). Best bet is to share a plate that has all 3 (beef chicken lamb). The saffron rice is excellent (not hard, not watery, just right). Hard to decide which is better (beef or chicken). The lamb is great, just not normal palate (the adventurous will love it). Best was that the flavor was not overpowering, yet was infused throughout.  No need to add salt or pepper.  ""Flavorful"" describes this the best.  Again, don't go for the decor... You WILL be disappointed.  Go for the food... You'll love it!"
5,"The lady at the cashier was very helpful and explained the whole menu to us being it was our first time there. We decided to get #14 Chicken Gyro Wrap. It came with salad, hummus, taftoon bread, tzatziki and dolmeh.  It was absolutely delicious! Good lunch portion. We also ordered a side of fries- YUM! They also threw in an extra portion of warm dolmeh and hummus on the side as an appetizer while we waited for our food. Great service and food! I'll definitely be coming back!!!"
5,"One of the best massages I've ever had!  I went onto Yelp for recommendations for a massage since I was only in town for a couple of days. I saw the strong reviews for Evolve Wellness Spa and thought I would give it a try. I called to see if they could fit me in for an afternoon appointment and there was one available, so I took it. Darius was my massage therapist and I would highly recommend him. We reviewed what gave me the most problems and the man knows his muscle groups. I was highly impressed with his professionalism and knowledge. He worked out many knots and even worked on my golf elbow issue that has been troubling me for months. Thank you Darius!  Overall the place is very relaxing and professional...I would recommend it!"
5,"I went to Evolve today for a lash lift and tint.
Olga was so sweet and did an amazing job! She asked about my makeup routine. I told her it's minimal. She suggested a brow tint to make my morning routine even easier. The brow tint was a game changer for me! I'm so happy she suggested it. I would highly recommend Evolve and Olga!"
5,I love Dog Bar and would go insane without it. My puppy gets to run around and play while I have a drink or two. The people are awesome and all dog lovers.  They have heaters and without this place I wouldn't get through winter with my puppy.  They have good drink specials and great bartenders especially Jen.  I always leave happy with a tired pup.  My dog even knows what Dog Bar means.
5,"Good service. Excellent value. I went for the ""All You Can Eat"" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices."
5,"Excellent spa for a massage and facial. 

This area is not my fortay usually, but I got a certificate for Valentine's day from my husband this year and it turned out to be an amazing gift. I would never had thought about getting a facial, but it was so enjoyable and my skin was glowing for a week. The woman doing my facial was really friendly and she even explained everything she was doing the whole time. I apologize, as I forgot her name and can't refer you to her; I was like a happy drunk already after getting 60 minutes of massage. But her legacy is that her consultation changed my outlook on daily skincare for the better.

This place is pricey, but it is worth it if you can spare the cash. The atmosphere is very relaxing and clean and the staff is very professional. I left after a massage and facial and felt like a new person. It was quite amazing. The products that they use for facials are high quality and largely organic. Parking can be tricky because of the location, so leave yourself some extra time to arrive. You'll also have to complete some paperwork too, so be aware of that as well. 

Treat yourself to some serious relaxation at Evolve whenever you can spare the time and cash."
5,"Evolve wellness spa is my favorite little oasis in the city. The environment is intimate and calming. The staff are knowledgeable and caring. While I don't get to go as often as I would like, every experience I've had there has been a positive one."
5,"It was the first time I've ever been here and I loved it! The meals were quite appetizing! Lets see we had a Passion Fruit Sangria, a pepperoni pizza, lamb, and calamari! Now it sounds like a lot because it is. The food comes in small portions so we were worried that we wouldn't have enough. Boy were we wrong. We had plenty! The passion fruit sangria is good if you like wine. Not so much if you don't. The Pizza on flat bread was phenomenal! The best pizza I've had in a long time! Talk about knowing how to put on pepperoni!  Lamb was scrumptious! I loved the potatoes that came with it as well. The mustard dip was the perfect touch to the whole thing. Lastly the calamari was divine! The best calamari I've tasted in a long time! Totally worth it! 

Besides having great food they also had great service. They constantly filled our drinks back up and when they brought the food they timed it well enough to where we didn't have all the entrees at the table at once. It was wonderful. Not to mention this place is so affordable! We're talking make $10 a plate. Trust me though you won't leave there hungry."
5,"I have to say, this is probably one of the best buffet in Charlotte. Possibly in NC. Of course, I am referring as an Asian buffet. Their sushi are excellent but I do wish they use less white fish inside of their rolls. One great thing is they offered small portion steak at their hibachi so that's a bonus. Great choice of food and plenty amount so above average. The place also looks nice with good amount of seating. Another great thing is their lunch buffet is fairly cheap and they are a little cheaper when it comes to dinner and weekend buffet compared to other Asian buffet. One thing I dislike most about this buffet is every single time I eat there, I end up stinking like buffet food. They need to do something about that; probably the fan isn't enough to filter the air and environment or their hibachi grill is just stinking up too much. Reason why they deserve a 5 star is because they were such a huge hit in a short period of time upon opening, within the year 2015."
5,"The food is so good. Fresh, wide variety, & the baklava is homemade by the owners mom! Yep you read that right, there is a nice little lady putting her love into food that you can take home & enjoy. Go get yourself some! The lentil soup is like nothing I've ever had, it isn't mushy & the spice combo is on point. Don't forget to try the green like salsa on the condiments bar inside. It is spicy but a true delight."
5,"Great breakfast. I had the eggchilada and he egg was fluffy and he cheeses were good. There was enough spice to know it's there but not overpowering. 

My Wife had the French toast. And it was also very good. The fresh squeezed OJ was perfect

The wait staff friendly and easy to get along with. Especially since we do not speak French. Will definitely repeat"
5,Their carne Asada tacos were awesome. Cool little spot off McDowell. Also had their homemade salsa and it was some of the best salsa I've had.
5,"I had never been to a tapas place before, and this was a great first time experience.  A friend recommended this place, so my boyfriend and I went here for happy hour. They had $3 tapas and  1/2 off sangrias from 4 to 7pm.

We ordered:
Pintxos:  We ordered all 6 for $8.95. Not on the happy hour menu, but wanted to try it anyways. Yummy!

Spicy potatoes w/ tomato alioli: there were a lot of potatoes on this dish. Yummy and a great value.

Skewered chicken & chorizo w/ sherry alioli: Yummy, but it's only 1 skewer... so about 2 bites.

Chicken empanada w/ red peppers, sherry alioli: Also a great value. One of our favorites.

Skewered beef w/ horseradish cream, red onion relish: same as skewered chicken and chorizo.... Yummy, but only 1 skewer as well.

Spanish meatballs in tomato sauce: comes with 2 large meatballs and 2 small potato pieces.

White peach sangria: refreshing. We shared a pitcher, and it was perfect.
We also got 2 desserts, which I'm not sure what the name was.  Maybe a chocolate tres leche and a milkshake drink.

I really think this place is more 4 stars than 5, but I wanted to help out the overall ratings a bit.  The service was great.  Although the ambiance towards the back of the bar was a little dim, the overall restaurant look and feel was great.  I would love to go back to try the paella and other tapas not on the happy hour menu (there are 10 choices on the happy hour menu)."
5,"Excelente servicio y la comida d lo mejor tambien, recomendadisima !!!  los empleados siempre muy atentos"
5,This buffet just opened at University Blvd. It is next to Big Lots and there is a Home Dept inside the shopping center. I took my parents there to eat during lunch time. I am impressed how good the food were. They do have sushi there but it is gone very fast.My suggestion is to go early like 11:00 am. They have good Habachi place and all sort of foods there. Dad likes the chicken wings there. For 6.99 it is cheap and you do get the quality of the food. Inside of the restaurant is very pretty and clean. For dinner is 9.99. Give this place a try.
5,"Holy hell, this place is so good. I sat at the bar and Trevor asssisted me. Started off with the sangria (which is made fresh) this is well made and smooth. I had the candied pecan salad to start, so tasty and fresh. Then I had the margarita pizza, hot and well balanced for flavor. This place rocks for food and drinks."
5,"This is the best bar in Charlotte. Friendly staff, great drinks, and tons of great dogs. I love bringing my dog Cooper here. Incredible atmosphere and the pups are playing freely."
5,I was there last night with my son and had the most amazing experience there!!  The kind gentleman at the counter asked if we had dined with them before.  I told him it was our first visit and he walked through the whole menu with us and gave us great recommendations.  We ordered a couple of combos with beef and chicken that were so delicious.  We also tried the hummus and Baba Ghanoush that were out of this world.  The meals came with this amazing bread that we watched him prepare and bake in front of us ( really cool to watch!) .  This place rocks!! Between the amazing team that works there to the delicious food .. We will be back:) Thank-you for being so kind and for the amazing meal!
5,"Omg. This place kicked ass. Not only was the waiter really nice, he gave us the happy hour discount even though we didn't sit by the bar (my sister is 15 so we couldn't sit there). That's 50% off for our pitcher of sangria. We had the white peach sangria and it was extremely delicious. The tapas were wonderful too. 
From the Pintxos menu we ordered the shrimp and egg salad on toast and the goat cheese croqueta. The flavors were simple and done perfectly. We savored our two bites. We then ordered the tomato and cheese Spanish flatbread. It was oblong shaped and really pretty. The crust was thin and crispy with a little bit of chewiness. 
My sister was most excited about the chicken paella. It had chunks of chicken and artichokes. Mmm my mouth is watering as I type about this dish. I do wish there were a little more crispy pieces since that's what differs a paella from a rice pilaf but the flavors were there so I'll let this one slide. 

Overall, this place is perfect. Cool ambiance, great food and really nice service."
5,Very good Waffle House is always very good!!! Waitress Rose was AWSOME!! Thanks you Waffles are always very good!!!
5,Great house special pizza! Subs are equally good. Went on Mother's Day and got a free piece of cheese cake.
5,"I have been to this spa three times, twice for massages with Kylie and Shimara (may be misspelling her name).  They have very different techniques but I very much enjoyed seeing both of them equally, so you really can't go wrong between the two of them.

More recently, I came in for a half Brazilian wax with Julia, and I have never had a more positive waxing experience in my life.  She is incredibly personable, warm, and friendly; we talked the whole time, and it was easy conversation, like talking to a good girlfriend.  She also made the entire experience significantly less clinical and awkward than it normally is, and she did a thorough and fantastic job on the waxing itself.

Everyone I've encountered at this spa has been extremely lovely, I would - and have - absolutely recommend this place to a friend, and I do have several who have been here and loved it as well."
5,"Favorite quick Mexican food in the valley. Everything is fresh, try the avocado torta or the chicken flautas. Good service, great prices, amazing food. Aguas frescas are great too, ask for a Jamaica mixed with limon."
5,This is a great place to bring your dog if it's friendly or to just come and have a drink while enjoying the company of other people's dogs. It's a win win.
5,One of the best in the neighborhood and well worth the wait! They've just remodeled and everything looks great! Food is always on point and the portions are well worth the small price
5,"I've been meaning to try this place out for a few years since my mechanic is basically across the street. So I finally took the plunge and said to myself, ""What took you so long?"".

I thought it was a nice sized place with plenty of seating and a stand alone soda station, salsa bar and  a bunch of yummy looking desserts at the counter. They had the spanish language televison and music going on as well.

I ordered the 3 carnitas tacos on corn shells. They give you plenty of meat with a little dab of quacamole on the side and garnished with a few chopped onions, tomatoes and some cilantro for $6.89. Did I mentioned that they give you plenty of meat? Wow, the flavors really meshed well together. Needless to say, I really enjoyed my meal and am looking forward to my next visit."
5,Great food! Great customer service. Beef kabob plate was delicious. I love this little hidden place right across from unlv
5,Upon arrival I was met by a sweet hostess who explained the concept of the restaurant. Loved how each lunch pizza came with drink and salad. I tried the sweet heat which was delicious. Loved the peppers.  The hostess also advised me they make their own mozzarella each week. You could see the difference in the pizza. Would love to go back and try more.
5,"Great lunch spot with good lunch specials, plus a discount for students. Sauce was tasty, plenty of meet in the gyro and the price is hard to beat. Definitely plan on frequenting this place!"
5,Nina and the chef were awesome! They were so much fun and have a great sense of humor! The customer service was excellent!
5,"Wow. What a great buffet. I have try many buffets in Charlotte, this is by far the best buffet in town. They have most varieties. And the food is always fresh and hot. This place is eater's heaven. I get them two thumbs up."
5,My boyfriend and I had 90 minute massages today With Mike and Becky. The massages were relaxing and the staff is friendly. We will go back for massages and to check out other services on the menu!
5,"Came back for an encore on Mother's Day with a party of six.  Same experience, different day!  Pot stickers, egg rolls, Tsing Taos, and wine by the glass to begin.  Had an assortment of main courses to share:  Mongolian Beef, a filet dish, a sauted chicken dish and multiple sushi orders.  We all mixed and matched.  The six of us left happy and contented!  Not a cheap meal, but well worth the cuisine, atmosphere, and service.  Will be back once again..."
5,"I haven't had a massage since moving to the city and I had a wonderful experience at evolve. I will definitely consider getting the subscription package because it is a super deal. Even without it, prices were much more reasonable than other spas in the area."
5,Awesome little place that has beer on tap and allows dogs inside. What more is there to say?
5,"This was near our place we stayed and we felt so lucky for that. this definitely beat any breakfast place I've been to. there were so many phenomenal sounding breakfast dishes. I had a breakfast crepe with eggs, hollandaise sauce, mushrooms, spinach and three types of cheeses. It came with a fresh, delicious side salad. I told myself any time we go back to Montreal, this will be our first place to go to!"
5,"Love this place! Pizzas are OK but the beef sandwich (what their known for) is AMAZING! The interior hasn't been updated in almost forever but it doesn't matter, food is excellent and prices are very cheap."
5,"What a fun place. I'm from Columbus OH and it reminds me for the dueling pianos bar. This place is a bit tight for all the people who want to come in and many have to stand but it's still a great time.

When you walk in you the stage with the pianos and drums is right in the middle in front of you. On both the right and left there is a bar so it makes it easier to get a drink. The drink menu is pretty extensive with specialty drinks. I got a signature drink, some kind of strawberry lemonade that was good. Boyfriend got a magic hat. Definitely an extensive drink selection.

The music played that Saturday night was a good selection. Some country, good 90's and 00's hits. Let's of different stuff. The musicians were very talented too. One of the make performers was just amazing. His piano skills were straight baller and he could really hit those high notes while singing. 

There was someone on the drums most if the time which added a bit oh oomp. There were a few songs that had both pianos, drums and two guitars all playing which was a lot of fun. A great place with nice bartenders, awesome and fun music. An overall great time. Our favorite place from the bars in the epicenter! So much fun and a must do. You won't regret it!"
5,"Booked a birthday massage at Evolve, and I love every minute of it. 
First up- parking. It could pose a problem since it's on street parking, but thankfully my husband dropped me off. 
Atmosphere- SO RELAXING. You walk in to plants, candles, and amazing aromas everywhere.
The receptionist was super duper nice, and brought me water while I waited. 
I booked a 90 minute massage with Becky, who was very attentive to what areas I wanted worked on the most. It was the most relaxing and comfortable massage I've had. I did have my massage during one of the wind storms, and Becky apologized for the wind gusts but I didn't mind at all. 
The one tip that I would say is that I love scented oils, usually lavender during a massage but the oils weren't scented. I'm guessing so it's suitable for everyone? Or maybe it's an up charge? I'm not sure, but for my next appointment I will inquire about that. 

My massage was so relaxing, I dozed off during it.

I definitely see myself going back and booking with Becky again."
5,"My wife and I walked here from L'Hotel when they opened at 7am. The waitress was friendly and place is very clean. I ordered the smoked meat omelet and she ordered the French toast. 
The normal order is 3 pieces but my wife can't eat that much. She asked for only 2 pieces and they adjusted the price.. how cool is that.. all places should offer 1/2 portions.

The food and service was great and started off our morning perfectly."
5,5 star!!! If youre on a ketogenic diet this place is a definitely a place to eat for keto. I ordered uncle Sam no bun very delicious and southern style omlette no lyannaise potato sub with cold tomato. Highly recommend breakfast joint.
5,Crazy good stuff going on here. One-of-a-kind fire wood burning oven's and some of the coolest staff. I will definitely be back!
5,"The food was at its right temperature, well proportioned, and was of average wait for the food to be prepared. I enjoyed it and will be back again. This place is a lil different but it's still good."
5,"Dog Bar has been a favorite of mine for a bit but I have never been impressed enough to write a review until last night. After adopting in March I wanted to make sure I was able to get my pup out and about as much as possible. Dog Bar has been a perfect space for that. He is a 80lb ball of energy and loves other dogs so getting tired out at dog bar is a huge plus for me. They always have great local beers on tap, my dog has a great time and I have never had any issue. Last night I unfortunately did but I wanted to make sure I included it in my review because it only raised my opinion of the Dog Bar. Another dog was not taking too kindly to mine and kept coming up and being pretty aggressive towards him.I wasn't too worried because of my dog being very submissive and always backing down from those behaviors.  At one point while his owner was away there was a big greeting at the entrance of a dog coming in and in the scuffle my dogs ear got hurt. From my experience the MIA owner is not normal, I have always experienced people having a good eye and read on their pups. However it is still a bar filled with dogs and things can happen. I don't think you can go to any dog bar and be surprised when dogs are acting like dogs. This being my first injury since adopting I had no idea what to do and was in a bit of shock. Travis behind the bar was absolutely wonderful. He immediately gave me space to get cleaned up and calmed down. He brought out anything I might need and was so comforting and helpful. I hardly ever review places like I should but even after what could have been a horrible experience, the staff and fellow patrons were, as always, wonderful. This will not be our last adventure to the Dog Bar."
5,The pizza is authentic and I've loved every one I've tried. My husband loves the sliders and eats them for an entree. We also really like the bar area and how it opens to the outside. On these beautiful days it's a great place to grab a drink and food!
5,"This. Place. Though. Do yourself a favor and go to. This. Place. :)

Seriously the best cheesesteaks, salad dressings, and lasagna in town. All 3 are bar none better than any where else in the whole dang city!!"
5,"The Dog Bar is a staple in our household. We love taking our Grayson there. The atmosphere is relaxing, and the amenities are exactly what you need, and nothing you don't. The dogs have free reign to play and bark and... well.. be dogs, and us humans can drink to our hearts' content.

Our favorite day to go is Sunday for the $5 ""big"" mimosa and bloody mary specials. No bloody Mary mix here! They spice them up themselves!  I also spent a good bit of time coming here on Wednesdays when my fiance was in night classes. It's a great way to break up the week for you and your pooch. :)

They do not have a kitchen, but they welcome you to bring your own take out from anywhere. They even have menus behind the bar.

The service here is great. Be nice to them and they'll be nice back. We love the Sarahs, but they're all great. 

When my parents came to visit from DC, the first thing they asked us was ""When are we going to The Dog Bar?!"" If that's not proof enough that we love this place, I don't know what is."
5,"You will definitely get a kick out of this place. Lots of fun and friendly staff. They also have a giant jenga block set,"
5,"Stopped in for an iced coffee Togo - very quick service, very friendly staff! Dunkin coffee continues to be a good value. They had a good variety of donuts left at around 5 pm, even though a cold drink was all I was in the mood for."
5,"The menu has a great variety of authentic Italian pizzas and fresh made pastas. You can't go wrong with any menu item in my opinion. Atmosphere is cool, comfortable, and tasteful. Staff is pretty friendly. Delicious sangrias! I could see this place becoming very popular in the near future with the development of the Langtree area."
5,"Omg.... so good!! The best I've been to thus far. So many choices and all are so delicious. So many vegetables and meats. Even the American food is good. So many desserts.

It is packed in there and for a good reason. It's worth the scramble for the food."
5,"their $5 carne asade torta has a full avocado in it and great bread!

i don't care for their elote--it's served as a gloppy mess in a cup instead of on the cob!"
5,The menu had plenty of egg related puns which I enjoyed. The food came quickly and tasted great. What pushed this review to a 5 star was our waiter who brought out a map of Montreal and drew out around 10 attractions with detailed directions on each one. He was truly great! It was our first day in after visiting from NYC.
5,"Loved the atmosphere, the people and excellent food both presentation and taste. Highly recommend!"
5,"Updated review. Please read. Old review 5/5 new review 5/5.

I just went to Novanta for the second time; this time for lunch.  I updated this review as there are a lot of negative reviews on here. I feel like people need a proper perspective.

This place is by no means a traditional pizza place, nor is it what most people would call a traditional brick oven pizza place. If that's what you're looking for, well this place is not for you. This place is a traditional Neopolitan wood oven pizzeria and restaurant. The ingredients are fresh and authentic as is the menu. If you go to say a Moroccan restaurant and you've never had true Moroccan food before, you're not going to be upset (or at least you shouldn't be) because it was not what you expected. The quality of the ingredients and the freshness is what dictates the price. This place is upscale casual and it's prices are on point with that. I don't know or have any affiliation with the owners. I am writing this as this is a new restaurant that I happen to enjoy. This new restaurant is doing something unfamiliar to a lot of people in the area. If this restaurant was in NYC it would be getting great reviews, because in NYC people are familiar with the Neopolitan concept. The local community should give any restaurant a fair shot instead of bombarding it 1 star reviews.

Okay below is my actual review of the restaurant.

Food is fresh and authentic. Great beer and wine selection. Nice warm and welcoming atmosphere. Owners and staff are friendly and helpful. Quality ingredients and cooking methods, which helps justify the price.

If you respect quality ingredients and fresh food it's a must try!"
5,"I always judge people by their wine and beer menus first, and they totally impressed. Fun and unique wines and tons of local beers. 
Then my pizza came out, beautifully presented. The brick oven cook on it made it nice and crispy. The dough wasn't the highlight of the pizza which is always nice. 
New favorite pizza stop in LKN!"
5,"The Farmhouse facial was an amazing experience.  Not only was it relaxing, the aesthetician tailored the facial to meet my individual skin care needs.  The day after my skin was smooth and glowing.  This was my first facial and my first visit to Evolve Wellness Spa.  I will definitely be back!"
5,This place is AMAZING!!! EVERYTHING I HAVE HAD HERE is....DELICIOUS!!!!!! Super steak nacho Supreme is out of this world!!! Piñon Ice cream in the delicate crisp cone .... ADDICTIVE!!! Love this place!!!  Very fair price and leave happy and stuffed! Why diet ? Have some good fun at Tortas! Staff is always friendly too!
5,"Came in on a Tuesday afternoon around 3 PM and had a great server who was very attentive and nice, his name was Mike. Of course I ordered a waffle because it's waffle house but also had eggs, bacon, sausage, toast and hashbrowns. Everything was cooked to order and tasted delicious. Employees were incredibly courteous and the environment was spotless. I have definitely been here multiple times before and will come back over and over again. I left feeling happy and full... What else can you ask for?"
5,Chioma was absolutely amazing! One of the best massages I've ever had - and I've had a lot!  She listened to my concerns & gave me exactly what I wanted. I can't wait to refer my friends to her & I can't wait for my next appointment.
5,"Price point is a little too high for my daily liking but their facials feel absolutely amazing and refreshing, and I feel much more energized yet calm after each session. The staff are also super friendly. Definitely recommend this place if you want to spoil yourself for a day or need a face lift for a special occasion. 

Notes: They only accept cash gratuity."
5,"The food and service it's great,I enjoyed my self nice atmosphere I recommend anyone to check it out. If you go before 3:00pm the rates are lower!!!"
5,Tapas. Perfect. White peach sangria. Perfect. The garlic shrimp is a must. Dip everything in the garlic sauce. Perfect sizes. Even the desserts were delectible.
5,The food is awesome and service is better than a lot of other restuarants.  The restuarant itself is very clean and I like the open kitchen.
5,Personal favorite out of all charlotte clubs. Good clean fun!!
5,Needed a quick somewhat healthy place for dinner before getting to the airport..  this was the perfect stop!
5,"Wow. What a lovely group of women. I was an out-of-towner on my own and looking for something special to do for my birthday. Booked a massage (Kylie) and facial (Robin) and it was a total treat. The spa is in every way warm, nurturing, relaxing. Thanks for a treat!"
5,Anytime I'm feeling overwhelmed by work I schedule an appointment here for a very relaxing and enjoyable experience. It's easy to make a reservation and I've received excellent massages and am willing to make the drive to this spa in particular as I always get incredible service and feel relaxed when walking out the door. Highly recommended.
5,Services were good. Will come back. Liked the atmosphere a lot. Becky was great. I would recommend her.
5,This was my second visit. Excellent food. Authentic Italian pizza and delicious pasta and salad. One of my favorite restaurants in the Lake Norman area. I highly recommend.
5,First time here and we loved it ! Decided to give this place a try and so glad we did and we'll definitely be back on another trip .I had the all star breakfast with raisin toast and grits ive never had grits before but very yummy and the ice tea is delicious. The staff was very friendly and welcoming thank you for a great experience and yummy food !
5,"Neighborhood friendly fun for you and your favorite dog pal.  Great for sporting events, even go alone and meet new friends.  The owner has recently done a new renovation, which opened up the inside and made the place a lot more people friendly.  GREAT drinks too and they don't mind if you order in or bring a picnic."
5,Awesome don't have these at home always a treat to find one near me on holiday waitress was pleasant cook was well trained and food was delish thanks Wafflehouse for a happy tummy
5,"Sweet people,  they make you feel welcome!  We had the large grilled chicken salad and large extra special pizza , great portion and amazing flavor !  Not greasy at all and fresh veggies with the salad. Highly recommended !!"
5,"What a gem!!! Not located in the best of areas but you would think they were getting ready for the President to arrive and dine! This place was spotless! The cashier was extremely friendly, not pushy, offered a sample of their homemade chicken soup while I was deciding (since it was a chilly 40 degrees outside it really hit the spot!). 
  
I was undecided between two menu items and she graciously helped me decide based on customers feedback. I ordered the torta cubana.... It was fantastic. It would have been nice if it was cut into two pieces but I devoured it anyway. 

Fresh homemade torta roll, the avocado,lettuce, and tomato were fresh! The meat was delicious! Great job guys! Great selection of baked goods, homemade ice cream, palletas, and horchata.

I will definitely be back!"
5,I had a personal pizza and a salad at lunch and it was delish! Good service and very cozy environment.
5,"i love this place really good, really clean,not to expensive,and food taste great .come here all the time."
5,Best tortas in the whole state of Arizona tortas paquime no hay otro lugar que ni se les acercan a estas tortas!!!! Y todo lo que venden está al 100%
5,I enjoyed a wonderful facial at Evolve. Very relaxing and the esthetician was extremely kind and professional. A day later my skin still feels awesome!
5,"This restaurant as I always saw it was a gem in Charlotte. Not much people know about it, but does it attract people from all around. One time I saw a Huntersville Police come down to this restaurant. I don't blame them taking that trip to taste their delicious subs.

I'm not a big fan of their pizza, but I will eat their subs daily if I could. I always order the Mushroom Steak or their Combination Steak subs which come with a melted cheese sub with mushrooms and steak with peppers (combination steak) and chips. I wish I could substitute the chips with something like a salad or something, but I'm not going to complain. The salad here is the freshest in all the restaurants I have ever eaten at. The house salad is always crisp and just taste wonderful with the  green peppers and baby tomatoes they add.

Every bite of their sub was an experience for me. The service is nice, but when it gets hectic in the restaurant you have to give them a little break. Inside, they have dimmed lights also with a big old style radio player (that plays really old music every 15-30 min). Overall, I love this place. It's not too far from my house and it's absolutely delicious."
5,"Great food and great service, they have ten tables of food to choose from and hibachi and sushi on top of that!"
5,"Good authentic Italian!   We started with the Sushi Novanta and Arancini rice balls. Yum!  Next was Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella, Pappardelle Bolognese and orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. Fresh ricotta on each dish.  We finished with a dessert sampler.  Excellent food!   Nice atmosphere.  Server was very attentive.  We'll be back."
5,Sam was super helpful and cool! The food... my god... I'm glad I went here instead of the other place I go to around school. Flavor is a bit different than I'm used to with Mediterranean food but IN A GOOD WAY! Definitely coming back for more kubideh :)
5,"Great Cheesesteak !!  Nice roll.  Didn't measure but looked like 14 - 16"".  Loads of chopped beef with melted cheese on top.  Delicious.  At half, wanted more but did not want to spoil the enjoyment.  Took other half home and shared with my wife.  Glad they're back."
5,"It's the happiest place on earth! Screw Disney, come get a drink and hang out with a bunch of doggies! They do a lot of promoting for local dog adoption agencies as well. It's absolutely my favorite bar on planet earth."
5,"Talk about friendly customer service! From the moment we walked in, we were greeted nicely and immediately felt welcome. I came here with my baby girl and boyfriend. We tried the beef, chicken and lamb kabobs. All were great but my favorite by far was the ground beef. It was so tender, flavorful and delicious! The freshly made bread and hummus was great too. Even my baby girl loved it. We will definitely be back again for more!"
5,Very good eggsperience from the service to the food.  Breakfast poutine was nicely presented and the taste blended the flavors very well. Dessert crepes with strawberries and Nutella were delicious.
5,"Came in around 5:00pm, ordered a lamb kabob salad, the person behind the counter recommended a different version of the order I wanted which had more lamb than what I was originally ordered. Food presentation was stellar, the food was great, get the rose water."
5,"Love it) everything is fresh and halal, which was very important for us muslims... I had veggie kabob, it was delicious and not expensive , thank u"
5,"I had a 60 minute hot stone massage as a part of a spa package.  The therapist talked to me before the massage started about areas I may or may not want addressed, the intensity of her massage, and the temperature of the stones.  The warmed bed, in addition to comfortable supports below the knees and under the ankles pending which way I was lying, made the experience even more relaxing.  Every minute of the massage was utilized and was absolutely amazing! I think the best that I have ever had!!  The complimentary wine before the massage, and water provided afterwards, were wonderful as well!"
5,"Tortas Paquime has the best authentic Mexican food I've had in Arizona.
Parking can be a struggle during busy lunch hours but once you get inside it's worth it."
5,"I'd never admit this to anyone but you, Internet.  Because I know you can keep a secret.

I drink at the dog bar and never bring my own dog.  Instead, I sit drinking with my wife and loom over everyone else's pets.  I've twice considered grabbing the cutest ones and making a break for my car.  But then I'd risk spilling my beer.  

I simply can't imagine a more perfect mixture: beer and friendly dogs.  
I honestly believe that if this place had better beer to offer than Budmiller domestic light lagers, I'd never go anywhere else.  But since they don't, it's usually a fun alternative after we get bored at another, lesser, more human-dominated bar in the NoDa vicinity.

Seriously, internet.  You have to check this place out.  Everyone loves dogs.  
What?  
You're a cat person?
Oh...

...stay away from me and my family."
5,"Yesterday was my first visit to evolve, and I plan to go back! Excellent ambiance, welcoming staff, just the right pressure massage. The tea and dark chocolate were a sweet treat. Thank you!"
5,"I purchased a Groupon deal where I got a facial and massage for one low price. I was super excited about it! Whenever I arrived, there was some sort of a mix-up and my appointment was somehow cancelled. Needless to say, the co-owner more than made up for the snafu! It was handled so professionally and kindly that I was beyond excited to go back! 

PS. I want to make sure to shout out to Darius for giving me one of the most amazing massages I have ever had! This place is TOP NOTCH and so warm and inviting."
5,Evolve Wellness Spa is a welcome oasis after a long work week ! Always courteous and helpful to find an appointment that fits my schedule. Staff is so welcoming on every visit to make guests feel comfortable. Massage therapists are top notch !
5,"As you would imagine this place really caters to dogs and does a great job at it.  If your dog likes to play with other dogs you have to bring them here.  It's like a playground for dogs with obstacles, slides, inside and out. The beer selection isn't bad at all, good enough to please the dog owners. for sure.  

Whenever I borrow a friends dog I take them there every time.  This place makes me want to get a dog!

***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***"
5,Best Mexican food in the valley hands down. Food is always fresh and authentic. Friendly staff and it's clean even though it's not in the best part of town. Their drinks and deserts are good too. I have to come here every time I'm in this part of town.
5,"Really fantastic little spa. Reasonable pricing, friendly people, great atmosphere. I was late and they were super accommodating.  The owner was there and very friendly. Got a 60 min deep tissue and it was great. Will definitely go again and may try some other services."
5,"Great place! Super friendly bar tender - Travis. The dogs are off leash so interaction between them is great. Indoor/outdoor space with plenty of water for the dogs. Prices for drinks are fair. Its a bit smelly... But its a dog bar, to be expected."
5,"Awesome, awesome place!!!! These guys are passionate about dogs too. It's cool their dogs are always with them! You can grab food from any local restaurant and kick it (aka drink) while your dog gets out all that energy! Parking can be tricky as NoDa continues to grow. The staff is always pleasant and I can appreciate those amazing drink specials!!"
5,My boyfriend and I were visiting Charolette for the first time and this was one of the highly recommended places to check out. I loved it was located in the Epicenter. The musicians were excellent and played a good variety of all genres. Drinks weren't too pricey. It was a great way to spend a chilly night in a new city listening to good music.
5,People have been telling me about waffle house for years. Last night I had my first experience.  The staff was very nice. The waffle that I had was awesome.  I think what surprised me most was how good their burgers were.  You are reading this correctly. I had breakfast and a burger.
5,"Eggceeded all eggspectations!! The best part of our Montréal visit was the food we ate. This little diner was clean and the people working here are very kind! The breakfast that we ordered (eggstravagnaza, steak and eggs, I can't remember the other...) was so filling. Some of their platters are composed of the best balance of sweet and savory. We came here twice because we loved it so much! Fresh grapefruit juice comes in a big glass, and the coffee is wonderful. Great way to start a long day of being a tourist!"
5,Nothing better than enjoying a pitcher beer special while my dogs get to run around and be social! Lots of delivery food options in the area with menus by the bar makes for an even better experience.... Just don't call domino's - they mess up your order every time. The staff and customers are friendly which keeps us coming back
5,"I am from Northern Virginia and maybe I'm not used to people being nice or maybe the service at Evolve is phenomenal.. I'll go with the latter. Robin at the front desk was really nice and very helpful, she recommended a place to eat before hand and squeezed my boyfriend and I in for a couples massage/facial pretty last minute. My boyfriend said the massage was great and the facial was pretty awesome, it was a chocolate facial (valentines day) and it made me crave something sweet. Once the facial was completed I sat up and found two chocolate covered strawberries for us, talk about service.
I plan on going back to this spa the next time we visit, for Penguins games of course!"
5,Every time we are in town we go and have a great time! The staff is wonderful and the musicians are talented! Great place!
5,I've been here a few times and I'm always impressed by the variety and selection. Last time we went we fasted all day in preparation because the food is too amazing to not try one of everything. The sushi bar has every sushi roll you could dream of and it all tastes great. I'm usually pretty hesitant to eat raw fish from a buffet (seems like a bad combination) but I haven't had any negative effects here. The hibachi grill is also something you should save room for. The only complaint I had was that they have fried crab instead of the steamed crab legs I love. But that can be overlooked since the food quality is excellent. The lower than average buffet price is a plus too. We'll definitely be back again!
5,"I enjoyed my massage. My therapist was sensitive to my individual requests as far as area of focus and level of pressure. The space was very relaxing and smelled extraordinary. Honestly if the scent or aroma therapy products were for sale I would buy it in a second. I felt that they worked harder than other massage locations I've visited (mostly big box chains) to provide a relaxing setting. The space was dark with candles and very low lighting, soft voices were encouraged and a noise machine was also used with music. Also I loved the warming table. It definitely made my week!"
5,Excellent service. Counter person very friendly and helpful. Always smiling and greeting customers as they walk in. Pretzel sandwich was perfect. Boston creme donut very fresh.
5,"I have enjoyed Tokyo grill and buffet for 3 months now. Mostly salad and salmon but the juicy roast beef and the sushi will keep me coming back. Every kind of shrimp dish, Bubba and Forrest Gump would be proud. Believe it or not with all that the people are relaxed, friendly and the waitresses are great too. I will try the hibachi grill made to order next."
5,This spot is amazing i dont understand negative reviews such a great spot with authentic food loved it.
5,"This was probably the least expensive great restaurant I went to in Vegas (OK we're not counting In-N-Out cause that place rocks for $6). SOOOOO many good plates, I mean, I had most of them and loved them, but I wanted to try them ALL!  I am picky about tapas... I lived in Boston and went to all 5 tapas places in the city regularly.

White peach sangria on a sunny afternoon sitting outside with the heat lamps on and yummy, yummy Spanish food.  If that doesn't cure a hangover, I don't know what does.

OK I guess I have one negative thing to say, but it still won't change my rating.. the sangria pitcher is on the small side.  You might need two."
5,"You know how when you walk in a bar, you can love it or hate it, in seconds.  Walking into the Dog Bar instantly loved it!  There are only a few bars that strangers talk to you, I love talking to everyone.  (Now there's a shocker.)  

If you are not a dog person, it might not be the place because the dogs do want to say hello.  It's kind of funny, you know they love going to play, dogs like dive bars too!  

The patrons and staff are friendly and easy going, very diverse crowd, there is no cool factor, thus making it a very cool bar.   And the hot bartender is heavy handed too..  The Dog Bar makes me want to get a dog."
5,"Darius was amazing. One of the best massages I have ever had.( I've had many!!) Feel great today!
Thank you..can't wait to return!"
5,So excited to find a great pizza plus lots more at this restaurant in Langtree. The Grilled Caesar and wood oven pizza were delicious and perfect for two to share. The wait staff elevates the fabulous food to five stars. Highly recommend this place.
5,"The eggs were phenomenal. Whats the secret to great scrambled eggs? Wish I knew because I would make them at home.
The brioche bread served with meal was perfect. Everything on my ""Eggstravanga"" was delicious. I had the first smoothie on the list..can't recall name. 

I was soo full. Ended up taking the rest as take away to eat later. But really good, my meal did not have a greasy feel.

The atmosphere feels very diner'ish. I came off season Monday AM at 11am...not every crowded so seating was very easy. 
Plus it was 5min walk from my hotel...can't argue with that."
5,Great experience and friendly staff. Had a one hour Swedish massage with Max and truly felt the benefits that night and the next day. I struggle with allergies and neck/back tension. The essential oils mixed with his positive energy and strength helped with my sleep and focus.
5,"Wow wow wow

I'm sure $10 is an opening price because it's so amazing. The food is incredible quality- the sushi by far is so good. I wish I had more to say but just GO here to eat and see."
5,"Loved this new spot in Mooresville! Great ambiance and loved being able to watch the pizza makers craft their edible art next to the wood burning stoves! I actually opted for one of the salads and added shrimp-- one of the best, hardy salads I have had in a long time. Our service was amazing, even with a larger group! Can't wait to return."
5,"On a recent trip to Montreal, while caffeinating at Starbucks, we inquired about a recommendation in the area for breakfast and our barista pointed us just down the block to Eggspectation.  This location is in the Old Montreal area, which, as tourists we clearly spent a good deal of time exploring, and, while I found it lacked the charm of many of the other smaller eateries nearby, it was convenient to our hotel, reasonably priced, and easily accommodated our traveling party of six two mornings in a row.

According to their menu, Eggspectation is apparently acclaimed for their many Benedict-style egg dishes.  It's nice when a restaurant lives up to their own hype, because the Russian rhapsody was probably the best Benedict-style dish I've ever had.  I say Benedict-style because it was not plain old hollandaise on there, but something they called Romanoff sauce.  Whatever it was, it was delicious and I had a hard time straying from this to try something new the next morning.  On our second visit I tried the breakfast burger, which was basically a meat omelette slapped on a brioche with lettuce and tomato.  Not as magical as the rhapsody dish, but certainly a big step up from a breakfast sandwich at Dunkin Donuts.  The most indulgent part of our meal here was the breakfast appetizer of s'mores French toast.  Everybody wanted to try it, but nobody thought ordering an entire plate of that for breakfast was such a wise idea, so we got a communal one and everyone got to have a taste.  We are still talking about it weeks later.      

A quick google search tells me that Eggspectation is a chain and that there are a few locations in the US, though none local to me.  I hope they make it to Massachusetts at some point, because IHOP just doesn't cut it compared to this place.  I will say that If you're a traveler who really relishes an authentic experience for every meal in a new city, maybe you want to skip this place as it is, as I said, a chain, but this place really delivered for us."
5,It's the best in medina.  Fresh food. Great service and love the new management    You must try a drink from the bar.
5,"I was referred here by a friend. I was in desperate need for a facial. Their online appointment system was very easy to use. Street parking can be tricky!  

I was greeted warmly when I entered and offered some delicious cucumber water. I was a little taken back though because they automatically told me they were ready to take me back. I assumed there would be some paperwork to fill out like about my complexion, allergies, etc. 

Kristie was my esthetician, and she was very friendly. I selected the ""custom"" facial online but wasn't given any options for customization when I got there.  All in all though the facial was great and I left with my skin feeling ahhhmazing. My sinuses also felt great, I forgot about the pressure points. Which is why I am still going to book another facial with them soon."
5,"I finally made it out this place after hearing so much about it, and the rumors are true - this place is awesome.  My dog absolutely loved it.  It has a large patio with a lot of seating so you can sit back and hang out while your dog runs around and plays with other dogs.  The inside area is smaller, but still plenty of room if you rather sit indoors and keep your dog inside as well.

I was suprised by the beer selection, they seemed to have a pretty good amount on tap.  Being that it was our first time, the owner was extremely nice and helpful and we filled out a form that took about a minute and paid a $10 fee (yearly).  They do not serve food but you can order food or bring it in and eat there.  I def will be doing that in the future since Noda has so many great restraunts.

I was a huge fan of this place, my boyfriend was, my friend was and our dogs were!! Will def be back!"
5,"I always love coming to Evolve. The service is always wonderful, especially facials with Olga!"
5,The pizza here is phenomenal!!  Still in search of other places as good as this one for the pizza.  The atmosphere is meh....but it goes w/the territory on this side of town you know.  Also their house salad dressing is pretty good.  A+++ love this place....
5,"First time here with a group of my friends after a long day of classes and we had a great time, the guy who took care of the order is the new owner and gave us 20% off with our student i.d. and that was awesome, plus the guy was super friendly. My friends and I will be back for the amazing experience."
5,"The tortas are amazingly delicious, but my favorite thing to eat there are the chicken flautas ajogadas."
5,"Had the 3 tenderloin kabob(beef,lamb,chicken) all were juicy and flavorful.. The manager brought me sample of hummus and 1 falafel to try.. Best falafel I've ever had in a while..Excellent wait time and great service.. Definitely will be back to try the shawerma wrap"
5,"If you plan on coming to this location during lunch time, prepare yourself for a line. Although, they were pretty damn quick at making sandwiches. I had to look out side and make sure I wasn't at a Jimmy Johns. lol. Anyways, I ordered the Torta Mexicana with French fries and a drink. I was pretty impressed on all the flavors I was getting from the torta. The French fries were very crispy, and the horchata was on point. I will be returning back to try there other tortas."
5,"If you have a playful pooch, why do you keep leaving him at home to go out with your friends, when you could be bringing him along? The recently renovated Dog Bar is the premier hangout for canines and their owners; and dog lovers without furry friends of their own can enjoy the scene and skip the poop-scooping. Great drink deals, many TVs for watching your favorite teams, and super friendly service. My little man is known by name and freaks out with excitement every time when he realizes our destination is The Dog Bar."
5,"I'm a repeat customer of this business but my 4/2/16 visit was the first time I had a massage treatment. It was phenomenal. I'm somewhat picky because I most often would use Massage Heights and think they are consistently great but thought I'd give Evolve a chance. My therapist was Matt and he truly is amazing. I love Evolve. They are friendly yet professional and it's great to be able to schedule online. Also, go see Keri for your waxing needs!"
5,"Took my kids here today for a late lunch and it was worth it!! This may be the best Chinese buffet I have had in a very long time! The place was clean, the staff was attentive and the food was VERY FRESH! They have a large selection to chose from and everything was hot and delicious(I tried it all lol) The hibachi grill cook was great and fast. The fruit was sweet and juicy and they even have Texas Pete hot sauce my daughters go to sauce for everything(I always have it in my purse when we eat out)  lunch buffet was $7.29 for me and the girls and 4.79 for my son. I will definitely be returning in the near future..this is not your typical Chinese buffet!!"
5,I come to this place a lot.  Sam is the man and the quality of lamb kabob is amazing.  You can't beat the price.   Plus they got free Wi-Fi and plush couches to lounge on afterwards and have some tea and do some work.   I highly recommend it.
5,"I went to Evolve yesterday after having received a gift certificate from a dear friend with the most beautiful skin. I have had  facials in Pittsburgh over the years.
Undoubtably, This was the best. 
Keri hit it out of the park! She is a Pro. Great touch.. the peels and masques felt great.  The products are all organic.. as in completely. I ended up purchasing a few. 

The vibe at Evolve is calm and soothing. Geniveve the manager is lovely.  I was well taken care of the moment I arrived.  
 
The Piéce de Résistance is my skin is still glowing!

This is my  first review on yelp .. Just had to let everyone know.. as Evolve is the best kept secret."
5,"wwoohaaa... I am honestly picky when it comes to pizza, this place deserves 5 stars from me. I love places kike this when it comes to pizza..cozy, not expensive and family owned where you feel welcomed. This is a must place for me now even if I have to drive longer distance"
5,Had a 50 guest dinner catered by Flame Kabob a few months back. Spoke with the owner a couple weeks before to set everything up. Got a great price and everything was ready on time as promised. Multiple times throughout the night I received complements on the food. Everything was warm and fresh. Planning to host another dinner in the near future and will keep this place in mind.
5,"Howlin' good time!  Bar service was good despite the place being pretty full.  The entertainers were funny, very engaging and very talented. They get the entire crowd involved with the fun."
5,Fantastic! Great variety and it is very fresh since they have incredible volume. But the place is clean and seats hundreds...usually no wait timw. They have a hibachi grill and sushi too. I love this joint!
5,Stumbled upon this gem by accident and so glad we did.  The pizza was amazing. We had the sweet honey hot.   Incredible flavor.  Will definitely drive the distance again.   Hands down best pizza I've had in NC.  Friendly staff too.
5,"I just got home from my mini spa / treat yourself day at Evolve and I am feeling SO relaxed & pampered.

I started off my day with a massage by Chris. This was my first ever massage and it was MAGIC - Chris was great and made my first massage a great experience. He is extremely friendly and professional, which helped to put my first time massage jitters at ease.

After my massage, I had a fantastic facial with Julie. My skin feels incredible and she gave me some great at-home tips to help me keep my skin looking fresh and clear all the time. She was also totally hilarious and had me cracking up the entire appointment - I'm not usually one for talking during my appointments, but Julie made me feel like I was just spending the hour catching up with an old friend.

I will DEFINITELY be back to Evolve in the future. Big thanks for Chris & Julie for a great day!!"
5,"First visit to Novanta . Enjoyed a pizza for lunch. 
VERY GOOD. Served with a nice side salad. All fresh ingredients. Cant wait to return for dinner."
5,Went for happy hour and loved it! Great sangria and delicious tapas. Dessert was to die for.
5,Such a fun place to go! I try and take visitors here when they stay with me from out of town. Always a great time with a great selection of music and drinks!
5,Was in town for Labor Day and had a BLAST at this place!  Love dueling pianos. It felt like Silky O'Sullivan's on Beale (but classier).  Will frequent this place every time I'm in town!
5,"Great little spot with very simple and delicious food.  The Greek sandwich is a must try, simply for the fantastic flavor of bleu cheese & italian dressing on a sandwich.  I also tried the lasagna and thought it was almost as good as mine...almost.  Cheap beers (if you've read my reviews, you know this is VERY important) and super fast and friendly service round this place out."
5,"First time i stopped by i tried the chicken shawrma also the appetizer sampler ( 3 flafel, humus and baba ghanosh ) and the bread was made fresh  worth to give it a shot"
5,"This restaurant's atmosphere is something else, set in a small complex ""underground"", it has more of a corner home ""hip"" feel to it. Of course, atmosphere is only a plus the real reason why I came here was for their kabobs.

They have an amazing menu full of different combinations and meats and exotic foods I have never heard of. I ordered what was known to me; the Chicken Kabob plate. However, when ordering the owner, or atleast what I presume to be the owner, talked me up to getting the Lamb Kabob plate, with no fee! This was amazing because lamb is much more expensive on the menu, $6.99 chicken vs $8.99 lamb, I did not complain and happily took the upgrade.

While waiting for my food I comfortably sat down in a chair, specified because they had a lounge area to the side with couches and chairs - something you would see out of a Hookah lounge. 

The food came and my first impression was that it was BEAUTIFUL. The plate was crafted beautifully, and if I figure out how to upload a photo I will. The salad was lackluster at best but that was so minimal that it did not hinder my dining experince. I still ate it. The safron rice was delicious and fresh, the Lamb Kabob laid beautifully on top of the rice looking fresh and ready to be eaten. This is the main dish and rightfully so! It was tender and melted in my mouth with a little bit of chewing. It was delicious. The pita bread and cilantro sauce was just out of this world. If I could, I would have ordered two more orders of the bread because of how delicious it was.

All in all, this place was very delicious and very close to the University, it's a good walk, good food, reasonably priced and has some college kid discounts, like a free drink or water. I will definetly be coming back and this time for a big Chicken Gyro!"
5,I've been going to Evolve for years for both facials and massages. I always get compliments on my skin after getting facials. Everyone is friendly and very good at what they do. Love it here!
5,Great Pizza.  Best Caesar salad (grilled) ever... but it's a crime not to try the lasagna (try adding mushrooms).  Delish.
5,Wow just got a thin mint frozen chocolate with a shot of espresso it is so good made with care thanks Dunkin'!!!
5,"Really good pizza!  A couple of tips tho. The pizza comes out really fast so order just one and share because if you order two the other one gets cold. I would also tell them to slice it in 6 or 8 pieces. 
The salad was fresh with good flavor combo. The staff was polite and efficient. The ambiance is trendy and upscale. Local craft beer selection is great. I will go again and get into the pasta menu."
5,"Just had a great lunch.  Appetizer tray was excellent.  And the grape leaves made by Essam's mom were very good.... oh yeah, try the rose water, very refreshing.  Hummus was one of the best I've tasted"
5,"Love this place. Such a happy atmosphere and great outdoor area. There's a good selection of beers/drinks and they always have drink specials. Plenty of seating area even when it gets super busy. Best of all, the pups always have a great tired and leave tired!"
5,"Love the Waffle House!  Scrambled eggs with cheese and chocolate chip waffles were excellent.  Had the same waiter twice (Jeremiah, I believe) and it was very evident that he's got a lot of enthusiasm for his job.  Hard to have a bad day after being waited on by him!"
5,"We just ate here tonight. The sushi buffet was great with an ample selection of raw, cooked, and non-fish rolls.  The salad bar was great with mixed greens, eggs, fruit, etc.  My favorite had to be the choice of various seafood dishes. I only wish there was a greater vegetable dish selection on the buffet--broccoli mix, green beans, and mushrooms only. 

The dinner price is excellent and we will be back!"
5,"If you want to know how much I liked this experience, I gave a $25 tip on a $35 bill. 

Monika (I believe that was her name) is the sweetest most attentive server I have seen in a long time. Absolutely delightful and made sure we were cared for with refills, cleaning up quickly, a happy attitude and fast. I cannot say enough good things about her.

But that's not enough... I am lucky to compare one Waffle House to another in Tennessee that I went to. Complete opposites. This one was clean...even the usual sticky syrup containers were clean! We sat at the counter so we could see the floor, the storage, the ""back of the counter"" areas and they were spotless. 

So if you get that waffle house craving this is the one to drive to."
5,"There appear to be two types of reviews for the Dog Bar in Charlotte. There are the ""Woohoo! Finally a place for my dog and me!"" reviews and then there are the, ""Yeah it might be a nice idea but dog poo and pee and free roaming dogs acting up... Ewww..."" types of reviews.

I won't criticize the latter reviews, because I'm the kind of germophobe who won't put her purse on the kitchen table, and I take my shoes off when I'm indoors because I think, ""Eww... think about where they've walked!"" 

All this to say that I GET the folks who are less-enamored of the Dog Bar than I might be, and I GET their reasons. But as a woman who wakes up with cats pawing my face (and freakishly realizes where those paws have probably BEEN) I am learning to let go on the germ thing. Which, you kind of need to do when you visit the Dog Bar.

We took our dog Ella to the Dog Bar for the second time on St. Patrick's Day. The first time we took her was last year, when their patio was still gravel, she was still a puppy, and I was a Nervous Nellie about her bothering people or sitting her butt in a drinking bowl. I have loosened up in a year, and she's chilled out a bit. So on our second visit, we had a simply PERFECT time. We planned to spend an hour, but we spent about four instead, socializing with new friends, and enjoying the show as our dog made new friends of her own, both human and canine.

The Dog Bar does not serve food, but on weekends and for special events, they often have food trucks in their parking lot, or you can get carryout from other restaurants in the area. We ate our food from the Maki Taco food truck on the patio tables at the Dog Bar. Yes, dogs had recently lounged on the bar, but our food was protected by a styrofoam barrier, and we took care not to lick the tables.

This year they put down new protective astroturf at the Dog Bar which is permeable, and designed for dog use. Dogs peed and pooped on said astroturf, and it was kind of a ""One for all and all for one"" mentality as the nearest human would pick up the poop with a bag, and hoses were available to hose the rest down through the astroturf. JP took care to point out on the Dog Bar's Facebook page that this astroturf is specially designed for dog use, meaning it's porous and is sanitized each night. I wasn't sitting on the astroturf, so I was no more bothered by walking on cleaned areas where dogs had peed or pooped than I would be at home in my  yard. (Hint, this is why I take my shoes off when I get home anyway.)

The most important reviewer of our experience at the Dog Bar can't type. Her name is Ella, and she had a blast. In fact, she's looking forward to us going again, likely this weekend. If you have a dog, or if you don't but you love dogs, the Dog Bar is a great place for them to hang out. I wish we had something closer to home in Ballantyne, but for now we'll trek to NoDa to give our dog a great day, and to enjoy meeting new people. The Dog Bar is one of Charlotte's most unique experiences, and I loved going and can't wait to go back!"
5,"There are simply not enough words to describe how delicious the food is at Novanta. We took friends, visiting from England, for dinner. They were in awe of the choices, portions and flavors. From appetizers  to drink to entrees to desserts you just won't get better service or food than Novanta. The peach desert was a singular highlight of the meal. It is a generous serving size and looks like you'll never be able to finish it after a delicious meal, but it is so light, before long you've eaten the whole desert. The sauce is to die for! We also had tomato marmalade with goat cheese on crisp pieces of bread. I want a whole jar of the marmalade! This was our 2nd meal at Novanta. It is destination eating when we are in the Charlotte area."
5,It's a great place for your pup to have some off-leash fun with other dogs while you drink. But with that comes the inherent risk of a dog fight!
5,"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Awesome atmosphere. Super friendly staff (Chris, the hostess is awesome). Chicken parm sandwich was DELICIOUS!!!!! Large draft beer selection. Conveniently located at Langtree Village"
5,"I loveeeee this place. I eat there at least twice a week & I'm still not tired of it & don't think I'll ever be! I'm a regular now, that every time I call to place my order they already know what I want & get it ready for me! I recommend Flame Kabob to everyone! I'm vegan so they cater to us!"
5,"Love this place... it's a great spot to socialize your dog and relax with a beer as they run around and play. Our dogs love going here and often play until they are completely exhausted. The bartender is a sweetheart and always greets us warmly. 

Besides drinks you can often chase your beer with a bite from the food trucks that are stationed right in the parking lot on the weekends.

Some clarification -- it seems to me that the people who have poorly reviewed this place don't understand the purpose of it. To be clear this is a bar with dogs (think dogpark with a bar).

It's not a Starbucks, it's not a workspace, it's not your local pub... if dogs aren't your thing or if you get uptight with dogs playing, running, and barking then this is not the place for you.

However if you have a furry canine critter who wants to play and you like beer then it's a winning combo.  :)"
5,We eat at Hunan enough that the entire staff knows us.  My kids and I would eat the sushi multiple times per week if we could.  We have had sushi in major cities around the country (and abroad) and we have yet to taste better than Hunan.
5,Really good kabobs. Clean restaurant.  Not crazy about location but food is worth it. I get chicken and beef special for $10. Great prices and it's a good business lunch spot.
5,"It's a Waffle House, what are you expecting. Yeah, it's bit sketchy-looking. The food is always great and served within 15 minutes of ordering. Oh and need I remind you of the cheap prices. My husband will walk out of there spending less than 20 bucks and when we hit up WH we eat like it's our last meal. 

Can't wait to go back!"
5,"I love this place. I work close to it and love going for lunch. Great selection and I house 2-3 plates every time I go. Their sushi is awesome and the rest of the buffet includes hibachi, Chinese, some American, a salad bar and desserts."
5,"After a tumultuous 6 months, I had the absolute pleasure of finding this place on Yelp and getting a massage from Becky today. She gets five stars for being kind and calm and technically very talented and for taking care of me during a difficult time. I'd like to give another 5 stars to the woman at the desk (whose name I didn't get), she was also a welcome kind soul. When you are from out of town, you never know what you're getting at a spa you've never been to, and today I was a very lucky customer. Hook yourself up, and ask for Becky, she's awesome."
5,"Food is great for the price and made fresh, not sure about the meat to me meat fresh is just butchered, I like to get the Lamb. It has a family owned feel to it ( I think it is, not sure)"
5,"wait - how have I lived in Charlotte for 3 years and not known about this little gem?! I actually love it here! It's a fun spot in the Epicenter for a night out. Grab a table with friends and order one of their buckets.. you'll definitely leave with a buzz after that! 
The live music is great, they're all so talented! I love the dueling piano concepts and the vibe!"
5,This place is eggcellent. If you are an egg lover this is where to go. Friendly service and cool smoothies make for an eggcellent brunch.
5,"GO GO GO!! Go to this place. It is epic! The band is insanely talented. They sing everything from Country to Rap and nail the song every time. Drinks are amazing. They even have these buckets of alcohol that serve 4 people. I was there on a Saturday and it was pretty crowded. Next time I will come early or reserve a table online. But even though we had to stand we had a blast. My bartender was really pleasant and accommodating even though it was busy.

The crowd is young to middle aged professionals. Everyone was really laid back. It's classy but casual at the same time. I will definitely return!"
5,"First, the woman when you first walk in is wonderful. (I took too long to write this, that her name slipped my mind) She easily attended to the people in the lobby as well as on the phone. And made me feel so comfortable on my first visit to their spa. Second, I had a 60min massage with Darius who was lovely. We discussed any issues I had and he explained his method of massage. I would highly recommend to anyone"
5,"Great food lamb is so amazing hard to find a kubideh place that's any good, my new kabob spot in Vegas"
5,"Oh! So that's how a spicy tuna roll is supposed to taste! Nori that's not rubber, perfect rice, spice that accents rather than overwhelming the fish... The Love Boat for 4-6 plus one large roll filled the four of us amply. We each chose one the four different soups, and we were all very pleased. 

We made a reservation for the tatami tables, a nice touch for a long meal. The higher walls around the section kept out some of the background noise from the full house. 

The Green Tea ice cream was delicious and portioned so large that two of us couldn't finish. I was not one of them.

We had very pleasant, non-rushed, service throughout our 2:45 minute meal. 

Thanks for a lovely evening."
5,"Amazing and delicious. Quick and easy to get too. Must try. Oh the tacos, burritos, tortas all are amazing"
5,The food is good and cheap. It's Waffle House so I don't expect it to be fancy. But I will say this is the cleanest location I've ever been to. Each time we've gone the staff has always been exceptionally friendly! Great breakfast and a great price.
5,"This place IS the quintessential hole in the wall restaurant that you always heard about but never been to before. Amazingly enough it is located right off of Central Avenue which is a very busy road but because of the exterior of you would drive right past it and think nothing of it.

 DON'T DO THAT AGAIN!!! Stop HERE and eat! 

Cheese steak Sub JUST DO IT

This place has a chicken parmesan pasta that you could literally eat with a fork if you were 105 years the chicken breast is so tender and succulent. 
One of the best pizzas I've had aside from an actual slice from NY."
5,"This place was really cool!  The atmosphere was casual but elegant, the pizza was amazing and the desserts were uniquely presented and worth saving some room for!  Will definitely be frequenting this restaurant."
5,"My husband and I were in dire need of a relaxing night and Evolve totally delivered! Plus, a very friendly and accommodating staff and therapists."
5,"Best lunch special in LangTree! I came in for a lunch meeting and loved a simple little salad and pizza. It was too much food and well worth the price tag ($11) for the amount of food I received. I took half of the pizza home for an early dinner. 

Not to mention the Caprese App was so great."
5,Fantastico Italian food! This is the real deal when it comes to Italian food. The owners are fabulous people that make a point to speak to their customers. Staff is awesome. They were willing to help me custom order a dish to my liking.
5,"For facials, Keri is amazing! The best facial I've ever had. I will never go anywhere else. She uses Rhonda Allison skincare, which is hard to find around here. It doesn't get much better as far as skincare lines go.  I recommend her to everyone I know. For massages, Kylie was incredible. She was so comforting & was really great at targeting the spots that needed extra attention. I will be giving her card to anyone I know looking for a excellent massage therapist. Front desk staff are always welcoming & friendly. Top notch all around!"
5,Absolutely love this restaurant!! The food is always fresh and cooked perfectly! I always order the vegetable steamed dumplings and for my main meal I order the seafood nest with no potato basket! I love it!
5,Absolutely delicious.   Perfect kabobs.  Melt in your mouth. Perfectly seasoned rice.   I will definitely  visit on my next Vegas trip.
5,This place is awesome! Everything from service to food. Best mediteranian food spot in town! SERIOUSLY! GIVE IT A GO
5,"My partner and I went to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba on our last night in Las Vegas because it had been recommended to me by a friend who visited recently.  The wait for an inside table was 30 minutes, but they had patio warmers outside so we were seated immediately - and we were toasty warm throughout our meal!

The service was excellent.  Not only did our waiter keep our glasses filled, but when he noticed we were running low on sangria, he suggested another half-pitcher.  When I asked about vegetarian options, he went over the entire menu with me and pointed everything out.  He brought all of our food out as it was ready, which is a great way to have tapas - you can nibble on each dish while you're waiting for the next one.

The food was quite good.  I am normally very picky, but I really enjoyed everything I ordered!  I recommend the spiced ""brave"" potatoes (they are actually new potatoes) and the potato-and-onion omelette which came with a great sauce.  We had two half-pitchers of the passionfruit sangria and really liked it - we are not normally sangria fans but this one was great!  And best of all, the entire place was reasonably priced.

We had a great time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and I definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the Strip area of Las Vegas."
5,"I visit the Dog Bar one a week I think. I looooooove this place. It feels like I am walking into a friend's house every time I go there. The staff are unbelievably friendly. They always make me (and my dog) feel very welcome. They have a different drink special every night which is nice for us folks on a budget.

My dog is a rescue dog, so she was very shy at first when we starting going there. Now whenever I walk to my car with her, she is dying to hop in the back seat because she knows that means it's Dog Bar time.

Thursdays are $3.50 draft beer night, which includes all the local beers. They have a nice selection from NODA and Birdsong Brewery.

If you have a dog that is nicely behaved, then venture out to the Dog Bar. Your pooch can play with all the other dogs while you kick back a few tasty beverages and watch them at play. It is really great to be able to go out to a bar and bring your dog with you.

Love this place!"
5,"It doesn't get any better then this! You get to drink and relax while your little animal runs around having a grand ol' time! We brought some take out food with us and enjoyed it with the great beer specials and selection. Lots of local crafts, great music, and great patio. They've got a great thing going here. Me and my fur ball are definitely new regulars!"
5,"Very good chain of breakfast places.   The waitress was smiley, efficient and helpful.  

We got some basic egg breakfast dishes....all good...all big plates.

They have a large menu with lots of choices, from pancakes to crepes, to eggs, omelettes, etc...you will not be disappointed...   My Belgian waffle with fresh fruit was awesome...every bite of fruit was fresh tasting.   Beautiful presentation ...."
5,"I went to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for light lunch and the famous sangria recommended by fellow yelpers. I sat in the patio where breezes from Wynn accompanied me during this warm afternoon. I absolutely love my Peach sangria which was more fruity and sweet compared to my friend's raspberry sangria which tasted more red wine. For tapas, we ordered seared sea scallops and chicken & ham croquettes. The scallops were good, crispy and have nice texture and favors. The croquettes and sauce made good toppings with the complementary bread. (See food in my pics) 

I want to thank the waiter and manager who served my table and made this a five star experience. After drinking much sangria, I dropped some croquettes sauce on my white top while I was eating it with the bread. I asked the waiter if it would be possible for me to clean the mess when I asked for the bill. He told me I should try using soda water. To my surprise, he actually came back later on and brought a table cloth with soda water and let me try to remove the spot. Service does make a difference in a place like Las Vegas where good restaurants are everywhere. Thank you Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!"
5,"Came back for another facial! Juli was fantastic. Super funny and knowledgable. I told her what I had elected online, but compared with what issues I have with my skin, she recommended a different set of products. So smart. It was a great time. 

This is such a nice spa! The atmosphere is so great, honestly you don't even realize you're in the middle of Shady Side."
5,I am impressed with the food and the quality! Service was great! Clean! A must try for everyone!
5,"We went with friends tonight to Novanta for dinner. 

For starters, the place is absolutely beautiful. I loved the decor, this is truly an upscale restaurant which I am happy about. We need more upscale choices at the lake, we lack them in this area. 

We started out sharing 3 salads, the Dolce, Rustica and Caesar. The Caesar had a beautiful presentation. The romaine was grilled and crispy with a lightly drizzled caesar dressing (which was some of the best I have had) and shaved pecorino romano. It was served with toasted bread. We all loved it. 

The Rustica had grilled artichokes, mozzerella cheese, roasted peppers, tomatoes and prosciutto. It was more of an italian flavored salad and also enjoyed by all of us. 

The Dolce was equally as delicious and tipped the scale for 3/4 of us. We LOVED this dressing as well as the sweet and salty flavors. It was a sweet dressing and on the salad was candied walnuts, tomatoes, purple onion, goat cheese, pancetta and raisins. Can you say YUM??!! 

We then ordered 2 pizzas with veggie toppings. They were really good pizza's. These pizza's are Neapolitan style which are much different from their other restaurants which offer NY Style. I had only had Neapolitan style pizza a few times prior so don't have much to compare it to but did like this pizza. It was the size of a personal pizza (maybe around 12"") It was a good size for one or 2 people or even for a nice appetizer for the whole table. It's definitely not a ""traditional"" type of pizza (with lots of cheese and heavy sauce), that many of us are used to, but very delicious. I would advise that if you try this place, you don't think you are walking into Brooklyn South because this is a very different style pizza, it's straight out of Italy. This is not NY style pizza so don't think you are ordering this. They nailed it, if you know anything about Neapolitan pizza. I did have to add salt but I salt a lot of things. 

We also shared 2 pasta dishes with the table. We had the Orechiette and the Strizzo dish. The Orechiette was good but the Strizzo was out of this world. We were all shocked at how good this was. It was zucchini and squash ""pasta"" (it was shaved to look like pasta), with the most incredible tomato cream sauce on it.   We all asked for more and more bread to dunk in the sauce until we finally ordered another one for the table. We all dove in and devoured that plate as well. We couldn't believe it wasn't pasta! It was delicious!!! This is one that I'll be craving and going back for. We call couldn't get enough of it. 

Unfortunately they don't have desserts until another week or so. We did request to see the menu and were very happy with what we saw. We are looking forward to the cheesecake and the dessert donuts. :)  They sound delicious!

So that's my review.  I was so excited to try this place as we kept hearing about it. But, I was a bit hesitant based on the reviews they had been getting on Yelp. Nonetheless, we decided to go and check it out. The owners also own other pizzerias in town and before moving out of state a few years ago, we would frequent Brooklyn South on a weekly basis. It was by far our favorite pizzeria. These negative reviews on Yelp, didn't make sense based on the food we have eaten at their other restaurants.  Their quality is superior in their other establishments. 

I have been to many other restaurants when they first open and know that it takes a few weeks to work out the glitches and get things right. I don't get these negative reviews on Yelp, as that was not our experience. The owners even came to check on us (and other tables), and wanted our opinions on how we liked the restaurant, and acted as if they genuinely wanted to know. We actually gave them a few suggestions, like to add a shrimp or chicken (add on) option to our favorite dish. The owner was very open and appreciated the suggestion. I also am a business owner and know the work it takes to open something and get it right. I love my yelp app and value it very much. I use it all the time for restaurant reviews. I think some of these other reviewers have been a bit harsh as this place hasn't even been opened for 2 weeks.  (IMHO)"
5,"This place is the place to get  a heartybreakfast especially if you like a full satisfying breakfast. Ate here with the family twice -we had a French toast (brioche -amazing),pancakes ,bagels -tried a lot of different things everything was great- they have large combination breakfasts that we were able to share between two people- the latte was great fresh squeezed orange juice was also good -service was very friendly -nice location spacious large benches to sit on -prices were good for the quality and amount of food"
5,"I have been going to the House of Pizza for over 15 years! Each bite of each steak and cheese sub gets better and better as the days go by. I live in another state now but when I visit Charlotte this is one of my must stops and I am never ever disappointed! Thank you, House of Pizza for being an amazing constant source of great good and fond memories!"
5,"Wow this place is amazing. i got the special that came with 2 eggs (i got them over medium) hash browns (capped & smothered meaning mushrooms and sausage gravy as a topping on the hash browns which was amazing) 2 slices of ham, 2 pieces of bacon, two slices of toast and a waffle of your choice.

First of all this place is not called ""Waffle House"" for no reason, Absolutely the best Waffles here than i ever had anywhere else... and ive had waffles all over the damn place. Outstanding staff they were very nice and on top of things, if i ever come back to AZ i would come here first before stopping by at any other place."
5,The atmosphere is super cool and cozy. I love that you can watch them prepare all the food. Good selection of craft beers. Wood pizza is great as is the toasted Caesar salad. My kid loved the lemon sorbet (sorbet in a real lemon). My only complaint (and I'm reaching here) are the icky paper napkins.  We will be back!
5,"This place is great. I've been following Becky for years and it's been a pleasure to get worked on in this space. The other staff are friendly, the prices are fair and it's extremely relaxing in the massage rooms. I try to go every time I'm in town."
5,This is the best pizza I have ever tasted. It is different from the typical Italian New York or Chicago pizza you know. The folks are the most friendly I have met. Order the Sushi.
5,"Visited the House of Hunan in Medina more times than I can count. Always have great sushi but tonite (feb 8) was the absolute best we have ever had. Don't know if they have a new chef or cuz of Year of the Snake celebration, but it was excellent!!!"
5,"Had a great experience! It's always weird when you walk in and you get 13 ""good mornings"" but it's nice. We got to choose our seating and were promptly greeted. Tameka was our waitress and she was SUPER nice. She has great customer service skills. The food was delicious and cheap, definitely not healthy,but on my budget I can't care today. Definitely recommend"
5,"Our favorite buffet to go to. Went for Mother's Day and was not disappointed, thy handle large crowds well and never ran out of food."
5,"Have been waiting for them to open! Went tonight. Place is beautiful, clean, well lit, the staff is super friendly, even stopped to play with my 18 month old son and gave him a balloon, so hes a customer forever. The food selection is astounding! Many chinese, american and japanese dishes, ALL delicious. I had 2 very well stacked plates and never got to try everything that looked good. Huge sushi and hibachi stations, both very well stocked, and they even have an ICE CREAM SUNDAE station! All for $9.99 dinner and $6.99 lunch, which includes EVERYTHING! I have found our new go-to chinese place!"
5,"Don't waste your time or $$ going to any other Asian buffets in the Charlotte area. Tokyo Buffet blows them all to smithereens. I've been to sushi only buffets that didn't have the selection this place has. Seriously it is head & shoulders above buffet sushi pretty much anywhere I've ever been aside from perhaps RuSan's (in Atlanta, have never tried RuSan's in Charlotte but I hear they also do sushi buffet lunch). They also have a really big (and separate from the sushi thank God) hibachi build it yourself grill. The actual ""regular"" buffet itself is like 3x bigger than anywhere else. The food is always fresh and turning over because this place is always busy. We went here right before closing one night and it was still packed. Nothing but fresh. It's clean for a buffet, I don't feel sketched out about the quality or origin of what they serve like some places. It is also blessedly not full of MSG. I couldn't eat here if it was. They always have a huge variety of stuff. My husband and I live 45 minutes away but we still would rather go here than anywhere near us because those places suck so much and cost the same or more, we don't want to be disappointed. I wish I could get this place to open another location near us, but it's ok. Be warned though: once you try Tokyo Buffet, everyone else will just be too lame to bother with."
5,"The pizza is a traditional Napoletan Pizza which I have never tasted in Italy but heard that it is supposed to be softer and slightly higher than the traditional Italian pizzas -- thin and crispy. I have recently traveled to Europe and had opportunity to taste it there. I went in for lunch today and I can say this meets what the restaurant is presenting. It is authentic as it gets! 

However, I like the pizza to be thin and crispy but I am not saying this pizza was bad at all, it was great for what style it is and truly lives by its name - Neapolitan pizza!

I will be back for the pasta, from the pictures they look amazing and also there is no garlic used here at all THANK YOU VERY MUCH! All the so called ""italian"" restaurants overload on garlic, that is not Italian cooking at all!

To the bad reviewers, specially the vegetarian one... get a grip! If you are vegetarian go eat in a vegetarian place and don't come here complaining about lack of veggie options."
5,"I went in to Flame Kabob for the first time to redeem a coupon for a free kabob and wound up adding a full lamb kabob platter.  The owner was incredibly personable and took great pride in his food, chatting with us about the origin of his produce as we waited a short time for our order to be prepared.  I have to say I was highly impressed!  The food's flavor and texture was fantastic and the drink selection (with free refills) was immense.  I highly recommend the lamb kabobs and the sour cherry iced tea and look forward to returning to this little restaurant in the near future."
5,"This place is so good. Had the bagel breakfast sandwich and it was delicious! Friends had French toast and eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce which he said was amazing. Service was good. The food took long to arrive, but it was worth the wait. FYI, even though it's Canada, they serve American bacon  ok with me! If you're in town, I recommend you to stop in. You won't regret it."
5,"Great spot to relax the day away! I loved my massage with Genevieve! She worked knots out of my back that were there for months! Kristie gave me an amazing facial and manicure that's going to make me feel like a million bucks all week! Honestly, this little spa in this little house is so warm and inviting I can't wait to go back!"
5,"My friends and I love this place! If you ever win a Happy Hour party from them--use it!! Word of warning though, it doesn't include a table reservation!

This place can get really crowded the later it gets, so make sure to get there relatively early if you want a guaranteed table. The crowd is a pretty varied age range, usually running from college graduates to mid-40s or so.

We especially like this place because it offers a lot of what other Charlotte nightlife places don't: seating, and lots of it! We can just sit, watch the show, listen to the performers play Gangnam Style, and have some drinks without feeling like we're in a trashy place. You can come to this place in just a cute top, jeans, and flat shoes, no need to get all gussied up like your'e going somewhere that thinks it's more important than it really is! The dress is pretty casual, no one dresses really ""fancy"" or ""ghetto.""

Fun fact: If you get the munchies you can order food in from places in the Epicenter like Libretto's! They'll bring it to you!

Also, the staff has been nothing but nice to us when we go. A while ago we met the guy who made the jello shooters for the night and complimented him on how great they were. Come to find out he had just experimented with some lemon-flavored liquor and strawberry flavored jello and had no idea how they turned out. He was glad to know it was a crowd pleaser!"
5,"One of the best Mexican places I have tried in Phoenix. I tried the Nachos once but I didn't like them. It didn't have melted cheese, wth! Nachos should have melted cheese not shredded. I don't know if they're always served like that but I wouldn't try them again.  However, I LOVE their carne asada torta! I love the bread, I love the savory taste of the meat! I love this place. Their salsas are good and the amount of avocado they use in the torta is good too. I also like their aguas frescas. They are not made from concentrate like most places. They truly taste good, they are super sweet though, but my favorite is the lime one because it's not as sweet.... but it's still pretty sweet. I like the corn in a cup, they do not use canned corn which is a huge plus. I also like their strawberries and cream. Yum! They're sweet bread is good too! I would try to get it as fresh as possible though. But that's with any bread. :)"
5,"Where to start...Persian cold ice teas, sour cherry and Rosewater are fantastic.  Appetizers: BabaGanoush and the Hummus are perfectly made. Entrees: ground lamb kabob is best in Vegas. Stews are fantastic and ""Ash"" soup is great. Decor is great but styrofoam plates don't meet the same high standard of the food. Entree prices between $7-$15 with appetizers between $2-$5. Enjoy!"
5,"The hummus, falafel, rice, kabob's and everything here is home made. I have looked for a place like this for the past 12 years and finally found it. Best Arabic food in town. Good quality and FRESH..."
5,This is my second time at this location. The service is great and the food is also. Came on Mondays special buck 50 waffle special and it is great. Hash browns are good extra crispy. Thursday seems to be the best deal with the $5 all stars combo. I like the breakfast all star best.
5,"It's a bar dedicated to the dogs! Love the concept and the service from the bartenders. As someone who just moved to the area, I felt a little nervous my first time as everyone seemed to know everyone, but instantly was greeted by the bartender Deidra and I think she could tell I was new. On my next visit she remembered me, which made me feel really welcomed. Back in Florida, I was a regular at the dog park, so I'm glad I've found a place up here that my dog and I enjoy!"
5,"I won a free Happy Hour party and celebrated my birthday there on May 15th. My guests and I had a blast!

I really enjoy going to Howl At The Moon. The music is really good and it's just a great place for a fun night out with friends!"
5,This place has so much selection it would be hard for even someone picky to not find something. Good price and you definitely get plenty to eat! Everything I tried was good and fresh And hot! Sushi bar is amazing I've never seen such a section! Will be coming back soon. Good sweet tea too:)
5,"Might be a little on the pricey side for Mexican food but the quality has consistently been there on my visits. Along with very nice bilingual cashiers. 

Huge menu but what I've tried so far has been great. One of the best horchata I've ever had too."
5,"I LOVE the dog bar. 

First of all, I should mention, I am a huge dog lover & own my own pet care business so I am obviously not phased by dogs playing, barking, pottying, etc. As you can see from ratings, most of the poor ratings are from people who do not like seeing dogs potty nearby... do not go to the Dog Bar if you don't want to see dogs pee/poop. 

Other reviews mentioned being ""snubbed"" because they didn't have a dog along. I would still go to the dog bar if I didn't have a dog. Everyone I've met at The Dog Bar seems to be very nice and friendly. I can see how some people might feel left out without bringing a dog along.... but, I mean, it is The DOG Bar.. 

The concept is wonderful, of course. Dogs + drinks + dog lovers + NoDa food options + Dogs!! = happiness. 

I love bringing pups here, meeting new dogs, and seeing them all interact. My friends have trouble getting my attention at the Dog Bar. I just can't help it with so many adorable pups around! It is also nice to be around so many like-minded dog lovers :). 

Based on 2011 reviews, they must have hired all new staff because I have been served by 3 different people at The Dog Bar and they were all wonderful! Their love for dogs was obvious and they are always so happy to be at work, meeting other dog lovers. Occasionally you have to speak up for a drink, but that makes sense to me... people politely sitting at the bar are harder to notice when there are tons of cute pups & friendly people around. 

You can order food from anywhere and bring it in to eat. I love this. There are SO many delicious places nearby.

The Dog Bar is one of my favorite places in Charlotte!"
5,"I looked online today and they are indeed reopened! Now I can indulge my favorites like the cheesesteak, lasagna and pizza. They were closed for so long I was starting to wonder if they would ever open again. There are huge improvements. The parking lot is not full of holes anymore, the dining room is much larger and there is actually a separate section for carry out orders. I'm so thrilled!"
5,"Nothing short of an amazing experience. Amazing food with a wide variety, fresh sushi, and friendly staff. You won't find a better meal for $9!"
5,Tokyo Grill is our go to restaurant. This is a huge restaurant. They offer a huge variety of food. Love the sushi! The service is excellent. The quality of the food is outstanding.
5,"Great breakfast place around the corner from our hotel. We ended up eating there twice during our five-day trip. The food was very good, the service was great, and it was a nice place to be, too."
5,Waffle House continues to not disappoint. The quaint establishment has great options for any time of the day. I definitely recommend the Texas bacon cheesesteak melt plate.
5,"Basically the best buffet for sushi that you'll find in the area!  If you're here for the sushi, you're in the right place!  Other favorites include crab rangoons, fried zucchini, philly steak (the thing that looks like a pasty!) and any of the sesame, general tsos, etc style chicken.  I'd avoid most of the rest of the American options are a little yuck but who's there for that, anyway?!"
5,We eat here once a week to feed our giant kid.  He eats vegetables and eats healthy.  Love the sushi and my son loves the hibachi which is cook to order.  My husband loves the fresh fruit and seafood.  The food is delicious!!!!! I am a regular!  The price is very reasonable which keeps us coming back often.
5,"I love this place. Had a going away party for a co-worker there and it was great. It cost me nothing, the guests ate for free, got great drink specials and the music and staff were incredible. If you live in the Charlotte area and you haven't tried this place, you're missing out."
5,Wow I had amazing service here!! Christina attended me and she was probably the nicest person who has ever given me coffee. Waiting for the next visit. :) better than Starbucks guys!!
5,"A haven for dogs. 

A bar where dogs can play with each other (inside, outside, behind the bar, on top of the bar...). There is a lot of outdoor space too with tons of seating and tables and a fire pit. Drinks arent necessarily cheap, but they have some good specials. Being they allow dogs inside, they dont serve food, or use glass (we don't want broken glass shards in puppies paws you know), but you can totally bring whatever take out food you want with you. Its normal to see pizzas, snacks, chinese food, you name it. 

I love this place because my dog does. There is a huge variety of people that show up, from people just coming to play with dogs (there's usually more dogs than people) to the guy that brings his pack of five, young girls that have no clue what to do with their dogs training, the guy that im pretty sure just showed up to hit on girls with puppies, older citizens with their older companions. Everything. And usually, people will want to talk about dogs so if you're bored at home and your dog needs something to do, this is your place. I see lots of people just buy sodas too, so don't feel obligated to purchase booze to go to this bar. Oh, and bring some hand sanitizer or wet wipes with you. Stinkey dogs abound.

If you are visiting (with or without a dog)- don't really plan on going anywhere nice after, your clothes could get doggy. While most dogs are well behaved, that one owner that doesn't pay attention/who fell behind on training/ who thinks its cute when muddy/drooly fido jumps all over you, will probably show up. All in all, most of the dogs are really great and the owners do well at training them. But one rambunctious untrained dog can really ruin the dynamic.

Tips to people who would like to bring their dog:
-Its a $10 year membership for each dog. Bring their rabies info with. The people with dogs not paying that day already have memberships, don't feel bad about it.

-If your dog is not already trained to listen to you, its not going to magically happen here. People want to bring their dogs to be socialized, which is good, but they also miss the part that the dog needs to be under control (meeting a ton of new dogs is already exciting enough for your pooch). If you need to sit there and scream at your dog for it to stop and come back to you, your dog isn't ready.

-The other dogs are usually medium to large sized. Usually small dogs would be fine, unless a bad owner brought their crazy dog in and its making all the others rambunctious. 

-When you arrive, there is a double fence. You can unleash your dog in the middle of the fences, then let them into the bar so they're not stuck on the leash when the pack of dogs crowds the gate to come greet the new people.
TIP- try to come in quickly, before all the other dogs notice someone is at the fence. It will get really crowded near the gate, and youre more likely to get jumped on if you linger around.

-The bar doesn't ""allow"" jumping or humping, so feel free to get the dogs paws off the bar if you don't want it near you, or please break up any humping that may happen, even if its not your dog. Also, its hard to always see your dog, so if another dog poops near you, it'd be swell if you could scooper it quick so others don't step in it. Scooping poop is better than cleaning it off your dog later!

UPDATE 4/5/12: The previously dirty gravel patio has been upgraded to a wonderful turf system that is santitized daily (and now I can actually wear normal clothes here! The previous patio made everything, and everyone, filthy). Five stars!!"
5,Staff is always super friendly and professional. The atmosphere is welcoming and relaxing. Olga gives the best facials and makes you feel super relaxed! NEVER a bad experience.
5,"this is not a high class joint. its a classic 
the staff is different but wonderful
i have been going to this location once a month for over 8 years
the people have changed the feel has not 
had a chef who made pancakes for my friends little girl 
we thought the manager would freak out 
... no he got the girl crayons and some milk for it"
5,This place was awesome! Great layout! Lots of authentic food from start to finish. The tacos were fantastic as was their corn and green chili soup! The staff was friendly and helpful. They offer flavored frescas (I had strawberry mango) which is basically fresh fruit flavored water which was delicious! They have a wide array of desserts as well which we didn't have a chance to try because we were so full but next Time!
5,"I've actually been here twice, and the falafel was great. I wanted to particularly give it 5 stars based on my second visit. I go to school across the street and was totally craving one of their falafel sandwiches. When I got there, he said they were out of them (I guess they make them daily). I was bummed because I'm vegetarian and falafel is the best dish at a Mediterranean restaurant. The gentleman at the register was awesome enough to have them prepare a batch fresh for me (so long as I didn't mind waiting a little longer for them to prep it). Great food, great service, and the price is good."
5,"I am a spa regular in my hometown of Washington, DC, so I'm picky about the facility and therapists. Looking for a girls' weekend treat for my sister, I found Evolve on Yelp. The old house in which it's located is spacious and walcoming, in no small part to the staff. I worked with Becky and my sister worked with Helen, and we both had 90 minute Swedish massages. On par with the best I've had in DC and beyond. 

Helen and Becky were both technically great, as well as having a really good sense for 'reading' clients. Like silence during your session? No problem. Like talking during your session? No problem - they're both professional and very friendly. The manager, Robin, is delightful, and made the visit extra-special for us. She also took the time at the end of the day to share some of her favorite kale recipies with my sister. 

Highly, highly recommended.
Note: a vegan mani-pedi is offered.

EVOLVE MONTHLY CLUB PLAN: They offer a monthly 'club' plan where you pay $59/month auto-billed on your credit card, and in return you not only get your choice of a 60 minute massage OR facial OR mani-pedi, you get a standing 'club rate' of $59 for any ADDITIONAL services you buy during the month. That's amazing for 'frequent fliers' - and you get the traditional spa experience, instead of the more clinical ""physical therapy"" feeling that comes with massage chains. I've never seen a private spa that can compete with the chains with a club like this - please patronize this wonderful local business!"
5,"This is probably my favorite location in Las Vegas now.  The staff is always friendly and the customer service is over-the-top good.  They have a very good selection of donuts and other pastries.  The coffee is always good and fresh and it is a very clean store and laid out well.  They also have a drive thru which is very convenient.  They definitely need to go give a Customer Service lesson to the stores on Durango/Spring Mountain and West Charleston a refresher course.   I also like the fact that they stay open until 9pm, where most of the stores close an hour earlier.  It's very strange that they close so early here in Vegas.  Most of the stores in Texas are open until 10 or 11, and some are even open 24 hours.  I wish that at least some of these stores with a drive-thru were 24 hour stores.  But nonetheless, this is a great store."
5,"In my opinion, they have the best pizza I've eaten since I left Pa. in 1985.  Their subs are good,too, but their pizza is the best."
5,So I was in the area last week for Thanksgiving and had heard that an authentic wood fired pizzeria had recently opened so had to check it out.  Well it did not disappoint!  Coming from NYC I'm used to having top notch pizza options back home and this place knocked them out!  Pizza was amazing and loved local brew options. Can't wait to be back in the area!
5,"One of the best massages I've had!  Becky was wonderful and extremely professional.  Will make this spa a ""must do"" whenever I visit Pittsburgh!"
5,"Really good Chinese/Asian food in Medina.  They have several choices of seating types.  The General Tso's Chicken here is good.  The hot mustard is awesome here, it really goes well on the egg rolls."
5,Great great place to eat the food is fresh. The restaurant is clean. And friendly. One of the best mom and pop places to go
5,"I always eat from the hibachi grill, it's always super yummy! I don't generally eat foods from a buffet but the food is good and the staff is always super friendly!!"
5,"The place is awesome. There are different types of items to choose from, burros, tortas, sweets, and ice cream. Must try the torta ahogada its  a savory torta with grilled pork or beef, with avocado lettuce & tomato on a telera roll covered in a delicious tomato based sauce and topped with fresh cream. They make their own ice cream here and it is the best. Try the pinenut. Very clean and awesome service. Definitely recommend."
5,"WOW! Visiting from out of town and so glad we stopped! 

This place was extremely clean first off, and the food was outstanding. It has an amazing selection of seafood, which I was told by a reliable source was amazing! ( I can't stand seafood, but my mother, whom was with me, would sell her children in a heartbeat if it meant she could eat seafood.)

The sushi and Hibatchi bar had lines, but worth the wait. 

It was PACKED! Keep that in mind if you are nervous in crowds. We went on a Saturday, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. There were several large groups of people there celebrating one thing or another and several small parties (2-4) waiting to be seated. Some waited 20+ minutes to get a seat, a testimony to the deliciousness of the food. PLUS several Asian families were dining there as well. As with any foreign food place, if the people of that culture eat there, you know it's good.

Excellent place!"
5,Our dog loved his first visit there yesterday.  Great for dogs of all ages and the staff was incredibly friendly.   Will be coming back often!
5,"The tortas are so delicious and the service was fast. Being Mexican myself, this is now my favorite torta restaurant. May I recommend the Torta de Milanesa de Res."
5,"WOW , they exceeded all of my EGGSPECTATIONS !!  This place was such a good find in Canada , I was so pleased with their food. After walking for my hotel my friend and I were of course famished. So we looked up the reviews and this place was A1 among the tourist as well as the locals. I was afraid that the wait times would be outrageous because the reviews mention the long waits. We went it and we were seated after about 6 mins of waiting not too bad. The service was ok the first time around. I went on two separate occasions and the service was perfect the second time around. 

Now in Canada you are expected to tip , they literally look at you like you're crazy if you don't tip. The service could be horrible and they still expect a tip. 

The food is amazing honestly and truly."
5,"I love love love this place. The staff is super friendly and personable. I have always felt welcomed whenever I come. (By the people too) 

The beer is reasonably priced, and a great selection. NODA brewery has a strong presence here. 

I recommend anybody with a well behaved dog to come, or even if you don't have a dog you'll have a great time."
5,"Ribeye tacos!!  Heaven. Trust me, I was born and raised in Mexico city and that combo of little home made flour tortillas and beef colliding  with lime juice and salsa... Brings me back home..
Congratulations Tortas paquime. 
Tortas good not the best 
Place is spotless!! And their bakery is sensational. 
You have to eat here no matter what."
5,"I used to live in the East coast and visited my local Dunkin quite a bit. I was sad to see so few Dunkin locations in Vegas, so after this location opened up (near me) I was excited. This is easily one of the nicest, if not nicest, Dunkin locations I've ever been to. HIGH ceilings, SLEEK interior, and CLEAN. I drop by and order a coffee at least once a week. I never tried the food here yet, but did have a couple of donuts and its exactly as expected. The atmosphere is what brings me here over and over again."
5,"i am a UNLV student and i always stop here in between my classes for lunch. always had the gyro, but last time i tried the kabob #9 it was great to try something new in there, i had beef,lamb, and chicken ground all good but my favorite is lamb"
5,The best pizza in Charlotte! Subs are out of this world delicious as well! Best ingredients. Homemade salad dressings! Quality.
5,This place is amazing and their food is out of this world!! The food is so good and fresh! Customer service is great since its under a new management !!! Love the people that work there! Cant wait to go with my friends there for their hookah nights!!
5,I have been eating here for years and their pizza continues to amaze me! My go to pizza is the house special. Their subs and pasta dishes are also delicious.
5,We had an awesome brunch today ! Food was very delicious and our server Martini was exceptional ! Def stop by if you are in Old Montreal !
5,"Amazing coffee, and amazing customer service! I would def recommend the hazelnut coffee. Hands down way better than sbux!"
5,"if you're looking for relatively cheap food (~$20/person) and lots of selection, you should try it.

i go here everytime i go to vegas. the past two times i've been here, we've stayed at the Palazzo and Encore and since cafe babareeba is located inside fashion show across from Wynn, it's a really close walk. their service is quick and they have indoor and outdoor seating, whichever you prefer. 

i love their food! recommended choices: seafood paella, white peach sangria, the bacon wrapped dates, and the potatoes. 

next time i end up in vegas, i will definitely eat here again. it's great for a lunch meal and it is gauranteed to fill you up"
5,"I have been here five or six times, and each time I have had a great experience.  The food is very good, and is also reasonably priced.  The sangria is delicious, and the atmosphere is very cool.  They do a great job with big groups as they have two rooms that are both very nice and private.  If you are on the strip and like tapas you have to try this place."
5,The food is always very good. The baklava is home made by the owners mom and it's incredible. They are always friendly and I enjoy coming here. The pistachio saffron ice cream is to die for!
5,"We attended a free Kellie Pickler concert here last summer.  How awesome is that?!  I don't live in Charlotte, but if I learned stuff like that happened very often, I might have to reconsider!"
5,"If you like ""old school"" pizza and sub joints (not decorated by some MBA, pastel vinyl freak), this is your place. It sits on Central Ave, just over the Eastway intersection (heading towards town), on the left. The neighborhood demographic is changing, so it's become a little out of place (yes, that's an OOB Waffle House next door and a Hispanic Western Wear a couple doors down).

I have an indecent love for their cheese steaks and Greek subs. I alternate between the two most of the time. I've had their pasta (great) and their pizza (also great), but the subs are what I keep coming back for.

Being a true ""Child of the South"", I won't try to compare the cheese steaks to anything from where you used to live up North. All I know is I like them as well as any I've found in CLT. Loads of meat (with just the right amount of what I like to pretend is just ""juice""), onions, and cheese. The meat has a hint of (Greek?) seasoning which I suspect gets put into everything in the place. Served with rippled chips and a pickle spear.

The Greek sub is another thing altogether. Roast beef and other cold-cuts on a hoagie bun, oozing with some mysterious sauce which is apparently the result of an evil lab experiment directed at completely dominating my waistline.

I alternate between the two, and there is always a mental tug of war over the choice.

There have been a lot of cigarettes smoked, beers drank, and pizzas sliced in this place over the years. Decor is pretty much unchanged from when your parents went on dates here. They have a jukebox and daily specials.

In my bachelor days, ""House of Pizza"" was one of my regular haunts. Since getting married and moving to the other side of town, I don't get in there as often as I should.

NOT A CHAIN, LOCALLY OWNED, GOOD FOOD. If you need a more corporate experience, there's an Olive Garden on Independence. Shame on you if you miss this place, though."
5,"The best place I have been to for sushi in Ohio. If you go for dinner on the weekends, the person that knows how to make the ""tomato roll"" is there (raw tuna wrapped around crab, mango, avocado, and maybe spicy shrimp). Otherwise, you can't go wrong with the New York City roll. Thai coconut soup is very good, too."
5,"Ladies, have you been looking for that place where you can go with some girlfriends, kick off your shoes and have some drinks at reasonable prices? Every once in a while, do you want to plug in that curling iron, slap on some makeup, put on that pushup bra, and go dance on a baby grand?

Gents, have you been looking for that place where you can go with some buddies and find these girls?

... Look no further. A group of my girlfriends and I did the former. Free admission was very nice, so be sure to print out those passes. 

I don't know what people are talking about, but the entertainers were great. The feeling of the entire place was very inclusive, and the band was cracking us up every minute of the night. 
Yes it's hard to get a table because they host a lot of parties, but there's nothing wrong with going up to the front of the stage with your drink to get a better view. Remember, you meet people by dancing with people at this place. 
They keep the back double doors open to the patio, so people can take their drink, go have a smoke, and talk to folks while being able to hear them. 
I'm not sure why people are saying that their drinks are overpriced. I'll be honest when I say that I'm not sure what they are individually, but here's how my evening tab went [I had a friend visiting that I was picking up the tab from, so don't think that all this is me being a crazy lush]:
2 incredibly dirty martinis
2 margaritas
3 bahama mama buckets (cost split between 4 people)
------------------
38.00

To me, that is reasonable, and a little bit above. That, coupled with good friends, great entertainment, general hilarity, and the fact that I didn't see one person who wasn't having a rockin' good time, makes me give this place five stars."
5,"I visited Charlotte to see a Panther's game. On Saturday night 2 of us visited Howl At The Moon. Everyone there was friendly and seemed genuinely glad that we were there. We had a great time and a special shout out to our server Mel and the performer Cat. 
If you are in town and you don't go to Howl At The Moon you are missing a great time."
5,"First time here. The most entertaining breakfast experience ever! So much going on today. Coffee machines are down, which isn't good for a breakfast place. But the repair guy is here along with a delivery in the back. These ladies don't miss a beat though, service was amazing, food was hot and delicious. They greeted every customer as they walked in the door. Thank you for the hospitality!"
5,Walk in and had no clue what I was looking too eat but the cashier was very helpful and I order the lamb and chicken kabob with humus and I loved it. The price was very fair so I left there happy and full.
5,"The people that work at this Waffle House are some of the best out there and other servers need to take note.  The cooks listen clearly on how you want you food cooker and get it done right quick.

Highly recommend this place."
5,"Wonderful experience. Celebrated bf's birthday and everything was perfect. We had a light dinner to save room for drinking later at the club. Great service and delicious food.

We ordered:
Paella
Stuff Mushroom
Short Ribs
Chocolate Cake - on the house for bf

Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars
Parking - 5 stars (plenty of parking spots)
Restroom - didn't go
Wait - 5 stars (no wait, we had reservation)"
5,"We did my best friends bachelorette party here this weekend. We all couldn't say enough wonderful things about this spa & business!!

Thank you, Darius! So much for an amazing massage! You are well worth the drive (we live an hour away) and I most definitely will be coming back and making steady appointments. 

He really focused on my target zones and truly listens. I feel like a completely new person! He taught me how important self care as simple as a massage is for this hairdresser. We totally connected as if I gained a new friend! 

All in all. Thank you for the best experience possible!! This is the place to go for personal attention!!"
5,Truly love this place. Staff and patrons are so friendly not to mention all the great pups!
5,"This is one of my favorite places. This tortas de puerco taste just like the ones from Tortas Paquime in Nuevo Casas grandes Chihuahua I loooooove it! Out of all the locations this is the one and only I like always clean, fast service and delicious food. Ooh and im a big fan of their jalapenos toreados yuuum!"
5,"The servers and joint here is LEGIT. Amazing omelette, waffles, bacon , eggs, steak all cooked to order. No microwaves here! Our server amber was great. Hash browns smothered and topped and waffle was freshly made on a griddle. Joint was clean. Will return. Friendly helpful staff"
5,"Wow, such an awesome place to eat. My sushi was great.... Alaska roll!!!! And my green curry was great as well!!!! I'll definitely be back!!!!! So looking forward to my next visit!!!!!"
5,"I used to enjoy this place when I lived in Chicago so I was eager to find out if the Vegas location lived up to the hype... 

This review is for happy hour only, which is fabulous. 3-7 PM, and 7 days a week.. YES happy hour on weekends too, a rareity! Nice patio on the strip.. great atmosphere

Sangria pitcher (6 cups) $24.95 (half price for happy hour). Solid sangria. and at ~$2 a cup for happy hour.. great price. Honestly the sangria at Tommy Bahama's is much stronger, but this one is nice because you're not getting loaded at 4 PM when you split a pitcher 3 ways. 

Food ($3 each for happy hour): We had the chicken empanada, the ham/tomato toast, potatoes, and bacon wrapped dates. All were awesome, and in particular we loved the bacon wrapped dates. None of the servings were huge.. but for $3 they were about right on. I would not, however, find this place a good deal at dinner. 

All in all, we paid $12 each (with tax and tip!) for sangria and some yummy appetizers. Definitely check this place out between 3-7.. it's a great value, particularly on the strip where things tend to get expensive."
5,"Tonight my wife and I decided to try out Novanta we were looking for something new in the area that is not a chain. So she suggested we try out Novanta saying she was pretty sure they were owned by the same owners as Brooklyn Boys Pizza in Mooresville. Which we both like and I can say with moderate certainty its close to New York Pizza. The space is dark and rustic and very comfortable and is very nicely decorated. The Whole Restaurant is done in reclaimed Brick and Wood from a warehouse in the Bowery in NY, simple and beautiful in design but enough on that. We decided to eat at the bar which was really nice because the Bar faces the windows so you looking out at the Christmas tree in Langtree and not at a wall of bottles. We were told that during the summer the windows  open and they will probably have stools outside so you can be at the bar but be outside.
Our bartender Amber was very attentive and gave us the run down of the menu and the what beers were on tap. My wife went for a glass of Pinot grigio and I decided on the AssClown Winter release. Decided to order appetizers and a pizza to share to get a good review of the menu. So I had the Antipasto sushi I don't remember if that is the exact name but it was very good it was mozzarella which they make in house, basil and some meat I was so hungry I don't remember what It was. my wife had the antipasto for two which was a nice assortment of cheese and meats. The ricotta is made in house and it came with prosciutto and salami,olives. Food came out hot and fresh and it was awesome. Wood fired pizza comes out with a little char it's not burnt in the least so don't listen to other reviews when they say it's burnt. If they think that is burnt they should,d definitely not try coal oven pizza, like frank Pepes in CT. We met one of the staff Mitch because he curiously was wearing a hard hat around the restaurant. Well after seeing that we had to ask why,come to find out it's because he is pretty tall and has nearly knocked himself on several occasions. So good food and nice beer selection friendly staff overall I don't think they are going out of business any time soon with that formula. So I would take some of the negative reviews with a grain of salt especially anyone with only one or two reviews. This is definitely a new destination for dinner out I highly recommend it take the negatives again with a grain of salt I don't know why everyone has to be such an *^%#% when reviewing somewhere new."
5,Was sad that they were closed or so long but was so happy to hear they reopened so I can enjoy my Large Chicken Strips sub with Ranch on the side.
5,"Need a  night out to let your hair down?  Well look no further than uptown Charlotte!    I fell in love with Howl @ the Moon in San Antonio Texas, so whenever I have an opportunity to visit Howl at the Moon in another city, I have to do it.     The musicians are great, and they make it alot of fun.   Don't know the words to the songs to sing along -- who cares, make something up!   The drinks are a little pricey, but they do have drink specials so it does not have to be a high dollar night.    I will warn you that if you get easily offended or not wanting to sing, have fun and laugh -- I would say skip the piano bar completely.  These entertainers and the patrons like to get loud, sing, dance and let loose and that is exactly why I keep coming back.     I cannot wait to visit Charlotte again in July!"
5,"I had a sandwich from here some time ago during a meeting when the folks made a food run and I was asked what l wanted. Best I could muster up was, ""what ever is good"" I was brought the roasted turkey. Might i say, best Mexican sandwich EVER.  I mean it was so good. You just have to come and try it for your self. I was given a menu and immediately searched for a place near me and viola, I have been here a few times already. Tonight I will try the Cubana.  It's one of those places you'd never think of going to. First off, this place is clean, I mean clean. It's a nice little place, parking kinda sucks but the food rocks. That is all."
5,Such a great experience with Becky. Very relaxing and she asked what areas I wanted her to pay attention to before starting. I was able to just close my eyes and relax in silence the entire time and feel totally comfortable. Definitely recommend
5,"Very pleasant experience. The only thing to keep in mind is that they only accept cash for tips. So you need to prepare around $30 cash per person before arriving, or they do have an ATM, which requires extra fee."
5,"Highly recommended! I decided to have lunch with a friend at Novanta. It was a overall great experience. Customer service was great, restaurant and restroom very clean. I ordered a Eggplant flatbread it was AMAZING!"
5,"I like this place for  five stars because their service and the food its very good






I like their Nachos with Carne Asada, the ribeye tacos are awsome.. And I love the ice creams!"
5,"You know, it may be crowded on weekends, hard to get a seat, drinks could be slow getting to the table - I've experienced all of these things on my four or five visits to Howl at the Moon. But, each visit, I've had a phenomenal time with friends, singing, laughing, drinking and dancing in my chair. Each time I leave, I think, ""we have to come back here again soon "". So, how could I not give it a five? My favorite girls night out destination."
5,"Great service, a lot of menu options. Big place, not crowded. The food was great ! First time having poutine, and I enjoyed it. Has some cocktail brunch options available as well, including mimosas."
5,"Stumbled upon this place while visiting Montreal and it was eggsactly :D what my friend and I were looking for. 
The service was great! The waiter gave us a map after breakfast on places to visit and see. The food? Delicious! It is a diner style restaurant with a yummy menu full of savory and sweet dishes. It was difficult to choose just one item, so my friend and I ordered 3 different plates. 

The breakfast pizza was perfect for my hangover. My friend ordered the eggs benedict and then we also shared an order of pancakes. yum, yum and yum!

There is nothing fancy or unexpected from this restaurant. It is simple and perfect for a nice breakfast in this neighborhood."
5,"Large menu to choose from which is always great.
Prices weren't bad at all for what we ordered.
Great food! 
Great service! 
What more can you ask for?

I recommend anyone who is passing by to stop here and gab a bite to eat. 
I will definitely come back"
5,"Dee is the jewel of this place.  I want to bring her back to Chicago with me!!! Wow, personality, warm and inviting I swear I walked into a friends house.  I LOVE the patriotism GOD BLESS AMERICA! Everyone knew each other's name, just simply amazing.  I will rave about THIS place to all my snowbirds back home.  So so so so sooooo clean and upbeat.  I'd really consider this the heart of breakfast in Arizona. Thank you yelp!"
5,"Had a lot of fun visiting The Dog Bar. Love the concept and can't believe places like this don't exist everywhere! Very social place and I was happy to not see any issues break out between any of the dogs.

Does not serve any food, but there are usually food trucks around, or you can pop into any of the other great restaurants in the area."
5,"This is my favorite place to go for Mexican food. I go there about every week since it is close to work and the food is great everytime.
It is very clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. Open kitchen style so you can watch the goodness being made. They grill my carne asada each time right after I order.
They are known for there tortas but I'm more of a burrito and taco guy so I almost always get the burrotote which is a carne asada burrito with beans and cheese. The meat is flavorful, the beans are amazing and the cheese they use sets it apart from the rest. I really enjoy this burrito if you can't tell.
The tacos are highly recommended as well.
You will not find a better chips and salsa anywhere else!
They have ice cream as well and it is very creamy and delicious. Also the Paletas are great too!
I give tortas paquime my highest recommendation if you want authentic flavorful satisfying Mexican food!
Now if only they would open one in Mesa then we would be set!"
5,"Wow! So glad this place opened! Ambiance was great, my kids loved the fish in the beautiful fountain, and the food selection was everything you want from a buffet. Largest and most delicious sushi selection I've ever had at a buffet. Will be coming back soon!"
5,"Earlier today, I visited Evolve Wellness Spa for a massage and I'm still smiling about my experience. I LOVE massages and I get them often and I can confidently say that this massage was one of the very best ones I've had in my life.  Heather was very attentive. She is such a skilled and gifted massage therapist. I'm SO thankful she was available. I keep thinking about how she made that hour feel longer than it was because she didn't make me feel rushed like some massage therapists can. On a very chilly day, the room was warm and comfortable.  The massage table had the softest linens EVER. From the moment I walked into the spa, I felt relaxed. The lovely woman behind the front desk greeted me by my first name and made me feel very welcomed. I quickly grabbed a brochure because I intend to return VERY soon."
5,Super fun! Looking for something to do while you drink? Come here and pet some dogs! Insider tip- bring your leftovers in a bag/box from where you just ate and the dogs will all be attracted to you and your wonderful smelling bag. Now if only I had a similar trick with the ladies...
5,"Are you one of those people that feels guilty every time they leave their pups at home?  Well I am I always feel bad when I yet again leave the house and my little pups sit at the window and wonder why they can't come with.  Well problem solved (as far as grabbing  beers and cocktails)  The Dog Bar in NoDa is the perfect place to relax outside with your pups grab a few drinks, hang out with friends, and hopefully meet some new human and canine friends.  At least you know when you come to the Dog Bar you already have something in common with the people that hang out there!

I love the Dog Bar now I must admit my dogs can be a little neurotic so I needed to check the place out by myself before I actually brought them with me.  Its great that the dogs are free to roam around the bar, you may have a dog next to your feet, standing on the table beside you, begging for a sip of your tasty drink but they are all having a great time.  Looking forward to some nice weather and outings at the Dog Bar this spring and summer!"
5,"Stephanie was amazing! She was knowledgeable, friendly, and recommended the right facial for my skin concerns...which was perfect! I am still seeing results from it and could not have had a better experience. I am beyond thankful for the expertise that she provided and will definitely be back again!"
5,"Today was my boyfriend and I, first time eating here! It was amazing and such great customer service. We told our server that it was our first time and she recommend us so many options. I don't know how to spell her name, (sorry). But she was super friendly, made us feel comfortable and welcomed. Way better service and food here than at the Denny's across the street hahaha! I ordered an omelet which was soooooo tasty! It was stuffed with ham, cheese, jalapeños, onions, yummmm! Best omelet I've had in a while! It's a simple omelet but bursting with flavor! I'm glad we decided to give it a try."
5,"The food was AMAZING and the service was fast.  But the people here were the best part. They were friendly, considerate and made us feel welcome the whole time."
5,YUM!  Found this great little place while looking at running boards for the pickup right next door.  Soooo glad we grabbed a bite!  Everything on the menu looked amazing and fresh!
5,"Oh my goodness.  Darius and Flynn gave my husband and me the best massages of our lives.  We've gotten many a massage (on cruise lines, spas, etc) and this was absolutely the best.  Worth every penny.  The atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxing.  Darius asked a few times during the massage if I was comfortable, but not so many times that it became annoying.  

Tips are CASH ONLY, so make sure you have some cash on hand.  We made the mistake of forgetting cash and needed to run to the ATM afterwards."
5,"We noticed another location yesterday and when we were in old Montréal we decided to do late lunch here.  

It was pretty quiet so service was quick and efficient.  I tried a savory crepe and my wife chose a chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. But the star of the meal was the sweet potato fries!!

Overall quality was high and the price was really reasonable. Recommend for those looking for a sure thing good meal."
5,Keri was the most amazing wonderful woman I've ever Met. She was so sweet and kind and I would drive an hour again to see her.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! We went out with our girls a few weeks ago here and had a BLAST! Drinks-awesome! Bartenders-on point! Band-no words... amazing! Wish we had gotten there earlier as the crowd was gettin' it!! Definitely plan to go back in April with the girls and party!!! :-) xoxo
5,"Always love this place... It's a great place for pasta, pizza and sandwiches. Make sure to go and enjoy"
5,"This is an excellent Italian option in the Lake Norman area. They have authentic Italian dishes, as well as Italian-American. 

Wide variety of pasta, calzones, and pizza. I also love the local beer selection including choices for Ass Clown, Birdsong, Wooden Robot, and Noda. They offer flights, too! 4... 5oz. pours for $7. 

I chose the Lasagna Calzone. The crust was delicious, the sauce and homemade ricotta were perfectly balanced. I did not want this dish to end. The crust and sauce were so good that I think we will be going back for pizza next time. 

A little pricey, but well worth it."
5,"Really delicious chicken tacos, bean and cheese burrito and twin burritos. Glass bottle soda and spicy guacamole. Very delicious and reasonably priced. Less than $20 for 3 plates"
5,"I love it here. And I go at least once a month since I purchased their monthly auto-pay package (comes with other great options to save). I've sampled a lot of the services and think they are all great. Since yelp seems to filter so many reviews with names, I'll leave those out, but you'll find all of the massage therapists to be wonderful. The acupuncturist is also great -- he does a comprehensive pulse check each time. So glad this place is here."
5,"Holy seaweed salad! I have never had a better General Tsu's chicken in my life. This is one of best Chinese places I have been to. The restaurant is really cool too. The decor is very modern and the atmosphere within the restaurant is really electric. We have been here a couple times just for post-meetings and what not. I would love to stay one night for drinks but haven't got around to that yet. I have never been here and had a bad experience and I will definitely recommend to others! 

if you like Chinese, give Hunan a try!"
5,"I have been in Evolve Wellness Spa for past two years. I visited there at least once a month to get a massage. I experienced massages from all female staffs except one, and I will talk about the best three female staffs (I have never gotten massages from male staffs).

Kalina - She is my most favorite one. She has a massage style closest to chiropractic one. Of course, she doesn't twist your neck or waist. Rather, while she gives you a massage, she gives you a light stretching of your body. She also has powerful fingers. So if you want something less than a chiropractic treatment, but more than just a massage, I recommend her strongly. She also has a fastest massage speed compared to other staffs. She works fast not to miss any of your body part she can massage.

Rachel (Not Rachael Janelle who I haven't tried yet) - If you want more relaxed, soft styled massage, go for her. She has a similar massage style to Kalina's but with less force and no chiropractic component (no stretching). 

Helen - I think she is most experienced female massage staff in Evolve Wellness Spa. She has a massage style between Kalina and Rachel. Only one negative thing about her was that when I got relaxation massages from her about a year ago, she charged extra $10-$15 for her massage oil. I am not sure whether she still charges extra money for her oil. Please ask a receptionist about extra charge when you make an appointment with Helen.When I got Hot Stone massage from her, she didn't charge extra money. 

All these three massage staffs have great skill. They just simply have different styles. They also always give you a full time massage (55-60 minutes for 1 hour massage, 85-90 minutes for 1.5 hour massage). They are also friendly, don't hesitate to tell what you want. Also, I am still a student, and not a most generous tip giver. However, they always treat me well."
5,"First time here on dec 13th and was very impressed... the pizza snob says two thumbs up for Novanta.  Everyone needs to understand that this is not New York style pizza. It is very good but don't be going in expecting to get a slice of New York style pizza.  The staff was very friendly and one of the owners came up to the table to talk to us about our meal. They have just been open for a couple weeks and the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. If I any complaints I would say the food is a bit pricey but definitely well worth it.

Update, second review ate there two days ago and everything was great. The pizza was absolutely incredible."
5,I love this place. I'm gluten sensitive and I can eat their pizza. My kids love it too!
5,This was an amazing breakfast experience! The server was so kind and friendly and the rest of the staff were also friendly and responsive to our needs. The food was really good and filling and there was a lot of it. There are many options so everybody will find something that they like.
5,"I had my first facial here and it was really nice. Kristie was my technician, She was extremely nice and listened to my concerns concerning my face. I left feeling very relaxed and beautiful."
5,"I crave this pizza. Super amazing vibe inside, great service, great craft beer offerings. Diverse pizza menu. Wood fired thin crust. Great little side salads."
5,"Incredible food, amazing service!  One of the few places that serves up lamb kabobs without including beef in it, which is great for people like me who don't eat beef.  The lamb and chicken kabobs are delicious, and the persian rice is so fragrant and flavoUrful.  The pita bread is made fresh in-house, and while a little more dry than I am usually used to, it has the rustic feel and taste that goes great with their kabobs. I also like the yogurt-mint-dill dip that comes with the kabobs. Ihaven't tried their lunch combos, but they're very reasonably priced, so I will definitely check it out soon."
5,"Great food. Fast, friendly service. Bright, colorful atmosphere. We highly recommend!"
5,"Great place for breakfast. Eggs were spectacular and so was the French toast. Fruit was very fresh. Service was super nice and attentive. Great food at a great price, considering the area is pretty touristy. Highly recommend this spot if you're in Montreal!"
5,"Evolve is amazing! I organized a spa day for a group of six, and the staff was extremely accommodating. Each of us had multiple services done and we all enjoyed them tremendously! My massage with Becky and facial with Audra were blissful.  The spa atmosphere was both welcoming and relaxing, and the prices were very reasonable. We can't wait to go back!"
5,Went there for the first time today after driving 2000 miles across the country. My Escalade was filthy and covered with bugs. They were very thorough with getting all of the bugs off and cleaning the inside.
5,"Here again for an oil change for my 2nd car. Just can't get enough of the great service Jim and his team provides every single time! If you want a great experience plus great service then come to this location and tell Jim that's Jonaz the amazon guy sent you so he knows you've heard it from me on yelp! Jim and team, thank you for everything every single time!"
5,Went there with my daughter for lunch today. The food was great. I had the lobster roll and it was fantastic. My daughter had a poke bowl which she loved. I can't wait to go back.
5,"Have always had a great experience with Hi Tide and whenever I have my lil two year old in tow, they really accommodate us and make us feel welcomed--the servers interact with the lil guy, made sure we had options for him to eat and ensured he had enough POG to drink!  We always order the poke nachos."
5,"I love knowing a business is investing in and supporting their community, but that's not the only reason to love Voodoo.  The art displayed on the walls, ceilings, and throughout the interior is not the only reason I love Voodoo either.  Being able to bring my dog (on a leash) and buy a frosty brew is not the only reason why I love Voodoo.  

So why do I love Voodoo?  To put it simply: it's freaking good beer.

It's creatively brewed craft beer with personality.  On a hot June evening, the garage doors are open and I was introduced to the Met-Mosa.  To the uninformed, that's their Grand Met Belgian Triple mixed with some orange juice.  It's better than your ""summer shandy"" - it's refreshing and oh so tasty.

Whether you're a fan of hops, stouts, or Belgian beer, Voodoo will put a spell on you."
5,"My Wife and I love it here. We were greeted right away from the lovely staff at the door. Seated right away and was served by an awesome waiter named Gelly.
  We ordered apps, the usual awesomeness called the bruschetta, to die for. As well as the veggie Mucho Nachos with guacamole yummerific.
  The Mains were Chicken Parm and I got the Smiling Buddha salad....I would definitely get this salad again. Chicken breast with strawberries,pecans,apples....incredible.."
5,"I don't understand these low reviews. If you have common sense and you actually listen to the techs or Jim, they are explaining what they diagnosed and they tell you the recommendations they know you need to have a better outcome in the long run. 1st and foremost, if your going to leave a review on yelp, please speak proper English not gibberish or broken English. I'm not trying to be mean but as a user we take these ratings seriously. I'm a mechanic myself but don't have the time to do small things like oil changes and flushes but that's why I go to Jim here at Meineke. When they talk to me, I listen first to see their point of view. Then decide from there if it's something I want to do or have Jim and his team do it instead. This location is the best out of all the meineke's in town. The other locations are owned by a different owner and I always had a bad experience with those locations except this one. Since day 1 of discovering Jim and his team, I've always had great service, great communications and Amazing timing on any type of service!!!"
5,"Great. Just great.  I am a fan of high ABV brews, and this place certainly didn't disappoint. I had a flight and my partner had the popular Big Black Voodoo Daddy. I can't complain  about any of it. From ciders, to IPAs, to Belgium Triples, they seem to have it all. They also have a kitchen in house, which is really nice. Not too much in the way of vegetarian fare (thus the 4 stars), but the Margarita pizza I got was still pretty tasty. My partner had the salmon cakes. She enjoyed those as well. And who can pass up the purchase of some cook glassware and a growler? One of the best things about the place was how open  and inviting it is. The front doors were open, because it was a nice spring night, and the bar wasn't too crowded. Even if it had been, I feel like I wouldn't have felt crunched and uncomfortable. Definitely a revisit in the future. Thanks for the great experience."
5,"Great ambiance and classy location. Tried their sparkling lemonade and chicken fingers....must say really tender meat. Went at the last moment so couldn't order enough, but surely going back to try more varieties on their menu."
5,"I have to tell my honest experience here.  I was on my way home from San Diego to Denver with my kids, and my wheel started making a horrible grinding noise and vibration, and we barely limped into Las Vegas.  I am in school full-time, and my finances are very limited.  I was so worried that this was a huge problem.  I took my car to these people, and they told me that all four caliper bolts were loose, and one was missing.  They tightened all bolts and replaced the missing bolt.  They charged me ZERO.  They could have been dishonest and told me that there was a more serious, expensive problem, but I was treated with honesty and kindness by Bruce and Jim.  THANK YOU!!!!"
5,"Great vibe and fantastic craft brews in an artfully restored century-old fire/police station ... don't miss the 2 cell jail tucked around the corner from the arcade. Ask about the line running down the length of the bar.

I really enjoyed my experience at Voodoo Brewery, great example of the unique small-scale  innovative entrepreneurs popping up in old Homestead!"
5,"Bringing VooDoo down to the Burgh is the beginning of great things, I can feel it! I've visited their Meadville brewery often, and just love it, so this opening just means I have a never ending supply of Wynona's Big Brown Ale. 

If you've never been to the Meadville brewery, you're in for a treat. The place has to be one of the most unique spaces. It's not just the fact that the building itself is an old municipal building, but then throw in the hand painted/chalk/spray paint art on the walls and even ceilings and you've got a great vibe going.

Right now they're only serving beer, but I imagine it's only a matter of time before they get a kitchen (the food in Meadville is great!). Plus, I hear they've got some great food truck options coming up, so stay tuned to their FB and Twitter feeds for news.

I tried the sampler of 6 beers (YES 6!). A lot of them were on the lighter or IPA side, so my fave was still the Big Brown Ale. I did try a sample of their Big Black Voodoo Daddy (which wasn't included in the sampler), and it was awesome! Next time, that's my first choice!

You can also pick up growlers and four packs of their brews to take home. But stopping in for a brew is just so much better!"
5,"I cant speak for any of their other food here except the late night breakfast menu egg sandwich with bacon. 

SERIOUSLY?!!!! Me and my friends had one (each) at 3:30 am, and it was THE most delicious egg sandwich this side of the rockies. 

The place doesn't look much more than a fast food chinese counter, but the eggs were fried, the swiss cheese melty, and the bacon crispy delicious, all served on a buttery piece of toast. OMG we actually went back the next night at 3:00am, YEAH IT WAS THAT GOOD. perfect comfort food for the drunken hearted."
5,"I saw the oxtail soup from the Yelpers and I had to go get some especially since I'm just across the way. I was highly satisfied with the soup, the broth is very flavorful and the oxtail is so tender that it falls off. The broth reminds me of the pho broth. The employees were very helpful and generous with the portions. Let's just say that the employees hooked it up. THANKS! My eyes were bigger than my stomach, it's ok though, I'll have leftovers for the next day."
5,"Love the atmosphere here. It's totally fitting of the name. Everything in the decor seems to be recycled and turned into something else for example old doors served as tables and the no surface, ceiling included was left untouched by art. I enjoyed how the space looked small but didn't feel that way at all. The bar is almost as big as the never ending craft beer menu. I had the love hop and it was a bit on the sweeter side but super enjoyable. Also try their meads as they totally steal the show. The blackberry Raspberry mead was nothing short of amazing. Last but not least how could I forget the staff? The staff were very helpful and make you feel cozy. I'll definitely be checking this place out again. Heads up though the parking can be a bit much to figure out but it's worth it."
5,"We had tickets to the masquerade party at the 9 in the Vault it was our first visit to the 9 Metropolitan and I have to say it was a delightful surprise, compared to any club on W6th. The club itself has a cool design with all the old vaults and seating areas. The hors d'oeuvres were great! The kebabs a favourite. The desserts also amazing with bacon cream puffs and pumpkin cream cheese mini cakes, we were all pleasantly surprised. They were mixing top songs in a show tune manner that was fun and enjoyable. The staff were on point, everyone serving and working were all very courteous and accommodating to me and my friends. We had a great time and definitely will be visiting often, can't wait to come in this summer and check out the rooftop bar. 
A+++ great experience"
5,"I love Voodoo. I never have had a bad time or a bad beer here. 

It's such a cool space - I think it's an old firehouse (?) and they've got plenty of seating. (long community style tables.) Even during prime time, it's not too crowded. Service is always so friendly and quick.

Beer selection is awesome! They have a good variety, which is my big gripe at other breweries, but not at Voodoo! I recommend the flight."
5,"I have nothing but good things to say about this Meineke and their staff.  The GM, Jim was friendly and did not speak down to me because I was a woman (as many other mechanics do).  He explained the needed repairs and even recommended how I could save money on the bill.  

I will be coming back for my future auto needs, including oil changes.

Thank you, Jim!"
5,This is the best car wash in the valley! The  people are helpful and friendly. I won't take my Mini Cooper any where else.
5,"Hehe I loved this bar! It had the BEST ""Love Appletini""'s everrrr! they were so good I bought 9 of them. lmfao"
5,"I literally loved this place! It was my first time here and I was not disappointed! I came for the food truck event so there were plenty of options; however, they do also have their own menu. The beer was awesome, everyone was super friendly, and they have board games and an arcade! It is the perfect place to hangout and relax! I will 100% be back!!"
5,"This hotel is absolutely magnificent with a hipster vibe!  I want to go back to Cleveland just to stay in this hotel again!!!

The staff were friendly , helpful and made you feel at home.  The hotel is tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. Our room was one of the most unique and fun rooms I have ever stayed in and I've stayed in a lot of hotels.

You will not be disappointed if you choose to stay here!"
5,Good friendly place. It is better than others jack aster's places in the city. It get better after midnight. Beautiful ladies show up.
5,The chalk art around this place is AMAZING. $2.50 tacos on Tuesdays and $10 beer flights. Best mojito I've had in Pittsburgh. This is a hidden gem
5,Thank you Jim for taking super good care of me and giving me the best deal without me stressing!! I super appreciate how much they care about their clients and try to give them the best route as possible. My car now sounds like a perfect purrr now  Customer service is absolutely outstanding!!
5,"This place is so cute! I love the atmosphere, the food is really good. I got the ahi tuna nachos and it was so flavorful, the price point was amazing, and you got a lot of food. Very filling. The customer service is really nice too. I love the open raw bar they have, it's a great lunch spot for sure"
5,"Good beers and a cool scene. The neighborhood isn't what I'd call posh, but welcome to the Burgh."
5,"jim, ricky and the team are amazing!!! if your having troubles with your car or need an oil change go here. spending a lil more goes far u wont regret it."
5,"One of my favorite places to drop in for a drink when visiting the MGM. Located at the MGM Grand, its right in the casino, but its a good way to get away from the casino floor for a while."
5,"Loved my poke rainbow bowl,  just with a few tweeks. I got it with no cabbage or cucumbers but added wasabi peas, edamame, pepper flakes & cilantro. I highly recommend their creamy sauce, taste like a lighter spicy mayo. All of the other sauces were much more of a thinner liquid & clear ish. Their super kind worker let me try a good portion of their options, which I didn't expect at all but I'm glad bc I don't think the others were my type, but they were interesting. I'm sure the plus is that It is healthier. 
The bd tried the lobster roll which he said must be their huge seller bc 4 out of 5 people ordered it when he kindly glanced at other guests plates. It was tasty, semi sweet & he absolutely loved it. It was on the small side for him (if he was starving) but the plus is they give you great quality portion, big meat but smaller bread. It's a good thing he had breakfast. 
Their strawberry cooler I liked better than the peach tea. Strawberry had more flavor and the peach tea was more of a light refreshing taste but I still liked both. Big plus for having infused water and I like their ice! Not cubed, not slush, but good. And I adore the fish lines they painted in the parking lot instead of the regular straight line, never seen that anywhere else! Would love to come back for the oysters, we thought it was a good price."
5,The hotel fabulous! I have no complaints. An employee named Thomas from the kitchen helped us with the elevator which was very confusing. While assisting us he told us all about what this hotel had to offer...making our experience the best!!
5,"Great hotel for the price!

Stayed here when my parents and I went on a roadtrip to Pittsburgh and Cleveland. This hotel was cheaper than the one in Pitts and it was better. Walking in I felt like I went back to Elvis Presley time because of the red and black velvet feels incorporated within the lobby. 

The front desk guy who helped us check in was super friendly. This is a dog friendly hotel because we saw residents with dogs come in and out throughout our stay. While we were checking in, a resident's dog ran up to the front desk guy and he told us the dog knows him because he always gives him treats (irrelevant but thought it was cute.) He gave us a quick tour and sent us up into the elevator.

The elevator was so cool!! I don't know if this has been around, but this was the first time I saw it. There's an electronic touchpad where you tap your room key on and then you tap the floor you have to go on and then the pad will tell you which elevator to go to. I thought it was pretty cool!!

When we stepped into our room it was HUGE! It was the longest hotel room we've ever stayed at and it felt like an actual apartment. The decor was gorgeous, the room was clean, just fantastic! It was a very modern vibe, which I love. I don't like the old victorian hotels because they seem outdated and old.

One night we ordered room service, I got some kind of shrimp pasta, which was a VERY small serving for the price but what do ya expect? Room service food is there to rip you off but when a girl is hungry, you gotta do what you gotta do. My dad also ordered a piece of chocolate cake as well as a coffee pot that had 3-4 servings. The worker that brought it to us was very nice and was super helpful and hospitable. As my dad was making his coffee he realized she forgot the cream (or sugar I forgot) but without even calling she sent someone back up to give us what was missing.

My parents and I are super clean freaks and we notice every little thing but our hotel room was spotless and super clean!"
5,"I came here for lunch and had a poke rainbow bowl, it was really good and probably the best poke in Charlotte. The service was great! I asked the manager if their was anyway I could get a flank steak cooked to go for dinner and she made it happen! She was very helpful and went above and beyond for me. I will definitely be back."
5,"If you want a cool place with more than just Poke, look no further than Hi-Tide.  The oysters are amazing, and the Poke Nachos are the best nachos that I have had any place in country.  Love the community tables, so you get the atmosphere of being in one of the big cities in the U.S.A.  They have made it easy to enjoy a healthy meal."
5,"This was my second poke experience in Charlotte and it didn't disappoint! 

This is an intimate little casual spot - I almost missed it driving by! I walked in and immediately felt welcomed. Darnell (my server) was very attentive, friendly and was patient with me even though I took forever reviewing the menu, lmao. 

I built my own bowl (salmon, kale salad, carrots, green onions, kimchi, pickled ginger, mango, avocado and red onion) and topped it with the lime sauce and soy reduction. Everything was SO fresh and I almost regret not getting more toppings than I did!

I definitely plan on coming back to try out their other menu items. That lobster roll is calling my name..."
5,"I've enjoyed voodoo brews for quite some time, however the Meadsville location seems so far from Pittsburgh.  Needless to say I was super excited that they opened a location closer to the 'burgh.

The atmosphere is quite eclectic with chalk artwork on the super high ceilings and some of the walls.  The space is wide open with two twenty person communal high top tables, about 12 bar stools and three small low top tables.  There are two large garage doors which open to the street for fresh air but no outdoor seating.  Over all it's a very relaxed joint.

They offer growlers and bottles to go and have 12 beers on tap.  I tried the H2P IPA and the cowbell imperial milk stout. The cowbell was phenomenal, especially for those who like a smooth dark beer.  They are dog friendly, which I always find to be a plus even though I don't have a dog.  No food or food trucks either of the times I've visited."
5,"Three cheers (or toasts) for Voodoo Brewery.  Located in Homestead just a block of the main road of 8th Avenue, Voodoo brewery is a proprietor of very good craft beer.  They have a healthy selection ranging from lagers to IPAs and some with some pretty high ABV levels, like my personal favorite, the H2P.
This is a big open space that was formerly a fire hall or police station.  There are large farm tables for groups and a nice sized bar as well.  They also have some seating areas with round tables that allow for small groups or those that might want to play a board game (there is a stack of board games here).  
Outside you will find their very own food truck that has pierogies and tacos to accompany your beer.  
Bring your growler and take some beer home with you!"
5,"Loving HI Tide!! The Poke Nachos are out of this world! It starts as a base of fried wonton crisps and then is piled high with tuna, avocado, cucumber, seaweed salad, scallions and delicious sauces! A steal for the price! Poke bowls are also on point. As were the kobe sliders. The service  here is excellent!! Order at the counter and grab a number  and a seat to wait on your food. During slower  times there is table service. Also, a nice selection of local beers and craft sodas are available as well. Definitely recommend!!"
5,"If I could give my stay at the Metropolitan 6 stars I would! I'm not sure I have ever stayed at a hotel in my life I would say was worth the money, but this hotel definitely was! My wife and I were looking for a one-night get away at a local hotel, but never expected it to be so amazing. As soon as you walk in the front door, you feel like you're entering a new world of modern, chic, elegance. I think the staff at the front desk saw my wife and I stop and stare at our surroundings, so came and helped us check in with ease. 

We immediately felt special and valued. It's impossible to downplay how much care was put in to every detail of this hotel. They could easily charge admission, just to walk around and explore the artistry of every wall. I could talk about how cool the automatic elevators were also, but I'll move on. Just for perspective, we felt all this before ever even reaching our room! 

As we entered our hotel room we immediately said, ""wow!"" It's not that it was the largest room we had ever stayed in, but it was by far the nicest. It's clear the passion to detail and ambience they put into the entrance and hallways, continued into our room. There were no cheap, cut corners here. I would describe most hotel rooms, even the nice ones as functional, nice, or might comment on how big they were. But, this room felt sexy, cozy, plush, and opulent. The room made my wife and I feel like we wanted to immediately relax, but it also gave us a vibe that we wanted to go out for a night on the town.  

After unpacking, we explored the movie room they have, and the rooftop bar, Azure. Every part of this hotel was created with passion, excellence, with a little bit of sexiness. If you're coming in town for a weekend, or just looking to get away with your loved one, or family, I could not recommend this hotel enough. 

On top of all that, this hotel has such an amazing location. Progressive Field, the Q, and the Casino are right down the street in one direction. East 4th street, which is filled with restaurants is in another direction (That's where my wife and I went). The theater district is right down the street in a third direction. Although we're locals, I don't think my wife and I had ever had such a fun time in downtown Cleveland. Oh, and we explored the amazing Bank-turned Heinen's grocery store next door. That may sound weird, but it's amazing and worth exploring too! 

My only feedbacks is, it would have been nice if there were a few more papers around our bed, introducing us to Azure, and giving us a list of all the amazing Cleveland things we could explore during our stay."
5,"When the MGM Grand completed it's 360 degree renovation they replaced everything that could or should go, but kept the best. This was by far the best!

LOVED

The one of a kind art deco ship sail decor

The free staff show conducted on the bar! They can really dance!

Fair prices and specials

A higher caliber of clientele.... But all are welcome!

The central location on the casino floor...elevated for great people watching

Wicked potent drinks

The beautiful female staff that remembers your name....no Hooters vibe!

The staff remembers you like to be seated next to available frisky young men

Favorite in Las Vegas!"
5,"First I'd like to say I know nothing about cars. All I know is that when a light turns on go to a mechanic. With that said here's my experience.

I went to this random mechanic to get an estimate and right off the bat the guy looked at the Service Engine light code I gave him and told me a ridiculous price without even asking me anything. I'm assuming he was up-charging me because I had no clue what the code meant.

Two days later my sisters boyfriend told me to come to Meineke on Blue Diamond. So I called for an estimate first before going and Jim was awesome! Told him my situation with the first mechanic and what supposably was wrong with my car and before he told me prices he actually asked me a bunch of questions that the first guy didn't even ask me! So I was shocked and knew that he was actually trying to figure out what was wrong with my car instead of giving me a price. Brought my car in the next day and he gave me the same price he told me on the phone, not a dollar more! Which was great! Left my car over night & picked it up around 1pm the next day. 
He also told me to come back the next day after driving a few miles to make sure everything was reading correctly.

I don't usually leave yelp review but this place and especially Jim gave awesome customer service! Coming from a company all about customer service is have to say they had it on point!"
5,I am In love with this restaurant. Food is fresh and so delicious. I've had different bowls and love them all. Oysters are fresh and tasty. The poke Nachos are a must have. All the food is AMAZING!!!!
5,"Classic Car Spa is the friendliest and least salesy car salon I've ever used and I've been everywhere. They care about what I want, and not just trying to up-sell me. Plus, they do a phenomenal job on interiors! I'm glad I live around the corner, I'll continue to use Classic Car Spa every time my car needs that new car smell. And, their holiday promotions rock! Very pleased.

M Hillert"
5,"Upon arrival, I was greeted promptly by a friendly server who offered me a menu. As I browsed the menu, I ordered  the Riesling which tasted lovely! I started with the shrimp cocktail, followed by the lobster roll. Both choices were fresh and delicious!!! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was impeccably clean! I will definitely be going back for more!!!!!"
5,Great customer service with even better food! Super fresh & great tasting! My new fav seafood spot
5,"This place is very good.  I don't normally give five stars even for places I really like but it is that good.  The quality of the ingredients is excellent, the specialities are great, and the people are great.  I've been back three times and enjoyed each one more.  Good beer selection and easy ways to order online too.  Good spot overall and will keep going back."
5,I enjoyed my poke bowl from here. I got tuna with the sesame soy sauce. I like that the toppings are unlimited. It is also nice to get a side of shucked oysters with your poke. I found it to be better than other poke joints in Charlotte. I will be back.
5,"Took around 10 minutes for a server to come greet us and take our orders. But other than that the service was good, staff were friendly and the food is great as always. Their nachos is always a great hit and my boyfriend likes their chicken fingers. I love the patio at this location and will definitely come back again."
5,Was in and out of here in no time! They have amazing attention to detail and I really like that they have so many different options as far as car washes go. Will definitely be coming back here :)
5,Great hotel!! I will definitely stay there again if I'm back in Cleveland!! Great place to host a corporate meeting.
5,"We went to one of their hosted food truck rallies, and it was a great time. 

They shut down the entire street, had some great food trucks (actually my favorite food came from the voodoo truck ; a pizzadilla.. Amazing). And they had a beer tent outside as well, so there was hardly ever any wait to fill up. Ended up liking one of the beers so much that we ended up going inside after the event and picking up a growler to take home. 

Good beer, good food, can't go wrong. Plenty of parking on the side streets; just lock your car."
5,"What a great experience. This place does a great job and it's all by hand. From the minute I drive up and was greeted by the representative Ben Brewer I knew I had stopped at the right place. 

This is a place worth driving the extra mile for. I will be back."
5,Awesome atmosphere. Awesome beer. Feels like you're in Denver instead of Homestead. We will definitely be back!
5,"Voodoo is everything.

Their beers range from creative (without being ridiculous) to just classic all-around well-balanced brews.  Absolutely zero complaints with the quality of their products.

I went to a Barrel Room Collection Release a few months ago and the Grand Met in aged in the Apple Brandy barrels was definitely my favorite beer ever.  EVER.  Of all time.  It was smooth and delicious and my dream beer--I will be first in line if they release that again.  I will be line for anything that they release actually.

Their events are super well-organized.  Sometimes tasting events can be poorly managed, but they always have enough staff to keep lines moving and to keep everyone happy.  Kudos.

They recently (ish) added a food truck/kitchen so you can order food there now."
5,Great place to get your car washed . They took great care of my new silverado . This will be the only place I come from now on.
5,"I've gone to so many other car wash places but I always come back here. The wash it's self is pretty good. They go over it was hand mitts and then through the wash. The guys at the end though who do the drying/detailing really make the difference. I always tip the detail guy since they make the cars shine. I'm a big fan since they vacuum, spray the windows/mirrors/glass and detail the wheels nicely. They have coupons on their website and are in mailings as well as those coupon big books some schools/stores sell. Also they have a punch card type system where after I believe 10 washes you get one free.  

It is NOT QUICK so don't come in thinking you will get your car back in 5 minutes, all sparkly clean. It takes time for them to do it right. I've seen them work almost 25 minutes on the detailing part before so depending on how dirty your car is how long it might take. If you want a quick wash n' go you might want to take your car somewhere else."
5,"Great carwash/detail!!! Conveniently located and great prices. Especially the groupon, attentive to detail. Love this car wash and all of the other locations here in the valley the only place i would go."
5,"I have been there twice now - this is a place to be. Why? First, it is a cool place, very unassuming with some character, friendly staff and oh yeah - great beer. Almost forgot. The concept is great. The art work including those in the ceiling is just so cool. I have not seen anything like this - it is distinctive. It is located near the municipality building or in an old firehouse house, you can see the fire holes in there. How cool is that.  The tables are made out of old shipping crates. the menu is awesome mind you no food just beer. They sell quality craft beer that they change periodically. The IPA are awesome - I got to go back again. There is a food truck parked next and one can buy food there. Good arrangement."
5,I am thankful this beautiful building was saved from destruction and turned into a hotel with residential units. Much better than the cockamamie plan Jimmy Dimora and Tim Hagan envisioned to destroy and rebuild. It was a pleasure to be on the inside and gaze at the city below through the rounded rectangular windows. There was an opaque glass shower next to the bed in the room. This was a unique idea as opposed to the usual location of a shower in a bathroom. One of the best hotel stays I've had.
5,"Good Vibes described the beer and atmosphere. I was able to bring my dog, this place truely is a gem!"
5,"I've been wanting to check out VooDoo for a while and finally made it this weekend, it did not disappoint!!! Love Child was my first choice, then I went all in on the girl drinks and had a MetMosa, and a Love Child mosa with pineapple OJ. Absolutely delicious, the perfect drink for me! I regret not getting a growler. I love the decor; the garage door was open and the vibe was just right. Can't wait to go there again, and I will for sure be leaving with a growler!"
5,"Excellent, excellent property with rooftoop bar open in good weather, a restaurant/bar on the first floor, a hotel bar on the second floor, and a swanky dance club in the basement (a former bank vault). This is definitely the most swanky building in Cleveland, and is a must see/visit if you are in town or are simply a Cleveland resident. Highly recommended. By the way - dress to impress when going to the 9!"
5,"Fun lovely atmosphere. Enjoy a flight of various beers. Some popular options were sold out. Arrived to late for the food truck, but close drive to various eateries in Homestead. Looking forward to a future visit."
5,"Love this place!!!!
Top notch service and wash. Great attention to detail and friendly staff.
Locations all over"
5,"Love this place!!!!
Top notch service and wash. Great attention to detail and friendly staff.
Locations all over the valley!!!!"
5,"Got a coupon in the mail and rolled on over. I was hesitant because of a few bad reviews, but the price was right.
Very clean facility with a friendly staff. They even checked my breaks for free. I asked about the bad reviews and they let me know that they were under new management w/ a completely new crew. Nice work!"
5,"I have stayed in some great hotels, but this one may be my favorite. Beautiful decor throughout the whole hotel. The rooms are spacious and perfectly decorated with an amazing bathroom and large living area. There is a bar/club in the basement which made bachelorette bar hopping great to start and end the night. Staff is very courteous. Everything you could want in a great hotel stay. Be aware however that valet parking is 38 dollars, which i thought was a tad steep for Cleveland, Ohio and don't touch anything in the minibar area due to the products being on sensors and the front desk will immediately charge you whether you put it back or not. I was about to call once I got my bill and they took off the extra charges. A great secure venue as well."
5,"I recently stayed at The Metropolitan at The 9 during my time in Cleveland, Ohio. The room was clean, the staff was friendly, and the stay was absolutely amazing. It has a Vegas feel and décor as the decorations aren't your  typical of Marriott.  In fact, most of the people I was with didn't even realize it was a Marriott. That being said, it definitely matched up to the standards of the brand. As a Gold Member, I was incredibly pleased with every aspect to the stay. The Hotel Manager I worked with really helped me out as well.  He went above and beyond to help me make it a special night for my guest.   Again, great people, great service, great room, and you're in the heart of Cleveland. I'm definitely coming back.  

Other notes, this hotel reminds me of the Encore in Vegas.  The somewhat see through shower is located in the front of the room.  Again, it's not your typical layout which I find is an added plus."
5,"I was getting my tires done next door at discount tires when I realized my keys were locked in the car. I was already spending a lot of money on my tires, the thought of spending even more money on a locksmith had me in tears. I walked next door to Meineke and told the gentleman at the counter what had happened. He said don't worry and grabbed one of his employees, Chris to pop my lock. I said how much will this cost!? He said it will be no charge and to come in again for my next oil change. I am DEFINITELY returning here for my next maintenance. Nice to see people that care. Thank you Meineke"
5,"My car broke down across the street I walked over they offered to drive me to my car and jump start me and bring me back to Meineke.  They assessed the situation and the manager, Jim Caruso was excellent and took very good care of me as well as his employees.  Specifically, Tony was the young man that drove me to my car to give a jumpstart.   They were friendly, professional  & courteous and could not of  been more empathetic.   Thank you for treating me so well & as if I were family.  You have a customer for life."
5,"I honestly did now know you could make lobster as good as Hi Tide has. Simply amazing. Staff was great, the restaurant was extremely clean, warming and I can't wait to go back for oysters on the half shell happy hour. This is my new go to spot in Dilworth. Also the Girl says the shrimp salad is the best thing she has ever eaten."
5,"Decided to not go to my car dealer anymore for my oil change because they took too long. 

Jim was awesome! He helped me and I was in and out. 

Reasonable pricing and quick service. 

Bruce (I think) was the one that worked on my car. 

Both guys are so nice and friendly! Will be coming here from now on!

Thank you for awesome customer service and for being quick!"
5,"The great customer service by Jim, Store Manager started the moment he answered the phone. They made me a same day appointment for an oil change and once I got there they were very thorough, knowledgeable and honest. They have very good prices for almost everything your car needs or may need. I also was assisted by Robert the owner who was professional and kind as well. They have coupons available for certain services that come through the mail and they honor those. Thanks Jim and Robert I'll be coming to you from now on!"
5,"Excellent modern hotel. Here for work attending a conference. Friendly staff, good food everywhere you turn, and fancy elevators. Received a free upgrade to a lovely suite. Massive televisions, pretty fake fireplace, and large living area.  Pet friendly with inside dog park. Great location for Cavs and Indians games, as well plenty of nearby restaurants, especially on E. 4th. Highly recommended."
5,"Genius! Old firehouse converted into a bar/restaurant. The food is on a food truck level so don't go expecting a sit down meal with service. It's all about the beer! This is a local brewery from meadville, PA and they got some good selections. Cool crowd with board games to keep you entertained. Although in a random spot in homestead, of which needs to be rejuvenated, it's a start and hopefully it can catch on like the rest of Pittsburgh. Will be a usual stop for myself and friends."
5,"I have been coming more often.  They have available more experimental beers and variants. On the last trip, i was able to try Good Vibes, which is a very well balanced IPA.  It may be their best one.   I really enjoyed the airy, open, vibe of the place and the staff is excellent.  There were many people at tables playing board games, which was neat."
5,Great place for repairs!!! These guys fixed my breaks and a few other things all in the same day. Great customer service! I appreciate all of their help and will be back!
5,This place is amazing! Best poke bowls in Charlotte. My favorite is building my own bowl because there are so many ingredients to choose from - and they're all included!
5,"We ate at Hi Tide about six weeks ago and had a very good meal. We went back tonight and the food was great! We built a bowl with Ahi Tuna and multiple other ingredients and the tuna was fresh and delicious. The portion was more then adequate. 

Last time we ordered the tuna nachos and really liked it. We decided to order the nachos again and were equally pleased. 

The meal was only $23 not including the beer my girlfriend ordered.

Highly recommended and we won't wait 6 weeks for our next visit!"
5,We love Voodoo!! They have a great beer selection and we'll as a great revolving menu. Servers are always super friendly and willing to make suggestions on new beers to try. 10/10 would recommend!
5,I am deeply grateful to the Valet service of the Metropolitan At the 9. Saturday night my car kept stalling due to a faulty voltage regulator. The valet crew tried several times to jump start my car. Max in all of his kindness offered to follow me home which resulted in an eventual tow by AAA. Max not only stayed with my wife and I but then drove us to our Cleveland Heights home while the tow truck delivered my car to the mechanic's shop. Thank you Max and your wonderful staff for your thoughtfulness and Excellent Service!
5,"I love this place!  We love our Thursday night bartenders.  Tony, Ben, and Rob are fantastic.  Try the Foodoo truck!"
5,A legendary hotel!!! So much fun staying there! A great big room and 2 TVs. They are really doing well and this is probably the nicest hotel in Cleveland. I feel blessed.
5,"Went to the opening this past weekend expecting absolute madness, as most high-profile beer events tend to be these days. But no, this was one of the most professionally-managed openings I've ever seen. They had ample staff and were organized, efficient and friendly. It was really impressive and simply the polar opposite experience of most overrun and frankly uncivilized beer events. This obviously wasn't Voodoo's first rodeo, having done scores of popular bottle releases over the years. 

As with the service, the product is refined through years of experience that unfortunately can't be faked. It didn't hurt that they broke out some special kegs for the opening, but they have enough draft lines here that I would be shocked if they didn't regularly have something interesting on offer. 

Not all of their beers are my favorite, nor honestly is the decor really much to my liking (I think an old building like this has enough charm on its own not to need brash paint schemes, but that's just me).  Minor gripes aside there is no way not to be absolutely thrilled with this addition to Pittsburgh's scene. This is unquestionably a destination-worthy spot if you care at all about beer, and I'm looking forward to great times in Homestead."
5,"I'm always nervous to go to mechanics because you always think the mechanics are going to lie to you just to take all your money. But I've been going to this blue diamond location the 2 years I've lived in Vegas because they are honest, hard working, friendly mechanics here that are willing to explain and show you whenever your car is in trouble. The first time I went here was for a simple break replacement.. I usually go shopping while I wait for my car (which is another plus about this location) so as I was browsing Ross one of the employees (I believe he was manager at the time) called me and told me while they were rotating my routers they noticed heat spots or something that was not good.. I kind of panicked and asked if I could see because I was scared of getting ripped off. So they told me to come back so they could show me before they replaced it for me.. In the end they were so helpful and nice that day I kept going back. I get my oil changed regularly here and they help me to upkeep my car for perfect running conditions.. Even when they told me my transmission fluid should be changed I wasn't sure but they were happy to dip a test strip in the transmission fluid and show me it should be changed. Also Jim the manager is so nice and understanding. I always feel like I understand more about my car everytime I visit. Thank you guys for being amazing at what you do!"
5,"I don't even drink, but I love it here. Really cool vibe, and everything I've had on their food truck is amazing. When my friends and I come in, they grab a drink, I grab a pop, we get something to eat, and just chill. They have board games, too! It's a lot of younger people, but certainly anyone and everyone comes here to enjoy all of the artwork and chill atmosphere"
5,"We were on our way down town and decided to stop by to get some good quality food without the down town price. Never been at this location before but I've been to the franchise many a time. I have to say, they did a great job making us happy. The staff was friendly, the food was great and in abundance. We ordered too much and had to take it home as leftovers because we were expecting less. 

If you are in the area and are looking for a slightly up scale place to eat. This is a great place."
5,"Once again Jim and Rick, and one of their amazing techs Save the Day. When I was stuck up in Oregon in a blinding snowstorm Jim stayed on the phone with me and calmly gave me the proper dates of my last oil change which helped me more than you can imagine.  It's the kind of service you hope for but never expect these days but with Jim and Rick I know it's going to happen.  Once again I brought my car in with a strange sound it turned out to be nothing and was not charged a dime.  Try to find that kind of service anywhere else, it just doesn't happen. Also it's a pleasure while you're waiting they keep you entertained. Thanks guys once again, I'm looking forward to seeing you next time!"
5,"Really nice spot I found while interviewing in Pittsburgh.  The vibe is super friendly, the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable and the beer is quite good.  Favorites were the Love Child and the Big Black Voodoo Daddy.  Now that I have the job, I'm going to definitely become a regular at this place!"
5,"Crazy fun does not describe it, hot people overflow from other clubs into here. I meet my drinking club here for meditation and book discussion, NOT. Come here Thursday thru Sunday."
5,"That was very unfortunate that Keith had such a negative experience. My husband got some gift certificates for Christmas and we went for our first visit, for lunch, a couple of weeks ago. We found our waitress very friendly and I was impressed by the large selection the menu offered. The food was excellent and as we are both trying to do the healthier eating thing, I was glad to see some good options other than the usual battered/deep fried everything. 

All in all it was a very good experience and as we still have some money left on the certificates, we will definitely be going back. 

I really think that Keith should give them another chance. Maybe your wait staff that day were having a bad day or they were just a**holes but I do understand how one bad experience does tend to turn you off for good."
5,We stopped in for a late lunch today and this place was great! My wife and I got two regular size bowls with the Poke Nachos as well and it was more than plenty. The flavor in the Poke Nachos was fantastic! I highly recommend those. We'll be coming back more often for sure.
5,"Thoroughly enjoyed our weekend at Metropolitan at the 9! Beautiful hotel with even better service! From the moment we pulled up,we felt as if you waiting for us to arrive!! Very hip place with modern amenities. Will definitely stay again. My only regret was that I did note make not of the names of the staff members that made the experience exceptional. I apologize, as they totally deserve the recognition!!"
5,"Stayed here for business. This place is AWESOME. 
The staff is top notch, run well, fantastic guest service. They do it right. The rooms are sweet. Restaurants, meeting rooms = awesomeness."
5,"Gosh, this place is perfect for so many different outings! I've been three times now, once with a group of girlfriends for girls night, once with just one gal pal, and once for a fundraiser we threw there for our rescue group The Proper Pit Bull. Of course all these events took place when it wasn't that warm out, so I am super excited to go back when the two large garage doors are open! *Just make sure to grab a DD or get an Uber as 99% of the beers have very high alcohol content!

The eclectic and rustic ambiance is spectacular. I love the long, tall farm tables! There is also bar seating and a few smaller round tables. 

The bartenders will let you sample any of their delicious craft beers on tap, which is nice because while I love craft beer, there are still so many I have yet to discover. So far I've tried the White Magick (my favorite), the Voodoo Love Child, which can also be turned into a ""Metmosa"" with some OJ or pineapple juice. I sampled my friends and it was soooo good. One time I stuck to the Single Hop because it was the lowest % at 4.5 I mean, they have one called Vandelay Industries.... how awesome is that?! Seinfeld fans? Yes!

There's also a cute little water station so you don't have to wait at the bar to get some water. I ordered the fish tacos ($8) from the Foodoo truck and they were very tasty. I'm a big fan of mango slaw so these were quite good! They also give you your check inside of a hard cover book! 

I had a great experience each time I've been there but the fundraiser event was by far my favorite. We had one of our awesome ""poster pits"" there and he was a big hit! There were easily 50 people that came by during our event and every single one of them had a good time. 

I can't wait to spend my summer days here. Great beer, great food... and a bar that helps to promote rescue dogs?! Score."
5,"For $20, you get a gorgeous hand car wash here

They do a good job and really pay attention to the details.  Beyond that, they actually check your claim ticket to make sure you only pick up your car.

Attention to detail and low cost make this a great carwash option!"
5,"Back again, just like a month ago. Time for that oil change again. No matter what time of the day I go as long as I schedule an appointment, I'm always taken care of. Jim your the best! You and the team are great and always guaranteed great customer service!!!"
5,"These guys are fantastic! Jim and the crew over here took great care of me and my broken truck. I went into the shop one morning last week with a weird noise that I wasn't used and they were able to figure out exactly what it was for me. Now I have new struts and front breaks, so my truck is all fixed and running perfect!
Thank you for all your help and awesome service! You guys rock!"
5,"CLEVELAND HAS NEEDED A HOTEL LIKE THE ""METROPOLITAN AT THE 9"" FOR A LONG TIME - AND NOW THEY HAVE IT

Before The Metropolitan at The 9 came to Cleveland, the nicest hotels were considered the Renaissance, The Ritz-Carlton and perhaps The Hyatt Regency at the Arcade. Those were fine, if you like hotel rooms from the late 1980's or smaller type rooms. The Metropolitan is a very unique, classy, modern 4 Star boutique hotel. 

The 9 is very easy to get to being right on East 9TH Street and close to the highway. 

VALET
I found the valet guys to be professional & most importantly FAST. Even on Friday & Saturday nights I found them to be very fast in bringing the car around. I found the fee, apparently standard in the downtown Cleveland area, to be a bit high at $32.00 a night, but when in Rome I suppose. 

FRONT DESK
I have stayed at The 9 twice now and have had nothing but professional, knowledgeable and very helpful staff assisting me. They do not appear to be robotic and you do not see forced smiles. The Front Desk Staff certainly gives a great first impression at The 9. 

HOUSEKEEPING
Stealth. Professional. Great. Just some of the words I would use to describe the Housekeeping Staff at The 9. I am a late riser and usually miss when they make their first visit and see my DND sign on the door. I will call as I'm leaving for lunch or for the day and when I return the room is just like it was when I first entered. 

RSVR LOUNGE
I had the pleasure of spending two nights on their RSRV floor, this floor has about 16 rooms I believe with a private lounge that has a staff member on hand until 10pm to assist guests. Being that I am a late riser I was only able to meet Alex in the late afternoon. Alex was full of knowledge about The 9, it's special construction and features. On the last night staying there we were speaking with Alex and I mentioned that I was surprised the hotel was using the paper DND door hangers and also mentioned that I thought the hallway lights were kinda bright. Alex grabbed a notebook out of a drawer while I was talking and began writing - I asked if he was taking notes on what I was saying. He said yes, this is the only way we will become better if we listen to feedback from our guests. I said it was very minor and that they were certainly not complaints - he said he always likes to bring the guests suggestions to the attention of the front office. 

By Alex quickly jotting down those notes is just one reason that The 9 will be THE best hotel in downtown Cleveland. Your hotel can have comfy beds and great showers, but I believe it is the staff that guests will remember and will bring guests back to your hotel. 

ELEVATORS
The 9 has an interesting system for the elevators. You wave your room key over the security window and then press the floor number - the screen will point you to your elevator. Once you get on you press no buttons, you are just taken to your floor. It takes some getting use to but once you do it is nice. 

THE ROOM
Here is the best part of the hotel. My first visit I stayed in a King Suite on the 9th floor. I had a corner room both times - ask for one when you go. The second visit was on the RSRV floor (13th floor) and has a great view into Progressive Field. 

The King Suite has a stand alone, large, shower and a deep tub. Both are basically out in the open. It's an interesting design, so if you are traveling with a friend know that they will be peaking at you through the glass shower. (See photos)

The bed is extremely comfortable with great pillows to choose from and extras in the closet. 

The living room area is a nice size with a comfortable elbow couch and a sitting chair. They list a fireplace but it is merely a video of a fireplace. I'm guessing they are setting a mood for you. 

Large TV in the living room and in front of the bed with premium movie and sports channels, along with free wifi throughout the entire hotel should keep you entertained and busy. 

The room décor is dark and modern with very nice artwork throughout the room and bathroom. (see photos) 

The room has a mix of wood & carpeted floors, which adds to the apartment feel. 

COMMON AREAS
I was unable to try their restaurant on the ground floor or their bar on the 2nd floor due to my schedule so I am unable to post any comments. I found the common areas to be large, well lit, very clean, and ample seating if you were waiting for friends. 

All in all I give The 9 4.75 Stars. There are some very minor adjustments / additions they can make to increase the guests experience. I will return to The 9 and will certainly direct my friends there as well. 

NOTE: There is a CVS Pharmacy right around the corner - walking distance. 
Stay clear of Flannery's as the service is as bad as the food. RED Steakhouse is also right around the corner and has outstanding steaks."
5,This place is beautiful and the employees are really friendly! Def looking forward to our next stay here!
5,"The Metropolitan is a magnificent hotel in Cleveland.

The location is fantastic.  It's within walking distance of Progressive Field, Quicken Loans arena, Playhouse Square, the Warehouse District, and tons of restaurants and bars.

I arrived at the hotel at about 10:30 on a Thursday.  I knew it was early, so I just asked the gentleman at the front desk if I could keep my bag somewhere while I did some sightseeing.  Thankfully a room was available and the gentleman happily checked me in.  

The room was gorgeous.  Modern and upscale, but very comfortable.  The room had a king sized bed, sitting area and a large, very nice TV.  My only complaint was that there was no mini fridge in the room.

As others have mentioned, be careful of the mini bar snacks.  They are uber sensitive.  I just ended up touching the phone charger and was billed.  They were more than happy to remove the charge.

During my stay, I dined at the restaurant, Adega.  Breakfast was fantastic.  I also had a drink at the Ledger Bar in the hotel.  The staff were nice, but $15.00 for a mediocre cosmo was a bit steep.  I also met with some people and went to the Vault Dance Club.  It was a blast.

All the staff were extremely friendly.  From the Valets, to the Doormen to the housekeeping staff, I was always greeted warmly.

I can't say enough nice things about this hotel.  I'm already planning a trip next year to see an Indians/Tigers game and I can't wait!"
5,"I actually had a really pleasant experience here! I purchased a Groupon for an oil change and a car wash, so I called to ask if I could get an appointment. Upon being told that they worked on a first come, first serve basis, I got nervous but when I arrived at this location, I didn't have to wait at all! I pulled right up into the bay and they got started on my car right away. The cashier, Brittany, knew exactly what to do with my Groupon and rang me out no problem. I sat for about forty minutes before my car was finished and personally, I think that's great! I'm so used to spending an hour and a half to two hours for my oil changes, but I was in and out with no problem. My only gripe is that my car had water spots on it so they didn't thoroughly dry my car after the wash, but otherwise I'm a happy camper!"
5,"The hotel service was outstanding, and we really enjoyed our experience.  It is a unique property that was a bank that was converted to a hotel.  We really enjoyed our dinner in the restaurant, and the fitness center is well equipped. I would definitely suggest checking out the bank vault in the basement that has been converted to a cocktail lounge.  The property also is dog friendly."
5,"I wanted to thank my server, Syeda, for her amazing service on Sun, Oct 22nd. A ""friend"" of mine made a reservation for 10 of our ""friends"" to join us in celebrating my birthday. Me and two friends arrived on time at 7:30 and were seated at a 12 person table. As soon as we were seated, Syeda came over and wished me a happy birthday, which was so nice. We waited and waited for these people to arrive. We ordered our food right away because we were starving and couldn't wait any longer. By 8:30pm it became apparent no one else was showing up. 

Embarrassed, I politely apologized to Syeda for the hold up of the table, as Jack Astors could have accommodated another large party, and also asked if we could be moved to one of the booths in front of us. I also let Syeda know why we were switching tables as well. She was so gracious and understanding even after having to replace the table sheet and all of the cutlery and glasses on top because we doodled all over the paper.

The food came and was great as usual. Towards the end of our meal, as always for birthdays, a group of people came out to sing to me - but the group was visibly larger! My friends and I were so busy grumbling about our loser ""friends"" that we totally forgot about this birthday song! Syeda then handed me a pretty yellow card, that said ""Happy Birthday Alicia - Jackastors"" with hearts and balloons all over it! And the customary Jacks birthday desert that seemed more than usual too. Once they left I opened the card and there were signatures from her and other staff members as well! I can't describe how happy that made me feel!

Syeda went above and beyond to make sure I had a great night. Not only did she practice great customer service, but a huge level of empathy as well. She was amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better server! She was so gracious, patient and understanding. Thank you so much for making my night so memorable!  Shoutout to Bruno, Quincy, Cynthia, Connor, Christine and Bahar for signing the card and participating in making my night along with Syeda! PS: Give them all raises!"
5,"The coolest hotel I've ever seen. Great front desk staff, 1 night club, a roof top bar, and world class restaurant, a crafted cocktail style bar,  a full blown 24 hour gym, a yoga studio, and REALLY NICE rooms. It's almost like Vegas in Cleveland."
5,Junior did a great job and actually cared about making sure my car was meticulously clean inside and out..will definitely go back !!
5,"Voodoo has some of the best beer I've ever had. It's also significantly higher in alcohol content than the average. Nothing about this place feels like a total ripoff or tourist trap- the quality is genuine and worth the trip into otherwise depressing Homestead. The re-vamped firehouse(?) space itself is uniquely decorated with a random assortment of found objects and kitsch, almost as if decorated for Halloween. Considering that a pint of any craft beer in Lawrenceville or Shadyside costs around $6, $5.25 for a superior Voodoo fix is reasonable."
5,"This is the only car wash that has never annoyed me with some little problem.  Seems like every other place regularly misses something, even in a high-end wash, but these guys always do a great job.  Prices are not cheap--but match the level of service given.  I've also never run into one of those glass salespeople there, which really annoy me.  Overall this is my preferred wash/detail company in the Phoenix area.

Their store is very nicely stocked, and waiting room seating is very comfortable."
5,"A few friends and I went here this past New Year's Eve. The staff was really friendly, and our waitress checked up on us a fair number of times. 

My steak was not cooked according to my request, so they took it back and had it done properly right away. At the end of our meal, the manager approached me and said that desert was on them because of the steak, and I kindly declined because I wasn't hungry. She said that they could just pack desert for me, and have me take it home. This was generous, but I kindly declined once again. She then said that my drink was on them. 

This just goes to show that they're willing to go that extra mile to satisfy the customer. This has been my favorite bar & grill so far, and I'm definitely visiting this location again."
5,"Jim is the best. This is the only place we trust with our cars. Great service, friendly staff who are very honest and do a good job. Highly recommend them for oil changes, maintenance, etc."
5,"While the local Ritz may connote more old school luxury; the Met at the 9 has the things I believe the next generation of travelers is looking for.  Free wi fi, a great theater showing cavs games, a modern lobby that is always vibrant, and in the rooms, the smart televisions are magnificent.  

General Manager Kenny Diddier you've done a great job!!!"
5,"Drove here from California for a concert. I could tell the rotors were bad by the shaking of the front end every time I braked. These guys were very friendly and helpful, got me in on a Saturday afternoon, fixed the problem for a fair price and arranged to have my pickup available late that night. I was able to drive home the next day and not wait. Highly recommended."
5,"Great prices, friendly staff and probably the best car wash place I have been to. 

When I first pulled up in my 4runner covered in bugs I was greeted by an attendant i think by the name of Alex. He was very nice. I told him I want to get the car clean and bugs off. He said we pride ourselves in our work. I just said TBD. A glass guy came out and acknowledged me and try to sell me a new windshield...said I had a lot of pits. Well this was the only piece I didn't like. I just said no thanks and he took off. 

I went inside and paid, sat around and watch my car go through. about 30 minutes later the attendant came and got me. 

My car was as clean as it had been when it left the show room floor 3 years ago. No more coke stains in the cup holders, the interior shined bright, the hold and bumper had about 95% of the bugs removed which is by far the best I seen considering that we drive alot and very few car washes the bugs somehow have become part of the car. 

I have since brought back car multiple times and could not have been any happier.

Definitely the best and I highly recommend."
5,Driving south on the 15 and my car was overheating during a June heat wave. Stopped in here to see if they could sort out the issue. Jim at the desk had an open bay available and immediately took my car in. Took just over an hour and they had my problem fixed and me on my way. Just what you want in a good repair shop.
5,"My first elite event was at the Voodoo Brewery (this review will always be special).   I was hearing the buzz about this new cool place and was looking forward to checking it out.  There isn't a parking lot - its off street parking..but I didn't have a problem at all finding a spot.  

VB is definitely bursting with personality!  You get a certain feeling when you are in a building that is more than a century old!   The building was vacant for a long time and the renovation is amazing.   You can tell by the hip décor that a lot of thought and time was put into the renovation.    In deed there also charm to it - like the ceilings.. chalk drawings(see photos).  
Ok onto the good stuff.. the CRAFT BEER: 
Voodoo Love Child - what a cool name and no doubt tasty. This is something you never forget after tasting. 
Wynona's Big Brown Ale - very tasty and thick 
And my favorite that I couldn't get enough of was....
""Some People Say Cucumbers Taste Better Than Pickles"".  It was really amazing and refreshing at the same time.  It was on the lighter side which is what I prefer.   There was only a hint of cucumber... it was truly amazing.. the taste.
I purchased a good quality black t-shirt for only $15.00 bucks!!   The Bartenders were friendly and helpful with questions.  When I closed out my tab it was enclosed in this book - which you can sign (see photo)!  I thought that was so clever.. and so unique.
I also really dig their website too it's pretty cool .. I recommend checking it out.    http://voodoobrewery.com

........Go ahead ""Voodoo Brewery"" ...do the voodoo that you do ...so well..."
5,Fun time! Comfy environment- great music! Great drinks & attentive service. Enjoyed the hookah too - great flavor selections! Stayed for a couple hours with friends!
5,friendly staff. the washes are reasonably priced and they have a lot of options. the cars coming through look emaculate and my first point of contact educated me on armorall and lotion for my dash interior. i would highly recommend this location for a car wash. thanks for the cherry scent! mmmm mm mmm
5,Jim and Tony did an excellent job. Gave me a wonderful discount. They even went an extra length to give me suggestions to save money in the long run. They are awesome and very funny. Do ask for an under the hood special.
5,"Good work, cleaned the insides great. The service guy was helpful and explained all the different options."
5,"great hotel. our room was very nice, and we loved the champagne waiting for us as we checked in"
5,Wonderful car wash outside inside done beautiful and nice workers many convent locations
5,"Everything worked out fine. Took my 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan in for Front End Alignment. After about 3 hours, got a call, letting me know the mechanic took her out after the procedure. To test the vehicle to ensure all was dialed in. Driven by myself, all is correct and true. Thanks guys!!"
5,"These are some of the most helpful and honest mechanics I have met! I had a flat tire that was slow leaking and not only did they repair it, they explained how tires change temperature with the weather and how the extreme cold to the extreme heat can greatly effect the way they wear. Jim Marco not only helped me understand the basics of tire rotation he explained how keeping tires on ones car until they wear out is super dangerous! He sold me two new tires, checked my fluids and sent me off feeling safer and more knowledgeable. Thank you for all the help. I will definitely be returning to this location for help in the future!"
5,"I went to the Classic Car spa and my service representative was Ben, exceptional customer service car was clean.. immaculate, and it was a great overall experience I'd recommend this place to anyone!"
5,"I have a black van so I don't use any brush washes.  I have always received good service here.  Not quick service but always done in a reasonable time and I am happy to wait in order to get good service.  If I am in a rush I just wait until I have time to stop.

My last was there was less than the quality I usually get there.  I called them when I got home and they told me to talk to a manager next time I came in.   A week later I came in and talked to a manager, they re washed and cleaned my van with no hassle and it looks amazing.  I even tried to tip them at the end and they refused to take my top and said they were happy to make things right.

Great place.  Great people.

Thx!"
5,"Great property in an outstanding location!  Mike, who works the lounge for priority customers on ""Level R"" exemplifies what great service is all about, thank you Mike!"
5,"Great overall. The poke nachos were the highlight of the meal. It was a generous serving with lots of goodies. There is a bunch of different sauces you can add to personalize your bowl. Service was great and the food came out very quickly (I know it is raw, but sometimes you think that it would come out quickly but it doesn't). Definitely worth a try 

PS There is wine and beer available."
5,"This business is a surprising find just outside of the city. It's worth the short drive across the mon. The beers I tried exceed my expectations having been to near by rock bottom, this is a true craft beer brew house."
5,"It's like a portal to another state , so clean & friendly ... Very accommodating.. Love it , they make it hard for u to remember ur in cleveland"
5,"Get the tuna nachos. Just get them. The manager gave us a great wine suggestion, our waiter Jex was nice, funny and also gave us a great food suggestion.

But seriously get the tuna nachos."
5,Great time on the RSRV floor like always. Dane was a great curator and host. Highly recommend!!
5,"REVIEW SUBJECT TO CHANGE: recently moved to Gilbert from CA and the road was not very kind to my Accord. However I brought it here for a full detail, but with how busy it was I didn't have enough time for my Clay Bar. BEN was totally understanding and seemed like a stand up guy, taking care of my car now making it look great with just a normal wash, I will most certainly be back for the Clay Wax. Can't wait to see my baby fully detailed by these hard working individuals. Will post update after full detail!"
5,"What a lovely hotel.  I felt like I was in Vegas and not in Cleveland.  Wow!  The room, lobby, and hallways were all lovely, bright, and clean.  The bar looked fantastic, but we did not have enough time to enjoy drinks here.  This is a MUST stay hotel if you are in Cleveland."
5,Great selection of beer. Foods ok but the growlers were worth it to me. Can't wait to come back and get more.
5,"One of the swankiest spots in Cleveland, we stayed here for one night last summer. The rooftop is enormous and features views so nice that you'll wonder whether you're still in Ohio. It's affiliated with Marriott but doesn't look, feel, or smell like a Marriott (a good thing). Rates are comparable and the location can't be beaten."
5,"Ok, so I have to admit that I would like to think that I know a thing or two about beer, but I had never actually been to Voodoo! I think (but I am not completely sure) that I had it once before at D's. Basically, I suck at being good at beer, because this place is amazeballs! 

The beers we tried were all really good. My fav was the love child. Prices were on par with any other bar or pub. The staff and owner were super friendly and helpful. 

The other cool thing about this place is the venue, it is the oldest fire/police house in Pittsburgh and Voodoo basically resurrected it from the dead. Oh, and did I mention all the cool art all over the place? And, it's for sale. So, not only are they selling kick ass beer, but they are also promoting local artists!"
5,"John and his crew are great - had my oil changed and it was quick - 
Service was quick and polite 
Highly recommend for you service needs 
Plus they use BG products - the best!!!"
5,"Love this lounge.  They play a mix of hip hop, techno type music and just overall fun music.  Best of all, every 30 min. The bartenders get on the bar and do a choreographed dance routine.  They are very good dancers.  Sooo fun... I will go back for sure."
5,"Really really good poke bowl! Fresh and great quality. I got the Rainbow bowl and highly recommend. My only critique is it could have used a little bit of sauce in it, but I'm not going to knock off a star because I always have a lot of sauce on my food and I don't know that it's ""traditional"" of poke to be covered in sauce. Just my preference (: 

Definitely a place you need to try!!"
5,"One of my favourite locations. I came here on a weekend to watch the Raptor's game so as expected the bar area was packed. We were seated at the edge of the bar, but I didn't mind as long as I could see the screen. 

The crowd that gathers there for games is awesome. 

Jack Astor's food is as expected. we ordered the beef chili nachos and a few pints of Guiness. It was really delicious and even though they were really busy at the bar they brought extra napkins and brought extra hot sauce quick time when I asked for it. 

There was a bit of a commotion because someone at the bar wanted to watch a hockey game and was drunk already making a kerfuffle. The Bartender was really great and dealt with it very professionally. The manager eventually had to ask the person to go. (I cheered inside when this happened). 

Good food, good beer and a good show!"
5,Amazing fast food. Pictures don't do it justice. Delicious lobster. The place gets a little crowded though but it's ok. Lots of beer and wine to choose from.
5,"IMPRESSED!!! When I walk into a brewery and discover they're brewing West Coast Style IPAs & Belgians, they've got my full attention! 

The Hoodoo, a West Coast Style IPA, was by far my favorite and I literally enjoyed every sip. Those beers have a unique hop flavor and Voodoo totally nailed it. In fact, I'll be ordering that again next time. Sampled  Belgians Gran Met & Voodoo Love Child which were a tad high in alcohol for me to consume more than a sample but, quite delicious. Wynona's Big Brown Ale was about as perfect as a Brown Ale gets with so many deep caramelly flavors. 

The space is an old converted fire/police station that sat vacant in Homestead for several years. Big garage doors open up to the street. The only food served here is if food trucks line up outside or they're hosting a special event. No food means it's also dog friendly, which is also totally awesome!"
5,"Got the Ahi tuna bowl - the ingredients were fresh, colorful, & delicious!  Perfect for anyone who's sensitive to spicy foods (like me).  Every member of the staff was friendly & extremely helpful.  10/10 would eat there again!"
5,What an awesome experience and excellent food. Enjoyed the chef selection of oysters along with the rainbow poke bowl and beer!  Give it a try and you won't be disappointed.
5,"What an amazing car wash!!!!
Great and friendly service.
Dale was an outstanding person with exceptional people skills. SO NiCE!!!!
Omar the guy that cleaned my car cleaned it like he was detailing the car.
This will definitely be the place we will bring all our cars to."
5,"Beautiful hotel. The staff was very friendly, room was large, spacious, and very clean. Room service was quick. No complaints."
5,"Voodoo has been one of my favorite PA breweries for quite awhile.  Having them move down closer to Pittsburgh is exciting.  

The brewpub itself is a unique place to visit.  Located in an old police/fire station in Homestead.  When I arrived here, the weather was quite nice and the garage doors were wide open, giving the place a cool outdoor vibe, though we were inside.  There is unique artwork all over, including the ceilings.  It is a really laid back funky vibe you would come to expect from Voodoo.  

On tap on this particular visit was Winona Big Brown Ale, Hoodoo IPA, Cowbell Oatmeal Stout,  Gran Met Tripel, Killapilz, Voodoo Love Child Tripel and H2P IPA.  Sadly for me, the White Magick was not available due to some issues with the white peppercorns.  But hey, I am easy, I can certainly find a beer to sip on.  

The staff here is really friendly, efficient and knowledgable. 

If you like craft beer and want to support some awesome local brewers, stop in here.  And if you like Belgian style beers and some tasty IPAs, Voodoo will not disappoint. Oh and they make a beer called Big Black Voodoo Daddy, which is fantastic...watch out for the Barrel Aged version, though you may have to fight craft beer 'whale' hunters for it when it is released."
5,The GM Jim helped us out and was very helpful highly recommend going here great service
5,"Stayed here for a quick trip to Cleveland and I'd definitely stay here again (if I were again able to use the Marriott Friends/Family discount). The hotel IS pretty pricey but it's very nice. 
THE GOOD: The glass of champagne upon check is a nice touch. My King room was clean and comfortable. Electrical plugs and dimming light switches are well placed, the Samsung SmartTV is amazing, lighted magnifying mirror in bathroom is great. The bed was good, firm if that's what you're into. The in-room wifi signal is super strong. Never had an issue connecting or staying connected. I love the shower in the room...though it did take a minute for the water to get hot and the pressure leaves something to be desired...it's super spacious and very sexy. (Speaking of sexy, this isn't a room that you'd share with someone you're uncomfortable with. The bathroom as a whole is NOT a separate entity and though the shower has wavy glass, you can still totally see silhouettes through it.)
I don't believe there's a way that anyone who is not staying at the hotel is able to get onto any floor outside of the lobby and basement. You need a room key to operate the elevators. I think this is great for security reasons. There's a Heinen's grocery store attached and although you have to walk outside to get to its entrance, it's well-stocked and the employees were very helpful. The hotel is very close to major downtown attractions. Location is perfect. 
THE MEH: I tried to use the extra blanket they have stocked in the cabinet one night. It smelled clean but it left fuzzies all over the bed. Took it off and turned the heat up instead. There are very nice quality drinking glasses in the room but nobody should ever drink out of those. Germ city!  I get wanting to keep things fancy but the hotel should seriously consider providing wrapped plastic cups. Maybe put them in the very fancy ice bucket so they're not in plain view?  There is no desk in the room. This was a bit surprising. This could be sucky for business travelers or people who want to eat their room service on something other than their laps. I was awakened early (like 2am) this morning by housekeeping knocking on my door. When I didn't answer they called my room. They thought I had requested a dental kit. Wrong room. Grrrrrrr. Then I was awakened again at about 4am but someone pounding on the walls in the hallway. I know that every guest isn't a good guest but it was super annoying. Not the hotel's fault and I know you risk things like this when there is a bar and nightclub on site. I stayed in room 1116. The view was abysmal. I just kept the curtains closed. Valet parking is expensive as hell. If you drive around a bit, you are sometimes able to find street parking within walking distance. Good luck!

Did not experience so cannot comment on: Adega, room service, bar, nightclub, rooftop, dog park, gym."
5,Love it! Very friendly staff and good food. Had drinks and appetizers. Great spot to go to
5,"This place is absolutely amazing! I've been here twice now and both times have created my own masterpiece with the make your own poke bowl. You can choose from four different bases (I always go for the milky Queen rice, six different proteins (I've tried the tuna and salmon), and then unlimited, yes UNLIMITED fruit and veggies (such as avocado, mango, cucumber, etc.), crunchy & contrast toppings (e.g. wasabi peas, fresh ginger, toasted coconut, etc.) and herbs, spices and sauces. My bowl looks like a beautiful rainbow of deliciousness. Hi Tide Poke only uses fresh seafood from environmental friendly and sustainable sources, which is very important to me."
5,"1st time in Cleveland this weekend. Staying overnight to visit an exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Art. Great experience!  Loved the hotel. We checked in early before heading to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Our concierge (TK?) was great!  Not only did she check us in early but upgraded our room. Gave us advice on where to eat lunch near the hall of fame, and told us about the exhibit we were attending Sunday (she had just been). Room was awesome - large with great bathroom and seating area. Only complaint - we didn't have much time to explore amenities at the hotel. We visited the rooftop bar after dinner but didn't have time for anything else. Great location & trip to Cleveland."
5,Jim and his team were great. They replaced a taillight bulb for me even though it was almost closing time! Thanks again for the friendly service
5,"If beer was a human, just finished traveling the world, and wanted a place to rest their feet. Pittsburgh would be where he/she settles to talk of the lessons learned to everyone. The beer scene in Pittsburgh is fantastic. And with such a fantastic beer scene, the fact that Voodoo Brewery stands out means a lot.

It's a little known fact that like Bender (and all robots) from Futurama, medical students run on beer. Sadly, no fire-burps. So a group of us have been traveling throughout Pittsburgh to discover the amazing beer scene.

So about Voodoo Brewery (Homestead), it's located in an old fire station. The walls are covered in chalk artwork. Jazz playing in the overhead speakers. Long wooden tables with high chairs to give a community-vibe. With good weather, the whole place was open to the outside. I loved the vibe of the whole place. Plus, THEY LET DOGS IN THE BUILDING.

About the beer:
I got the flight, so was able to try a little bit of everything. There is seriously a style of beer for everyone. The Hoodoo was a very, very, very hoppy IPA. The Brown Ale was smooth and nutty. The Voodoo Love Child was a fantastic Belgian Ale with raspberry notes. I enjoyed the beers because they were unique with strong, bold flavors. These are all pretty strong beers, from 7.5% all the way to 11+%.

My girlfriend got the beer-mosa (spelling?). It was 75% beer with a splash of your juice of choice. I tasted some and it was delicious!!!

We also ordered the Voodoo Homestead Tap Water (ABV 0.00%) The sign made me laugh and I loved that type of attitude they had towards everything.

Overall, in my search for the best breweries, this ranks as one of the top. The atmosphere added to the great experience. I will definitely be coming back here soon."
5,"First time coming here, and I wish I had come here sooner!! My boyfriend and I are huge poke fans, and were curious about Hi Tide. In short, if you love poke, seafood, or oysters, you HAVE to come here. The service is very friendly and very helpful without being pushy. The atmosphere is perfect for an authentic seafood place. Not too stuffy, but has the polish of a well-managed restaurant. I got a bottle of Coke from the cooler, and when I went up to the counter to order and pay, the employee asked me if I'd like a cold glass, and pulled a glass out of a cooler with ice. I loved that touch. So simple, but so thoughtful. 
My boyfriend got one of their speciality poke bowls and I got the lobster roll with fries. The lobster roll was amazing and the fries were super fresh and seasoned perfectly. I spent summers in New England and know how a real lobster roll should taste and they nailed it. My boyfriends poke bowl was delicious and full of flavor. I noticed that they have half off oysters 4-7 on weekdays, which is a deal I plan on taking advantage of in the near future. Love this spot. Can't wait to come back!"
5,jim and his teams amazing!!! customer service is superb!!!  i would recommend them to everyone having car troubles.
5,"The food amazing,  the service incredible thanks Eden the person attending us.  The precise was just fine . I will be back with my wife again."
5,"Try the Oxtail Soup Combo!

Tucked inside the Fremont hotel in downtown Vegas, this little hole-in-the-whole, fast food, Panda-Express-like place fitted in perfectly with the rest of the downtown scene. No glitz, no frills, just an authentic, real, and delicious experience. Plastic utensils, wooden throw-away chopsticks, seating that would put Subway to shame...The staff was incredibly friendly, joked with us, and teased us as we asked them about the oxtail soup. 

Yes, that's right. Oxtail soup. 

We came here specifically to find this delicacy, and were not disappointed in the least. Tender, tasty, hunky meat that falls off the bone with the touch of a spoon. Topped with a good handful (or two if you're nice) of shiitake mushrooms and fresh-cut cilantro, this amazing meal befriends your wallet at a mere $7.95 (with or without white rice)!

In conclusion, try the oxtail soup combo!"
5,"Very nice, clean, upscale hotel. I didn't want to leave ....definitely will have to go back in the spring summer when the roof top is open. Due to the weather it was closed."
5,"Great beers, cool vibe, happy/cheerful/passionate bartenders. Never disappointed. Love the food truck events. Especially when Rogue BBQ is there."
5,"Wow is all i can say! Best car wash in town! Fast, clean and great attention to detail..."
5,"Good booze, ambience, and great service. Check it out if you're in the Pittsburgh area for sure. You won't be disappointed! Two thumbs up for sure"
5,"I got my oil changed on Saturday and I couldn't be anymore pleased. I especially thank the front desk guy Pat for being extremely nice, but also not being pushy in sales for some of the minor problems I needed to fix my car. 
Great customer service! Also, thanks to the mechanic that changed my oil :)"
5,"This location is very good.  Service was quick,  honest and shows you the problems and what needs to be done. Pat, awesome guy.  Very personable and exactly the type of customer service rep you want to be dealing with.   Thumbs up for this group."
5,"Wow, what a great find inside the MGM. At first the two bartenders  (Ashley & Frank) were very busy, when it slowed down they were up to par with our orders and extremely friendly. Came to find out both from same areas of where me and my co-worker were from. These two need a promotion. Thanks you guys!!!. From the 2 annoying customers last friday"
5,"Beyond pleased with the service I received from Jim and the team at Meineke!  I stopped by with no appointment to have my a/c checked because it wasn't blowing cold and my poor kids were melting in the back seat.  He had my car fixed super quickly (I had walked to Target to kill time and they were done faster than I was!!) and it is good as new (maybe even better!).  They also checked for a fuel leak because I had been smelling gasoline, but found literally nothing wrong, so he removed the diagnostic charge - I was extremely impressed that they were willing to do that!!  What would have cost me half a day and well over $300 at the car dealer, was done in less than an hour for just over $100.  I will absolutely be returning here in lieu of the dealer in the future!!"
5,I wish I had been here longer than one night!  I loved this hotel. Very trendy and modern.  The check out was quick and efficient. I was invited to a welcome reception via email which was kind - I was not able to attend. The hotel seemed to have a cool bar - The Vault. If I am back in Cleveland I would definitely stay here!
5,"Amended review. Jake, one of the owners, encouraged me to come back after a bad experience. I'm glad I did. The beer is absolutely excellent, and the atmosphere is great. I'm a happy girl."
5,Bartender Jordon was awesome!  Good drinks served in a timely manner...best place to come for a quiet drink . Kinda off beat from the casino floor without the slot machine noise. If your at MGM definitely stop here and ask for Jordon!
5,"If you want to experience one of the coolest atmospheres in Pittsburgh and some awesome beer, I'd highly suggest Voodoo! 

I waited to judge Voodoo until my second time here, and I gotta say, it still held up to my expectations. The building is located in a cool old police station, and decorated in the coolest chalk art I've ever seen. 

With an assortment of beers on top from Voodoo, you can't go wrong. They have something for everyone here. The customer service was even better, when I ordered my beer, they just kicked the tap when the bartender opened up a bottle so I didn't have to wait for a new one. Applause to you, that impressed me more than anything. 

On a Friday / Saturday it does get crowded, so I would get there early if getting somewhere to sit is important to you."
5,Bought a groupon- they washed my car. My car is clean and I am a happy camper. Friendly and fast for a great job. People just like to complain on yelp! This is a good car wash and great deal with groupon
5,"When I was wandering around I discovered a couple of gems:  1.  they have real lions at the MGM and it's free to see them.  2.  there is a very nice looking round bar there too.   We just wanted a mellow drink or 2 and heck, we were in Vegas.  It was not our big night out so just 1 or 2 and off to bed.  When we went at about 10, I saw ladies dancing on the bar and was drawn immediately in.  Then to my utter surprise, the song ended and they started pouring drinks.  Our bartenders had to dance every 1/2 hour.  So we sat down in front of a male bartender and ordered some dirty martinis and asked if he had to dance too.  Yes.  pfft.  I didn't want to leave.  Really.  And if I can remember, Kyle was his name and he was an AWEsome dancer.  I love my boyfriend but I was getting a little crush on our fancy footed barman. And their drinks were great and the prices were not that bad.  I really wanted to go back and see Kyle(?) again but no time.  I hope he still works there my next trip because I am definitely going back.  Oh, you have to hold your drink while they dance but who minds that?"
5,"The people that work at Meineke on Blue Diamond today really helped me out more than they can imagine, Jim especially. I went in thinking I had a blown head gasket, was 99% sure that's what it was as a matter of fact. I called around getting estimates for that type of job and I was getting in the $3500 range. Jim told me to bring it in because there is that whole other 1% of things it ""might"" be. Glad he knows more than me! I took it in for a diagnostic and got a phone call less than 2 hours later telling me it was just a faulty radiator cap, which was $15!!!!! I really appreciate the work they do and the honesty that is behind it. I would recommend this auto shop for ANY maintenance or repair job and will definitely be coming back. Thank you Jim and everyone that helped me today!!!!!!!!"
5,"My sister and I splurged for the Bubbles Under Glass event, including early access to the Bubbles Lounge. Tasting Cristal was on our bucket list and this event did not disappoint. Staff was welcoming and friendly. The pours were generous and the hors d' oeuvres were unique. We thoroughly enjoyed both the event and the venue. Top of line without any snobbery. The venue was beautiful, unique and luxurious from check-in to valet, to an excellent room service breakfast. We will definitely keep in touch with other events at this venue. Proud to have this in CLE!"
5,"Just came back from an oil change and the customer service was superb! Very friendly, quick service and it's conveniently located inside a shopping center so I got to kill two birds with one stone and run errands. I would definitely recommend this place and am coming back!"
5,"Probably the best hotel I've stayed at. I received the military discount and this is the best discount on a hotel I've ever received.  This place is a modern luxury masterpiece. The rooms, elevators and building itself is immaculate.  Everyone was very nice and the staff was super friendly as well.  The rooftop bar was pretty awesome as well.  Overall, great hotel and this will always be my number one hotel to stay at when I am back home in Cleveland!"
5,"Excellent quality fish, wonderful staff and lovely drink selection. It was small inside and we were a big group- but it worked out well on a Thursday and we never felt rushed or crowded and we were there for a while. Half price oysters were also excellent.
Poke bowls are small- even the large so it's worth it to pay the extra few dollars for more.  Thank you to the establishment we enjoyed our experience."
5,Truly my favorite bar in Pittsburgh. The beers here are top notch and will get you drunk for cheap in an awesome atmosphere. Now with the addition of the FooDoo food truck outside you absolutely can't go wrong here. My personal faves are the Voodoo Love Child and the Portobello tacos. Get down to Homestead immediately!
5,"Excellent service, upscale updated rooms. valet to keep you out of the cold. Fantastic Basement Jazz bar in the winter or rooftop bar in the warmer weather."
5,"Coming from the Meadville area, I was skeptical that our hometown brew would travel so well to Pittsburgh--but goodness, the bar is even more beautiful and awesome than our bar in Crawford County. This place kicks so much ass. The staff was great, the beer was fantastic (as always), and the crowd was kicking. If you're in the area, you CAN'T miss this place."
5,"Went here at about 9pm on a friday and it wasn't busy at all (which surprised me). However, I was with family and friends and we were looking for somewhere we would be able to hear one another. There is a great selection of different brews for decent prices and the overall vibe is very cool and hipster. My brother brought his growler and was able to fill it for $15. 

Only complaint is that it was a cold night and they did not put down the two huge garage doors that essentially make up one of the walls until about 10pm so you may want to bring a jacket! 

Will definitely return in the future!"
5,"I prepaid for a hand wax and interior detail last month (I only had time for a wash and vacuum), and the fast talking salesman told me to bring it by anytime to get this completed. 

So I stopped by today and they told me they didn't have time, but if I really wanted to, I could leave it and pick it up at 5. This was obviously distressing, as it was 11, and I was just a bit upset. 

So the man I was speaking to told me we can set an appointment for next week and he'd do a wash on it today for free. 

I went from not ever returning to a happy customer. They made right on a mistake and have likely earned my loyalty ( I went to the same carwash in California for 10 years). I'm glad I have finally found a good carwash in Arizona and can't wait to return!"
5,"I went to the New Year's Eve party that took place at The Vault downstairs and had a wonderful experience. I arrived early (8pm) because I had not pre-purchased a ticket for the party which was said to be sold out. I called and spoke with a kind woman ahead of time, and she recommended showing up early and waiting to see if there was a possibility of getting in. 

I did--and there was. Prior to going to the downstairs affair which included appetizers (crab cakes, asian egg roll type things, and bruschetta), I went upstairs to a well-appointed small bar. They didn't have one of the ingredients for the coffee drink I wanted to order, so it was suggested I consider a chocolate martini, which I did. It was excellent--with a red raspberry on the rim of the glass. My only qualm was that this drink was $3 more than the coffee drink I wanted to order, and I was not told about this ahead of time. So--$3--that's fine. Not a big deal obviously, but still it would have been nice to know prior to ordering. 

As for the party downstairs, it was great. The people at this place are professional. Thank you for a wonderful New Year's Eve party. If I lived out of town, I would stay at this hotel."
5,"Friendly staff, good poke and decent price! Well worth the walk from my hotel. Try the spicy ahi poke bowl paired with a Blue Blaze Brewing CO Kolsch, a great combo :-)"
5,"A must try bar at Mgm. You'll be paying club prices for drinks but with none of the hassle. Awesome decor. This bar has been here for years so you know it's good. Great service from the bartenders, I didn't wait long for my drinks. I suggest trying this bar before all the other small bars you'll stroll by at the Mgm"
5,Spent New Year's Eve there with family and friends.  Good food and friendly service.  Overall great experience.
5,I had a business meeting this morning here. I am a throat cancer survivor so meals are a challenge. The breakfast spread looked and smell terrific but there was unfortunately nothing I could eat. I spoke with a staff member about any options. She (I did not get her name) offered to get me some Payne from the Kitchen. Not only did they bring that but also some sliced bananas. This may not sound like much to most of you but it was huge to me. They went above and beyond for me and I truly appreciate it. I did not stay here but if this treatment is a taste of the service I will be back to stay the night.
5,"awesome spot!  great atmosphere, love the food truck.  try the foodoo burger and beach gear beer!"
5,I have been to a couple of the other Classic Car Spas and this location is by far the best. They do a great job and are very friendly.  My car is always immaculate. Chris was very helpful and didn't try to upsale me things I didn't need. I'll drive a few extra miles to come back here.
5,"Went to this place and the food was good with reasonable price. There were plenty of options and if you get overwhelmed, the staff are super friendly to help you out with any questions. There is a guy named Drew and he was very friendly to customers. A plus if you're hangover or hangry! The location is convenient for a quick stop for food."
5,"Really cool atmosphere! Huge garage space with multiple tables made from slats or reclaimed wood and (I assume) local art on the walls as well as painted creations on the ceiling. Definitely the type of place where various groups of people can come together and kick back. They also allow dogs, which makes my heart happy...my pup was pretty stoked about it too!

The beers I tried were enjoyable - two of their IPAs, the hoodoo and the H2P (Hail to Pitt!!!). I liked the H2P a touch better but couldn't quite place my finger on why. I read on their Untappd description that it's brewed to have a bit of a piney flavor, so maybe that was it! 

The service at the bar was also spectacular. I went on a Thursday evening so it probably wasn't their busiest night, but all the bar seats and tables closest to the bar were full and a good crowd was gathered at the other tables for the band that was playing. The bar tender was super attentive and came over to me almost immediately each time that I came to the bar. As a five foot nothing gal, I can tell you that this type of service is both uncommon and appreciated! 

Will definitely be stopping back and recommending the brewery to others. They don't serve food, but I hear the original brewery in Meadville does, so I'm hoping that will change soon!"
5,Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. This was my first time coming here and I will defiantly be back.
5,"Very nice, clean, upscale hotel. I didn't want to leave ....definitely will have to go back in the spring summer when the roof top is open. Due to the weather it was closed. Customer service was great. I rate 10"
5,"Love this place! Excellent craft beers, plus they make their own mead! We've also tried their food and it's surprisingly delicious. Best part though is that they have giant wood tables and board games. Great place to meet friends."
5,"Love this place! Excellent for a chill, ppl watching spot. Awesome DJs. The waitresses could be more attentive and alert but the bartenders are usually great. Added to my list of must go places in Vegas since it's in my favorite hotel."
5,This is the place to go if you are looking for great friendly service. I don't know much about cars and when I ask they explain until I understand without frustration. Jim is super understand and awesome. I highly recommend this shop.
5,"I am in LOVE with this place! We came here around 7 on a Saturday night, and there was no wait. The set up and ambiance was awesome; the best way I can describe this is laid back casual. The vibe is a true New England fish market, but a modern no-frills hip take on it.

We ordered the Poke Nachos, Lobster roll, Spicy Ahi Tuna Bowl, and the Seared Wagyu Bowl. First off, the Regular size poke bowl is a great size. For 8.95, the regular size is plenty to feed one person.  They also offer a large for $12.95 (which is prob what a large dude would eat if they were trying to pack the protein in.  

The nachos were unexpectedly tasty! They're served on fried wonton crisps, and that is the perfect choice. You can tell the dish is really balanced, and that a lot of thought went into the elements.  The seaweed isn't your normal seaweed, and is a perfect touch. The creamy and spicy togarashi sauce ties the whole thing together without overpowering the tuna, and leaves you wanting more!

Bowl of our bowls were really really good, and I especially like how they have a sauce and accoutrements station at the tables; you can spice, sauce, and season the bowl to your liking! And for FREE. The soy reduction and lime ponzu were our personal faves, but they were all good.

Last, but not least, the lobster roll. OHHHH, the lobster roll. A moment of awed silence for this.
I'm from Connecticut. The COAST of Connecticut. So when I tell you I've had more lobster rolls in my life than most people have had glasses of water, I'm not kidding. So believe me when I say, this is the BEST cold lobster roll that I've ever had.  { Only second to a hot lobster roll that I had in Maine, because... butter. ?}
The lobster they use isn't over cooked or over-steamed, which happens a lot unfortunately. Their lobster is clearly great quality and properly prepared. And there's SO much of it!! It's a huge portion for only ~$20. Best part: it's not oversoaked in mayo or huge chunks of celery...it's light and fresh. Served on what is obviously a toasted Martins Potato roll (true connoisseurs choice for lobster roll), this is just perfection.

This new spot is no amateur hour, and is the product of what is obviously a lot of careful and deliberate planning from its owners.  Check it out ASAP, you won't be sorry."
5,"I was checking out potential brewery stops on the route to our new home in Maryland when I stumbled upon this gem. Their website looked promising and so I decided this would make a worthy resting area.

As it was August, they had their doors open and allowed us to bring our cats inside as long as we were close to the open air. It was raining, but I was still so thankful they let us give the kitties (and their mommies) a much needed break. Their beer was wonderful and ran the gamut of different varieties. As much as I tried to stick to the light, lower ABV types, I was immediately drawn to the Blueberry Bunches of Oats (11%). It was so sweet and scrumptious, it took a valiant effort on my part to not drink more than a taster of it. 

I would also like to note that they serve perogies and that makes my heart happy. The service is always wonderful and the beer tenders are very friendly. Even finding parking on the street has been a breeze both instances I've made my way back here. I love absolutely everything about this place.

P.S. Take some time to check out the art around the taproom."
5,"This place is the BOMB. Boyfriend lives across the street and if I wasn't obsessed with him already, I'd probably still stick around just so we could continue hitting up this joint every weekend.

Everything is so fresh, flavorful, and delicious. I can't move past the signature shrimp bowl, but I have ventured out to try the waygu steak bowl as well as the wonton nachos. Nachos are probably/definitely not gluten free and man, did I regret it later; however, THEY WERE SO GOOD, I can't promise that I'll never order and suffer again.

The shrimp bowl is like heaven in a dish. Yummy, fresh shrimp, surrounded by pineapple and spices and vegetables, and I smother the whole thing in their Kuzu Lime sauce and I just really can't imagine myself happier than I am when I'm eating that thing. 

I tried the waygu steak bowl - the steak was a little rare for my taste and the wasabi peas were a little spicy for my taste (I know, I'm a child, shut up). It was still great and it's my boyfriend's go-to bowl.

The nachos are otherworldly - wonton strips and delicious chunks of seafood and vegetables and it's all covered in this obscenely delicious creamy sauce that would make an old shoe taste good. Seriously. Get the freaking nachos.

Service is awesome - they've made fun of the boyfriend and I for literally coming in for 3 days in a row before. Stop making the food so damn good if you don't want to see our faces!"
5,"Stayed on a Saturday night and found out what the buzz is all about! This beautiful hotel is full of energy!  People coming and going, I felt like I was in New York City! Did not get to the club, The Vault, or restaurant, Adega, because of our short stay, but look forward to trying them out next time. The room was awesome and the service could not be any better. In short, The Metropolitan at the 9 is a 10!"
5,"We came here for a nearby dinner and a show down the street. I had planned to rely on surface lots, but my spouse had arranged for parking through the park whiz app. Thank goodness he did since there was a great deal going on and all the lots were priced the same. Having a parking garage and valet already taken care of was quite a bonus. The staff were fast and friendly. We will use thius again"
5,"I've received great service at this location twice now. Jim was affable, communicative, proactive and not condescending in any perceivable way. I'll be going back to this location when the need arrives and will recommend it to others as well. Great work!"
5,"Just a Deli that sells $.99 shrimp cocktails. You'll have to wind through the casino to find it, but it's worth it if you like to budget."
5,"Love love love!  Atmosphere is awesome, big, open, community feel long high top tables.  Board games to play too.  Beer is really good, large selection to keep everyone happy.  I LOVED the metmosa (got it with Voodoo Love Child).  I just felt at home here, I'll be back... ALOT."
5,"Simply the best car wash in the valley.  Thorough and complete service, you actually feel guilty with the amount of effort they put in.  Great job every time!  Tell your friends too!"
5,"Bar stop #4 of 4 day one at the MGM Grand Casino and Hotel pre Canelo vs. GGG fight.  Centifuge.  Always a good time.  Always a good place.  Always an adventure.  Best drinks of all 4 bars with great Tenders.  Circular bar hence the name, awesome  music piping in with music videos on screen.  Vibrant place for people watching and/or posing ...you choose.  Adjacent to Hakasan nightclub, the newly built game room and entertainment area, Sports Book, Poker Tables and all around casino scene.  A must for even just one drink!"
5,"Great customer service...Thought my tailpipe/muffler was bent because it was off the hanger due to backing into a rock. Took it in an the manager/worker put it on the lift, put the tailpipe back on the hanger and it wasn't bent as bad as I thought....Manager didn't charge me a dime. Next time I need work done, that's the place to go. Thanks"
5,"Everything is awesome. The asian worker name drew is very friendly, fast worker and nice."
5,"Meineke has always been the go to auto repair place in Pennsylvania. After I moved to Las Vegas, I struggled with shady auto repair shops until I came back to Meineke. I should have started here! This location handled my problem with professional care. They checked out the entire car for safety, addressed my concerns, and reassured me that all was well. The bill came to $0.00. They could have ""found something"" and charged me, but they are honest! I will reward their honesty with my loyalty. Great Job!"
5,Best location in Toronto. Jack Astors offers a fun noisy TV crazy environment with interesting but always tasty food options. Try the pan bread with cheese yum!
5,"Yup. Best hotel in the US for the price. High quality service, a teeny not pricey but you definitely get what you pay for and that's quality service. I legit felt a sense of class I never have walking DOWN THE HALLWAY IN OUR HOTEL ROOM...IN THE ROOM. HALLWAY. YEA  2 big ass flat screen TVs ..a damn LIVING ROOM SET UP. Deep ass tub for wifey and a rainfall shower head. Kids loved it too"
5,"Got my car detailed here and it was AMAZING!!! It looked better then when it was new. Ever since then I have been back every other week, keeping my car looking great. BEN is definitely the guy to go to, he cares about your car as if it were your own!"
5,I didn't stay at the hotel but I did come here for a CD release at the ALEX theatre and had a meal here. WOW - this place is BEAUTIFUL. Super classy. I was blown away with how elegant and beautiful it was inside.
5,"When I first found out Voodoo Brewery was opening a retail location in Pittsburgh in Homestead (by the Waterfront), I was beyond excited.  The possibility of getting their staple, and at times Barrel Room Collection, beers in the burgh without the accompanying 2 hour commute North to Meadville made the #1 food news I heard in 2014.

I had the chance to attend their soft opening, and needless to say, my building anticipation and the accompanying hype was worth it...  the new place rocks.

What I love about it, is how they've managed to replicate the unique feel of the Meadville brewery (reused materials, vibrant yet dark colors and appreciation for the building they occupy) while tailoring it to the Homestead building they bought and renovated (an old municipal building that housed Police, Volunteer Fire Firefighters, municipal staff, etc.).

The bar is absolutely huge (stationed inside the garage where the fire trucks used to be parked...  so let your imagination run) and it has a ton of really cool vintage fire suits, hoses, etc. that pay homage to its previous occupants.

Thanks to our fine friends at the PLCB, it seems they're limited in how they can sell/serve alcohol (there's a yellow line they're confined to), but they have a set of staple and then rotational taps that they keep on hand (looked to be about 12) in addition to case/bomber sales out of a cooler.  If you've had their beers before, expect the same high-quality big-alcohol, big-bodied beers that blend a good bit of creativity and representative styles.  They also have a mix of gear (t shirts, glasses etc.) that you can purchase to accompany the brew.

The only drawbacks I can come up with are the lack of food and parking.  Relative to parking, they've at least hired a valet for their evening hours (though I'm usually the last person willing to let someone drive our cars).  For food, apparently there's a food truck in the works, so I guess we'll have to rest on just their brews until they get that project running (hopefully it replicates the great grub they have at the brewery).

Overall, I've found the latest threat to my wallet!"
5,Beautiful modern room with alot of space. We had a room with two queen beds and a living room area. The room was huge as well as the bathroom. Hotel was very clean. We usually stay at another Cleveland hotel every year around this time but will be returning here next time instead. As a tip valet parking is expensive so if possible don't bring a car or park elsewhere.
5,"First of all go see Ben, he takes great care of your car. I have been getting my car done here since I have lived in AZ and each time they do a great job! I am always impressed with how quick my car gets done and how nice my car looks afterwards."
5,"Amazing fresh fish, the nachos are definitely worth getting. The Hawaiian cold brew coconut cream is also great too!"
5,This place is great. I traveled from New York for the weekend and it was a great place to stop by on a Sunday afternoon to catch the football game. Everyone here was very nice and the servers were great. The food here was very good. Try the wings ! Perfect for Sunday football. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
5,"Easily the coolest place I've ever been to in Cleveland
Great bar great music cool people

This is definitely a high-end place but it's definitely worth going lots of little nooks and crannies to hang out in."
5,"My favorite LV bar. EVER. Maybe it's just because I'm cheesy and love the dancing on the bar. Or maybe it's because how awesome the bartenders are. I don't go to Vegas often but when I go here, I'm always remembered. Their staff rarely changes. Some of the best bartenders I've ever met. They can make good drinks and entertain for hours."
5,"Great place, good ambiance & good food . Came for lunch& the cucumber Bloody Mary is a winner. Food is prepared with all good healthy variety turkey burger and Mushroom flat bread is light and tasty."
5,I was told by a different company that I needed brakes and an oil change.  I took my car to the Meineke on blue diamond near my home.  I was let into the office by a very kind staff.  It was there I met Jim Marco the general manager.  Jim explained to me that I didn't need brakes at all.  This was an amazing overall feeling knowing that I didn't have to replace my brakes.  It was also comforting to know that Meineke did not try to fix something that didn't need fixing.  The knowledge and professionalism of this Meineke is something that was truly genuine from gym and the rest of his staff I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends.
5,"Love all the chalk art! This is probably Pittsburgh's coolest looking brewery. The cow bell milk stout on nitro is extremely good. I highly recommend it if you're into good, dark beers."
5,Classic Car Wash is the place to go. Every time I've been here to have a car wash they have done an exemplary job. My car always looks brand new leaving the lot. I also had both of our cars detailed. The detailing is wonderful and their prices are more than fair.
5,Fabulous restaurant. I had the shrimp roll and a beef slider from my associates plate.  Absolutely perfect.  The shrimp was not overdressed in too much mayo and spices.  The bread was lightly toasted with a bit of butter so it was not greasy. Crunchy veggies on both that made it extra tasty.  Fresh is the word to describe this meal.  Definitely will be returning!
5,"WOW!!! Just WOW!!!

I have never seen a hotel that is so over the top with the customer service. 

from the first person I spoke with (Lauren) who assisted me in making sure the family was well taken care of with a great room, to Jennifer at the front desk, who went COMPLETELY out of her way to ensure my parents 35 wedding anniversary was over the top.... I have never been so blown away with customer service (and I work in a 5 star hotel myself)

They haven't even checked in yet and I already am forever in love with this property. 

Thank you thank you thank you! I am nearly in tears knowing they are going to have an amazing time at this hotel"
5,"Would highly recommend Metropolitan 9 !! I had a great time !! Visited the roof top bar which sure adds a lot of character to the place !! The view is beautiful and the wines and food are excellent . A very special ""thanks"" to Olivia who works at the bar !! She was so personable and made our bar and dinning experience an amazing one !! She is truly a very dedicated worker and I was very happy to meet her !! She attended to all our needs inspite of being so busy she made sure we were having a great time !! Thank you Olivia for making it a great evening for us !! 
Sincerely
DR MD"
5,"I just want to say how great the service was when I went in to get my oil change! Such nice gentlemen working here! I want to especially thank Jim, Rick, and Tony for looking into an issue I had with my radio! Thanks so much again! This is now my new car repair shop :)"
5,"Always a delight to slip over to Homestead and have a glass of Voodoo beer, was thrilled to have them expand to the area. The renovated fire hall adds a nice local and funky feel to the experience. Long and large wooden tables with stool chairs are inviting to groups large and small to stop by for a brew. An updated chalkboard brew list makes for easy selection of one pint or a flight. Bike friendly location along Homestead and street parking was adequate on two previous visits. Laid back and friendly staff/brewers, games for playing and clean restrooms are all a reason to come back. Cheers!"
5,"My new favorite place!! Amazing fresh poke bowls that you can completely customize. They don't charge you and arms and a leg for loading up your bowl either! They offer some items that are cooked for those non raw lovers. The tuna nachos looked amazing even though we didn't try them.

 It's a small place with one big long family style table so if you are planning on eating in keep that in mind but you also can order take out. 

I plan on visiting this place regularly! YUMMMMM!"
5,"Super cool environment to visit while enjoying an awesome variety of beers, food truck eats, and really friendly/knowledgeable staff.

I ordered a flight of ALL the beers (except the Magick White, which they ran out of). I love that each beer carried their own distinctive taste. Just putting that out there since some breweries' ""variety"" of beers all taste the same. Brews ranged from IPA's, brown ales, white ales, imperial stouts, milk stouts, and porters. Out of all of them, I'd say the milk stout on nitro stole my heart the most.

You order food at the bar, and the food truck parked preps the food. All good drunchie food. I ended up trying the pierogies and muffuletta sandwich. I've never had either before, but I thought they were decently priced ($5 and $10, respectively) while still filling me up, standing up to my beers, and putting me in a warm, comfort zone of food coma.

Environment is cool. There are long benches, great for groups, but also smaller tables for those who want a more intimate setting. Servers are great. Seems like they come in on their own time and genuinely enjoy every minute of interacting with the patrons."
5,"H2P. All I need to say. Plus the food truck is great. Chilling here on a summer evening with the garage doors open is great. They have plenty of their stuff on tap. And like I mentioned, you can get H2P here. And from what I understand you can't really get it anywhere else (hardly) and definitely not in bottles."
5,"I always stay at the MGM when I'm in Vegas and I always make sure to drop it at Centrifuge. It's a great place to people watch and like one of the other reviewers said, you should go here instead of Hakassan. Max, Steve and Joe are seasoned, professional bartenders and some of the nicest you will find in Las Vegas. Love you guys! This is a laid back, dimly lit place to tuck it at a couch with your friends, play some video poker, dance to the d.j. or just get your drink on. Always fun."
5,"Greatest team I'm dealt with in Nevada
They are the best team and best location for meineke.
Please praise them and they are amazing
Please recognize the general manager too
He helps as much as possible and speaks about the specials if any is going on."
5,The staff there at the 9 was very professional. They tended to my every need . Room were nice and clean and it in a great location.
5,"This place is a drunk mans Disneyland.  I stood in AWE with my other brothers in drunk crime as we watched a variety of food orders announced and then picked up from the food window.  To drunk to decide we cheered as the food went out.  Had been here over 40 times in my life but each time always feels like the first.  For some reason, everyone who comes here openly conversates in food dialog.  So I approached an elderly Asian couple who were sharing a bowel of something...  I said ""Good"" they told me ""#1""  so I ordered one of those they were having.  Turns out it was their famous oxtail soup, don't miss out on this no matter what you might think.  Usually the breakfast is what I have but everything on the menu is good.  Never had one bad thing.  This place is the ultimate in late night grub.  One of the Best places for steak & eggs at a reasonable price in the land.  To get the full experience you must be extremely intoxicated.  I will come back....."
5,"These are some of the most helpful and honest mechanics I have met! I had shoddy brakes that were squeaking like crazy and not only did they repair it, they explained how breaking too fast can wear them quicker and how the extreme cold to the extreme heat can greatly effect the way they wear. Jim Marco not only helped me understand the basics of brakes he explained how keeping bad brakes is super dangerous! He sold me new brakes, checked my fluids and sent me off feeling safer and more knowledgeable. Thank you for all the help. I will definitely be returning to this location for help in the future!"
5,"Honest, fast and friendly! They did a oil changed and helped me with any questions I needed to be answered! I am a young women newer to Vegas so it was nice going into a auto body place and felt like I wasn't being ripped off and got the professional opinions and services I went there for. Also I needed new tires and they even had the guys at the shop next door come over and give me a price! Thank you guys for your fast and honest work!!!! I will be coming back and sending people your way!"
5,"Went here for an early dinner one day. I had heard about it and wanted to check it out but never found myself in the neighborhood before when it was convenient. This time, I was nearby and ready to give it a try. Service was great and one of the servers helped me navigate the menu. After I picked my selection there was a small wait as the place was over half-full when I got there and was starting to fill up more as I was waiting. My poke bowl was brought to me and it was one of the most fresh, delicious poke bowls I have ever had. Very filling and very tasty. I have been back several times since and the food has always been excellent. Seafood lovers need to give it a try when they get a chance."
5,"I am so excited to find out that VooDoo Brewery has come to Homestead! A few friends and I checked out this place a couple Fridays ago. It is located in an old fire hall, which is super cool! There are not big signs outside, just a subtle ""VD"" on the door, so it could be easy to miss!

The inside was amazing! Art covering the ceiling and all of the walls... their draft list was written in chalk. So cool! I loved looking around at all of the drawings and creativity on the walls. There weren't any TV's and they do not have a kitchen (at THIS point in time), but there was a catering company that had sauerkraut and sausage sandwiches. I ordered the beer flight, which allowed me to try 6 of their beers! I also ordered a couple drafts as well. Out of all of the beers I had, I enjoyed VooDoo Love child, Killapilz and H2P (one of their seasonals) the most. Killapilz was an awesome beer for people who love hops, which I do! The beers were reasonably priced and the flight was presented in such a cool way! I ended up purchasing a beer goblet with the VooDoo logo on it also!

I will warn you, the beers are strong! 9-11%, which is pretty high, even for craft beer! The VooDoo love child doesn't taste like 11% at all either, which can be dangerous, lol.

The service was great, the beers were awesome and my friends and I had a blast! Now I am just anxiously waiting for a kitchen to open in the future!"
5,"We had a problem with an online order so we called and the manager was very nice and told us to come in the following week for complimentary poke bowls. We went in on Thursday night and the staff was kind and helpful. The manager that night looked into it and made sure our experience was good throughout. We ordered half a dozen Fire Lake oysters ($15 @ 2.50 each) and they were delicious and well-cleaned. 

The rainbow poke bowl is really awesome. It has salmon, ahi tuna and hamachi which makes a great sampling of the popular fish varieties without the added expense of $5 per additional protein if you go with other bowls. It's a great option if you can't decide what you want! 

We had Anika (sorry if I'm spelling your name wrong!) as a server and she was lovely. She added in a few toppings I was craving into the bowl. 

Slip ups happen at all restaurants and Hi Tide made up for it and we will continue to visit! This was our fifth time dining here/doing take out in a month so it tell you they are doing something right!"
5,Voodoo is from my hometown and I'm ecstatic that it is now here in Pittsburgh! I love a Belgian tripel and they have 2 on tap. Great place for groups! Check out all the amazing chalk art!!
5,"Full disclosure: I am a Marriott believer! I love staying at Marriott hotels. They have a great collection, a hotel everywhere, and the most consistent experience out there. The Metropolitan on the 9 is part of their Autograph Collection and is a fantastic hotel. The Autograph Collection is usually a quirky collection of unique hotels that offer a variety of experiences. The Met doesn't disappoint. They have a contemporary style that is welcoming and cool at the same time. And for being in downtown Cleveland the rates are not too bad. As with all Marriotts the rooms are clean and the service is fantastic. Adega is the main restaurant and has a unique menu of great dishes. Azure is the rooftop restaurant/bar that offers great views of the skyline and a chill environment. Not geared towards business travelers the rooms do not have desks so you will be using your laptop on your laptop. But who can say it is work when you are chilling on a couch in your room watching a 60"" TV while the monster bathtub fills for a soon to be soak and relaxation?"
5,"Centrifuge is located inside the MGM.  Bf and I stopped here for a drink.  There was a female bartender who waited on us.  She was hospitable and prompt.

At 10 p.m., the bartenders got on top of the tables and started dancing.  It was a lot of fun."
5,"I sent my wife to Meineke to have a check engine light re-diagnosed ( for free ) after going to a neighboring competitor.  I didn't want to pay twice for the same obvious condition.  in any event, the Meineke boys took care of my wife .  If I can send her to a mechanic, and she comes home happy, I'm impressed.  In all, I bought the needed part, and they installed a new intake manifold.  The check engine light was cleared, fuel injectors cleaned, and we are back on the road due to some quality service from Meineke and their neighborhood team of service technicians.  Thank you Meineke."
5,"Decided to not go to my car dealer anymore for my oil change because they took too long. 

Jim was awesome! He helped me and I was in and out. 

Reasonable pricing and quick service. 

Bruce (I think) was the one that worked on my car. 

Both guys are so nice and friendly! Will be coming here from now on!

Thank you for awesome customer service and for being quick!"
5,"I havent made it to too many breweries in my drinking days but this one is a must if you are so inclined. It really has it all. Its tight outside of main city Pittsburgh in a smaller town called Homestead which makes it super convenient whenever you're in the Pittsburgh area. 
The brewery resembled an old warehouse but had all tge fixings of a local bar type feel. 
A favorite of mine was the cowbell nitro stout. A milk stout infused with chocolate and oatmeal hints but not too filling although it tasted like a yummy chocolate milkshake. 
Another notable mention was Voodoo Lovechild. A fruitier Belgian Ale that taste more like a refreshing beach cocktail than a beer. At a whopping 8.5% alcohol content be careful not to drink too many of these unless of course you brought a designated driver. Hahaha...lesson learned. 
The atmosphere was super friendly and super cool. Everyone mingling and acted as if we were all good friends. 
Props lined  the walls and corners all within a voodoo type darker theme. But were interesting and sometimes hilarious to notice. The ceilings had great paintings and were well decorated
Service was super. I cannot comment on the food selection as my belly was reserved for all beer on this particular day. Although they had a chicken and waffle truck right  outside the building that many bar dwellers seemed to be enjoying. I will def save some room for this novelty next time. 
Classic games such as Clue, Scrabble, Checkers, Yahtzee, and Candy Land were offered for play if the mood so struck
Be sure to take a friend who knows how to have a good time like BJ A and I and your day/night cannot go wrong.    
Definitely cannot wait to return!!!"
5,"I have pulled in to Hi Tide, now twice, on my commute home from work. First time, dining in. I was dying to try some 1/2 priced oysters, which they offer daily, Monday -Thursday. I had a great experience. I'll definitely go back for more. Today, I stopped for take out, and had to try my first POKE bowl. I tried the Sriracha Salmon, medium. Incredible!!!
I'm hooked. I'm a pescatarian and also eating low carb, so Hi Tide is my new jam.
Can't wait to try lobster roll, on a bed of greens for me, on special every Monday. They also offer an incredible selection to whet your whistle."
5,"I went to Voodoo Brewery for a social with CrossFit Athletics during the afternoon and had a blast. I loved the open air setting. I arrived a little early with a book, had some amazing (and spicy) veggie tacos, and loved the Voodoo Love Child!

The service was fast--even when our group of 35 or so arrived. The bartenders were pleasant and helpful.

I don't know what it's like during the evening, but what a great place to hang out during the day! I'll definitely be back (with friends!)."
5,"Upon entering this JA on NYE, I was greeted and asked how many people. I came here for a dinner date, and luckily there was no wait for 2! However, due to their fully booked reservations, we could only sit for 1.5hr. Our hostess led us to our table and provided menus before quickly scribbling our arrival time (they really wanted us out quick, eh?). I was busy playing Pokemon GO, which I should note that UNFORTUNATELY, the surrounding pokestops are just beyond reach of JA. I was trying to catch some pokemon though. So a few minutes later, our server Dylan arrives. Dylan asks how we are doing and if we are ready to order. I, who was so caught up on Pokemon, didn't even look at the menu yet, so I let my date order before me. I didn't want a big dinner. Dylan recommended some sort of chicken special but I ultimately went with Lobster and Crab Dip while date got Cheese Quesadilla (starters for dinner yay). Dylan noticed I was playing Pokemon GO and made some remarks to bond over Pokemon GO. We waited 10-15 minutes for our food. The Quesadilla was soooo goood. Hot and cheesy. The Dip was already a favourite of mine, and this location met my standards for the dish. Dylan passed by twice to make sure everything was okay. We had other plans that night so we ate until we were full (which meant we finished the quesadillas and half the dip) and then I flagged Dylan down for the bill. It came up to just under $33 after taxes. I recommend both dishes for anyone who loves cheese. Dylan was also a great server. This is definitely my new favourite JA location."
5,Great bunch of guys. Very friendly.  Explained all the work being done.They had to call out to get a part I needed but they had it delivered!!  Truly full service! Don't hesitate to bring your car here for service.
5,"I am most lamentably and embarrassingly remiss in updating my previous review of this restaurant. I had a not very memorable experience with bad nachos, as they were stale, bland, jalapeno free ( I thought they were green bell peppers!) and also lacking in cheese and flavor.

As an avid lover of spicy food, I am very pleasantly surprised to say nachos don't have to be fiery and spicy to be tasty! When I let the restaurant know about my grievances at having taken a dear friend from out of province to dine there on a Friday night two weeks ago, JoJo one of the managers was very apologetic and immediately wanted to remedy the situation.

We all make mistakes but these people do everything they can to ensure it's nothing more than a fleeting memory of the past, and do everything they can to make it right again.

JoJo allowed the same friend, my husband to join me for lunch there on Sunday immediately following the incident and fed us not only delectable chicken quesadilla and the oh-so-worth the calories, totally scrumptious trademark Jack Astor garlic cheese pan bread, which is famous for a reason, but he insisted I try the nachos again this time with fresh tortilla chips and enough cheese to open up its own factory! Yes they use fresh jalapenos which are not a spicy as the jarred variety but it didn't matter because the flavor and care in the preparation made these rival and surpassed The Keg which was my previous contender for best nachos. Excellent service, fair pricing and amazing staff. Definitely would recommend going here. 5/5."
5,Love these guys always give me 110% Jim is the Shiznit!!!  He explains everything in detail so I can understand what I'm getting done. I feel confident in the work and won't go anywhere else.
5,This is the only place i will go to wash my car! Its fast and my car always comes out clean aswel as my interior. I highly recommend this place...
5,My preferred Jack Astors in Toronto. Great servers and food. My preferred drink is the Blue Raspberry lemonade.  Excellent poutine and excellent sauced up chicken fingers. Cheesy garlic bread is always great. So is the spinach artichoke dip. Really just a great place.
5,I like this car wash. My truck was super dirty and insides covered in pet hair from a road trip.  I bought a groupon just looking for a simple overall cleaning.  It came out amazing.  They took extra time on the pet hair and making the inside look as great as they did the outside.  I actually now prefer this hand wash over the other chain near my home.  I was treated well and did not have to be up sold over and over again because it was already included in the supreme wash.  Very happy.
5,"We had an excellent meal at HI Tide. Recently opened and it looks great inside and out. The food was great, I had the Poke nachos and a lobster roll. Everything was seasoned perfectly and tasted great. I plan on making this a regular stop in Charlotte. The service was great as well."
5,This was our first trip to Voodoo and we LOVED it! The beer was very good and the staff very friendly and helpful. There is a lot to look at inside... The decor and art were VERY interesting to say the least! We really enjoyed ourselves and we will be back!
5,"This is the BEST HOTEL in downtown Cleveland hands down! In fact, my experience has been consistently 5 STAR with all of the Marriott Autograph Collection Hotels that I've stayed at...The Metropolitan at The 9 clearly meets and exceeds this upscale, hipster, beautiful Autograph Collection standard!

We were upgraded to a gorgeous high floor corner King suite with sweeping views of the city!  Talk about great walking proximity to Everything - Progressive Field, many many superb restaurants and bars!  Hotel parking is valet only so we were lucky to leave the car in the hotel garage  and walk everywhere.

Remember the Metropolitan at The 9 if you are seeking a great place to stay in Downtown Cleveland and take in all the sights!"
5,Was my pregame and postgame food for life is beautiful. Definitely get your moneys worth here & one of the best deals downtown!
5,This car wash is the best! Always friendly service and they do a good job on my wash.  I come her every other month and won't go anywhere else!
5,"This is the Jack's that I usually go to. I haven't had a problem with the service yet and I've been there countless of times over the years. I've probably been at least 10 times this year! I've  tried most things on the menu and the best things would probably be the steaks and any chicken...so crispy tenders, sauced up tenders, wings (especially the hot wings..delicious). The fajitas are also really good. Don't go for the pastas...they taste very bland. Not much too it but it's Jack's so I wouldn't really expect pasta to taste anything out of this world. The cookie brownie is my favorite dessert."
5,"This is one of the hottest hotels I have been to in a long time 

Very cosmopolitan - very hip!!

The owner, Greg is top notch.  His staff is excellent!!  Alex the bartender knows his stuff and takes great care of his customers 

Greg gave me a tour of the club downstairs, the Vault.  One of the best clubs I've been to in a long time!!!!

When I'm in Cleveland, this is where I'm staying

Great Place"
5,Good place to get something to eat without going into a restaurant. They got oxtail soup $9 something whenever they are open. The two choice plate special for $6.99 is good too. The choices are chinese fast food kinda like panda express. For a quick bite to eat you cant beat the hotdog special for $3.50.
5,"I want to thank Pepper the Bartender & Lindy the Manager for making this the most memorable Birthday. You both went far beyond expectations. It will be one of the many reasons I will return. The Grilled Salmon was exquisite. I'm usually very picky about my fish but this as well exceeded my expectations & the flavors danced on my tung. 

The atmosphere was warm and inviting. How ya'll ended up getting the whole bar to sing happy birthday to me is still mind boggling. Thank you once again. It's something I won't forget."
5,"Favorite place for Poke bowls. Always fresh and flavorful. I feel like I've just stepped off the beach to grab dinner. The inside is a bit small but service is fast and there are a few outside tables and a bags set-up if you have to wait. Long beer/wine list. And a good lobster roll special on Mondays. 

I'm sure I'll be making this a regular stop while I'm in town!"
5,"Great place to go get drinks rather than go to Hakkasan which is next to it! We spent $25 for 2 tasty good sized drinks and a shot! In the club, it's about $25 for a small drink the size of a shot that tastes watered down, so save your money! The bar has TVs that play a lot of the music in Hakkasan, but shows music videos. Much more affordable and better quality! Great place to pregame! Johnny took care of us!!! Loved him! Would return for him!"
5,"What a remarkable renovation!

These guys have taken an old, run down, near-uninhabitable mess of a police station/firehall and revamped it to be a beerhall, bested only by Hofbrau. What impresses me the most is their ingenuity in using the materials they found in the dilapidated space to create the tables and some of the aesthetics in the room. For example, the palates were transformed into the picnic table tops. 

The grand opening was yesterday, and it was filled to the brim with people. No surprise, however, since their original location needed to expand. 

Voodoo's beers have been hitting the market for years, and now, Pittsburghers can enjoy the special releases and extras that those in the north have. 

You're not going to get any food here, so plan accordingly."
5,"I've had all good experiences at this location. Jim and the staff have been very friendly. It's easy to get an appointment there and they work on my cars in a very timely fashion. I've had several oil changes and brake replacement. I've even brought my car in on two occasions and they referred me out to other places for the work. That's a good way you know you can trust the place where you take your car, when they're honest. They do make recommendations for other work after the appointment, but I always appreciate them bringing it to my attention if they think something should be done now or in the future."
5,"I went there today to get my car washed, used a groupon.  It's the cleanest I've ever seen it in years.  I watched for 45 minutes as the man (I wish I would've gotten his name) scrubbed and scrubbed the interior and used this AWESOME smelling strawberry spray.  It smells and looks AMAZING!!!  I've had ""just ok"" service from this place before at other locations, but this location is my absolute favorite now.  I'll definitely be back for more!  I've tried some of the air fresheners they sell inside.  The only ones that really work are the ones that come in the sealed cans... all the other gel pads and stuff don't work well at all, so don't waste your money on anything but the CANS!

before i left, the guy asked me to make sure that i was happy with everything also.  i think that was PERFECT customer service.  they obviously want you to drive away happy and guarantee their work."
5,This place is so honest and friendly. Highly recommend. Amazing professionalism from the two men behind the counter. Will definitely be back.
5,"I honestly don't even want to post because I don't want this place to be packed... but then that'd just be cruel to keep this place just for myself. Oxtail soup is AMAZING!!! so good I literally came back for dinner! Yeah I know it's not your typical restaurant... it's fast food but trust me, this place for oxtail soup is legit! Sorry California hotel... I've found a new spot."
5,Service was quick and Jim and his staff are very helpful. I was grateful for their ability to fix my exhaust problem at very little cost. It's nice to have someone not try to sell you unneeded repairs.
5,Went in for an oil change and left feeling comfortable and confident about my car. They did an inspection so thoroughly they ended up replacing a fuel cap I didn't even know was broken (now it clicks!). The mechanic was kind and explained things so I understood. Overall I felt it was a very friendly auto shop and I'll definitely return and recommend to others.
5,"I came in to get the studs fixed on my wheels.   These guys are really nice.  The dealership said I was due brakes soon.  These guys are like,  not yet."
5,"YAAAAAAASSS!! LURVE this place! SO happy I found it! Their in house brews are AMAZING. Wanna know what else is amazing....it's LIZ! Yup, she's pretty awesome....."
5,"How can you not love a beer called Voodoo Love Child?!?  
This brewery is great!  It just opened a few weeks ago and already is drawing a big crowd.  The building is an old firehouse and is decorated with chalk drawings on most of the walls.  The beer list is also written in chalk on the wall.  They offer quite a few different styles of beers and have a sampler board so you try them all.  I really enjoy Belgium style beers and they have three on tap.  I like them all, but the Voodoo Love Child was my fav.  
This place is really big and you can definitely go with a group and have room for everyone.  Most places in Pennsylvania are BYOB, but this brewery is BYOS.  Bring your own snacks.  I saw a few people ordered pizzas and had them delivered.  Great idea!"
5,"I got a dozen oysters, three different types (which were all excellent). They were served with a horseradish sorbet, something I've never seen before and it was amazing. I also got a Spicy Tuna bowl that was delicious. Will definitely be back soon."
5,"Great place to go get drinks rather than go to Hakkasan which is next to it! Much more affordable and better quality! We went there pre-Hakkasan and basically spent $25 for 2 good sized, yummy drinks and a Jell-O shot! It's cool because they have all the music they would play inside the club on TVs with music videos! Johnny took care of us!!! Loved him! Save your money from buying drinks at Hakkasan and come here around 9:30-10:30!!! Pregame for sure!"
5,"Rick and Jim always take great care of us. Me and my wife have used them for all car problems, brakes, oil changes etc. and have had nothing but awesome customer service and will continue using them for all car troubles."
5,Cozy little spot with a fresh vibrant flavor. The passion fruit guava fresca was refreshing. The lobster lollipops had a mouthwatering flavor that made wish I could just keep eating it. I enjoyed every last bit of the hamachi bowl I had to finish my experience. Great food and service I'll have to try them again.
5,Has to be the best deal on Fremont street. 99 cents shrimp cocktail. I could eat these all day. I'll be back tomorrow for more
5,SO SO VERY IMPRESSED! Very friendly and funny staff. Discounts galore! Seriously! Wonderful prices and service....plus all the freebies! 4months roadside...FREE...inspection....FREE....!!! Knowledgable and customer service oriented. Will definitely go back!
5,"Stopped by for a few cocktails last night. The music was bumping and the cocktail waitresses were on the move. Enjoyed a fine Manhattan here and Niki being a fan of dirty martinis got a superb one here. The couch was comfy and a great place to sit, relax, enjoy some music, and do some people watching."
5,Hands down the best oxtail soup here in Las Vegas!!!! The wait is short and you don't have to wait long like the Cal. Trust me head down there and try it!!!!
5,"Voodoo is one of my favorite breweries, I've even made the happy pilgrimage out to sleepy Meadville to enjoy their ambrosia straight from the source.

Imagine my delight upon discovering that they were opening a new brewery right in my backyard in Homestead.  It's nearly within stumbling distance of my house, and offers a huge number of award winning craft beers and barrel aged heavy hitters.

Their decor has a ton of character including wooden shipping palette tables, intricate chalk art on the ceilings ranging from portraits of Nicola Tesla to Sistine Chapel recreations, and massive graffiti pieces covering the loading docks.  Their eclectic mix of art styles is as diverse and inspired as their beer.  

Voodoo is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and while we have many fine breweries in Pittsburgh, none are as uncompromising in quality, as unapologetically zany, or as over flowing with character as Voodoo."
5,"I am returning in 2018!!! when I stayed at Fremont Hotel, a customer told me that the oxtail soup with rice combo is KILLAZ!!!! so....I ordered it and went to my room and ate....for the next 6 nights, guess what was on my mind....and since the chinese ""fast food section was tempting""....so be it! 
the counter staff can be so-so, but from where I am from, I am USED TO with that kinda attitude.....I seen WORSE...beleive me!  Btw....I am NOT going to stand in a line of 20+ folks at the Cal at 1am in the morning for their oxtail soup....they probably are retired and gambling....me, I come for ""working vacation"".
UPDATE!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what the HELL HAPPENED???? your oxtail soup was AWESOME about a year ago....NOW,  after ordering that once I arrived in Vegas, your oxtail meat is NOT TENDER!!! I gave it a 2nd try a few days later.....OMG!!!! even WORSE!!!! so guess what I did? I covered it up good and tied a bag around it and shoved it in my check in luggage after leaving it frozen in the fridge....I will bring it home to have it BOILED again in my kitchen!!  One more thing...I am a customer of Vacations Hawaii and because my ""working vacation"" does NOT make me have time to go to a buffet....thus why I stop at your guys place....I am giving you my visitor $$$....I could go elsewhere but I like your food!  So what if I came a day later for dinner again...plse do not poke fun at me (not ringing up my order promptly!!!)....besides, sites like Yelp and others DO inform patrons about the quality, quantity and the service."
5,Love the place. Great atmosphere. Poke Nachos are must have. I have had several different bowls and they are all amazing!!!! And the oysters are
5,"Very impressed.  Food quality was excellent and reasonably priced.  Chicken fingers are excellent.  Food is very fresh and well prepared.  Would avoid the Thai summer rolls because as delicious as they are, one would need about a dozen to feel like it's a meal.  I plan to be a regular here."
5,Great car wash. Perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. Great prices for excellent washes. Only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around!!
5,I've been to the Meadville brewery before and it was an awesome place.  I decided to try the location down here in Pittsburgh yesterday and it was amazing.  All their beers are top notch and very good.  I finally tried their Breakfast of Champions stout and it was awesome.  Their hoodoo ipa is great too and they keep bringing our new brews to try during the year.
5,Great car wash. Perfect location along with there other locations valleywide. Great prices for excellent washes. Only place i go customer servie is outstanding and courteous. 2 thumbs up all around!!!
5,"We went to get a smog check and was told that something is wrong with our brakes. We decided to go to Meineke and not only was there nothing with our brake pad, Dean and Robert were super professional, they were honest.  Dean waited till I come back and made sure he showed me my brake pad was fine but I still have 9mm brake pad left.  These guys will always have my business, thank you for your service"
5,"The Metropolitan at the 9 is a brand new hotel and apartment building in the heart of downtown Cleveland only a half mile away from Progressive field and Quicken Loans arena and just over a mile away  from First Energy Stadium, The Great Lakes Science Center and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  The staff starting with the valet and the bellman to the front desk and the housekeeping staff were very friendly and professional but not robotic, engaging in genuine conversation and excellent service.
The queen suite was beautiful especially the huge bathroom with double sink vanity, separate commode, huge soaking tub and separate shower.  Quality of the beds and all the linens including the towels was outstanding.  At the higher end of pricing for other Downtown Cleveland hotels but very satisfied with the value.  Did not get a chance to go to the on site theater or the restaurant or either of the two bars but they looked fantastic.  The building also houses a Heinen's grocery store.  Several other bars and restaurants within walking distance.  Definitely will be back for a Tigers vs Indians  game this summer."
5,"Came here last night for a couple drinks and dinner.. the food was impressive! We got the pepperoni pizza, Cuban sandwich and buffalo chicken tacos. We devoured alllll of it and couldn't believe our taste buds! The atmosphere is garage chic with lots of cool art and painted murals- This place is killing it. They feature drinks from other local breweries and mead from Apis mead in Carnegie. On all fronts, we were very satisfied and can't wait to return. It's also cool that they now have other locations in grove city, Meadville and Erie!"
5,"This place has some of the freshest seafood in Charlotte.  We were very impressed with the quality and presentation of the poke bowl, poke nachos, and our daughter enjoyed her fried shrimp & fries.  We then moved onto the oysters and were shocked at how big & fresh they were - even our daughter loved them!  Hands down the best oysters we've had in Charlotte.  They also have a happy hour from 4-7pm where Oysters are half priced - which really helps the hit on the wallet."
5,The oxtail soup is soooooo good. I don't know why they don't mark it as specialty. Maybe other food is just so so . but you gotta try the oxtail!
5,"This place is located in the Fremont casino. We decided to eat here because of their famous oxtail soup. $10 gets you about 4 huge pieces of oxtail. The soup was so hearty and flavorful. You also get a bowl of rice with it. So worth it and affordable!

They also had a deal (I want to say it was about $4?) where you get bacon, sausage, eggs and rice and the portion was huge. 

Line was somewhat long but worth the wait."
5,"Voodoo is absolutely a world class brewery. Walk in to the brewpub any day of the week and you will be greeted with some of the best beers in the city. But if you choose a Barrel Room Collection(BRC) release day, you'll get to experience some of the most sought after brews in the world. People come from far and wide for a chance to get a draft of their amazing Barrel Aged beers. And if you are especially lucky, you'll have the opportunity to walk out with one or two bottles of their BRC beers. 

This was the case with my last visit. There was word that they had announced on social media that they had released their latest BRC beer and I had to check it out. I was greeted with a pub full of fellow beer drinkers all lined up around the inside of the pub to purchase two bottles and a draft of their new version of Big Black Voodoo Daddy. On an off day, there may be 10-20 people in the pub at any given time. But on this day there was well over 100 and more filing through the door by the minute.

The beer didn't disappoint. It had notes of coffee and oak. They also had a great selection of their regular beers as well as seasonally including their pumpkin barleywine. 

They also have a nice selection of small plates including hot dogs and tacos. And if beer isn't your thing, they also have local mead and wine as well as a selection of barrel aged cocktails."
5,Great great food! Very nice owners. I have never had anything I did not like. The only bad part is when you get there too late and they have run out of something you were craving! This place is a must!!!!
5,"Oh yum. I was driving around with my little guy asleep in the car, new to Downtown Phoenix and hungry. The friendly food truck person waved with a sign as I passed and I quickly made a loop around to see what they had to eat. 
Purchased a catfish burrito and the only thing that bothered me about it was that I wish I had 3 other people to share it with because it was huge. I got through half of it and was beyond finished. 
Delicious stuff and friendly people. Good street marketing."
5,"Yes, the hush puppies are AMAZING!  Their jambalaya was awesome!  Not too spicy but has a little heat on it!  Definitely find this truck!"
5,"My co-workers and I come here for lunch several times a week. The wait staff has come to know us and do all they can to help us speed through the lunch break, since we get only 45 minutes! 

The food is terrific, especially the French fries! And we all love the homemade ranch dressing. 

They have a lunchtime loyalty program, and if you go on your birthday, you get to spin the wheel for a variety of prizes! Lots of fun and great food . . .what more could you ask for?"
5,"I came here for the first time with my 3 year old daughter and this place is so so amazing! They have two separate rooms, one for a spa like pedicure and the other room is for nails. They even have a kids pedicure chair that my daughter loves. Very clean and a lot of colors that are ""in"" to choose from! They always try to accommodate everyone and they have the sweetest staff. Definitely a place my daughter and I will come to regularly!"
5,"First of all, this place is a gem! Mark is an amazing server, ask for him. What did we eat? I think everything. All was fabulous. Let me recap....

Rib eye, the king of steaks. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with a salt and pepper rub. I also ordered a side of Mac and cheese. If you like cheese, do it! It has a veal reduction in it which makes it good. Filet mignon 7 ounce, Perfectly bloody, and yummy....moo!!!. Lobster risotto, yummy but they used a bit of tarragon, not my favorite but good aside form hat personal preference. We did not eat dessert but we peeked at other tables and we're pleased with the views."
5,It was pricey but the staff was awesome.  They did everything in their power to create a great experience.  We had a picket child with us and the check made an amazing pasta and borrowed sauce from the restaurant next door.  It was also my Mom's birthday and they treated her to a nice dessert sampling.  They went above and beyond for our group!
5,Love this place. I've been eating here since I was a kid. The hoagie buns are fresh and the oil and seasonings make the sandwich.
5,Love coming here for a chinese buffet. Food is good and place is clean! They kinda rush you on the check when your still eating but regardless i love it here.
5,Got Five more subs for my 31st class reunion. Gateway.  Almost everyone had some and as always the super battleships were great.  Called ahead and they had them ready when we got there!  Thanks guys!
5,Everyone was very nice when I went there! Made accommodations for us and made the experience great! Would definitely go back for Tracy and Vinney!
5,"oh waffle house gods in the sky. thank you for arranging the stars so the good egg had a wait. i know your feelings may have been hurt because a certain someone didn't have her heart set on partaking in a meal at your restaurant. 

but i love you, even though the tables are gnarly, the silverware is kinda clean, the floor is not to be made eye contact with and it is advisable to drink your beverage with a straw. and we with the help from the wait gods got three more waffle house converts out of a meal. 

our server was fantastic. she apologized because they were short staffed yet she was accommodating in every way. she exceeded all of our waffle house expectations. we had a little bit of everything and you can't go wrong with anything. get the hash browns all the way - it's a style, not a request. the burgers are good diner burgers too. 

y'all it's not a high class place. it's cheesy greasy, tasty and cheap. but it's f*(king delicious! and CA needs to get one."
5,This place is awesome!! Vibe is really cool and so many drink options something for everyone. The highlight was the video games from my childhood! My husband and I had a blast! We will be back
5,"We have eaten here for years and really enjoy the huge variety. Everything we have ever had has been great and cooked perfectly.  We placed a large catering order for today and I just wanted to say how wonderful everything was!! We ordered 400 wings, cheese fries and stuffed mushrooms. Everything was delicious, hot, and packaged perfectly.  We were given a lot of ranch dressing and carrots and celery too. It was so nice to have a party and not worry about the food at all. I will use NPL next time we host an event like this and I would recommend them to anyone who wants a large carry out order."
5,"Terrific, authentically prepared Cajun food.

We stopped by the Phoenix Public Market yesterday to check out Food Truck Fridays.  It was almost 2 p.m. and they were getting ready to close so after quickly surveying the six trucks, we decided on Jamburritos.

We ordered the chicken and okra gumbo and the fried catfish special.  Both were awesome.  The gumbo was a fairly large portion that was rich, flavorful and chock full of sausage, chicken and okra.  Absolutely delicious and a steal at five bucks.  The catfish was completely non-greasy and cooked perfectly, served with rice and greens.

Highly recommended."

**slow clap**

Well done WW, you bested me last night, bested me at my own game and tested my tummy.  

Devils inferno was your game and you certainly brought ""the heat.""

I've never eaten something that so immediately brought tears to my eyes and made me yearn for a quick death more. Bravo. 

Devils Inferno is not something to be trifled with... Trust me its the next morning and it is now trifling with me in an ungodly way. 

Despite gruellingly slow service last night (due to AYCE wing night and a Leaf game), I'm giving you a fifth star for your performance in the ""scorch Kris so bad he'd rather cut off his tongue, douse himself in gasoline, light himself on fire an get kicked in balls by a satanic mule"" category. 

Glory glory what a helluva way to die...."
5,"I love this cafe! ""Lazy Daisy's"" is one of those places that you feel comfortable in... Of course the environment helps but also their food and personnel! 
They have games for you to play, many electricity plugs on the wall for you to charge your laptop or phone and a very good coffee to go with that. 
I'm sold and I also recommend you to go visit them."
5,"My first time here , heard a lot of hype about this place , food was good , customer service was good , still would like to try a few others to get a true feel  for the franchise and the food ! Overall I give them a thumps up , good prices as well if you have not tried it ? I would say go for it !"
5,"Delicious homemade food! Friendly, competent staff. Congenial ambience. Super value. All in all a winner. Highly recommended!"
5,"Food, service and ambiance was PERFECT! Must say it was hands down the best dinner I've had in Vegas and possibly ever. Lobster and ribeye were cooked to perfection. Just melts in your mouth! The chef here is amazingly talented. I came here on a recommendation and left recommending. Can't remember the servers name, but remember the chef was Steve Young. 

A DEFINITE MUST TRY."
5,"been going here for years, there is something spacial about Barros. just taste so good and different the other pies"
5,"Literally the best food truck I've tried out here!! Got one of pretty much everything on the menu the nigut we went and was not the least bit disappointed with anything. The fresh made cajun chips and hush puppies were excellent, tacos were great, and the jamburrito was absolutely to die for! I wanted four more, but was already so full. Will definately return."
5,"fantastic, we tried 5 items and they were all excellent. our appetizer was the pot stickers, then we all shared the house special lo mein, the general xaos, the sesame beef, and the chicken wraps. all yummy, cant wait to go again. the woman behind the counter was polite, friendly, and very helpful."
5,Local family friendly cafe at Coxwell and Gerrard. It's nice and comfy and you get a nice feel at home sense when at the cafe. It's a nice casual cafe to catch up with friends and family over a cup of coffee and pastry or even to catch up on some work on your laptop as the cafe does supply free WiFi as well. Their food is made with local ingredients that they get from local farmers and suppliers and a lot of their pastries are homemade. If not they are brought in other local bakeries. They also have beer from local breweries like Godspeed Brewery that is open just behind them on Coxwell. Their menu maybe on the pricier side and gets busy around lunch and especially on the weekends (they have brunch from 8:30am-2:30pm on the weekends and a brunch menu) but totally well worth it!
5,Wonderful little cafe with excellent breakfast and brunch options.
5,"Stumbled this place at 1 am while finding ourselves famished. Service was super friendly, space is open and fun, accessories and decor just made me feel like a kid at McDonald's . Wings-best I've ever had. I happen to be a wing frequenter."
5,"Good quality food, great value, friendly service, clean restaurant.  This place has it all.

I had the kalbi banh mi and it was delicious.  Good amount of meat, and veggies were fresh.  My son had 2 spiced pork belly baos and he loved them.  Was fun watching him spit out the cilantro - it was his first time tasting it and didn't know what it was.  I take nothing away from the restaurant though as I'm not sure cilantro is universally loved by kids.

Highly recommend this place."
5,Favourite southern Italian in Toronto. Wish they still had the rabbit on the menu. Definitely get the osso buco. Order as a group and share for the best experience.
5,"I had an empty stomach and time to kill before an appointment when I stumbled upon this place. Recognizable name yet I had never been.

I ordered the steamed bao in pork belly and fried chicken and waited for them to cook it. Grabbed a table in a fairly empty place. Wish the heavily cologned couple had not chosen the table right beside me. My head can feel that cologne.

Screw the cologne, there is a flavour explosion in my mouth. I started with the fried chicken bao and mmm the sweetvinegar carrots with cilantro and crunchy chicken is perfect. If I get this again would probably go without the mayo.

On to the five spice pork belly. Unplanned I had saved the best for last. I love five spice and with cilantro there are no words.

The place was clean and employees friendly. Nice and bright at the front, cozier towards the back."
5,Wonderful experience and it feels like a spa vice just a nail joint. My sister went to Johnny (absolutely amazing) and I went to Jimmy (equally amazing)!!! Would recommend this place to anyone!  Dan is the owner of this family business who has a great business sense and treats clients like family!
5,All I can say is... AMAZING!! Michael and his staff are awesome and serve up some great food!! They came out to our office and catered a lunch for our Firm. The food was fresh and delicious. The chicken etoufee and shrimp tacos were the best! Their fresh salsas were excellent. I especially loved the Cajun chips and the homemade Hush puppies.  The portion size was super generous. If you see this food truck around definitely grab a bite to eat as you will not be disappointed! I can't wait to eat their food again!!
5,"Sandwiches aren't highly visible amongst the hand written taps on the chalkboard but ask about them! We tried the fig and goat cheese as well as a pepper and prosciutto sandwich (can't remember what they were called) and they were to die for. 

There are also games and a ton of beer, ciders, mead, etc."
5,"Before I went vegan I would always get poutine from here and it was soooo good. I decided to try the vegan poutine and was expecting it to be disappointing, but it was actually really good  even without real cheese (and it's awesome that they include vegan options). I had a slight problem with my order (I paid for extra ingredient and it was really lacking in what I ordered) but the owners went out of their way to make it up to me, so it's clear they care about customer satisfaction. If you want a poutine, go here! Definitely worth it."
5,"Always has a place in my heart. 

My ultimate fall back. The variety of flavours for there wings is incomparable! The size of the place is huge. And the service always friendly :) 

What can I say I am a sucker for chicken wings. So if you love wings as much as I do, you gotta try this place!!!"
5,"My husband and I have been on the hunt for the best Steakhouse in Vegas, and we feel that we have finally found it!  This place was not cheap, but it was sooooo worth it!  My husband had the 32oz porterhouse, and I had the 7oz filet mignon. Both entrees were the most tender steaks we've ever had. They also had delicious sides, like stuffed baked potato and Mac n cheese with truffles. The service was top notch as well, not too stuffy to engage, and the perfect amount of attentiveness.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did:)"
5,"Hands down the best place to get a craft beer downtown!  Epic selection, great staff, quality games!  You can't go wrong with the Pig!"
5,"I have lived in Las Vegas all my life, and I had never been to this restaurant before yesterday (7-6-18) evening. It was excellent. The food was fantastic, and the service was exceptional. Our server was Bobby, and I could not have asked for better service. I met several other servers, including Liman, and they were all very friendly and informative. Our server even brought the chef, Steve Young, out to meet us.  You have to meet this young, passionate chef.  He will be famous someday!"
5,"Great pizza and even better wings. I recommend the sweet red chili flavor! Good, consistent service keeps us coming back almost weekly!"
5,Finally a place that open late. I needed last min manicure n I have driven by this place a couple times so I decided to try out. Trish was the girl that took care of my nails. She did a great job! Loved it! Very patient n sweet. I'll definitely come back to get pedicure. Love the fact they close 11pm n the best part it's just around the corner of my house. I'm one satisfied customer!!
5,"Think fresh bread, fresh vegetables, daily sliced meats of the highest caliber served in white butcher paper by very slow service.  Ahhhh, the joys of ordering a torpedo (around six inches of bread) or a Battleship (fasten the hatches!) from the Triangle.  They make the best cold hoagies -- turkey, italian, and ham are among my favorites!  They also have a bar and TV's for that minimalist game viewing adventure with regulars from nearby homestead and braddock propping up the stools.  It's a great take out place -- call ahead though.  A Pittsburgh classic you must try once for a Steeler or Penguin game party.  Terrific!"
5,"Really great room and location. Room price was spot on too. 

Manager's reception had great drinks, but the snacks were a bit basic. Okay though, when you factor the cost of the room with the reception and a free, hot, made-to-order breakfast.

Breakfast was very good. Kitchen staff were super friendly.

This experience really made me change my focus as to which Hilton brand to continue to patronize."
5,Very delightful atmosphere. Calm and serene with a wonderful aroma. Staff was kind and helpful and I didn't have to wait long at all. My pedicure ranks among the best I've had in Vegas. Soooo glad it is open late as that is the only time I can ever get out. Owner was on site and very friendly and helpful.
5,Omg best cheese steak ever!! Gigantic subs and gigantic taste! Perfect hoagie  bread  ratio of bread to filling was perfection and meat was juicy and veggies fresh. The drippage was perfect and flavor on point!
5,"Omg! So enjoyed the long salt scrub, massage & attention to detail at this salon! Make sure to request Johny--he was thorough & fun.  They have lots of trendy colors and lots of regular nail polishes that match gel nail polishes."
5,Wow I've lived in Las Vegas for 20 years and have tried many nail salons. This place is super clean & relaxing. They give you a warm neck wrap while having a pedicure. There are essential oil diffusers going and chill music it has a luxury spa feel. You will be surprised when you walk in because the strip mall is in does not do it justice. KEN is the main reason in writng this review. He gives the best foot and leg massage! Really it's so fantastic! Call and name sure he's free before you come down here! Love this place!
5,"Ask for Trish or Dan!!!. Beautiful, clean, and hip space. Dan gave me one of the best pedicure massages ever! They have happy hour options and they're open late, which is a huge perk. I drove across town because a friend recommended this place and it was SO worth it. I'll definitely becoming again. Definitely a great first experience!!"
5,"Wed, 5/8 - I found the Jamburritos truck at the Public Market in downtown Phoenix.  Wow, the chicken etouffee was just amazing!  High-end restaurant quality all the way.  I'm already looking forward to the next time."
5,"I went here yesterday to meet some friends for dinner.   The waitresses and the hostess were very nice , hostess had a booth cleaned just for us even though there were empty tables.  Our food came really fast, and everything was good, I had a sandwhich with a pretzel bun very good!  I got one of there specialty drinks the strawberry palmer, it was good.  One of my friends got a cosmo and said it was too strong she couldnt even drink it.  The food is pretty good here and its really cheap.  We were there on a tuesday and they got really busy, looks like alot people stop there after work."
5,"Great concept. Nice ""industrial"" feel. Very friendly barman. Pity there were no Belgian beers on tap this time. However the Delirium Tremens was excellent by the bottle.
Had fun as usual playing a board game and leaving notes on the blackboard."
5,I can't wait to come again! Best workers and best Cajun food I've ever had in AZ! We went yesterday during national burrito day and it was the best choice for our first time!
5,"This place is as good as it gets. The quality of the hand made drinks is superlative. The bartender is a true professional who exudes  style and flash , a true showman.  Each dish has a unique quality and could stand on its own as meal , even the bread.  You won't be sorry you came here.  $$$$$"
5,"I have loved this place since I was a kid. It has not changed since then. This is not a ""nice"" place to dine in. It's a hole in the wall bar that makes Pittsburgh's best sandwiches. Huge stuffed hogies. I mean huge. The ""Battleship"" is the cornerstone size and it could satisfy 4-5 men no problem. My favs? Corned beef, steak, and the famous fried baloney but any selection is good. Go here get a hogie and take it to share."
5,great experience worth Ken and johnny... beautiful salon.... relaxing atmosphere.... loved it!
5,"I rarely leave reviews, but read them often when looking for places to eat. I have lived here in Phoenix for 1 year now, and this is THE best pizza I've had. This will be my go to place for pizza, hands down. We got a large cheese (it's Friday during lent=no meat) along with bread sticks. We did ask for extra cheese and sauce since we weren't getting other toppings."
5,"Lounge fries, lounge fries and more lounge fries! This place keeps me coming back. Step up from basic bar food, always have a drink special and they have little tv's at the booths to watch games. I started coming here more and more now that rumrunners is steaming pile of poo and I am never disappointed."
5,Today was me and my wife's anniversary... so I decided to take her to EDGE STEAKHOUSE... i had the 10oz fillet Mignon and my wife had the wagyu steak. The food was amazing and worth every penny! This place is definitely one of my favorites. We had the best customer service I had in a restaurant period! RYAN was our server. He was on top of his game and very professional and informative with everything. He is the star of edge steakhouse!!! Without him I can't see coming here... thank you for a great night and amazing food!
5,Quite possibly the best meal I have ever had. The filet was perfect and the creamed spinach was wonderful. Looking forward to returning on our next trip to Vegas. Outstanding.
5,"I love this place. I had a friend tell me about it 5 years ago. It is a hole in the wall for sure but those are the best and this place hold true to that. They have a similar menu to China a go go but their flavor is so much better. One night I got China a go go and the next night I got little dumpling and there was no comparison. I have ordered from this place countless times and only had 2 times where they messed our order and it wasnt even major, one time I remember they for got 2 egg rolls. Another major plus is they are really fast."
5,How amazing is this place?! 5/5 stars for sure! Kevin was our bartender and takes pride in his job and took excellent care of myself and my business partner. Allowed us to sample our sour vs the cider and gave us the best experience. Best warm Welcome from Cali to AZ. Welcome Home!
5,"Just go here, and order a battleship. If Kris makes it, its even better!"
5,"I've been traveling for work a lot lately and that takes a toll on a girl! Lucky for me, I stay here where the rooms are comfortable, the food is amazing and the bar staff have quickly become a second family to me especially since I eat there virtually every night. Biggest praise though goes to Desiree who always greets everyone with a smile and a kind word, patient even when the customer doesn't deserve it (& I have watched a few ridiculous ones). Not to mention makes the BEST Margaritas I have ever had!!!!"
5,Always the same great food and drinks.  Been going to Barros pizza since the late 80's. still the best pizza and wings available
5,"Love everything. The tacos, the bao and the banh mi. All were plenty sauced and full of flavor. The 5 spice in the pork belly will definitely kick you in the taste buds. One of the best dinner choices I've made while visiting."
5,No complaints here! One of the best steakhouses I've been to in Vegas. Everything from the food service and presentation was great. Mario and Bobby were amazing servers and very knowledgeable of the food that they serve. If you come here definitely ask for them! Food is delicious as expected. Restaurant is very clean which is a plus.
5,Love this Barro's pizza place. Great food at affordable prices and service is the best.
5,"This was an awesome find! We came in craving Chinese, and left wanting them to open a location in Reno. The staff is beyond friendly and they have the food to entice you to come back again and again. We had the Mongolian beef, which was well balanced with still crisp well-cooked onions, the generals chicken, which had pineapple in to balance the heat, orange chicken which was perfectly cooked and well sauced, and the pineapple fried rice- which was fresh and tasty. 
Can't wait to visit again to explore the menu further! Thank you for being so welcoming and kind!
*also the spicy mustard was home made and AMAZING"
5,"Been a loonnng customer.. Never been disappinted with service or food, great ambience and crowd."
5,"I've been coming here since the day it opened and I can't believe I haven't written a review! Sorry LD! I love it here - especially now that I have a toddler. It is very family friendly - which might turn some of you off - but if you do have kids it's amazing. I can eat and drink a coffee (hot) while my son plays with trains. Service is always lovely - especially Giovanni who never forgets a face or a name. Ingredients are always fresh & local. I love all of their sandwiches and my son loves the bean salad that comes with them - win win! 
Even without kids, it's great sitting in the sunny front with a book or some work and feeling a part of the neighborhood (which I moved out of three years ago but I still come weekly)"
5,"I had a pork belly steamed bao, a pork bahn mi, and the kimchi fries.  There's evidently 10 of these in Toronto.  When food comes from a chain, I begin to fear and want to run away, but everything I had here was amazing.  Everything had so much flavor yet it was well balanced, nothing was too spicy but it still had heat, the texture of the bread, the balance between filling and bread of both the bao and the bahn mi, the kim chee fries were just such a beautiful gluttonous food such that I'm gonna try to make them at home, and just... yum.

It's really cheap too.  Probably the best fast-casual place I've ever been to anywhere, especially considering that there's so many locations to choose from."
5,"Amazing Salon! Great Pedicures from Johnny! All types of services, aromatherapy, special treats...amazing!"

5,"The warm earth tones in this lounge evoke a feeling of comfort and give patrons a place to chill in an upscale relaxed fashion.  Drinks are expensive but stiff.  I would suggest reserving a table, not many places to sit, but they do have comfy bar seating.  The music is upbeat, not many people are dancing, but it's certainly not frowned upon."
5,"Great beer 
Friendly staff 
Good food 
Big selections beers 
Would certainly go back there again 
Can get busy when a game is on but still good place"
5,"The food was excellent and the customer service superb ordered the pineapple chicken fried rice which was phenomenal and paired it with Mongolian beef, the combo was great I was unsure walking in and am very glad I did."
5,"A dive bar with a family atmosphere, north park lounge is a great place to hang out. The food did not disappoint and the service is very good. If you're looking for the American experience, it's here, with televisions at every table in addition to several larger ones at the bar."
5,"Always aware of the hype but rarely making the trip downtown, I was a bit excited to find out that Banh Mi Boys would be opening in my hood and after having eaten there plenty of times since, I'm glad they did.

Sure, you can get a traditional banh mi elsewhere for cheaper but those places don't offer the variety of choices that you get to choose from here, The amount of ingredients they stuff into each of the items justify the price. 

Admittedly, I still have to try their basic banh mi but I've enjoyed the other different items that I have tried. Maybe I'll finally go for the basic for lunch today?"
5,"Happy hour until 8 pm? What isn't to like? 
I came here to kill some time with two friends before First Friday. At first we were a bit taken aback by how busy it was for a late Friday afternoon. After finding a place near the bar to sit we perused the MASSIVE menu.  If you are a beer, wine or even mead drinker they have something for you. 

We didn't have to wait very long to order at all, bar tenders also would take orders of people in line as they walked by. 

I personally really enjoyed the idea of the mystery wine and beer. I orderes the mystery white and a red sangria. The sangria does come straight from a bottle, but man it's delicious. My companions enjoyed the place so much that our intended hour stay ended up being nearly three hours. 

Also try the grilled cheese, any if them. The menu is on top of the wall opposite the drink menu. 6 dollars gets you a sandwich, pickle and chips. 

Lastly, they have board games all over the bar which will always get a bar bonus points in my book."
5,Ordered delivery. I got honey walnut shrimp and shrimp pad Thai! I'm really happy with the quality and the prices and the results. See picture.
5,"I am always pleased with Waffle House. Granted a lot of people think their food isn't that good but ever since I discovered them on a nationwide road trip a couple of years ago, I have been nothing but pleased. They don't exist where I'm from. I enjoy getting a good hearty breakfast for a good price. This location being near hotels and the airport, found it pretty busy on a Saturday morning. We were seated about 10 minutes later and enjoyed good service. Nothing fancy here, just people working their job getting you your food. Thoroughly enjoyed my Texas melts with hash browns covered in gravy. My dad enjoyed his eggs and sausage with a waffle on the side. He was pleased he could get chocolate chips over the waffle! He had never been to Waffle House before but he enjoyed the price, that's for sure. I'm a fan!"
5,"A great food experience. I love the medeteranian style resto with the kitchen in the front.

Small yet intemate

True Italian menu. All fresh. The primi was superb. 

We had the ""family menu"" gives a sampling of many of the dishes"
5,I love all the whining pigs! I have been going to them since they first open the 16th St. and Bethany home. The one on Indian school is very close to my house so it's the one I go to mostly. But I did want to check out the new downtown location. It is much larger than the other locations
5,"Always come here every Friday from work with my coworker. Jamburritos with chicken, steak and fish have all been really great and so are their nachos. Really big portions, fair price and the staff is always on point with being friendly. Definitely recommend and I'll be continuing to eat here every Friday"
5,"El Pollo plate was delicious!!! Chicken is perfectly cooked, rice n beans and 3 flour tortillas! A must try!! Salsa bar with alot of different choices ! Definitely coming back here!!"
5,First time customer. Jimmy gave me a wonderful mani/pedi. Foot massage was great! The salon was very clean and all the staff was friendly and helpful. Massage chairs are also high quality in pedicure area. I will be back
5,"After further investigation, I opt for the butcher boy. Fried jumbo. Jumbo? Jumbo what? Seems its a local delicacy you can only get in Pittsburgh - just kidding. I don't even like bologna but I actually drool thinking about this sandwich. Heck, I would practically be a vegetarian if I stopped eating here, but its so worth it now and then."
5,All you need do is get ya self and a super battleship and a 6er of whatever you choose.  Nuff said.  This spot will continue to kick out the best hoagies around da burgh.
5,I absolutely love this place! It makes the best subs in Pittsburgh. They always have a line but the employees work hard.
5,One of my favorite nail salons on the SW side of town. Friendly customer service and they work fast. Very convenient hours too. My gel always last at least 3-4 weeks with them.
5,"I love the triangle, get there a little early, I've came later, like 4pm and there was no bread l eft... Great sandwich."
5,"Fabulous!

I can't believe the low reviews on Yelp for Little Dumpling (I think people just like to complain because they have nothing better to do).  I've spent 4 years looking for a great chinese restaurant and finally found the very best!  Sure you can have 5 star food in the casinos, but you will pay $50 a plate for it.

The restaurant is spotless, small and simple.  I believe it is family owned, so all the more reason to come in and support a local business.  The menu is extensive, the portions are immense, and the price is very affordable for everything you get.  They even threw in two egg rolls for free!

Buddah's Delight: is the best in Henderson.  I'm a vegi connoisseur and this plate comes with my new found fav tofu.  The tofu is cooked perfectly, a bit of a sear that gives it great texture.  

Hot n Sour Soup: my wife loves this soup.  Spicy, dark and super flavorful.

Pineapple fried rice: this was very different for us as the chicken is separate from the rice but full of pineapple flavor.

Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  I will visit Little Dumpling for my sole source of chinese food from now on.  

Thanks Little Dumpling!"
5,"Wow!  You wouldn't think much of this place if you were judging a book by its cover....or even from the appearance on the inside, but OH MY GOODNESS!!!! They have a great menu.... Simple,  but wonderful. We got the Super Battleship Italian hoagie last week and decided to make the drive to get a Battleship Meatball hoagie this afternoon. 

Despite battling Pittsburgh traffic to get there, we were both very pleased!  Cheap prices for what you get. Where else can you get a 3 ft hoagie with FRESH ingredients for $20?!

The staff is friendly and quick!  We will return time & time again!!!"
5,"Love, love, love this place!!! Best homemade Italian food in town. They never disappoint, no matter how many times I come back. Great, warm friendly service and so endearing to see Mama at the front cooking."
5,"This is the best Waffle House I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot. Great food, super friendly staff, clean and efficient. Great job guys!"
5,"So NPL is right around the corner from me and I've been eating here as long as I can remember. I've had it all; everything from burgers to wings to quesadillas and one of the best fish sandwiches you'll ever have! Don't even get me started on the lounge fries! But aside from all the good food, the reason I love it here so much is the staff. You can tell they like their jobs. It's the type of place where you can walk in for the first time and feel like a regular. They have all kinds of fun specials like a birthday wheel, trivia night, name that tune, and much more. They even have TVs at a lot of the booths so if you can get a seat at the bar to see the game, you don't have to worry. I really can't speak highly enough about this place. I hope it's still here for a long long time"
5,Insane selection of beer and reasonably priced. Happy hour lasts until 8pm too. Also tons of games to play and keep yourself occupied. Love this place!
5,"One of my favorite places to goto for Wings! This place is absolutely massive. Great atmosphere, pool tables, large flat screens, friendly and attentive staff and huge selection of wings. Better than Wild wing for sure."
5,"Love that it's open late. The facility itself is clean and comfortable. You feel welcomed, their customer service is excellent. For the work itself, well Trish did a great job!"
5,The food was amazing! Service was phenomenal. First time I ever had John Dori fish. So tasty. White light flaky mild fish. Another first was the English peas. Delish! Great bottle of wine. Perfect dining experience.
5,"We went out with guests who were staying at the Westgate Hotel and Casino. Upon checking out previous reviews we decided to eat at the Edge Steakhouse and were very impressed with the food and especially the people who worked there. Everyone was very accommodating, very upscale, and the food was outstanding. We highly recommend this steakhouse and will definitely be returning."
5,I love this place and their coffee.  Plus they are mom/baby welcoming. Good vibes all around.
5,I love the veal lasagna. I get it for takeout many times when I have a late night at the office.
5,Best wings of all time and they have 100 types of sauces you can try and good service and then that have a pool table and tv for like games and great place for party's !! 10\10
5,"Best place to get hoagies. Haven't been here in a while. Hasn't changed. My favorite is cheese steak. Hoagies come in torpedo, destroyer, and battleship sizes. Great if ordering for parties. Reasonable prices. They make hoagies fresh. They do get busy during sporting events and holidays."
5,"So many flavours to choose from. They have sampler platters with four flavours. Delicious! It's a good place to enjoy, hang-out and eat good food! They have billiards are too!"
5,"For some reason, I walk into this place, drop more coin than my miserly ass usually likes to, and I have a good time and leave with a good buzz.

I'm low key and usually not wearing clothing costing more than $50 (total from head to toe!) and haven't been hassled here.

Maybe they just know who I really am - wait then I'd probably get da boot."
5,"Homemade italian fare oozing with passion and love.  

If its in the revolving menu that evening, do get the veal sausage.  Its wonderful, juicy, and very tasty.  

Make sure to try the veal meatballs, the eggplant parmigiana, and the almighty Lasagna!

Basically, you cannot go wrong.  And ask for the hot peppers on the side.  I wish they sold these!!!

Ambiance is casual/romantic.  Very good food without the pretension.   10000 stars if I could."
5,"Overall is perfect! Enjoyed my filet mignon as I requested it medium rare paired up with red wine I really liked, Rogue Cabernet Sauvignon. The trio mash potatoes and the Brussels sprout was so delicious as well."
5,Barros is one of my favorite pizzas. It's got a nice thick crust that is amazing. They really don't skimp out on cheese either. Their sauce is just right and when out together make one delicious pizza!
5,"One of my favorite go to's in the city for a sandwich without breaking the bank. The duck confit is always on point, actually, all of their sandwiches are on point. 

The kimchi fries are a great veg option to boot!"
5,"First time trying banh mi boys and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. Our table of four tried a variety of Bao, banh mi and tacos. Our favorites were the pork belly Bao and kimchi fries.
Would definitely go back for more."
5,"Open late and by all the strip clubs, Danny our server was awesome great customer service skills. The waffle I had had strawberries infused in it sooooo good.  5 stars to Danny our late night man."
5,Really awesome! Love the wings....made me and my boyfriend really gassy...we were farting all over each other the whole night... But worth it
5,"Great service, clean place. Love all the staff!!! Highly recommend it. Trish is amazing."
5,Super cute place! The have a variety of games/board games which add a nice touch! Great beer selection and the bartender was very personable and friendly (sorry I didn't catch her name)! Of course I would return and bring a friend!
5,"Ask for Trish! Wish they would massage a little longer, but she does and amazing job."
5,Excellent food and service. Had the Ribeye end cap and it was delish!
5,Honestly I would throw myself into the sun for another Lazy Daisy's quiche. Service is always friendly-- and see if you can sneak in and get a ticket for one of their lovely wine and cheese events!
5,"Tried 2 of their locations within a span of 24 hours and the consistency in flavours and presentation was on point! I tried the fried chicken bao, 5 spice pork belly boa and sandwich and the duck confit bao. Not one disappointed. The flavour of the lemongrass with the duck; cilantro with the pork; the sweet pickle with the chicken - all amazing! A must try"
5,"Happy Hour: 1pm-8pm every day
HH Specials: $5 mystery wine, $3 brown bag beer, $5 sangria, $12 wine flights, $8 beer flights

Day one of my Arizona trip and I already have my first five stars. This includes service, drinks, AND their brownie. This was my favorite wine and beer bar in Phoenix mainly because of the ambiance. Walking in I was hesitant because I'm not a big beer person and a sweet wine kind of person, I know, I know judge me all you want. I was excited to see that they had $8 beer flights because I'd have to like at least one of the ones I tried right? Right. My favorite was the Passion Fruit Nectar Mead. As for their wines, their red sangria is absolutely delicious! 

You know what else is delicious? Their brownie. Check in for a free brownie which looks unsuspecting but it is a delicious combination of peanut butter and brownie. 

Bars are fun when you have people to talk to but when you want to be a little more interactive, this is the place to go! They have board games all over the place AND electronic old school games too.

All in all, I highly recommend this place!"
5,Love this place! It's only a few blocks from my house and always take friends from out of town. Friendly locals bar and fun games to play.
5,Lunch is priced very well around $8.49. I don't remember exactly. Drinks are about $1.69 more. Not too bad. It's your typical Chinese buffet like you'll find across the country. Food is good. Well worth the low price.
5,Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and Summerlicious Great atmosphere and great food! Would definitely come again!
5,"Great atmosphere!  The drinks were good and it was a real classy place.  Not too crowded, and not too expensive.  Loved it!"
5,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside (lit up palm tree) and looks particularly small.. but it was recommended to me by a family member and a group of us went. 
This place is amazing, the size and layout is fantastic! Looks are deceiving as it's completely different when you walk in! It's HUGE! We sat up near the bar and there are screens everywhere yet it's not overpowering; it won't drown you out trying to talk! There is a massive screen behind the bar too or projector screen (can't remember) ..
I ordered fish tacos and garlic Parmesan fries which are both amazing but regular fries would have done, I was just being a glutton (and trying it was worth it).. 
There is also an arcade machine section and down below the bar there's a ton of pool tables!! You Can reserve the bigger ones or just do loonies on the smaller ones! 
I think they would do well with groups so we will be going back next month for an event!
Ps. Tacky tree transformed to Amazing tree at night when we left"
5,"This is my favourite place for a quick meal. Their banh mis are consistently amazing and I can't get enough of their squid tacos  Having been to this and the Queen W locations, I have to say this location is much better in terms of service."
5,"The Battleship hoagie is a long-time favorite in my family... by far my favorite cold Italian sub in the area!  These subs are great for parties, a game day feast, or eating alone on your couch.  No one said you had to share! :)

Their bread is perfectly soft, meats are well portioned and evenly distributed, and the tomatoes and lettuce are always fresh.  I've never personally been to the brick & mortar location, but my family has always remarked how quick and pleasant the service is.   The Triangle hoagies are a must if you're looking for something quick, easy, delicious, and reasonably priced to tote along to your next family get together."
5,"Best damn hoagie in Pittsburgh, order 5 super destroyers every steeler game, get the destroyer and you won't be disappointed!!"
5,What can i say but WOW... Came here on my first trip to vegas and WOW my friends and i were BLOWN AWAY. My first time having wagyu beef and it exceeded my expectations a thousand fold! The servers Ryan and Bobby were amazingly attentive and made the experience that much better. But I truly cannot compliment chef Steve Young enough!!! The food was so amazing we asked to meet the chef and even took a picture with him. Overall the entire expierence was amazing. The ambiance and atmosphere pulled the entire expierence to a magical height. Amazing experience and i recommend it to any and all that happen to be in the area!!!
5,"Not sure as to why there are bad reviews, but also haven't been here long enough  to know what real poutine should be like. I am just glad I found vegan poutine! There are also a couple vegetarian options."
5,"I just discovered the Whining Pig when I was in town last week and I'm glad I did because I will definitely be back! I came on a Thursday night so it was rather dead and I was able to chat with the bartenders. They offer a wide variety of wine and beers and happy hour until 8pm! Talk about a realistic happy hour ending time. The atmosphere is laid back, but you can chose your fun by playing an assortment of board games that they offer.

I've been raving about this place since I went so you can guarantee I'll go back when I'm in town next."
5,"Love the pizza here! My family and I just moved into the area and found this place. Great food, service, prices and especially great for families with children :)
We definitely will be back!!"
5,"Really good place. Meals were constantly being cooked when I went, which means nothing was precooked/left to sit around like a lot of places. 

I like how you can pick your preferred spice level (I like things really hot). Kimchi fries are a must try, way better than I expected. Beware though, this place uses a lot of garlic."
5,"We came in with a large party of 20-25 people. We didn't call the restaurant before hand to let them know that we were coming in, and they were still able to accommodate us, no problem. 
I got a Coney Island root beer, and I have to say, I think I like the Coney Island brand better than Not Your Fathers. I also got an Italian hot sub, and it was perfect. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd definitely stop by for some good eats."
5,"Great selection, awesome happy hour! The brown bag beer is a great way to try something you normally wouldn't. Cool vibe, how many pennies?"
5,"I love this place. Everyone is awesome. I love  Trish, she does the best gel mani. The hours are great & check out the happy hour deal Tue & Wed before 2:30pm!!!!"
5,"Ordered a super battleship and wasn't disappointed!  Fresh meat, lots of it, fresh bread and great dressing!  For the price it can't be beat!"
5,We've come to this barros for a long time. We had a mishap with some undercooked wings and I sent an email just so they would know and hopefully no one else got sick but the manager credit our account $25 which I honestly wasn't even expecting I genuinely just wanted to let them know. Even with the credit we didn't end up eating here again until about 4 months later. We still got the credit even though it had been awhile and everyone is always so nice. Bomb pizza. Bomb ranch
5,Great mexican food and great salsa! They have an excellent breakfast burrito and lots of lunch specials. I love going here but the food is so intense i usually want a nap afterwards.
5,Grade A+ times 10. Staff was one of the best if my years traveling and staying at hotels. One of the cleanest and spacious rooms ever and if you leave some things home just go to the front desk and its free of charge.
5,"Listen, this spot is badass! Vibes are A1- staff is amazing, music is chill and overall just a good time. Trent and Kevin the bartenders will take good care of you. Drop what you're doing and just like....  come here.... no seriously now. Do it now!"
5,"I visited here many times over the years.  As my diet changed, I stopped visiting due to no good vegetarian/vegan options.  I am happy to say that I stopped by on the way back from a softball game in North Park for a beer and discovered the Roasted Zucchini & Hummus Flatbread.  This is and appetizer that eats like a meal.  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EATEN IN MONTHS!  DELICIOUS! Thanks for offering an option to continue coming back..."
5,"My first visit was dated in 2013 when I just moved here and I was desperate in finding a good Italian place to eat without breaking my bank. I was super happy to discover 7 and mama rosa. The food here reminds me of Italian home cooking, a little bit messy and a little bit go-with-mood, but it certainly satisfies my stomach. I kept on coming back and brought many of my friends to try this place. Why I like about this place? 1. Quality of food, everything you order is delicious 2. Great value /good price for what you get 3. A chill and chic dating spot too! In the summer, definitely go back to the patio!"
5,"Just SO good. I get the fried chicken in bao buns. It's just SO good, the fresh veg makes it. A must try if you have not been here before."
5,We had our fantasy football draft at this location this weekend.  The venue was great and that omelette bar was top notch.  The manager Avery went above and beyond and made sure our stay and event was awesome!  This experience and his assistance and dedication to excellent customer service has made me become a loyal fan of this hotel
5,Tasty pizza. Affordable. Clean place. They know how to take care of their customers. I am very appreciative!
5,"We had a great time there today.. Great food, wine and atmosphere. We ordered fish of the day, shrimps and lamb, all meals where just amazing"
5,"This has been my go-to cafe since moving to Little India almost 2 years ago. Love the vibe, there are no holier-than-thou espresso-wieding baristas like a lot of the more well-known places. The staff members are awesome! So friendly, (almost) always smiling. They seem to have a LOT to do, so I always try to cut them some slack. This isn't just a coffee shop. There's a full food menu, and even craft beers for sale. Whenever I'm in there the staff are constantly on the move and doing a good job.

I've found it's a good place to get some work done and catch up on emails. The coffee is great, and the food is a-mazing! Fresh, unique, delicious. Sunday brunch is always a hit (and is usually crazy busy). Try the Son-of-a-Rise and thank me later

Food is a bit pricey, but that's what ya get for farm fresh, free run, organic-type stuff. I'm already looking forward to stopping in tomorrow!"
5,"this place is amazing if you're looking for a quick bite and cheap price. got the braised beef on the steamed bao that was more like a steamed cloud of deliciousness, basically brisket. Also got the kalbi soft taco which was amazing, very Korean BBQ tasting. will definitely be back. total cost was under $8."
5,"Trisha is absolutely amazing, she has done both my gel acrylics and pedicures twice, and both times they have been great. She really pays attention to detail, and takes her time. There was also a women there whose name I forgot to ask, she always wears heels and has very long hair, she did an amazing job with my pedicure as well."
5,"Ok, so I don't love this place as much as I used to but I think that is my fault because I came here too many times. They are super consistent which is great and great value for the flavour it packs.

The pork belly bao is highly recommended as well as the kimchi fries. The fried chicken banh mi is also pretty good. Also bonus points for carrying cherry coca-cola!!!!!

During peak times it gets pretty busy and might be difficult to get seats. So, if there is more than 1 in your party I would say to have someone grab seats if available while someone else does the ordering."
5,What can i say about triangle that hasn't already been said. I grew up on these subs if you never had these what are you waiting for.
5,"This comfy café is so far east! It takes us an hour to get there by transit. However, I've been three times in the past month because they have such great events, great food, and great atmosphere. There's a Trivia Night every second Wednesday, a Family Happy Hour every Saturday from 6-8pm (free apple juice and milk for kids), and Open Mic Nights, but it's the monthly Smashmouth Spoken Word Night that is so addictive. If you're a word person, it's a chill Saturday night! You can sign up to share some of your own work or just sit back and relax, and they have two featured artists, one musical and one lyrical.

The menu is a bit expensive, but it boasts local, organic, farm-to-table ingredients, which are fresher than fresh. I'm such a sucker for that! I always get the Harvest Salad (avocados, corn, beans, sunflower seeds, grated carrot, tomatoes, vinaigrette dressing, mixed greens, SO delicious!) I've also tried the grilled cheese, which is tasty and reasonably priced (about $5). People in my groups have tried and enjoyed the chili and the naan pizzas. They have a full line up of coffees and teas, but those especially worth noting are the caramel and chai lattes, so smooth! Their desserts include healthier options, such as gluten free peanut butter cookies and black bean brownies, but the blueberry cheesecake is delish. Oh, also, they're licensed.

If you need any more convincing to check this place out, the owner and staff are all super friendly! Great customer service, very accommodating of large groups. The place itself is open and airy with high ceilings, and I can imagine it would be filled with light in the mornings. When they turn the lights down for spoken word, it gets so cozy! There is a terribly long commute, yet despite this, we still keep coming back!"
5,"Heaven on earth.
This place has it all: good burritos, awesome salsa, cold beer, creepy mexican carnival music, and an I (heart) Huckabees Poster in the women's restroom."
5,Me and husband went in tonight (our first time)  and the young lady at the counter was soooo friendly. He attitude was amazing. We ordered pizza and wings which both were really good. Came out fast. I needed a few extra things such as ranch and hot peppers she was really friendly ( I've been to other places where they get annoyed if you ask for other things) she had no problem getting them for me. I would definitely come back.
5,Food was awesome!!!! I had the chicken K-sadilla and it filled me up. Had a side of hush puppies too that I love. Please come back to the Discovery Building in Tempe or the TOC Building for State Farm. I need more of your food!!!!
5,"Jambalya= Cajun stew, usually good but not very accessible or common (at least not in AZ)
Burrito= kinda good, some people love them, I think they're usually too big and unwieldy...just give me some tacos or an enchilda

Jamburrito=....Out.of.this.World! 

Tried it at Food Truck Fridays and man was it worth the wait and $. It was $9 for a chicken Jamburrito, hushpuppies and a soda. Not bad, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I only finished half and am still full 3 hours later. At the same time, it wasn't as overwhelming to me as a Chipotle burrito. Maybe because they cut it in half so I can easily save the other half for later.

Anyway, this is one of those fusions that just works. It's a great tortilla and good jambalya, and together they combine for a really tasty and unique meal."
5,"Excellent friendly service! The location is clean, modern  and beautiful!! Great hours!! Cat did a fantastic job with my gel manicure, gel pedicure, waxing and lashes!! They offer water, tea, coffee and several other refreshments plus a relaxing, peaceful atmosphere that makes you want to stay longer and come back for more....
 
I read the review of the customer who is complaining about how rude and racist the technicians were to her and her child... I happen to be there while she was there and I did not see any of this behavior towards her? I am really sorry that she had a bad experience but the truth is that the only complaint I had during my visit was her child running around in the salon while I am paying to relax?? 

This is most definitely a child friendly salon, they even have a special area just for little girls to get their nails done with cute children's pedicure chairs! 

I think the salon is doing the right thing by taking all its clients in consideration when it asks you to make sure your child respect the other clients and don't run around in the salon disrupting the other clients! 

Everything is not always because people are rude or racist! It's a place of business where people are paying for a professional service not a playground. It's also a safety issue.

I am letting all my friends know about this salon and I cannot wait to come back for my next appointment! I have already scheduled a facial for next week! Give them a try you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,"Haven't had it in awhile but their hoagies are sooo good! The inside of the restaurant/bar is pretty cool too, never had an issue when I went there"
5,"Great spot for craft beer and whine ;) Try the Grilled Cheese... you won't be disappointed! I recommend the STAR...pepperoni, sriracha, cherry peppers, and Italian cheese."
5,"So a German, an Indian and a Chicagoan walk into an Italian restaurant ... no joke, true story. business trip to Toronto, Yelp to the rescue.

I am a huge fan of authentic Italian (hard to find in North America). This place offers traditional dishes in traditional portions, made to eat thru the courses (antipasti, primi, secundi) as intended. 
Everything about this restaurant is charming: the kitchen is in the front and you can actually peek in thru the huge glass front. When you walk in, you're greeted by the small staff. Very rustic interior, the menu written on the white board (only the wine menu on the iPad is a bit anachronistic).
We went with the family style dinner: salad, pasta & main for 29$ (you share the first courses but pick your main). Great selection. The goat cheese with the salad was fantastic. The calamari were such a nice break from the usual fried & breaded version. Then the pasta selection was really diverse.
Hidden gem: the homemade pickled peppers. Not only spice things up but extremely flavorful. We ended up throwing peppers into the leftover pasta sauce and scooped it up with bread. Good times.
By the time our mains arrive, we're already calling this a winner. I chose the osso buco ... fall-of-the-bone goodness, no knife needed.

The server alone (wish I could remember his name) deserves 5 stars, super attentive, witty and extremely knowledge about the dishes and their ingredients. I actually returned a month later with 2 different coworkers (form 2 different countries) and he remembered every detail about our conversation. Wikipedia should show his picture under perfect host."
5,"Banh Mi Boys is a a twist on your traditional Vietnamese sandwich shop. Instead of your typical cold cut meats there is Korean and Taiwanese style meats, like braised beef, pulled pork and duck confit. There is even a southern inspired fried chicken steamed bao bun. So you take your usual Vietnamese sandwich palette and swap out the sliced pork and meatballs for something way more flavorful and higher quality. 

The food here is seriously delicious. You'll want to keep coming back for more. This will no doubt become a regular stop of mine. Yum!"
5,"My best meal in Vegas during my last trip. The steak, the mashed potato was great! Service was excellent, very attentive!"
5,Always delicious.  Always friendly.  Keeps me coming back for the duck confit any time I'm in the area.
5,"Of all my travels and all the bars I've been to... this wins as one of the best. Happy hour every single day until 8pm. 

The most extensive and impressive  selection of craft beers and wines I have ever seen. Anything you could think of wanting, they have. And then some more. They have a bunch of board games to play while you're hanging out and drinking. A gem of a bar in Phoenix, definitely worth checking out for the daily happy hour!"
5,Straight up: get the family style dinner! Bang for your buck and a tasting of almost everything on the menu.
5,"The only place you need to go for football games. They have the best hoagies! Make sure you call ahead if it's game day because they will get slammed. We always get the go-go and the super smasharooney or whatever, roast beef and turkey. Fresh bread, fresh everything."
5,"Y'all don't know good eatin' 'til you stopped at Jamburritos!  My tastebuds died, went to heaven.  

I'm a southerner.  I DO NOT, I DO NOT, order fried catfish in restaurants outside of certain states in the south.  It just doesn't happen.  Something about folks in other states putting beer batter or breadcrumbs or  flour based breading on it that runs me outta the restaurant.  But I figured, this Mex-Cajun fusion way would  be something to try.  I ordered a fried catfish jamburrito... that's fried catfish, with jambalaya (2 staples in my kitchen) and all the other fixin's of a burrito.  I got the fire hot sauce on the side and I also ordered up the hush puppies.  They had Faygo pops (yep, I said ""Pops"", that's cause I'm from the South.  If you're from other southern regions, you might call it a ""cold drink"".) That took me back years to my childhood and I ordered up the orange Faygo.  Whoop Whoop!  

So, what does this southerner say?  They killed it.  The hush puppies were absolutely delicious.  A bit on the small side in comparison to what I'm accustomed to having back home.  But exactly the taste you want in a hush puppy!  WOW.  I'm bringing my mom to the truck, I bet she hasn't cooked hush puppies since I was a kid.  

The Jamburrito was something out of this world.  The taste of the jambalaya in every bite of the catfish was an amazing mixture of spiciness with the delicious cajun flavor of the rice.  And don't forget that there's also beans and all the fixins of a burrito.  The lettuce and fresh veggies help to cool the zing of the spice from the hot sauce.  if you don't like spicy, don't get the hot sauce on yours. 

Here's a pic of my plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jamburritos-cajun-grille-express-phoenix?select=xh1Ac9X35EPQywGj9QZbnA#7gSc9b6Jr19CHMRtb40tmA

What a creative fusion of the Mexican burrito and cajun food.  I was so satisfied and  thrilled with the tastes and flavors.  

I have to go back and try their friend crawfish and perhaps some other things that will take me down the Mississippi river of memories... Bravo Jamburritos!  Bravo."
5,"This was a wonderful experience as Tracy did a fantastic massage and pedicure. Will definitely keep coming back and the owner Dan was so delightful and made sure I was getting proper attention. Five star establishment!  Thank you all! 
Pam"
5,This place is great. Amazing beer and wine selection and great atmosphere. Downtown needs more places like this!
5,"Best. Resto. Ever.
Its our go to restaurant on the danforth
Food is great, vibe is great, Vito & staff are amazing!
Eat here!!!"
5,"If you're a fan of big huge hoagie sandwich subs, then this is the place to go! Personally, I love going to this place because of the fresh ingredients that they use to make their sandwiches daily. You also have a pretty generous palette of options to select from, including the classic Italian hoagie to the lovely cheesesteak. They also sell some items as sides/appetizers if you're into that kind of thing. However, in general, this is the place to go for huge subs. Fresh ingredients ... oh and did I mention the great prices, considering that the subs you're getting are more than generous in portion sizes."
5,I have visited twice and both times the food and service were amazing. The beef Wellington was amazing along with the lobster macaroni and cheese. The beets salad and cauliflower soup was delicious. The staff was attentive and made sure that we were taken care of during every course of our meal. It is definitely a hidden gem!
5,"Looking for a restaurant with amazing ambiance and absolutely tasting food? Make your reservation now for Edge Steakhouse!
I have been several times with my girlfriend and my parents and time after time we are amazed by the staff and the delicious food that is prepared.
Each season there is a few items that are specific for the season, the most recent visit we enjoyed a plethora of items from the menu. 
We started off with the Parisian gnocchi with morel mushrooms, my father is like a kid in a candy store when this starter comes out! He used to pick fresh morel's back in Iowa and they are as amazingly fresh in the gnocchi as they were when he picked them back at home. We continued on with a few more starters, Beef tartare, a family favorite and the spicy shrimp which has a kick to it but even my girlfriend who cannot eat spicy food enjoys it!
My father continued on with the Cream of cauliflower soup, to say he enjoyed it is an understatement, each bite he had to express how delicious it was.
The hospitality continued with the beef Wellington (melt in your mouth good) with the lobster tail, seasoned and cooked perfectly. 
This restaurant is perfect for every occasion, birthdays, anniversaries, work dinners, etc. From the hostesses, to the bartenders, wait staff and chef Steve we feel right at home every time we step into Edge Steakhouse. A MUST visit!"
5,"We were able to get in quickly with a party of 4 & no reservations on a busy Friday night during a busy volleyball tournament weekend!  Service was great, food was fantastic, prices were a bit steep!"
5,"Best Italian food in Toronto.

This is the only Italian restaurant that's food rivals my Mothers. I've been to all the top restaurants in Toronto and time and time again this one reigns supreme.

Terroni tastes like a foot in comparison. Order the sexy duck leg, insanely amazing! 

I cannot stress this enough, best Italian restaurant! Charming trattoria-like atmosphere."
5,"I went here on a UFC night of Feb. Everything was busy and 90% of the tables were already packed at 11pm. We waited 2 mins, before a table was cleared. The waitress arrived within 5 mins, she was friendly and took her time to explain things on such a busy night. This was my first time here as well. We ordered a 80oz pitcher. I really recommend this on a busy night... The waitress didnt have to come back and we didnt have to wait for drinks. It was only my boyfriend and I, the 80oz was 3 pints exactly. We got a sample platter, 4 choices of 5 wings. The signature meduim was my least fav, top favs were meduim bbq, meduim thai, and honey garlic. The waitress checked up on us a good amount of times. All the pool tables were taken so I cant comment on the game section but it was big!

The service was great, they have wetnaps, paper roll, salt&pepper on every table. TVs every side of each section... A lot of them!
The staff was friendly, food came out quick (and it was very busy). 

I would come back here out of all the wing places, I've been to. The staff was good, food is top notch. I prefer this over WW."
5,"Pork belly banh mi sandwich is sooooo good! Lots of flavor, lots of pork, really affordable for what you get. The service is great. Boom! Coming here again!"
5,Dan is Awesome !!! My first experience with a technician at MD nail spa was not satisfying at all !!!  Dan addressed the concerns immediately and  corrected the issue. The main component to running and good business is outstanding customer service. I won't let one bad apple spoil the bunch!! In the future I am willing to give MD Nail Spa another chance to have a better experience. Prompt actions and problems solving  speaks volumes in the world of customer service. I really appreciate being treated in an understanding and compassionate manner. Dan you're great when it comes to customer service!! Thank you so much !!
5,"""Wow, this is better than Chipotle!"" my friend said, before I had the urge to deliver a swift kick to her face.

""That's not saying much at all!"" I replied in disgust. There is NOTHING I can compare this to. Basically, it's 'Creole' food wrapped in a tortilla, or made in a quesadilla, or in a bowl by itself. I thought the idea of chicken + andouille sausage in a wrap wouldn't work, but I was proven wrong bite after bite. I haven't bought from a food truck in years, and I think I'm gonna follow this one around for a while. 

5 stars because it's better than I expected, and there's nothing I would change. Delicious!"
5,"This Embassy Suites had great service at the front desk and am awesome free made to order breakfast with omelettes, French Toast, pancakes, bacon and sausages. Highly recommend."
5,"Little Dumplings? More like Little Dankums. I would've taken a picture but it smelled so good that I couldn't wait to dig in. Let's start with the orange chicken. Tasty sauce and moist pieces of chicken makes for a mouthful of YUM YUM. The sweet and sour chicken was also a pleasant surprise. 

Those rangoons though... Heavenly flavored, crispy, crustacean centered nuggets of pure joy. This is a joy similar to getting your toes wet at the beach for the first time in years, with warm and calm water, and seeing a shooting star take a six second stroll across the sky. The initial crunch is enough to raise an eyebrow, and the creamy filling seals the deal like car salesman on cocaine. Absurdly amazing. 

Rice was done right. Perfectly cooked. 

The free veggie rolls they added in were also fantastic. Nothing was undercooked or overlooked. 

I will be looking forward to my next meal, where I will try something new, but also double up on rangoons."
5,"Five stars hands down!

I am a proud Canadian and have had my fair share of poutines, but last night I felt like my taste buds had finally been awakened.

Word on the street is they are getting a food truck! Look out Food Truck Frenzy, things are about to get cheesy!"
5,There is no doubt that Edge Steakhouse serves excellent food. Their staff is extremely polite and professional. I had the Scottish Salmon. It was prepared perfectly.  I also added the truffle Mac & Cheese. It was very rich but oh so satisfying! Perhaps the most divine thing I had was the 24 hour sous vide pork belly with sweet potato gnocchi.  It was absolutely scrumptious to the last bite. I will return to this restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas. I highly recommend giving it a try.
5,"They have an awesome selection of beer, both draft and bottles/cans. They have ""mystery"" beers and wines for a special deal, which is pretty fun to experience. I definitely recommend going there anytime you're downtown!"
5,"Went here on Halloween when it was ""Scaramel"". Met the general manager Nick that night-- what a great guy! The bar is very relaxed and fun without being pretentious or clubby."
5,"The boyfriend & I decided to grab a bite here after checking out the local shops off of Roosevelt Row. We split a Jamburitto and I must say that it was *awesome*. The rice had great flavoring and the chicken was tender- but most of all the side of hot sauce was DAMN tasty, can't say I've had anything like it! 
And they sell xtra long neck (ie. mexican style) Coca Cola sodas :o 
Hellsyea I'm coming back!"
5,"Absolutely delicious! This has plenty of heat and flavor without being overwhelming. The service was amazing, friendly and personable.  I had the fried catfish with jambalaya rice and hush puppies. Definitely recommend!"
5,"I was in town for my family reunion that was 30 minutes outside of Charlotte. This room was awesome. Very clean and spacious. The staff was very hospitable and professional. I love the free breakfast  and the free happy hour on site. Our room was very nice . The kitchenette was cute. Everything was very clean. The pool was small and it would nice to have an outdoor pool. The hotel was conveniently located to every shop, restaurants and the night scene. Overall I was very impressed can't wait to come back."
5,"Amazing nail salon! Beautiful interior design, friendly staff, and great customer service. We were instantly greeted with a warm welcome from their receptionist and offered water and comfortable seating in waiting lobby. Must ask for Johny! He does amazing work and gives the best massages! We will definitely be coming back!"
5,came here before the night became a blur it was pretty spacious inside and wasnt crammed full of people which is nice.
5,"Great late night snack. Close to the bars and plenty of options!

Spent a good amount of time in Calgary on my visit and this was one of my favorites! 10/10 suggest if you like poutine!"
5,Never had bad service or a bad slice. The staff is always on top of it and the nicest people. Great place for a beer and really good pizza. Crust is amazing for all you carb lovers.
5,Jeremiah was an excellent server!! Food was great as usual and it was fun to watch the cook behind the counter... he was a machine! It's great to see people take pride in their work and these folks clearly did!
5,Love this place! Great place to grab a delicious sandwich and soup without spending a fortune!! My favourite is the Farmers Club!
5,"Meal and service were both superior. My friend and I ordered the 5 course tasting with wine pairing. Every single course was delicious, well seasoned and perfectly prepared. 

Photos say it all!!! Shout out to Felix and Angel out service team! Dedicated and attentive team! Love them, please give them recognition for their mastery of dining steps of service!! Thank you chef Steve for a memorable meal!!"
5,"I'll make this short and sweet.  I grew up in the Pittsburgh area and now have retired at the central California Coast. I have tried hoagies throughout the United States and the hoagies made at the Triangle Bar in Swissvale are BY FAR the absolute best hoagies in the United States of America!!!!  When I go back and visit Pittsburgh, the Triangle Bar is a MUST stop and I usually buy a couple of extra hoagies so that I can bring them home on the plane to California and enjoy them here!!!

The Best of the Best!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"**** BEST SANDWICH ***** 

My friend's and I go out in San Francisco looking for great sandwiches and nothing compares to this place. There's a guy named Ryan that works here - good looking kid, and makes the best sandwiches. I Highly Recommend 

The Italian Battleship and The Roast Beef. 

Just the best - good Italian long roll with plenty of everything! Family Favorite since I was a kid - a long long time ago."
5,"Why have I not tried this sooner? Was in the area and I discovered that Banh Mi Boys is amazing. 

First off the store ambiance is great. Seating, cleanliness and a view of the food preparation area. When I went it wasn't too crowded (11:30ish) but I believe lines form around 12:30 until 2. Nonetheless, they seem fast and efficient. 

The menu is awesome and great pricing! I love how the menu has vegetarian options in each area too, that's a major plus for me. Decided on tofu fries and a Panko crusted tofu bao. 

my order was ready very swiftly. The tofu fries were delicious...basically kimchi fries but instead of pulled pork they substitute with tofu. This is incredibly filling...I was not able to finish the entire box. 

The tofu bao was delicious too!! Lightly fried Panko crusted tofu with Sriracha and fresh veggies....mmmm so good!! 

And the prices are so reasonable! I'll definitely be back soon."
5,"Called today about getting an acrylic fill with gel and they were super nice and able to get me in right away! The salon is clean new and super pretty on the inside. I was greeted right away by Trish who was so sweet!! I love my nails she did an amazing job and was very meticulous to make sure they were perfect and to my liking. I don't live in the area, I'm house sitting near by, but would definitely recommend this place! They also have a very nice and clean area for pedi's, looked beautiful I might be back later this week."
5,"Sometimes when you find a business that is so good, it is hard to share your discovery with the world. This is the case with MD Nail Spa. There are hundreds of nails shops all over the valley, sometimes 2-3 in the same shopping plaza. What sets MD Nail Spa apart is their cleanliness, service, and spa-like ambience. On my quest to find the best, clean and reasonably priced nail salon, I checked this place out.

I received a regular pedicure. The pedicure I received is comparable to those that are offered in local hotel spas, but less $$$. They actually take the time to massage you, which many places hastily do. I felt pampered and relaxed since they played spa music and the pedicure area lighting is soft and warm. The environment is quiet and chill. I just needed a glass of wine and a nap to exceed 5 stars.

Anyway, Jimmy was really nice and did a fantastic job with my color application. I love how shiny and perfect they look. I believe my service lasted about 40 minutes. The prices are unmatched for the service you get. There are many salons around town that charge waaay too much for a mediocre service. Don't settle. If you have to drive across town, do it!"
5,Best pedicure I've had in awhile!!! I go to the bar next door all the time and always see this. I got off work at night and really wanted a pedicure and remembered this place was open to 11pm. I called and they said they could fit me in. I loved that the place has a separate room for pedicures. It was so clean and relaxing when you stepped in. The place smelled just like a spa. I got the hot stone pedicure for $35. They brought me out this thing for my neck. It was warm and smelled like lavander. The pedicure was great! My only complaint is the massage could have been a bit longer. I will definitely be back for a pedicure!
5,"A-MA-ZING!! A friend of mine had been here and told us about the Chef (Steve Young), so we figured we'd give it a shot. So glad we did! Definitely made it to my list of favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!  Wagyu beef is insanely tender and prepare so deliciously! I had a soup with cauliflower three ways that was so tasty! I don't even really care for cauliflower and I loved this soup! We had oysters, shrimp, tartare... we just kept ordering food and it just kept getting better! Seriously, everything was prepared so deliciously! We mentioned to the waiter that we were there because we heard about the chef and the chef even came out to personally say hello to us and ask our meal was. He even took a photo with us. Amazing service and even more amazing food!!"
5,Delicious! I'm so glad they opened up near work. It's great for a quick and cheap lunch! I could eat bao every day! Bbq pork belly is so delicious. I also like the fact that they have vanilla and cherry coke.
5,Great service! Great Breakfast food!! The hashbrowns are awesome! Scattered Smothered Baby!!!
5,"Love the pizza the steak and cheese and the place.

Try to hit one of their restaurants every time I am in the Burgh.

Plenty if TV screens to watch the game and just a good local joint.

You can always count on a hockey game being on during season in this place. 

Hoping Detroit beats Boston tonight in this sudden death OT. Go wings

Had the worst bar tender in a long time. She is more worried about talking to everyone than getting patrons taken care Had the worst bar tender in a long time. He is more worried about talking to everyone than getting patrons taken care of.

Still a 5 even with a horrible bar tender"
5,"I give md nail, Dan and titi, the owners, Cat our favorite nail tech, and even tris the one who actually did the work last time a five star rating. My girls and I have always been treated like royalty from the moment we walk in to the personalized treatments, outstanding services, quality products, discounted prices, and the hug and walk out to the car by the owner. 

This is our fourth time to MD Nail. We first found this place through yelp after wanting to get our nails done past most closing times for most nail salons. They were offering a free hot stone pedicure with gel manicure special and we greatly took advantage of that. Even though they don't run that special anymore, Dan is always kind enough to offer me a discount on prices that are already lowered compared to other places. If you are looking for a quality business, that uses the newest products, keeps up with the trends in nails, and just an all around great place don't go anywhere but MD nail. 

Thanks Dan, Titi, and MD nail family. Happy holidays! 

Kenisha, Natasha, Daysia, and Jazmyne"
5,"I love the whining pig...  I love draught beers..... This brings the two together! Shockingly, this felt like the largest whining pig and it's right in the middle of downtown Phoenix. The decor is similar to their other bars...very hip and modern. Their beer selection is huge. HH til 8 on bottles, cans, and draughts. What's not to like?"
5,"I think for the first time ever we can say we have ""our bar we hang out at!"" We love love love this place. Kris is a great bartender, he literally now knows that I want ""that nitro beer that you gave me the first time I came in"" and brings it out quickly! That is great service! We didn't know many of the beers that they have listed, they have 30 something on tap, just as many in bottles/cans and another 30+ wines. We told him some of what we know we like and for both us of, he hit it right on with his suggestion. We split a grilled cheese which was super yummy! It had pepperoni and cherry peppers and really hit the spot. Played some card games and just enjoyed our pre game and then post game relaxing. Prices are really good. Our check always seems wrong in the right direction! It is fairly priced for being right next to the stadiums and their happy hour is wonderful. We love it here!"
5,"This place has a great selection and a cool atmosphere. Also, the 1pm-8pm happy hour is grrrrrrrr8!"
5,"I stayed here two weeks ago. It was my first time back since the renovations started. I called ahead to make sure there wasn't still a lot of construction going on because I didn't want to be disappointed. The front desk staff assured me there wasn't. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. I love the renovations. Everything is now so modern. I wasn't able to make it to the complimentary happy hour either day I was there, but I do like the new bar set up. The breakfast is amazing! The best I have had at any hotel. The rooms were nice and spacious and I like the layout. The location is great. It's not too far from downtown and Southpark."
5,"Love this hotel! Excellent 24 hr gym with ellipticals, treadmills, weights, body balls. Breakfast buffet includes made to order eggs/omelettes, full hot buffet along with oatmeal, cold cereals, fruit and pastries. 
Evening time is managers welcome with appetizers and free alcoholic beverages ( ticket required, you get when check in). 
Rooms are very nice - spacious, comfy beds, fresh bedding and clean. Mini fridge, micro, sink separate from bath. 
Staff is friendly, helpful
Truly enjoyed my stay"
5,"Tasty food and excellent and friendly service!! It is really more of a take-out place, but my husband and I come here every week for a ""sit down"" lunch, and we love it. It is a very clean and quiet place to eat. In addition, the staff is wonderful and kind. We enjoy trying different dishes - from the more American-Chinese style to the more authentic Chinese dishes they actually make, and all of them are delicious and tasty. We highly recommend Little Dumpling!"
5,"Loved it! Came here with a friend and had the lemongrass tofu banh mi along with the sweet potato fries. Both were really well done and sweet potato fries are just the bomb diggity. I especially liked the very fast service...no idle chit chat like ""how's your day Akhil"" ""omg I love your sweater!"" Like c'mon Becky, I don't have time for that. And I don't even own any sweaters. But overall a nice place to just sit down  a usually with friends and have a fast, convinient, delicious meal. It can get busy at time so watch out for that."
5,"A place in the Burgh where you can order a two foot sub... what?! I NEVER heard about this place, but Brendan and I were hungry and in the area, so I checked yelp, saw this place and off we went. At first, I thought this place was closed. It's at the end of a street and just kind of looked closed from the outside. Inside, there's minimal table seating, a bar with seating and a counter to order your food. We had to go for the battleship, even though it was just the two of us. We asked for the toppings on the side, so that we could take it home and heat it up there (we prefer toasted subs over cold). The battleship is huge and the flavors are just as big. They packed meat and cheese onto this thing- it's honestly a steal. $16 for basically 4 Italian hoagies. We had this thing for dinner for 2 nights. It heated up well at home- the bread was fresh and the meat was juicy. The house italian dressing was delicious and of course we enjoyed it with the classic toppings of thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and shredded lettuce. I can't wait to come back here for some battleships the next time we have a get together at the house- you can't beat the price for the quality you get here. Delicious."
5,"I went here with some friends on the 4th of July and it was great. I've been to their other Arcadia location, but this one was a lot bigger and more ideal for bigger groups. As usual the beer selection and bar staff was on poiint! I will say, they do a great job at hiring their staff, always polite and great at suggestions. 

They did close earlier that day then they had advertised, but they made sure to give us ample warning for last call. It was the 4th after all so understandable that they wanted to leave a little early.

All in all, great experience and would recommend it!! And happy hour is until 8pm!"
5,"Our favourites are:
- Pork belly banh mi 
- Grilled chicken taco (LOVE!!!)
- Fried chicken Bao
Their signature sauce (regardless of the spice level) takes the flavour a notch higher. The fresh veggies and the portion of meat make it a hearty filling meal in itself. Great staff and an absolute value for money!"
5,"I was pleased with the service and the food. We were greeted immediately by the staff. They were helpful in answering our questions. They made good recommendations. 

In terms of the food, it's good steak and sides. I'd recommend their filet mignon. It was perfectly cooked to medium rare. The sides that I got was absolutely amazing. 

The real treat is the yummy cheesy popover bread they serve in the beginning before your meal. 

Would definitely come here again."
5,"Came here with my sister and we absolutely love it!
Very welcoming and the the way they do nails is really good.
I recommend going to Jimmy and Trish as they did a great job on my nails. The selection of color is great and the location is not too crowded
Would definitely come back! =]"
5,"How insane I've never reviewed this place. This historical land of sandwiches. Of course the Battleship is my favorite. I love that it's an unassuming establishment, neighborhood place oozing yum.
Here's a favorite story from probably 15 years ago. I'll preface the story: my parents retired to their home in Conneaut but prior lived in McDonald. My dad and his friend would make the drive from McDonald to Swissvale once a month for Triangle sandwiches. These guys are old school and have known the goodness long before the rest of us. Ok anyway, the story...
When my daughter was 5 or so we'd been visiting my parents. While there my dad came home from a monthly Triangle visit. When I was asked to partake of course I didn't refuse. I devoured my portion of that sandwich as though I'd never eaten before. When we got home my daughter's father (just home from a 12 hour workday) said, ""I thought you were at your mom and dad's."" When I told him we had been there he next asked, ""So why so you smell like a Battleship?"" Busted!! There was none for him.
These guys have been at it a long time and have remained consistent to bring us some pretty damn tasty hoagies!"
5,"I search for the best place to buy beer in every city I visit.  I tried many places while in Phoenix for several days for a conference, and the Whining Pig was hands down the best.  Incredible variety both on tap and in cans/bottles. The bar tenders really know their stuff, and made some fantastic recommendations.  The only drawback is that they have limited food offerings.  After finding this place on day two of my time in Phoenix, I returned each of the following three days I was in town.  If you like craft beer and you are in Phoenix, this place is a must."
5,"You guys rock. You had a ton of games and we enjoyed the atmosphere. The mead was amazing and the staff was phenomenal.

10/10 would go back again!"
5,"Am visiting from Lancastet, Ca.  My Mother and I both had pedicures and manicures at the MD nail salon.  The ambiance is just like a spa, music, the lighting and the decor.  I have asthma  and the acryllic someyimes trigger my asthma, so I was ecstatic that the area we had our mani pedi was in a totally separate areas from where they did the acryllic nails.

Linna was my  technician and Lisa was my mom's.  They both exemplified excellent customer service.  They were very accommodating, responsive and attentive.

Whenever in Vegas in the future will return for our nails spa experience. 

Wish we could kidnap them both and take home with us."
5,"What a wonderful place! I can't say enough about the fine staff, decor and rooms. Hubby said the location is convenient to downtown and the airport. We had a suite that was bigger then my first apartment with a separate living room with tv and desk and couch. Our room had 2 large screen flat tv that did have movies to rent. Only downside for me was no tub, but only a large shower. Breakfast was a real fully cooked to order breakfast with made to order omelets, and everything else you could want. All free!! A gracious staff in the atrium setting for breakfast that moves quickly along and restaurant quality omelets to boot! I was greeted with a warm ""good morning"" from the cooks to the staffers who clean tables. A nicely appointed exercise room and pool area. Three quick elevators so no waiting. This is my new favorite place to stay in charlotte and stays on our favorites list!"
5,"I drive from the other end of Stephanie for the lunch specials. Probably once a week. 

I have several favorites, but steered clear of the too often clichéd Mongolian beef. I tried it recently and was surprised by the complexity. I think it is my current favorite. 

I was thinking, what if they tried a new family meal deal C for a while to see if it catches on. My idea is to do one without soup because laowai (gringos) don't really know what to do with takeout soup. I wonder if it would be a hit. Maybe worth a try."
5,"I may be a midwest-raised boy (Indiana), but I LOVE cajun/spicy food; the hotter the better. This place (truck) manages to help me get my heat fix and still have a TON of flavor. 

Came across Jamburritos at the Phoenix Public Farmers' Market on a Saturday morning. Now with all those food options around (Hey Joe, Short Leash, etc.) you may ask what made me pick this one (besides the heat); Catfish! I hadn't had catfish (scratch that, good catfish) in quite sometime. 

I had a couple options for the catfish; grilled or fried/sandwich or bowl. Over a couple of visits, I have all the combinations. There is no wrong way to have Chef Michael Brown's catfish. 

The catfish was perfect, and what I mean by that is: 
- Perfectly cooked, tender and flaky 
- spiced perfectly (wife finds it a little hot for her, but still tastes so good she is willing to endure) :) 

If they don't have the catfish, I usually go for a chicken jamburrito with rice, andouille sausage, pepper jack cheese, and lettuce. The make a great red/hot sauce you can put on any of the menu and kick the heat up a notch. 

Lastly, can't forget to mention the hushpuppies. I consider myself a foodie, but I eat these little deep-fried puffs so fast that I don't take anytime to figure out what is in them. I know for sure though, they are NOT like any hushpuppies you have had before (oh so good). 

Phoenix Public Market on Saturday mornings or 
Phoenix Public Market for Mobile food court on Wednesday 4-8pm. 

check them out!!"
5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining here.  My choice was the filet mignon and the truffle mac and cheese.  Can i say..it was amazing! Steak melted in my mouth.  The staff was super nice and attentive.  Special shout out to Shaun who exuded professionalism and courtesy.  When i return to Las Vegas, it will sure to be a ""must stop"" for dinner."
5,"first time going to eat there tonight. the ambiance is great. very, very casual. the sushi was super fresh, and it was very flavorful. i also had the steamed shrimp, fried rice, and chow mein. it was all delicious. my parents had some of the chicken dishes, and they loved them. my sister had one of the made-upon-request dishes and she loved it also. overall, such a delicious place. highly debating if i should go back tomorrow!"
5,"We were able to get in quickly with a party of 4 & no reservations on a busy Friday night.  Service was great, food was fantastic, prices were a bit steep!"
5,"One of the best breakfasts i've had, I mean, for diner food."
5,"Triangle hoagies are second to none. When I  think about them when I'm hungry, my mouth starts watering immediately. This can be torture because I live thousands of miles away right now. But when I get into town my first meal is always from here. The hot sandwiches are very good but, for me the way to go is the turkey battleship. With that high quality meat and cheese, the veg and sauces on those soft italian rolls, it's sandwich perfection for me. Best yet, the Triangle is a bar, so you can sit down for a drink or grab a big bottle of beer to go, and some Turner tea to wash it all down.  Bring cash and an empty tummy."
5,"Favorite Bar in Downtown Phoenix! Beer & wine lists are amazing, something for everybody. Service is wonderful as well...attentive, knowledgeable and just overall cool people! 
And HAPPY HOUR EVERYDAY FROM 1-8PM. WHAAAAAAAT!"
5,"Love the vibe, variety and the people. Easy parking in garage. Music is a little too loud"
5,Been going here for years! They recently updated their menu so there is some new stuff. They have great food at great prices especially compared to some of the other Chinese take-out places in the Henderson area. Service is always friendly too and when you order in person you never have to wait too long. Their shrimp fried rice is my favorite! I also like their Buddah's delight as well if you're not a meat-eater. Another plus is that they have Thai tea with boba! So definitely check this place out if you're craving Chinese food. :)
5,"Upon arrival, I was immediately charmed by the ambiance of rustic decor and candlelit tables. The kitchen is out by the front as you walk in and you can see the bubbling pasta sauce ready to be tossed in a bowl of fresh cavatelli pasta. This isn't a typical pasta/pizzeria joint (not to knock pasta/pizzeria joints). The menu changes periodically and everything is made fresh and geared towards sharing (family-style), just like what you would have in a typical home in Italy.We met some of my coworkers there, 8 of us at our table. Our waiter was helpful in explaining the theme of the restaurant and made some fine wine recommendations. 

My wife and I decided to share one of each of the antipasti, primi, secondi and contorni. There was enough food to satisfy both of us and needless to say they all were absolutely delicious. The grilled shrimp with spicy pea puree - how do they get so much flavour in the shrimp?? And pea puree with shrimp? I know, but it works! We had a cavatelli pasta bowl with cheese grated over top (forgot the type of cheese). Simple yet magnificent. My wife had dreams about it that night. We also got a side of grilled asparagus (yum) and the osso bucco as the main, where the meat was cut up and bathed in a luscious, sort of stew-like tomato based sauce. We finished it off with an apple crumble, which was just ok and the only thing we ate that was less of exceptional. It would have been better warmed up.

And the surprise ending was that the owner, Rosa, came by our table and was so welcoming and friendly that we had to take pictures with her. So our entire table pretty much had individual pictures taken with her.

In summary, if you want a great dinner and evening out with friends or with that special person in your life, or even just alone, go to 7 Numbers, Eglinton and you will be blown away!"
5,But it just closed permanently. They had the best tomatillo salsa in town. They had great carne asada both the platter and the quesadilla.  I hope I can find great tomatillo salsa somewhere else in town.
5,Very delicious aged filet mignon with the baked potato and side salad.  Cheesecake was amazing!  Fantastic service and atmosphere.  Only problem I had was running out of room in my belly!
5,Great brand new nail salon! Very nice inside! My daughter and I enjoyed it very much!!!
5,"I guess it really depends on which day and time you visit because I had a wonderful experience here.  

Visited on Good Friday for lunch and it wasn't packed to the tits like other days (like their AYCE Wings on Wednesdays.  

It was cold but sunny so my boyfriend and I sat at the outdoor patio area.  During the heat I am sure this area will be packed.  There's even a tv facing out for everyone on the patio.  They had an amazing selection of classic rock playing.  I would totally come back and sit here til they close at 2AM on a hot summer day and just drink and each their sour cream and onion flavoured onion rings!

We were there not for a pig out this time.

Order:

1 Sour Cream and Onion - Onion Rings
1 Wing sampler (4 flavours of 5 wings each)

Our server was very friendly and seemed very experienced.  Came out to check on us a perfect amount of times without being annoying.

This has the best onion rings all round.  I like them because they are thinner and crispy with a hint of the flavouring.  I wanted to order about 3 baskets of them but then I'd be greedy.  Good portion.

Wing flavours:  Dr Pepper (actually tastes like the pop! - Excellent taste), Lemon Pepper (I love the lemon flavoured salt), Rickards and Blue Cheese.  

I was never a wing person but these are excellently done.  Not tooooo saucy like many places.  

Food came in about 15 mins. In the mean time we were on their wifi which was FREE.  FREE is the key.

If you come for the AYCE option on Wednesday I would come with a group of more than 4 people so you can try more flavours without bending the rules of sharing.  Totally worth the $14.99 plus drink purchase.

I've played at their arcade area.  I love that adults can play there and win tickets to redeem for prizes.  

This place is huge!  I would totally have a party or meeting here.

I can't wait to visit those little plastic chicks and hens again"
5,"So excited for the second location to be finished!! It looks amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. Relaxing & always really well taken care of. The new location has two very large rooms as well as private rooms. The decoration and styling of the salon is modern, sophisticated and very beautiful- such a great job!! It's been hard to find a home for my spa and nail needs but haven't stopped coming to either locations since my first visit.  Services & hospitality are never less than outstanding. Congratulations TiTi Pham, Dan & to the MD Nails spa team that make it everything it has come together as and thank you for making me feel like part of the family!"
5,"THE Place to go if you want to feed a family of four for under $20!!  Meat is fresh, toppings sublime, and the friendliest owner as well.   Just don't expect to sit and eat."
5,"A Hidden treasure tucked under the stairwell of the Collier Center. The MOST Incredible craft beer, 37 continuously rotating, not to mention the wine too. Don't let the beards throw you off ladies, the mgr is certainly knowledgeable of his wine & bartenders that remember your name. Very reasonably priced with HH 1-8pm! Brownies are a MUST."
5,Delicious sandwiches and friendly staff.  We both had the grilled chicken on a baguette. Everything was perfect. Homemade French fries. Definitely will return to try other menu items.
5,"Excellent food, portions and value!!!  Don't let the unconventional locale fool you...Definitely a must-stop whenever in the 7th St & McDowell vicinity.  Go for any of the asada and pollo plates and nachos...You won't be disappointed!"
5,Great vibe and happy hour (1-8 daily). Loved the wine selection and yum grilled cheese.
5,This hotel is beautiful!  As you walk in the door you feel as if you are walking into a resort.  The rooms are more like a condo than a hotel.  You have got to see it for yourself!
5,Chico's tacos rocks!!!   Best ever  dinner I ever had that place rocks even serves beer awesome everything about that place is the best!!!
5,"One of my first or few Mexican experiences in Phoenix that are actually authentically enjoyable. 

Entered there for early lunch and not very hungry which is not a good sign for lunch place reviews. Ordered a shredded beef tostada and a beer at 11.30 :). They have a nice selection of Mexican beer. Have to ask if they make Micheladas. 
Tostada was buried in salad but was good! Especially because of the salsas they have in the amount that you want. Their green salsa - salsa verde was very good. The red ones I would definitely improve and chill a bit more. But it was so pleasant experience and I felt like in the right place. 
Wanna try also their fish tacos next time. 
 And I just wanted to shop at Safeway :). Good for me:)"
5,Amazing selection of beer and wine and really cool stuff. You guys need to support this place or it will go away. Which would be a shame.
5,"I honestly love this restaurant and Mama Rosa, the cook. She is really the star of the show. Her food is delicious, home-style Italian cooking. And the prices are very reasonable, which is something you cannot find too often in Toronto.
The place is always packed and for good reason."
5,"I really think this restaurant is awesome - super clean and great atmosphere!  The wings are world class - thoroughly cooked and an enormous selection of sauces.  I wanted to try the boneless Devil's Inferno (where you sign the waiver) but the waitress talked me out of it and suggested Meghan Fox Hot.  It was like suicide but I think it would have been hotter if it was on regular bone-in wings so I'm still curious about this Devil's Inferno.  We also tried the chili lime and it was soooo good!  My husband ordered poutine, which wouldn't be my number one choice but it extremely tasty.  Beer was also nice and cold!

Lots of TVs with various games on and a you can buy tickets to play all sorts of games.  The tables were super clean (had a roll of paper towel and a bucket to discard bones), really friendly and knowledgeable waitress and people just seemed to be having a really good time.  It's a good place for a night out with friends!"
5,One of my favorite restaurants at yonge & eg. The food is always fresh and hot. I love everything on their menu.
5,"I'm a local, so I'm sure some people would say I'm ""biased"". However, this is one of the BEST local sandwich shops you can find anywhere! The bread is fresh delivered (which is why you see all the whiny comments complaining about them being out of bread. Yes. If you come at 9, and they close at 10, they'll probably be out of bread OR if you show up right before any Pittsburgh sporting event, yep, they'll probably be out of bread, unless you pre-order like the other smart customers!) 
The steak hoagies are my personal favorite, my boyfriend loves the original/Italian hoagie. I've heard good things about the meatball hoagie, also, just haven't tried it personally. Yes, they are CASH ONLY! It's a small town, local sandwich shop, EXPECT to have cash on hand. And don't take your frustration of having to carry cash out on the guys and gals making your delicious hoagies; it's not their fault you don't plan ahead. 
Parking is Not hard, unless you come early on a Sunday. There's a church right behind them and they park up and down the surrounding streets. Again, small town local sandwich shop. It is what it is. The small things that seem to bother the non-knowers are things the people who know and love this place are completely fine with. The food is worth it."
5,"So happy I discovered this nail salon! Super
Close to my house. My teenage daughter and I needed a gel pedi, and I needed a gel mani as well. Johnny did my toes and was absolutely amazing. I was able to get both done at the same time. The owner is nice, it is super clean and the vibe is easy."
5,"This is a very nice steakhouse inside the westgate casino.  I had the Japanese wagu 3oz with a side of broccolini.  The beef was just how it should be, fatty from the heavy marbling and an intense buttery flavor.  It's rich and melts in your mouth.  The outside was seared perfectly with a nice crunch to compliment the juicy center.  It's a small piece of meat with a ton of flavor.  I would choose this over one of the larger options.  It's a real treat for a steak lover."
5,"Insane insane, hard to describe what just happened.
Super juicy and slightly charred Pork belly bah mi, loaded with cilantro and fresh chopped veg, habaneros and spicy mayo. A clear 10/10.
Also friendly service and patience to explain the menu deeply.

Take my money now. Must walk the menu end to end.
We also tried the steamed bun with fried tofu, also ridiculous.
Go now. Go!


Why are you still here?"
5,"Trent was the best bartender! Super great ambiance... Awesome food... Awesome drinks , would definitely recommend!"
5,"Went here the other day, chicken wings are amazing!!! Very clean and staff was friendly."
5,OH EM GEE.  Jump on the chance to try their catfish!!!  It's a huge portion and seasoned perfectly. I got the fried catfish and the Cajun rice and andouille sausage bowl with a side of hushpuppies.  It was $11 total ($9 for the catfish bowl and $2 for the hushpuppies) and I definitely won't finish it.  It's seriously to die for!  Anyone who gives these guys a bad review is a crabby snob...don't listen to them.  Best food truck grub I've ever had!!!  A+++++++
5,Used to go to the original location on Bethany and 16th Street but now this one is closer to home so I go here all the time. Amazing selection of wine and beer! One of my favorite places to hang out after a long day of work to relax with a friend or 2. Check it out!
5,Went here for my very first time and was amazed by the service both Trish and Jimmy made me very comfortable and relaxed definitely will be coming here again! Thank you MD Nails Spa for such a great experience and a special thank you to both Trish and Jimmy
5,This monster sandwich was a beast. Great Cappicola. Friendly people. Def go if u are in the area.
5,"Trish was awesome! I showed her a photo of nails that I really loved and she was able to transform my big block looking acrylic nails into this fabulous masterpiece! I also went in for a pedicure, massage was great and my toes look great! Thank you Trish! This is now my go to place every two weeks for nails, relaxation, and convenience!"
5,Great bar.  Great vibe.  Great staff.   Nothing but good things to say.  I love the huge selection of beers.   Seems like this place has more choices than any other place I've seen in Phoenix.   Decor inside is super cool and big copper sign out front is awesome!
5,I did the hot stone massage pedi. It was long and thorough and relaxing. Pedicure room is big and clean and well decorated. Andrew was meticulous and attentive. Very enjoyable. Love that they're open late. Will definitely return.
5,"How I love you Waffle House....

When I see your awkward plain square yellow letters...W...A...F....F....L...E.....H....O....U....S...E....I truly light up inside.....you have been my inspiration to continue driving on many of my road trips.....I just keep going and going and going...from one waffle house to the next through out the whole country......sometimes I am unfaithful to you and swing in to Cracker Barrel...but you always get me first..they get your sloppy seconds......Yes I can see your sign in my mind right now.....

I swing in and almost sprint inside....I force myself in between to fat smelly truck drivers at the counter...and then I wait for the oh so ugly staff with the lazy eye and missing teeth to ask my for my order.( I wonder if having a lazy eye is a job requirement at Waffle House ).....no need for a menu...I know....I always know.....I want the cheese egg special that comes with raison toast ,apple butter and yummy ass hashbrowns ( be careful in some states it comes with nasty ass grits ).......sometimes I get a double order of eggs......and a diet coke ofcourse.....

Then I watch as the even uglier sweaty cooks go to work on my breakfast...my mouth waters...not even the stench of the fat truck driver staring a my tits next to me....can stop my excitement...my tongue waits to lick the plate...greesy cheesy goodness....no need to have any class here....as I look around at another truck driver picking his nose in the corner.....

I dream of Waffle House.....and my 3 dollar breakfast...its the first place I stop as soon as I leave California.....God how I wish we had one in my State"
5,Just went there for the first time. I got the braised beef banh mi sandwich and it was delicious. I'm going back tomorrow for lunch! The service was quick even though there was a fairly long line. Highly recommend.
5,"Living in Louisiana, you always want to have something that reminds you of your childhood.  Well, Jamburritos also brought some innovation to the table too for the new age/ adult in me.  I went to the Great Cajun Cookoff and was amazed at what I tasted.  Red Beans and Rice and Jambalaya intertwined into burritos/tacos?  Also, the Catfish was cooked to perfection too.  I just wanted to tip my hat off to this express truck and excited to try something else on their menu!"
5,Far better pizza than any other around.  For the same price as the Paps John's and Domino's too.
5,Love this place. The service is so friendly. Food was delicious. It was ready so quickly after ordering! Super happy with my experience!
5,"If you've had Banh Mi sammies before you'd know them as great valued sandwiches with a simplistic taste but perfect for a light lunch. This place is pretty much Banh Mi on steroids. Dish out a couple more bucks and you've got some dope stuff now. I had the Steamed Bao Five Spice Pork Bun along with hundreds of others who reviewed it and it's delicious, my girlfriend had the sandwich verson of the Five Spice and it's just as good. We had the Tofu Kimchi fries to share and coming up below $20 it was pretty damn perfect. Their tacos and their other flavours are intriguing and I'm excited to come back and try some more!"
5,Gia the owner is really cool I can see she is focused on her business. Kiki was the server she was so nice and the food came out in under 7 minutes!!!! Great food
5,"The host or server at the podium, Mark, was very neglecting. He saw us standing by him and didn't acknowledge us for a good while.

Thank you, Alex (Chang K) and Liman, for the greatest service! You guys were very personable and attentive. Ask for either one of them to wait on your table. You won't regret it.

The food was amazing! Great flavors and perfect preparation and presentation. The $150 3-course Tomahawk and Lobster for two was a great deal. The lobster is a little bland, but pair the meat with roasted mushrooms and garlic potatoes, you're all set. Don't forget the dessert! 

The start was rocky, but the finish was great!"
5,Had the grilled pork bahn mi and the kimchi fries. It was super tasty!!! :) service was quick and the lady at the counter was very friendly!
5,"Best cajun food in town, not just from a truck.  Phoenix doesn't have the greatest selection of cajun offerings so I was amazed at Food Truck Friday to find Jamburrito.  They have a pretty stellar selection of meats & meals considering it's from a truck.

The spices were perfect - just spicy enough to enjoy but nothing that's going to harm.  I had the catfish once and the jamburrito twice... not in one sitting because the portions are VERY filling."
5,"Probably some of the very best Pizza in town!  If you want great tasting Pizza and you want it pretty fast, then come to Barrio's!  They make outstanding Pizza in either a regular or thin crust and the toppings are well supplied.  Multiple size choices to choose from along with wings if you want those as well.  This may be a ""chain type"" store, but this isn't your run of the mill pizza.  You will not be disappointed...give Barrio's a try, they are worth it!

5,"Great Food and the people that work their or great to 
The only trouble is I like to have big cold beer after I order 2 sips and the food is in front of me and then the ride home I have to smell that food with my mouth watering LOL"
5,"Just...Wow.  INCREDIBLE selection.  There is truly something for everyone.  Don't know what you want?  The bartenders can certainly recommend.  It is small, so it can get crowded and a tiny bit loud.  But overall, this place knocks my socks off.  Fun old-school games are laid out all along the bar...everything from Rock Em Sock Em Robots to Trivial Pursuit cards.  It's not too downtown-hipster and did I mention the selection??  YUM"
5,"Fantastic hidden spot inside The Westgate!

Finally this property has good places to dine at other than the outdated Benihana .

Decor was nice, dining room was cozy and the staff was friendly. Our server Ryan greeted us and was fantastic throughout the entire meal! He paired a few dishes with our tasting that completed great!

Had the following dishes I won't go into much detail rather I'm just going to explain what was enjoyed 

Salmon belly crudo 
Spicy crispy shrimp
Cauliflower soup
Sunchoke ravioli 
John Dory 
Beef Wellington. 
A5 Kobe cap
Creme brûlée 

Highly recommend going to this place as you will leave the same way I did...Happy and hungry for a return"
5,"Jamburritos is like an ice cream truck for adults. I was fortunate enough to encounter my newest addiction at the Phoenix Food Truck Festival.

The Jambalaya burrito had the perfect blend of heat and spices. The catfish is expertly breaded and fried. The hushpuppies were delightfully fluffy, moist balls of crackalicious magic. I honestly had not considered the potential of Creolexian until now. I'm fairly convinced Jamburrito can do no wrong.

I wish these guys lived in my neighborhood so that I could conveniently drop by for dinner. Phoenix needs a fleet of these trucks so that I can happily grow fat."
5,"Super awesome espresso martinis! And they have popovers, too! My steak was done perfectly and their mushrooms were delicious."
5,"Still the same Barro's I loved in Mesa.  This one was big, and had a lot of tables.  It was very busy, which is not a surprise.  The only flaw I saw in the whole place is that the soda machine is past the cash registers.  So people paying/picking up and people going to refill drinks keep crossing paths.  A place that busy, it was kind of annoying.  Pizza was as good as I expected."
5,My go to pizza in Phoenix.  Consistently good regardless of day of week or location. Ready when promised and there are so many locations that you are always close to one
5,"We were celebrating a special anniversary with another couple. I found the Travelzoo deal for dinner for four for $189. This seemed to fit the bill for what we wanted. 
Ambience: this would best be described has old school Vegas classy. The tables are very nicely spaced, the chairs very comfortable. You know you are in an upscale place as soon as you sit down.
Service: Angel, our server, was that our table almost immediately after we sat. He was not familiar with the Travelzoo offer so he got his manager to come to the table to explain how things would work. Both of them couldn't be nicer. Throughout the evening, Angel, the bus boy, and the food runners, were extremely attentive without being intrusive. The service was near-perfect. In fact, we had a minor problem with the order. Angel assured us that he would make it right and he did. And when he heard that couple was celebrating a major anniversary, he brought us complimentary desserts. Truly five star service throughout
Food: my wife and I each decided to start the meal with a shrimp cocktail appetizer. Gorgeous presentation and delicious food. Nice way to start the meal. I chose the flat iron steak and my wife chose petite filet as our entrees. It was cooked to perfection. I preferred the filet to my flat iron steak. But both were excellent dishes. As a side dish I got the Corn Trio. Is consisted of a portion of cream corn, chili lime corn on the cob and jalapeno cornbread. Delish! We finished with a flaming creme brulee and the huge piece of chocolate layer cake. The presentation on the crème brûlée was spectacular to say the least. And it tasted equally good.
Value: the Travelzoo voucher for approximately $45 a head for a meal like this is a terrific value - what a great way to celebrate an anniversary."
5,Oh......My.......God......this place is fantastic!!!! The catfish jamburrito is one of the most unique and flavorful burritos I've ever had. Every friend/family member I've told to get it loves it as well. Keep up the deliciousness!
5,"Caught this place on a slow Sunday afternoon to catch up with family and watch the end of the Cardinals game.  They have a great happy hour with legit prices on a variety of craft beers and wine.  The girl running the bar was friendly and knowledgeable. Not sure how loud or busy this place gets during a weekday HH or Friday evening, but it was very chill on Sunday."
5,"I probably order from LD every weekend.. Always fast, fresh and delicious..Pad Thai and Chef's Hong Kong noodles are fantastic..when I'm visiting my daughter the first idea is ""let's order lil dumpling.."" You will not be disappointed."
5,"I love their sub sandwiches during the Football season that's my favorite spot. The Decour is kind of old but don't let that scare you, food is fantastic and the service is A+."
5,"I love their omelettes and hashbrowns! Also, I love how everyone always yells out, ""Hello"" whenever you walk in!!"
5,I am addicted to this place. Luckily I don't live too close to this restaurant otherwise I'd start looking like a Bao :D I recommend the five spice pork belly bao. Get two because you'll be sorry you didn't when you are down to your last bite. They're smallish. I also recommend any of their banh mi sandwiches. Everything tastes fresh and has great flavour combinations. I tend to pre order on Ritual because sometimes I can't find parking nearby and need to do a quick hop off hop on kinda deal. I can't think of anything negative or suggestions for improvement either. This restaurant is a keeper!
5,I am so excited there is a downtown location now! I've been to the other two locations and loved it! They have a great selection of beer! The most diverse. The atmosphere is great with board games and styling. I will definitely be back!
5,"These are the best tacos I've had since moving to Phoenix, and Taco Tuesday makes it a great deal too. The shredded beef tacos are the best, and they'll send you home with chips and salsa too (the hot red salsa is a delight)!"
5,"The customer service at this hotel is stupendous, especially the cooks at the breakfast area. Wanda is great. She's so friendly and welcoming and having to wake up on a weekday at 6 in the morning, it was a pleasure for her to be the first person that I interacted with. I loved my room as well. Clean, updated, nice. The only critique I have is that the air conditioning was out in the common area. You can only imagine no air conditioning on the hottest week of the year thus far in SC! I still give it five stars, though, based on all of the other pluses."
5,"I've had 2 items from this awesome food truck.

Texas Toast Blackened Catfish Sandwich
That day, they didn't have anymore fried catfish.  I almost said nevermind, but I'm so glad I didn't.  The sandwich was huge, I could only handle half.  It was a while ago so I can't remember everything on it, but their cajun sauce i definitely remember.  The sauce and the blackened fish meshed so well, along with the toasty texas toast.  It was flawless.  I can only imagine how much more I might have liked the fried fish.  I'd recommend this to anyone.

Fried catfish k-tacos
If someone had told me I'd wake up that morning and have a perfect meal, I'd say...'why are you talking to me this early'.  The catfish was flawless (there's that word again).  Fried like my own grandmother was in that truck doing the cooking.  I haven't had catfish seasoned and fried this well since her.  A better job could not have been done here.  Every single thing on these tacos was awesome.  And again, their white cajun tartar sauce walks hand in hand with this fish.  The best catfish I've had outside of my grandma's, and the best fish tacos I've had period.

The first time I had food from this truck was at a farmer's market.  The wait was a bit because the line was quite long.  Second time, same thing.  I'm not a frequent food truck customer, so I'm not sure what an average wait time should be.  However, I did not mind the wait because of the kind of food they were pumping out of there.  I mean, you're serving up platters of freshly fried and perfect catfish.  You can take a while.  I don't mind.

Customer service is just fine.
Their website has a schedule to track them, which I really appreciate.
Only wish they had clones."
5,Friendly and fast service. I tried their blackened catfish jamburrito and it was deeeelish!
5,"This is an adorable place with locally sourced cafe with organic and vegan pastries, sandwich options and delicious beverages. I LOVE the aesthetic - minimal and crisp. It is quite spacious as well. A great place for conversation, study or work! :)"
5,"The truck came by our work on rio salado today and I had been wanting to try them as they came up as an option for our wedding catering.

The woman taking orders was very friendly, outgoing and knowledgeable about the food.

I had the fried catfish jamburrito with hush puppies. Everything came with a very good sized portion and was delicious. I will definitely be eating here again and they are in the running for our catering needs."
5,"Went here on a whim with a friend today and will.definitely go again. 
I got a vegetable wrap and chai tea. Super yummy wrap. After eating I grabbed another chai to go and a delicious ginger cookie!

Lots of yummy menu options to choose from as well. The actual cafe has a nice friendly vibe and I noticed a lot of board games on a shelf so looks like you csn enjoy some games with friends there too."
5,I'm usually a pizza hut kinda girl and I dont really venture out to eat at other pizza joints but im tired of pizza hut and decided to try Barro's. I have to say I am pleasantly suprised. I will never eat pizza hut again after tasting Barro's. The pizza was hot and very delicious. I loved that it had a lot of toppings. This is definitely my new first choice for pizza! Thanks Barros.
5,It's a staple in my family. Nothing like a cold beer and a battleship. I prefer the roast beef. It's amazing. I always get a battleship and a small roast beef for myself. The seasoning and oil with the provolone and fresh soft chewy bread.....amazing.
5,"So ridiculously excited that this new bar opened in downtown Phoenix!  I have been to the other locations and love the laid back vibe, great service and extensive beer/cider/wine menu...and luckily, this location is no different.  This will definitely be our new hangout in the neighborhood - happy hour from 1-8pm each day (can you say amazing?) and you can bring in food from local restaurants (bonus!)."
5,"This place is so nice.  It opened only a month ago and me and my friends family were the first to stay in room 205, ever.  The breakfast was great, delicious!  Lots of choices and the people are so polite, don't take advantage of that.  Even if you are richer, or higher on the social scale, treat the people here with respect no matter what.  They do that with you, so return the favor and smile back.  Anyway, this place is clean, the people are nice, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a nice hotel."
5,"They have such great sandwiches here awesome flavours and ingredients.  Only problem is place is so popular it's rare that it's not packed.  Also which it was open a little later too but hey, those are minor quibbles.  You can't go wrong here"
5,the absolutely best steak hoagie in the state of pennsylvania.......   i promise you'll want another... and to top it off the price is even better u get real steak fresh veggies and most importantly soft fresh bread!?!?! #battleship
5,"My go to place- good food, cheap, friendly staff and consistent. My favorite and go to are  the panko tofu steamed Bao, and jicama papaya salad, both are so good. The braised beef steamed bao is also delicious and juicy. I wouldn't recommend the tacos or the calamari banh mi, but the grilled pork banh mi is another great option."
5,"This was the first stop on my first First Friday tour, and I'm very glad to have been introduced to this hip, comfortable, modern bar. They have a wide selection of great craft beer on tap -- I got an IPA, but I'll have to try the mystery/sample tray next time as there were quite a few I had never heard of. We missed happy hour (all the way to 8 pm, so we didn't really have an excuse) by a few minutes, but the bartender still hooked us up - I would give five stars just for that!

In contrast to the Whining Pig on Bethany (much more hipster, much more cramped/intimate, depending on how you look at it), this one was spacious with appropriate lighting and plenty of seating. There's also 2-player Mario Kart at the tables, and I personally love when bars have stuff like that.

Definitely worth a visit -- I'll be back!"
5,I like the breakfast burritos. I really like that I can call in my order ahead of time and pick it up on my way to work!
5,"Excellent service and quality. Ordered take away lasagna and pasta, absolutely delicious."
5,This bar is amazing!!  Great beer selection and staff is awesome!  Bigger than the Bethany Home location. Copper pipe sculpture hanging in the bar is an incredible work of art!
5,"Went to Food Truck Friday for the first time and after 10 min of reading every food truck menu, I decided on Jamburritos mainly because I was in the mood for some hushpuppies. I was eyeing the chicken jambalaya in a bowl, but then I saw a grilled catfish sandwich go by and changed my mind instantly. I was so happy with my dish. The fish was flaky and full of spices. The hushpuppies were to die for! And even the Fanta was a nice add to the greasy, yet yummy dish that I had. I love this food truck craze and I hope it sticks around. I still need to try Hey Joe Filipino and the Torch food place."
5,"Great crowd for happy hour, excellent service! And a very upbeat fun atmosphere I definitely recommend and my wife and I went on a Tuesday can only imagine how much fun on a Friday!"
5,This place is soooo cute!! I will definitely go back with a group of friends to play games and have drinks! It's a wine and beer only place with so many options you are sure to be overwhelmed (in a good way). The food menu is minuscule but delicious and very adult. This is the kind of place you go with a group of friends and forget about your cell phone because there's so much fun to be had if you like games. I had the star grilled cheese which was delicious and filling. The staff here may as well be your friends because they are so cool and happy to help you pick the perfect drink. Annnnnnd park in the garage because they validate parking!!
5,"This part of Toronto is gentrifying. There is a neat toy store next door and in general the storefronts are better kept. 

This place deserves a great neighbourhood."
5,"Went here last night out of chance. The ambience is ideal for those looking to have a fun yet intimate experience. Although it was a little loud, the candle lit environment was warming and a great place to take someone on a date. We tried the calamari which I found was a little on the soggy end. However my friend enjoyed it and she finished it quickly. The lamb shank and duck leg were both good. For those looking to try the duck leg, I'd recommend finishing it quickly, for some reason letting it serenade causes it to become salty. Taste wise the food was top notch and relatively inexpensive, nothing over $25."
5,"Great wine, excellent service, fun atmosphere, and happy hour from 1 - 8pm, what more could you want in a neighborhood bar? If you don't like this place, go back to Scottsdale! Haha! If you're a wino like me, whining pig is the perfect place for an after work bev, night out with friends, or just a friendly place to meet people and stare at the cute boys pouring wine! Ugh and the grilled cheese, mouth watering! Cheers Phoenicians!"
5,"Prior to taking in the Amon Amarth concert at Mr. Smalls Theater, I met up with friends for a pre-show apartment party in Millvale. Food was to be provided by Frank's Pizza and Chicken, but when I arrived, the pie had vanished. 

""Wait, Darren,"" a friend I'll call The Wizard said. ""I got a Battleship!""

""From Triangle Bar?"" I asked.

""Yeah. And it was barely touched!""

A chant began, long-haired hellraisers representing both genders in tattoos and black shirts began to shout my name in unison. 

A Triangle Bar Battleship -- a hoagie 26 inches long that is blessed with an Italian vinaigrette so magically pungent, has the capacity for making standard iceberg lettuce, garden tomatoes, and plain white onions dazzle -- was waiting for me.  The deli meat is piled as thick as 2X4's, the fresh-baked bread is akin to a Portuguese roll, and 2 foot plus submarine can feed a brigade of hungry metallions. 

Except it wasn't a mere grinder...

The sandwich snake's juicy proteins, lead-heavy grains, and vegetables squished when bitten into, lashing out, thrashing, whipping its enormous tail at me. 

Nonetheless, Jormungand would fall, Earth's demise would be averted, and loud, guitar-driven merriment ensued. 

After not having had a Battleship in 7 or so years, I found that its quality had not wavered. It is truly a zep for all time, one that offers to its competitors...

5,"This hotel was above and beyond my expectations. Upon arrival, Avery greeted me, and was SO friendly and helpful, he really made the experience begin on such a positive note. Any manager reading this should give him praise, he honestly was one of the nicest, happiest, and friendliest employees I've met in all of my travels, and even checked in with me the next day when he saw me walking into the hotel from a walk outside. 

The room was modern and big, with a nice sized bathroom and exceptionally clean. The whole hotel was full of kind and helpful staff who always were polite, courteous and friendly. The free breakfast buffet and manager's cocktail reception were such great touches as well! Anytime I come back to Charlotte, I will absolutely stay here. Only 8 minutes via Lyft from the airport ($9 fare) and minutes from the city. Plus, the residential streets near the hotel were great for a midday walk, lots of lovely houses and woods."
5,"I have to force myself to limit how often I come to Chico's, because it's so good. First off they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right after you pay for your order. This way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained while they cook your order. But there's only one thing I order each time I come here, Nachos! This place has the most delicious plate of nachos that I've come across in the area. Of course the serving size is generous, I usually make it a point to not finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard toppings, the beans are good, the red sauce that they drape over it is great. But what makes these better then most is first the cheese, love the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on. But what wins me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice and hot, melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips. The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't hit a spot, but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind! So beware... 

Staff here has always been nice, I've never had an order go wrong, never had an issue on quality or consistency."
5,"You can find me here every Tuesday night. You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed to whole the damn monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out weight them my friends!

Anyhow, the burrito is large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals. Awesome for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly amazing. It all tastes very authentic, and I love that I can easily make it vegan since they don't add any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me coming back.

Oh, and the salsa bar is to die for! I am usually creeped out by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh - yuck) but they actually make some damn good salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal favorite salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. Be sure to try it with your free chips.

On top of everything I love about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid.

Stop by and check it out when you want some affordable, authentic tasting AND high quality Mexican food."
5,"I've been going to this buffet for years. The staff is genuinely polite and great to our kids (two energetic boys). The food is wonderful and fresh, I highly recommend the coconut shrimp. They have a sushi and Mongolian bar too. You won't be disappointed. Great location and atmosphere. Not overpriced-they fare with other buffets in the county. Definitely my top two Chinese buffets. You won't be disappointed."
5,"""Jamburritos Cajun Grill"" has a nice little place at Food Truck Friday event in PHX. This is the place to be! Get there early or you WILL have to wait in line!  It was my first time at the event and I did have to stand around a bit, but it was so worth it.  
The grilled Catfish Jamburrito was my order of choice and I found it to be quite a work of art! There was sooo much food neatly wrapped up in the oversize tortilla (burrito) that I couldn't wait to dig in. The succulent catfish and a spicy rice mixture (Jambalaya) was quite the thing I needed, as it put a little ""pep in my step!"" 
I ate the entire first half of burrito, but had to slow down and use a fork when it was time to devour the second half. The burrito and myself were bursting at the seams at that point. I eat a lot of food but this thing was gigantic! I washed it down with an ice cold Fanta soda and for dessert, the lemon lollipop was a surprise, but also refreshing. 
I was quite impressed with the way the cashier was handling the crowd. During my small wait time, I enjoyed watching her work! The Chef was quite gracious and when he handed me the large food tray. His nice comments, and his reminder to pickup my forgotten soda, put a smile on my face. So I decided to write this review. Yep, 5-stars! I'll be back!"
5,Awesome and cheap place to do your nails. It's beautiful in here and the staff is kind. Thank you TRISH for doing such a great job!! :)
5,"We love the Embassy Suites and this one was no exception. Although the atrium is under construction, the room was great, all new furniture, amazing bed with great pillows, etc... But the room wasn't the best part. Markus Tate, the front desk staff member who checked us in last night and was still around this morning when we headed out, overheard me suggest to my wife that we take an Uber to the airport since one of the hotel shuttles wasn't running. He gave me his email address to send him the uber receipt and the hotel reimbursed us for the short trip ($12). He went above and beyond to help us get to the airport quickly and without any extra burden of paying for the uber. I don't know how long Markus has worked at the Embassy Suites, or if he is already in a management role, but he should be put into a management training program or into a management role because he truly set the bar in terms of outstanding customer service. From check in last night all the way through his email to us confirming he got out uber receipt and thanking us for staying at the embassy suites and wishing us safe travels, Markus is the sole reason for this 5 star review!"
5,"My boyfriend and I started coming to this place a few months back and now we just can't stay away! We are never disappointed and always leave feeling full. The price is very reasonable as well! It's good for lunch or dinner. 

My favourite bao is probably the fried chicken. The crispiness just balances the sauce and the soft bao so well! There is also a squid one and some other great choices like pork belly etc. 

You are also a fool if you don't get the kimchi fries...a fool I tell you.  So delicious!"
5,"Simply put, the Battleship is consistently the best hoagie I've ever eaten. Every time.   Especially if  you're lucky enough to have it made by one of the many tattooed men.  (I'm not sure why, but the more tattoos the sandwich maker has, the better the hoagie tastes.)

Yeah, the neighborhood leaves a lot to be desired. Grab a buddy, lock your car, and get the sandwich to go and eat it elsewhere.  It's absolutely worth it."
5,"Okay, I admit that I have never eaten here before 2:00 am and in any sort of clear mind, but that doesn't take away from the greatness of the Big Cheese. 

In essence, its fast food with a couple uncomfortable tables in the restaurant and most clientele having orders to go. Poutine is simple in nature, but add on some sauces, meats, a few vegetables (peas seem to be popular) and you got yourself...well...poutine, which is the only thing served here. 

There are roughly 20 choices of poutine that come in large and small sizes. Most nights I find it hard to finish a large by myself, which at $6.99-$10.00 is an excellent value. They offer vegetarian, beef, pork, chicken combinations ect... that suit anybody, as long as you like poutine.  

Here is a menu link : http://www.mybigcheese.com/menu/menu_thebigcheese_poutine_25-may-11.pdf

I am not an aficionado, but I can tell that the cheese 'curds' may not be official, however it still makes a good meal and snack. I find it helps to let the flavors settle for a bit (as I vigorously shake my brown take out box) and the cheese to melt before enjoying.  They have a condiment station with extra spices and whatnot to make it the way you like.

I highly enjoy this place and continue to work my way through the menu. Scottish Curry is quite spicy, Donair seemed bland, traditional poutine is a safe bet, but anything with Pig in the name is recommended.

Big Cheese seems to have an inviting atmosphere, is well lit and clean, which is more than I can say for some of the pizza places that I frequent late night.

Next time, I trying the yam fries...maybe even in the daytime!"
5,"Fantastic biscuit sandy. I make my own homemade biscuits (and have eaten a lot both home and away) so I consider myself a biscuit pro, and these are fantastic biscuits.  The place is clearly family/kid friendly. Super strong and tasty coffee. I'll be back. Great spot."
5,"This place is amazing!!!!!!!

Very happy to see when there are plenty of vegetarian options -  I got the pank tofu Bao. Person I was with got pulled pork - galbi - pork belly and chicken bao. Everything was tasty as hell, staff was really nice and place is clean. Everything is well priced, and the size of their bao is really good for the price!

This location is really nice, lots to do in the area and there is a green p parking garage around the corner. TIp for anyone going in June -  the parking garage on 30 roehampton is free for the first 2 hrs until June 30th 2017

I'm sold for life, this is my go to Bao-Taco-Banh Mi place now."
5,"The whining pig is a cozy bar downtown that offers a relaxed, but fun atmosphere with games included! The beer list is extensive and the bartenders are always willing to give recommendations. Happy house is until 8pm everyday! I'll definitely be back!"
5,"Super clean, professional and great results!  Highly recommend.  They were able to get two of us in right away for pedis and they were great.  $35 was an upgraded pedi with an extra long massage and hot stones.  Really impressed with this place"
5,"Best Dinner I've had in Las Vegas, Hands Down! My wife and I arrived around 7:30 and we decided we wanted to eat in the lounge adjacent to the bar. The hostess, Cheryl was amazing in accomadating us. She is a true professional and made us feel at home from the get go. For starters we shared the Steak Sashimi and the Seared Foie Gras. Amazing!! Both the presentation and the taste were top shelf. I had the 10 oz Manhattan Sirloin with a side of Brussels sprouts, melted in my mouth, I believe they added some kind of Thai Chili to the Brussels Sprouts which gave it such a mouth watering little kick! My Wife had the 48 hour Buffalo Short Ribs. They just melted in your mouth like butter, and the portion was so generous! Mike came from behind the Bar to take care of us. He is a Real Charmer! He made us feel So Comfortable and we shared a few good laughs together. They have some great wines by the glass, I like my Old Fashions though. Mike made it ""The Way It Should Be Made""!! Great experience overall and DEFINITELY will be back soon!"
5,"Came here with my sister-in-law. We were very impressed. The location is perfect, not much businesses around so parking spots is accessible. The spa is very beautiful, spacious and tidy. So much color selection & finally a place that has gel and regular polish that actually matches!! Plenty of manicure stations and a separate room with pedicure chairs, they also have an area in the pedicure room for kids and opposite side of the room are a few secluded chairs. We thought it would be a perfect place to host special occasions, small parties or even Bachelorette parties. 

The staff is very friendly and welcoming. My nail tech asked if this was our first time, which it was. She also mentioned that because we said yes and that the spa is beautiful that we should go on Yelp and write a good review, because there are 2 bad reviews posted? Strange, because all the reviews posted are good anyways? Nonetheless, we had a great experience either way.. although my service took 2 hours for pedicure + gel manicure and not busy at all. But I do appreciate that they are opened late and is conveniently located in my area.. Happy Hour is from 9:30am-4:00pm, gel manicure & pedicure receive $10 off. We will definitely be back!!"
5,"Korean - Vietnamese Fusion that is to die for. Honestly some of the tastiest sandwiches in the city at prices you can't beat. Standard sandwiches are served on a long baguette, nice and crisp bread with fresh veggies and delicious meats no matter what you choose. I really love that they started serving smaller slider style sandwiches on baos, the sweet steamed Chinese buns you often find at dim sum. The sweetness goes well and is a little easier to munch on than the sandwiches if you have a smaller mouth. Really great flavours and great prices. Very convenient as well, you can order beforehand to skip the lines if you want to avoid the lunch rush. Kim chi fries are delicious and they also have nice selection of beverages with cold coffees and some other nice touches. Definitely worth a try if your ever in midtown area or down near their queen street location!"
5,"Nice atmosphere. It's a huge place when you walk in. Lots of big flat screens by the bar. Lots of tables. Even a gaming area and pool tables. 

We tried the sample platter (4 flavours, 5 wings each) and was enough for my boyfriend and I (but we did order a side of fries and mozzarella sticks as an app). Nice to try some of the many flavours they have!

Would definitely go back :)"
5,"I'm a huge fan of the downtown locations of the Banh Mi Boys franchise. I think this uptown  location is the best out of all of them. 

The food is what you can expect from. You can never go wrong with a pork banh mi sandwich and of course top it off with the kimchi fries. 

The modern interior is what gives this location a slight edge over it's downtown locations. Its spacious, tables have a black finish so it makes it a lot sleeker and cleaner, lots of tables (good for bigger parties), and great ceiling art. 

Very pleased that they opened this location at Yonge and Eglinton."
5,"Wow, great food, the ""family style"" dining was incredible value -- there were three of us, we got four appetizers, three pastas, three entrees with two vegetables... all for $28 each.  And all of it so delicious with fun and friendly service.  My new favourite place."
5,"I tried the shop(az)fyitm double ipa and franziskaner weissbier.  I highly recommend the ipa if you like ipa's.  Ordered the fig spread, prosciatto, goat cheese sandwich (sweet, creamy).  I bet their secret ingredient is honey in those sandwiches."
5,"I would highly recommend this place! I came in for a late night pedicure at 9pm and was pleasantly surprised. They had 7 or 8 other clients there as well but they offered me a drink while I waited. They set me up with a heating pad on my shoulders while I waited in the pedicure chair for the next free person. I opted for the hot stone pedicure for only $35 and it was amazing! They massage for a long time and the hot stone is so worth the extra $10. Very relaxing atmosphere, clean facility, and friendly staff. Linna was the one who did my pedicure and she did a beautiful job and was very nice! I have found my new nail spot!"
5,"Since I was a child, Wor Wonton Soup has been a requirement any time I am not feeling well. The other night I had the flu, and being new to the area I was stuck without a favorite Chinese food destination.

I took to the Internet and pulled up Yelp. Little Dumpling was 15 miles away, but had the best ratings. Man am I glad I took the drive. The Wor Wonton was excellent -- definitely hit the spot. I also had the cashew shrimp -- I ordered a small and it was still enough to share (with the soup).

I arrived to pick up the food a few minutes before it was ready - and was surprised to see spring rolls in the order which I hadn't asked for. I guess that's their way of saying ""sorry you had to wait"" -- Great service. 

Good food, good prices, good portions. I will certainly be back soon."
5,"My sister lives in Austin where food trucks are on almost every corner, so when I heard the trucks were coming to Phoenix, I was super psyched!! My co workers and I headed down on Friday around 1pm. The trucks are parked close to my school, so we got there quickly, and there was tons of parking, and no lines to wait in. When we arrived, there was such a variety, I wasn't sure what to pick. We tried to find a money machine, but realized, to our delight, most of the truck accept credit. I chose to go to Jamburritos and did not regret my choice. I order the jambalaya and it was awesome! The dish was spicy and delicious! I will return and this time, my choice will not be difficult; I will go to Jamburritos!"
5,Solid steakhouse which would give any steakhouse in Vegas a run for there money. I would recommend the filet and lobster tail meal along with some baked stuffed potato and Mac n' cheese
5,"Best spot in Phoenix, you're an idiot if you don't drop in:) great atmosphere with a stellar beer and wine selection."
5,"We had a wonderful experience at the Edge Steakhouse on Friday. Celebrating a 60th birthday and the attention to detail, attentive service and service with a smile was top shelf!  The Westgate has it going on with their culinary offerings and we had a great time!  Thanks for making it memorable!"
5,"Cute little café located at Main and Gerrard, a nice place to get some breakfast and a coffee. Their breakfast sandwiches are my favourite.

It's generally very busy and pretty noisy, since it's a family-friendly café. There are often a lot of kids around, so if you don't like having kids around, this probably isn't the place for you."
5,Really good!!I l love these subs and they have the extended sizes for a reason. Highly recommended.
5,"I first saw MD Nails a few months ago.   The fact that they are open until 11pm is what caught my attention.   Finally went in tonight and let me just say.   I was so impressed.   The first thing you notice is how welcoming it feels.    The smells that usually permiate a nail salon were non existent.  Instead,  the smells of essential oils filled the air of this gorgeous spa.   As i sat in my chair i was just so relaxed.
 Tonight i got the best pedicure I've  had in years.   I could go on and about T and the rest of the staff.   Go in you will not be disappointed."
5,Stayed here for a week.  I was reading some of the negative comments and can honestly say my experience has been quite the opposite.  The entire staff from reception to shuttle driver was friendly and more than accommodating.  The complimentary breakfast and reception hour was good and the service moved reasonably considering the amount of people.  I will definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to others.
5,"My sweetie and I had time to kill before a movie,  so we popped in for a beer. Awesome selection,  unpretentious atmosphere,  cool bartender,  and games, we played ""Smart Ass"".  Yelp gave us a free brownie , which was tasty.  We will definitely be back on a regular basis for the atmosphere and the 7 hour happy hour.  Think we're going to bring a few more friends and play cards against humanity next time.  Glad we found this little gem."
5,Been going to the competitor for so long but had to find something closer. Was a little hesitant about the price but it was totally worth it! Great customer service and super fast! Only got a car wash but I don't plan on going anywhere else! Thanks guys!
5,"What's better than beer/wine and board games?! This place has a ton of beer and wine selections and can please anyone from a beer amateur to a beer connoisseur.

They have an awesome happy hour (1-8pm everyday) and have $2 off all drafts. 

They have $8 beer flights (5 3oz glasses) and $12 beer flights (4 3oz glasses). 

They have TONS of board games, from trivia pursuit, connect 4, jenga, cards against humanity, boggle, sorry, and a lot more. They also have retro two person controller games on a screen. 

The only thing is they don't serve liquor. I'm usually not a beer person but the atmosphere here is just awesome. All the employees are so nice and helpful as it was our first time. 

Also, if you check in you can get a free brownie which is actually AMAZING. I thought it'd be just some cheap brownie but it was delicious!

This place is close to Talking Stick Arena and the Phoenix Convention Center so if you have the time to stop by for a drink and some games, do it!"
5,"Amazing nail salon! Brand new. The inside is so trendy, clean and inviting. The owners are hands on and always aim to please. Their hours are great because they are open late and NEVER rush you out or close early. We arrived at 9pm and Dan did my moms gel manicure/pedicure. Julie did my gel pedicure and Ti did my manicure. They were all fabulous and their customer service was wonderful. We will definitely be coming back!"
5,"Great new addition to the downtown beer scene. They've created an intimate environment in a rather large and open space. The staff there are friendly, down-to-earth, unpretentious, and knowledgeable. They have close to 40 taps I believe, always rotating, great beers from all over. Great happy hour prices. The grilled cheese sandwiches are wonderful. I plan to return every time I'm in the area."
5,"For someone that is particular; I cannot find one negative about this hotel. It was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a long time. After reading so many mixed reviews I didn't know what to expect but this place delivered. It shows that they are truly aiming to please! The pool, fitness center, cooked to order breakfast, two room suites and much more is no false advertisement. It is all exactly what they say! We didn't get an opportunity to enjoy the complimentary drinks and reception but I saw it being set up and it looked pretty awesome. Kid friendly and family oriented. 

Great job staff and management of Embassy Suites; you got this right!"
5,"It's about time my neighborhood got a cafe that compares to the cool Leslieville Cafes that so many flock to. 

This place has a great menu that includes cornbread goat cheese Whoopie Pies! The Lattes are amazing and it's kid friendly!"
5,"This is a good local spot for coffee, tea and sandwiches if you need some sustenance. I am not sure why there are so many comments about how the food isn't mind blowing. I had a BLT which is pretty standard fare if you are going out for brunch. The sandwich was generously proportioned and came on multi-grain bread.  My friend had the big breakfast which reminded him of an English breakfast. Again generous proportion. The coffee that they had is Pilot coffee.

The seating is spaced out so that you don't feel like you are intruding on your neighbour's conversation.  Families with children do frequent this spot which is nice. The servers were remarkably cheery and amiable. I didn't feel like I had just been parachuted into hipsterville or the land of toddlers.  

Would certainly make a return trip."
5,"I lovelovelove this place. Small, dark lounge in Bellagio that has the feeling of Vegas, without the over-crowdedness of clubs. The music they play is pretty similar to what you would hear in a club anyway, so come here, get a few drinks, and groove! Lots of places to sit, the age of the crowd is all over the place, but everyone is pretty friendly and keeps to themselves, for the most part. A really nice chill place."
5,"Went in and got lunch carry out for $9.06.  Stuffed the box full with sushi, orange chicken, general tso's chicken, bourbon chicken, and a shrimp mixture. And yes, all of that fit, I just had to pile it high, but they don't care, which is why I love it!

Sure, you could go get a lunch combo meal for $5 at any other Chinese place, but here you get variety and get as much as you want.

Staff is always friendly and they do a great job refilling anything that is even remotely low."
5,"This is the type of bar I wish I had in my neighborhood.  Draft list 35 strong.  Bottle list at 100.  Rotating wine selection.  Happy Hour with incredible hours of 1-8:00pm.  Flights for less than $10.  Have I could your attention yet?  Beers from out of state as well as local.  Ciders, meads, and all varieties are welcome.  Tons of free games to pass the time and a TV for watching the game.  Open late and centrally located right in the sports district.  I really can't give enough love to Whining Pig.  5 out of 5 for sure!"
5,"I took some food out at this location many years ago and it wasn't memorable and I never went back. A few weeks ago we had to go into Walgreens and could smell a wonderful aroma of Chinese food cooking in the distance. I thought to myself it must be Little Dumplings which is located behind the drug store. One night we order some dinner to go off the internet and was surprised how good it was and it was a TON of food for the money. I am sure most will have leftovers which makes it even a better deal if you like leftovers for the next day. A few days later I ordered lunch special L-19, it's Shrimp Chop Suey (veggies) and you get a choice of a side, I chose the Lo Mein noodles. You also get a small cup of soup, like Hot and Sour. Also included is the little crispy wontons skins with sweet and sour sauce. All this for $7.95!!!!! You know all too well that for such a low price you get about 5 tiny tasteless shrimps at most Chinese take outs, right? Well not here at Little Dumplings, not only is there a very very generous amount, but they are pretty darn tasty too! The Chop Suey is a deluxe recipe, garlic, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, baby corn, squash, bean sprouts, everything! The Chef back there knows what his is doing, this isn't not a Panda place, no no not at all. The restaurant isn't fancy, you can dine in, but its very casual. Order a few items to go, but beware the food comes in huge portions and you will most likely be very surprised! It's my new favorite Chinese cusine and luckily I live close by! Yay!"
5,This place was actually seen in a magazine which I opened up Friday afternoon. Let's just say this!!! If you're in Vegas I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this steakhouse!!! Just come and you'll be amazed PERIOD!!!
5,Very nice owner if u have a problem he will help u right away! Thank u Dan!
5,"I can honestly say that I will not go to another nail shop! KATIE is the best nail tech ever! She does an amazing job, she is friendly, and has great insight on what you need and might want. The nail shop is amazing as well. It is always clean, they use the best products, and treat you amazing! On top of that they stay open to 11pm! You will not be disappointed. Also you can call or message them yo make an appointment! I have always been treated amazing at both locations. They will even make you an amazing cup of tea!!!"
5,Come here!!! It is amazing! Beautiful inside and everyone is so welcoming and nice! Trisha is amazing!! I absolutely loved the way she did my nails!!
5,"Best steak I've ever had. I had the 10oz Manhattan Sirloin and it was fantastic, pretty much melted in my mouth. The truffle Mac 'n' Cheese was also excellent. The jumbo Prawns were amazing. I can't say enough great things about this restaurant. Angel was our waiter and he was excellent, very welcoming and generally great at his job."
5,"Good selection of food and convenient. I liked the rice and coconut shrimp, waiters were friendly and no wait to sit down"
5,"Where do I begin?! When you first walk in the decor is absolutely gorgeous and you feel at home right then. We were seated at a gorgeous and comfortable booth right in the dining area. It was wonderful because it seemed as if we were in our own little dining room with the privacy the booth gave us. Then we were greeted by Bobby our server, so incredibly kind, knowledgeable and fun. He explained about the restaurant and how we came at the perfect time as the extraordinary (my words not his, LOL) Chef Steve had just created a new Spring menu.

I love getting all the information I can about the food on the menu so before each portion of the meal we were told what was in each aspect of the dish. For appetizers we had Beet Salad, Bone Marrow Pizza, and my absolute favorite the Beef Tartar with Caviar. It was everyone's first time trying caviar and we are all now HUGE fans. I would HIGHLY suggest ordering any and all of those when you go visit.

Next course was the English Pea Soup with Morel Mushrooms, mind you I am not a fan of mushrooms but I had to try it, and was I surprised as to how amazing it was! All of the ingredients and flavors in the soup mixed together perfectly.

After that it was the main course, I had the 7 oz Filet, which was melt in your mouth perfection. It was paired along with the Whipped potatoes and Lobster Mac & Cheese, I know my potatoes and these were whipped so finely that it was like butter in your mouth, so creamy and delicious. The Lobster Mac & Cheese had the right amount of cheese and lobster, not too much of either, so yummy!!!

My boyfriend has the John Dory, a fish I have never tried before, but was it absolutely delicious!!!! Each bite had more flavor than the next, I think everyone at the table was worried about me for a moment as I was making the weirdest faces but it was that GOOD!!!! A must have!

We wrapped up the meal with the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulle, which I have never really been a fan of at other restaurants, Chef Steve has officially changed my mind on that, at least at The Edge Steakhouse anyways!

I have travelled alot and have been fortunate to have amazing meals but The Edge Steakhouse and Chef Steve's masterful culinary mind and insane talents have proven that I knew nothing before, this, by far is the best meal I have had to date. If you make your way to Vegas you HAVE to come to The Edge Steakhouse, otherwise you are missing out on an amazing experience.

***SUMMER UPDATE***
Can you tell I love it here?! I'm getting hungry again just looking at my most recent pictures! My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and we tried the Summer tasting menu that was released the day before we visited! The meal started off with a sort of asiago bread while we were waiting on our drinks. Which by the way were yummy! I got the Moscow mule which was absolutely refreshing!!! Then we had a tasting of three of the appetizers, beef tartar (my favorite), spicy shrimp that has a kick at the end, and a heirloom tomato salad with avocado. All light and not filling so you could enjoy the rest of the meal. Next up gazpacho with king crab, now I'm not much a fan of gazpacho but WOW! Then we had the Beef Wellington with Foie Gras, vegetables and a side of the garlic, whipped potatoes. I am spoiled now, between the perfection of the temperature of the meat and the Foie Gras paired with the Wellington I will not be able to enjoy it anywhere else!!! The meal was finished off with a yummy birthday vanilla bean, raspberry topped cheesecake!!! DELISH!! (See pictures for presentation!) everyone get in there before the summer menu turns over!"
5,"Sleek and sexy were the two words that sprang into my head when my  husband and I went to Caramel. We went the night before 4th of July at around midnight and it wasn't very crowded. We sat at the bar, even though there was plenty of seating throughout the space. The interior is dark and well decorated and arranged with a variety of seating options. There was definitely enough room to dance if the mood struck  you. I ordered an expresso martini which was delicious and my husband stuck with beer. The music was spot on, and while it was loud, it wasn't loud enough where we couldn't carry on a conversation.

Caramel is a nice alternative when you want a chic, upscale spot to drink without the craziness of the clubs. I will definitely be back my next trip to Vegas."
5,"Look, it's by no means ""chicago-style"" pizza, but hey, it's excellent pizza. They get all the ingredients right, resulting in a damn good slice. And $4.50 for two slices is excellent. Never a wait, interesting toppings for the walk up slices. Great place to stop in for a slice, 5 stars"
5,"I love this nail salon! Dan the owner is so nice and treats his customers with care and is very polite . Jimmy did my nails and is quick , calm, and did a great job on my mani and pedi . This place is for relaxing customers with a family friendly environment. I bring my sisters here and my nieces . They have two kid chairs and it has a living room look . Their nail bar is separate from the pedicures so if you need a quick fix for nails that is quicker than pedicures. I highly recommend this nail place, the price is worth all the relaxation and customer care."
5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay!! Mostly Everything was excellent, price, location, food and happy hour. The bartender was really nice and fast. I loved the spacious rooms, elevators were fast and parking was plenty and free. Check out was excellent. I was able to do late check out with no hassle (ended up not needing it). The breakfast was hot and plentiful. The staff at breakfast was nice. Only minor complaint was check-in. I wasn't acknowledged as a Hilton honors member and the Latin lady doing the checking in was very dismissive, constantly checking her phone and almost rude. She didn't tell me about the happy hour, had to ask where my room and elevators were located. But overall her lack of customer service did not dampen my stay there! I will return!"
5,I love this place. Chicos Tacos make you feel like family. The food is always on point and most importantly Robin was awesome with her customer service skills
5,"WOW!!  Do you guys deliver to Boston?!

I ordered the Blackened Cajun Fish Burrito.

Best burrito I have ever had and I'm not a real Mexican fan. But this I can eat everyday !! 

Portions great for the price too !!"
5,"This is my second time here, great service and quality work.  My last visit I got a gel pedi and it lasted forever!  This time I brought my 6 year old daughter, they have super cute kids chairs.  She loved the pampering and they were great with her.  We will be back!"
5,Nothing better than a cup of java after a long day of helping clients in the area find their dream homes. Very lofty design & great staff.
5,"One of the greatest hotels I have stayed at. I travel extensively. Domestic and internationally. Large rooms, wireless internet, complementary breakfast, and all this for around $100 a day.

Great!"
5,"We probably come here more than most places. If you get a salad, get the sesame poppyseed dressing!"
5,"I have not been to the Triangle for more than 20 years, but have told my husband about it many times (the place I used to go in college with friends late at night that had amazing hoagies named after ships - destroyers, battleship, etc.).  He had never been there and never heard of the Triangle.  Today was my lucky day!  We went to Kennywood and I realized the Triangle was just over the bridge.  My husband, a big Danny's fan, was game to try it.  The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but parking was easy and the Triangle was exactly as I remembered it, especially the orange and green tiled floor!

We ordered a battleship and a cheesesteak destroyer.  Everyone (kids, grandpa) loved them.  They were even better than I remember - fantastic fresh bread stuffed with meat and cheese, lettuce and tomato, just the right amount of oil and vinegar, salt and pepper.  Like other people say, you'd think that such a sandwich would be easy to find, but for some reason good simple  things (basic awesome bread) are hard to come by.  The cheesesteak was fantastic as well.  We felt that the cheesesteak was better than Danny's.  We have NOTHING like this in the west.  Definitely a great place, a fantastic  price, oh, and Turner's iced tea too!  I just hope I don't have to wait another 20 years for my next one."
5,"We had 21 family members here last night and this was the perfect place for us to come. We were loud and drinking margaritas, but the food was great and the service was outstanding - so much so that even today our crew is still talking about how great our server, Jaymee, was. None of us had an empty glass all evening, and when the bill came we were shocked at how inexpensive it was for the amount of food and drinks we had. Fantastic!!!"
5,Been coming here for over 50 years. Hands down the best hoagie in the Pittsburgh area!  Moved to Ohio recently and will make the drive on a regular basis for my fix.
5,This restaurant is absolutely amazing. The amount of food options and if you are lucky enough to be able to go when grandma is cooking it really has a homey vibe and amazing food and dining experience. Me and my bf went for our anniversary and it was a great romantic spot to go to have an intimate dinner experience.
5,"Best afterwork watering hole spot downtown.   They have a huge variety of beer and wine.  And you can buy beer/wine to go.  Happy hour is from 1pm-8pm.  They serve sandwiches and sides of chips and nuts.  They have a slew of board games to keep you occupied, which is always a fun way to spend your time. We tend to play card games or connect 4 which makes me feel like a kid again.  They also have a couple of table top arcade games to play.   All in all this is our go to spot downtown for great beer selection, and a laid back vibe."
5,"Triangle serves up the best hoags in Pgh, hands down, one of a kind and delicious! Their Battleships are such an easy thing to take to a tailgate or game day party, always a crowd pleaser! Besides the battleship they also have a delicious fried fish sandwich that I would definitely recommend for lent. They also carry Turner's Tea, and you really can't eat a Triangle hoagie without having Turner's to wash it down with. 

I would also recommend calling in your order ahead of time because it can get really busy in there. Plus during lent they might run out of fish, and you don't want to be without that delicious crispy fish. If you do call in, you can skip the line and go to the right side of the store to pick up your order. No matter what, it's worth the wait!"
5,"The pizza and wings are tasty, but what really drives me here is the children's play area. It's neat for them and works well for me. Plenty of tv's to view sports and often makes for an easy night for me. 

The service is good and the place is always tidy. I plan on returning time and time again."
5,I love this place. The food is awesome and they serve you Pinot Grigio in a goblet. Nothing beats a fried shrimp platter and a copious amount of wine in one glass after a long day.
5,"This is my favorite Chinese take-out in Henderson!  If you are looking for delicious food and generous portions at a great price -this is the place!
For example, when you order an entree, the price includes steamed rice and fried wonton strips to dip in the sweet and sour sauce.  Yummy.  They don't nickle and dime you here.  The staff is very friendly."
5,"I usually go to the Whining Pig in Arcadia but I was excited to explore the new WP opening downtown. The location is easy and to get to and there's street parking. 
This place has a crazy selection of beers ! I always stick to the IPAs but there's something for everyone. There's a good crowd at the WP, always good music, & awesome bartenders. Perfection addition to downtown."
5,"I also do not understand the bad reviews!
A friendly, family owned business.  I've been going there for years.  The Crab Rangoon is everything everyone says (and my son's favorite - If I'm lucky he'll let me have one!) No complaints ever about the Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, or Kung Pao Chicken.  All the veggies are cooked through yet never mushy.  But it's the shrimp dishes that I find amazing!  They serve really big perfectly cooked shrimp!   The Honey Walnut Shrimp heavenly and if I'm trying to be good its the Shrimp with Snow Peas.  Seriously, the best shrimp around!"
5,"When you arrive at 12:30pm and the buffet ends at 1pm, you don't expect much. Wow, did North Park over deliver! Our group of 5 all took advantage of the extensive buffet. My plate included tots, a blintz, pancakes, a freshly made waffle+toppings, mac 'n cheese, an MTO omelette and who knows what else? Throw in a chocolate fountain, multiple dessert options, amazing service and a $14 bill and you've got a fan.for.LIFE!"
5,"What a Gem within the Westgate Casino ! I was staying at the Westgate for a conference and was travelling as a single lady. I usually don't venture out too much while travelling on business alone and opt for room service. I decided I would try the Edge Steakhouse, what a great Decision, This place is amazing and I probably had the best night Ever while travelling on business !!
I sat at the Bar and from the get go, was made to feel So comfortable with the Bartender Mike. A real Old School kind of barman that you really don't find much anymore, anywhere! Its almost as if he sensed I may have been a little uncomfortable as he asked me "" where's the rest of the gang"" I said I was alone to which he replied in his New Yawk accent "" I got your back"" and introduced himself. Mike made me feel so comfortable that I stayed almost until closing. His personality just shines and yes, he is a very handsome man, maybe that helped a little too :) 
I had a delicious 7 oz petit filet with a side of mushrooms, both delicious and just melts in your mouth, best steak Ive ever had !! I asked Mike what his recommendation would be for a nice dry red to accompany my meal. He suggested a Chianti. Perfect Again !
I will definitely be venturing out alone more as a single business Woman, at least, to The Edge Steakhouse Bar. Highly Recommend!!"
5,"Ordered the Braised Lamb Shank cooked with peas and onions.  First off, I'm not a fan of peas in particular... But that day I decoded to try things for a change and also ordered the asparagus as a side.  (never tried asparagus in my entire life!) 
As the order came, it all smelt simply delicious and the flavour unimaginable as compared to anything I've ever tasted.  I actually liked the asparagus!  Truly worth the visit.  Can't wait to come back."
5,"Clean rooms. free drinks and appetizers before 7, a waterfall, and a jacuzzi what more could you ask for?"
5,"Fantastic steak house.  Had crab& avocado salad.  Real blue crab meat.  Excellent taste and flavor.  Main course "" Beef Wellington "".  This was definitely  5 stars!  Cooked to perfection.  First time here.  Tried it out with a TravelZoo coupon.  Will return with or without coupon!"
5,The BEST Red Beans And Rice With Andouille Sausage I've ever had!  So delicious. .. check them out!
5,"A s chief cook on LST 325 I can attest to the quality and flavor of great hoagies, the bread was especially good thanks for a wonderful meal on our short visit to Pittsburgh"
5,"This is my place!! It's a Chinese Buffet so please don't expect elegant steakhouse quality food. You know what you're getting at a Chinese Buffet. The food is great and the selection is even better. You can't beat the price and they have sushi and hibachi as well. The seafood never looks all that appetizing, but I usually stick to chicken anyways. The booths aren't the most comfortable, but so what. The place is always packed at lunch time, but there is plenty of seating."
5,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Excellent service, unbeatable food at a price unfathomably cheap for the quality of food you receive. 

We had the calamari, the meatballs and linguine. Everything was to die for. The meatballs were easily the bet I've had. Our server (unfortunately we can't remember the name!) was one of the best. We tried the Sweetgrass beer. Please try it. It was fantastic.  

5 stars. Will absolutely be back. As soon as possible."
5,Just in from California and had to bring my family here everytime I come to Pittsburgh. The super battleship is fantastic and feeds my whole family.6 of us .6 big pieces.love this sandwich.its all good.Just get over there and try it.You wont be disapointed.See you in 4 months when im back in town guys.Keep up the good work.
5,"Found this place here on yelp, and could not be happier! Moved here 3 months ago and believe it or not, have tried 4 different nail places before coming here.  It's really a beautiful place to hang out and get your nails/pedicure done. The staff are professional and it is super clean and modern. Johnny took care of my gel pedicure and took extra care of me. Kan worked extra hard to be sure I was happy. All in all, a great experience and priced right! They offer discounts for seemingly every day of the week!
I have found my nail place"
5,This bar is awesome !!! Awesome selection of beers and wines !!! Love the Schilling pineapple cider my boyfriend liked the peanut butter stout
5,"Chef Michael and Gregg catered a delicious small menu of  food for a very special fundraising event on Apr 13, 2014 at the Stand-up Scottsdale Comedy Club. Feedback on the Chicken Etoufee and Hush Puppies was wonderful and everyone went home with full tummies. Food was delivered on time and the team came back to clean up just as promised. Will definitely recommend Jamburritos again! And I'm sure so will our other 100+ guests! Thanks, Chef Michael and Gregg."
5,"Late night great food as always.  Very clean, and staff was awesome."
5,"Have come  here over the years. Always a positive experience.  
The only thing I have ordered is the Wing Sampler  That is what I will recommend as you can have four different flavours. If you go with four other friends and all  5 of you order  different flavours in your wing sampler that is  a total of   20 different flavours you can try . It will be one wing per person but a foodie adventure. 
I recommend any wings flavour you cannot get elsewhere and if you stick to basic and familiar flavours then you are  wasting your foodie experience . 
They have their wing challenges for customers to try . I tried their Devils Inferno challenge. I  made it halfway before my friend tried to take a picture and i lost my concentration and felt the burn thereby throwing in the towel. :( 
Reservations are very easy to make as long as you call two weeks in advance. I have been able to book tables when bringing groups to watch sports events and always got a good table."
5,What can I say I haven been to a lot of places and this one has probably been the best pizza I have every had. I was in Arizona for 2 days and ate there pizza for 2 days lol I couldn't resist... nothing more to say but they are good.
5,"Great Happy Hour Specials from 5-7 on bar food.  Plenty of TV's, and Buzztime NTN Network to play trivia.  Staff is friendly and service is quick."
5,"Love this place! The first time I went to Caramel was this past trip to Vegas last week, and I don't know what took me so long to go!
The bartenders were really nice and talkative, and the drink selections are great. I had their Oreo Martini, a very fun drink. I didn't have any food, but the menu selection looks very good. They serve food until 9pm each night. 

It is a nice small lounge, with a great atmosphere, and a great place to chill. Definetly a place to keep coming back to!"
5,"I don't spend a lot of time in this area but I've been working nearby for about half a month now and this has quickly become a morning staple. Delicious coffee, awesome breakfast sandwiches, almost all of which are completely home made, and the friendliest staff I've ever met, even during their super busy morning rush! They even make their own breakfast biscuits. So good."
5,"Great food, friendly staff. Bathroom clean.

Extremely busy at lunch time.

Must have: 
fried chicken Bao
Kim chi poutine fries
Five spice pork belly

Nothing to complain about. Just good food at very reasonable prices.

Must go! I mean now!"
5,"Went here with a friend of mine that has been here quite often in the past. I can see why he likes it. I had two soft tacos, a carne asada and a grilled chicken. They both tasted great, had fresh garnishes, and a good amount of cheese without being overwhelming like some places are. Free salsa bar with good choices, and if you're a drinker they also serve margaritas and had several varieties of beer for sale. Planning to take my daughter here in a few weeks when I'm up this way again."
5,"I really like this location. My favourite is the secret menu bao.

Staff is always nice, and the keep the place clean.

Food is ready pretty fast.

Cheap, fast, simple and delicious!"
5,"Because I always have to copy off of my sister AB, I should toss up a review of Jamburritos as well (especially since I was the one who told her about the food trucks!). 

The addition of the food trucks to Downtown has been fantastic. There are some solid spots near the ASU campus, but adding 4-6 trucks every Friday really livens up the options. However, I have been pretty boring, because 4 out of 5 times I have went there, Jamburritos and the chicken jamburrito has been my choice. I can explain though; it's freaking awesome.

First off, the service with Jamburritos is quick and very friendly. I always walk my food back to the office (I'm SO dedicated to my job), and the truck wraps up my deliciousness. More importantly, the chicken jamburrito is basically amazing. I am always a fan of non-Mexican food in burritos (the blackened chicken burrito from California Tortilla is one of the best I have ever had), so a jambalaya burrito was a perfect idea. The chicken and sausage are always perfectly cooked and extremely succulent, and the dirty rice really adds some flavor to the meal. For $6, it is hard to beat Jamburritos, so try 'em out!"
5,"If you want great honest home style Italian food you will do no better than seven numbers. 

The lasagna as noted by others is the best in the city.   Everything Rosa does is done with love and the key to success is the simplicity.  

Calamari is light crisp and the best you will eat, the sexy duck is like a happy duck who just can't wait to be eaten.   

We eat here quite frequently and it is always a fan favourite when we bring in guests from out of town.  

Let Momma Rosa and the fantastic staff at seven numbers take care of you for a night you won't forget."
5,"Simple and authentic -- my favourite Italian restaurant in the city. For those that know real Italian food, it's the homemade tomato sauce that sets this place apart. It literally brings me back to my childhood.

The atmosphere is intimate, but casual. On busy nights, it can get a bit noisy and a little crowded, but that's part of the experience. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of ingredients, but if I had to list a complaint, I'd like to see larger portion sizes. That said, I was fed by an Italian grandmother as a child, so take that for what you will.

Service is always friendly and warm; it's the perfect neighbourhood restaurant."
5,"I love this place; i come to this location or the one near yonge and dundas at least once per month. My go to is always the duck confit bahn mi with medium heat (siracha) - it is so tasty and the pickled carrots, cilantro, cucumber, bread - it's a perfect combination. If I'm getting just the duck bahn mi, I also like to get the jicama slaw too - the dressing is a little spicy. Other favorites of mine are the fried chicken steamed bun, the beef steamed bun and the kimchi fries - all super tasty. And everyone I come here with always loves the kimchi fries. Pricing is also not bad; dinner for 2 with a can of pop is around $25. The only annoying this is that their hours a little short in the evening."
5,Jason and Jony are absolutely amazing. My nails have never looked better!  It truly is a Spa with the pedicures in a different room. A truly relaxing and beautiful Nail Salon
5,"Everything went better than expected!

We went here for lunch the other day after the original place we picked was too busy. By the looks of it I thought it would be a fast food style Mexican restaurant similar to el pollo loco or something like that so my expectations were not high. I was presently surprised. 

Walking in there was lots of room but not very busy. The menu was well displayed. I went with the Achiote chicken salad which was quite good. I spiced it up a little with some salsa from their well equipped salsa bar. Although the salad was good I soon regretted my decision as I sampled my friend's baja fish tacos. I love fish tacos. I REALLY love fish tacos. If my life was a video game their would definitely be a side mission that entailed trying fish tacos at every restaurant in the game. Anyway, the fish tacos were delicious. Everything I could've hoped for. A very classic fried fish taco. 

Now I can't stop thinking about fish tacos. Review over. I'm going to lunch."
5,Trish is so amazing she take her time and do your nails with perfection I'm so happy with her service !! I've lived in Vegas my whole life and never found a shop that compares to this MD Nails U Rock
5,Great Subs and my all time favorite since growing up as a child is getting the Battleship or the Destroyer.
5,"Excellent breakfast spot. BF and I came by for a quick breakfast and my was it great. The pancakes were fat and fluffy and worked well with the banana and chocolate chips we added. The ""Hi' rise"" sandwich was even better. The bacon was lean and crispy and the biscuit the sandwich is served on was amazing. They absolutely nailed it."
5,"My girlfriends and I came here on a Sunday night and surprisingly it was decently busy. The restaurant don't take reservations for parties under 6 so we were lucky to get a table since the place isn't too big. 
I have been to the Danforth location and the menu items looked the same. We decided to order 2 apps and an entree for each of us. The items we ordered:

Spicy grilled shrimp with this avocado salsa
Gorgonzola, strawberry and walnut spinach salad
Veal meatballs with a side of linguine 
Orechiette pasta
Linguine with a rich tomato sauce and rapini

All the dishes were delicious and satisfying. The portions are actually really good for sharing. The flavours of each dish were well thought out and super tasty. I would say its Italian comfort food if there are such terms :)

The service was awesome and the servers are very attentive and knowledgeable. It was a really enjoyable evening with great food and atmosphere! 

I definitely recommend this Italian restaurant and will be back again in the near future."
5,"My daughter and I came here after a particularly hard and long day. It was almost 1am and we were beat.
The staff were friendly and extremely courteous.
Our waitress bent over backwards, always checking on us. Brought us refills without needing to be asked and making sure our food was alright.

No this is not a Michelin star restaurant, it's an all night diner. The food is tasty and fast."
5,"Happy hour which is 2 and a half hours with free drinks and appetizers, jacuzzi and pool, complimentary breakfast with made to order omelet! Plus the room is 2 rooms with 2 tvs a fridge and a microwave. Best deal on a hotel I've seen in years! Got a rental car from Alamo through them for being a guest for 21 bucks a day. I am elated. I hesitate to post this review for fear the deals won't continue for my next journey here. We just drove 14 hours from Chicago overnight, and this is just what the doctor ordered. What's that? Sorry, I couldn't hear you over the jacuzzi bubbles 8)"
5,I have purchased my weekly pizza from Barros for 10 years. Unfortunately my closest location (ray and 48th) has the worse service imaginable.  Then take out orders are NEVER ready as planned. It seems that the estimate is typically half of what is experienced.. time to find  new local solution
5,"I had a party for my birthday on 03/22, and I got three of the battleship hoagies, the chicken salad, roast beef, and Italian.  They were a huge hit with everyone at the party and they were absolutely delicious!  I read the reviews of this place here on Yelp and everyone said they had the best sandwiches in Pittsburgh.  They definitely did not disappoint.  A fantastic way to feed a lot of people, and I can't wait to return!"
5,I got a standard pedi from Jimmy and it was my first time there. The atmosphere is totally relaxing. Jimmy was super chill n cool. I happen to be there during their happy hour so it was even better! Jimmy told me to grab a stamp card on my way out n I totally forgot but I will most definitely be back. My pedi turned out great and he was thorough.
5,"The salon has an amazing ambiance, everyone is so friendly and professional. This is the best nail salon I have been so far. The price is reasonable compare to  Summerlin community: pedicure $25 gel manicure $35. If you want cheaper go to somewhere. You get what you pay for. I love this salon and definitely coming back."
5,Every time I come here.. my food is fast and perfectly cooked! The guy that cooks (I'm pretty sure he's the only guy there and is there every time) is always on point with everything and is a great multitasker from what I saw so no wonder my food is always fast.
5,"I made reservations months ago and needless to say it was worth the wait. Before I even talk food I have to tell you about the amazing customer service. There entire team is top notch! The greeters, our waiter, the water guys, and the bartender were all incredibly kind and accommodating. Our waiter was very impressive, his knowledge of the menu was boundless, and it made our great meal even better. 

As for the food I picked Edge based on reputation and a desire to try some new things. When we sat down we were given these very tasty popovers. Then we got started with a cheese board, wagyu beef tartare, and the bone marrow flat bread.

I love cheese/meat boards but they are often hit/miss, this one was a hit! Three varieties of cheese (goat cheese and two other), preschutto, chorizo, apricots, pecans, crustini, and honey. The combinations of texture were fun to explore and all of it was absolutely delicious. 

The bone marrow flat bread was very different but in a good way I can't quite describe. Overall very enjoyable.

The beef tartare was made from Japanese A5 beef which I believe is essentially Kobe. It was molded together with a sort of citrus/mayo, topped with caviar, and served with crackers. The medley of textures and flavors was absolutely fantastic.

Along the way I also enjoyed a manhattan and a Vegas dream cocktail. Both were incredible. The Vegas dream was a orange vodka, champagne concoction that really hit the spot. 

For my entree I got the 10 oz wagyu sirloin with a side of whipped Yukon gold potatoes. Great piece of meat, perfectly cooked, overall a fantastic finish to the meal. 

5 star from the atmosphere, to the staff, and the food. Literally my only disappointment was that the salmon belly crudo was not on the menu at the moment (I really wanted to try it ha)"
5,"This is one of top steakhouses in town!!   My coworker and I have been looking forward to trying the Edge for quite some time. We had a little taste and preview of Chef Steve Young's skills at the Las Vegas Food Festival. 

Needless to say that we had an amazing dining experience.  We had 4 star service as well as 4 star quality and presentation.  Chef Steve Young was nice to stop by and ask us how everything was.   My coworker and I were impressed by the balanced flavors from all the dishes that arrived to our table.   My personal favorites were the salmon carpaccio and the cauliflower soup.  Yum!!  The next time I come I would be interested in trying the Wagyu beef or the braised short ribs. 

I've been to several steakhouses in town and I would rank the Edge and N9ne at the top of the list for food, flavor, service, presentation and ambiance."
5,"I've been saying for a few years now, that this corner just needs a 'Starbucks' to turn it around and clean it up a little...don't get me wrong, I love Little Indian, but the venues on this corner usually leave much to be desired.  Enter Lazy Daisy's Cafe, and wow!  First of all, kudos to the owners for taking a chance and taking the first of what I hope will be many steps toward improving business in this community.  Secondly, the service and food were fantastic.  I stopped by this morning and had a mocha and toast with my two fav spreads ('pb&n' as I like to call it - peanut butter & nutella) and it did not disappoint.  I expected the service to be great as I've been hearing nothing but great things from folks in the hood, but what impressed me too, was watching as Dawn took the time to chat with all her patrons...and by patrons, I'm talking all walks of life - young, old, professionals, parents with children/infants etc.  Reading her fb page, you get a sense of how much personal passion has been put into this biz, and being there in person proves that's not just a bunch of publicity.  I returned in the afternoon with a friend and we feasted on the salted caramel brownie...deeelish!  I hear they do breakfast on weekends and 'cortados'...I think I'll be filling my coffee card pretty quick!"
5,"I absolutely love this place. Before I moved back to PA, I'd always have my family bring me one to where I was staying. The Italian beast would feed 3 of us. I don't really know what it was called, but I call it a beast because it is huge. You will be licking your fingers. Getchu one."
5,"Every time I come here I order the 'destroyer' Italian sandwich for take out. It is more than enough for two people, and a quick, inexpensive meal. The sand which itself is packed with meat and cheese and really very good. When I get home I usually like to pop it in the oven for a few minutes to heat it up (its served cold). This place is definitely worth checking out!"
5,Best breakfast sandwich/burger! High rise is a must try! Nice decor and atmosphere. Kind staff.
5,"Best sub in the Burgh!!!
I highly recommend the fried bologna!!
Clean and inviting 
The Best bread!!
And Rick Sebak Love it here too!"
5,"It was high time that I tried Westgate's new upscale dining venue, Edge Steakhouse, that I had been eyeing for awhile.  And, once I had worked my way through 6 extensive courses, along with Diane and two friends, I was quite impressed with what I encountered, including a capacious contemporary dining room and a spacious elongated booth.  

A Prawn Cocktail offered at the dizzying price of $36.00 was actually worth the freight: sweet and meaty.  I was told that seafood is flown in fresh here daily, and I believe it!  A bowl of French Onion Soup served in a classic ceramic, lion-headed white crock was one of the best I have ever enjoyed, with a gooey mixture of Gruyere and Swiss Cheese rolling over the top.  A savory Chopped Salad was a large starter featuring big chunks of bacon.  Well-made Iced Tea was served in a tall glass beside a filled carafe conveniently left on the table.  I just was not that into the complimentary baked puffs of dough that served as a bread product and resembled Yorkshire Pudding . 

As a tasty interlude, Silk Road Spicy Shrimp, a special of the house, sported plump shrimp graced by smears of spiciness; and a platter of fragile slices of Pepper Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that were tender and mouth watering.  Then came our main: a nicely seasoned and buttery medium-rare Petite Filet accompanied by excellent Bearnaise Sauce, top-grade Peppercorn Sauce, and a sweet lobster tail split in half for me and my spouse, which tasted great dipped in Buerre Blanc.  Mysteriously the menu indicated that the Petite Filet was 7 oz. in size, but the check said 6 oz.  If it was 6 oz., my Filet was a large 6.

Sides were no less inviting: a magnificent Truffle Mac N Cheese graced by Demi Glace, a large array of assorted varieties of Sauteed Mushrooms, and a large Baked Potato adorned with butter, chives, and bacon.  The only service errors of the night was our server initially forgetting to provide my ordered Baked Potato, and then the bacon and chives when it was fairly quickly produced.  The spud was large and the skin well rubbed with salt.  A delicious repast!

But a meal of this magnitude would not be complete without a memorable dessert!  So we all opted to share a large slice of 7-Layer Chocolate Cake and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  Paired up, the mixture was simply divine.  And there was cake to spare.  Chef de Cuisine Steve Young came by to see if we were enjoying our meal.  Very much, thank you!  Hostess, manager, and waitstaff were all friendly and helpful.  And all food was top shelf and delicious.

I will surely be back for more of the same!"
5,"Great place with delicious food. Have been a few times and never had a problem, staff are always great! Went with a group of 10 last night for a birthday and everything went perfectly. Menu is very Italian with 4 courses to chose from so portions are bit smaller, but very tasty. The Veal Lasagna is delicious!"
5,"Exceptional...no other way to say it. These guys make hogies the way they're supposed to be made. Best in the 'burgh, bar none!"
5,Great vibe and glad this place is downtown. It's bigger than it's predecessor but keeps the local bar feel.
5,"I take my mom and daughter for lunch here all the time. I drive from North Phoenix just to eat here. The food is delicious and they offer many many choices. I love this place and I love the food! So good!. The chinese buffet by my house is minutes away, but makes me throw up every time I eat there, and gave my daughter the runs. We will continue to drive over 20 miles and continue eating here only. The coconut shrimp is to die for."
5,"Are you drunk? Is it 2am? If so, grab some poutine, head straight home, and enjoy some delicious poutine in bed."
5,"Just there last week to finally try the wagyu steak  and we were SO happy with our experience. We ordered 3 steaks at our table, and they were all perfectly prepared; the wagyu exceptionally so. The sides are shareable portions, which allowed us to try a few different items. The whipped garlic potatoes were outstanding. In addition to a wonderful dinner, the staff was quite impressive. The maitre d', waiter, and chef who visited with our table were polite, charming, and attentive without being intrusive or overbearing. The maitre d' was an especially kind and welcoming man. Everything about the evening exceeded our expectations. My only regret is not writing this review immediately; I wish I could name the individuals who served us."
5,Great place to hangout before the games. They got a huge selection of beers. All the employees is very friendly and helpful will definitely will be coming back again.
5,"This restaurant is a must do while in vegas. The atmosphere is great, the manager ""SEAN"" along with the rest of the staff ""MIKE"" , MARK"", CHERYL"", and others , genuinely try to make your evening special. It's everyone's attitude that keeps us going back. Give it a try, you won't be sorry."
5,Totally and utterly delicious. Highly recommend. Make sure you are hungry or take someone to share with.  I definitely would have been happy with just the one half.
5,"My friends and I go to Bahn Mi Boys at least once a month. We love the service, the atmosphere, but specially the FOOD! My favourites are the squid taco and the kimchi fries."
5,Great pizza for good prices. Small quiet place to eat in or carry out.
5,"The Whining Pig is a place that keeps it simple but gets it right.   It has a retro, super cool atmosphere.  Imagine a (gender) cave stocked with all your favorite games from you when were a kid.  Your favorite songs from back in that day belt out non stop.  The room has just the right colors and lighting to have you feeling fine..  And last but not least, there's a ridiculous amount of craft beer to choose from.  If the sprawling beer list is overwhelming don't worry, the tender has got you.
Grab your favorite beer or one you've never heard of, and challenge your friends to Trivial Pursuit- or Hungry Hippos.  Once you've got a good buzz going draw a picture or leave a comment on the giant chalk board. (Its more fun than Facebook)
This is a can't miss place for beer drinkers born before 1980.  Or for hipsters who like to pretend its 1980.  So oldheads, hipsters, wanderers, add this one to your bookmarks!"
5,This is still one of the best food trucks in town. They have a unique flavor combinations that entice you to find out where they are going to be in the valley and stop on over. They are very reasonably priced and quick to serve you. Check them out today.
5,"Visited this nail/spa this morning.  What a nice place.  Only 5 months old, the place is in great shape and has a great ambiance for relaxation while getting your nails done.  I had a paraffin pedicure and it was great.  Julie did a wonderful job taking care of me."
5,"I've been going to this place since its opening several years ago.  With different friends and memories, each time this place has delivered as promised.  It's good, family-owned food that is certainly worth trying.  The prices are very reasonable, the service is excellent, and they have plenty of options to choose from.

Try the dumplings, steamed or fried.  They are the places namesake, and for their quality and cheap price I'd say they deserve it.

They also cook to order by telephone, so you can bring it back with you if you'd prefer.  It's been fun watching this place grow and become successful, and it isn't by luck."
5,This restaurant is so cute and I am so glad I tried this place out for summerlicious! Everything we had was delicious! The staff were super friendly.  The only downside is that the restaurant is a little cramped.
5,"After a disappointing experience next door at Fresco, my business associate and I were hesitant to give another Westgate restaurant a try. I'm so glad we did! We accepted a table in the bar and for that they comped our drinks. The waitstaff was fun, interesting, and took time to chat with us. Our food was amazing!!! Steaks flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had the brussels sprouts side and he had the truffle fries. Perfect. Dessert choices were cheesecake or creme broule.  We both chose the broule-  arrived flaming. Creamy underneath and gorgeously crisp on top. Would highly recommend Edge!"
5,The games are so fun. Ambiance and vibe very similar to the uptown location but with a little more room which is great. Happy hour from 1-8pm which is a good chunk of time to fit everyone's schedules. Definitely will make a point to stop in whenever I am in the downtown area.
5,"Hands down, my favorite nail salon, ever.

I'm not a night owl, but this place is open pretty late (11pm). Walk-ins are welcome but I usually call a couple hours ahead and schedule a same day appt. This place lives up to its name - it truly is a spa! It smells so fresh when you walk in. Everything is always clean and tidy. Staff are friendly and prompt.  Water is offered. They truly do care about your experience here and not just making money.

The pedicure with hot stones is A MUST! They also give you a nice, hot neck pillow to relax you. Johnny is great but I can say the same for the rest of the staff here! Very hard working and detail oriented techs. 

The decor inside is so cute, btw. There's a room specifically for manicures and a separate room for only pedicures. 

Did I mention that they call in staff when they don't want customers to be waiting a long time? Unbelievable! They literally call techs in to come to work if they feel that clients will be waiting a while. That's AMAZING customer service right there."
5,"Love this place! Found it a few years ago when i moved into the neighborhood. I have since I left the neighborhood and still travel back to Henderson for their food. The food is always full of flavor, prepared quickly, and the staff is super friendly."
5,Consistency! Consistency is the best review any business can receive and every time i come here it tastes exactly the same way great the best sandwiches in town well worth the line....
5,"Great experience!

1.called to order, lady who took my order spoke clearly and followed me, not someone half listening trying to multi task. 
2.order arrived promptly within explained time frame
3. Large is very hefty for 2. Ordering one salad is more than enough to split-very generous.
4. Top quality ingredients, from the the meats to the crust and cheese. The salad was very fresh and even the ranch was legit - not the stuff you get at the store, but the richer, home made stuff.
5. Pizza arrived very hot, salad was perfect temp(not frozen). Pizza was on fleek.


*2nd order-- just as good, got a pic this time
Cheese sticks are decent, pizza is excellent!"
5,"Everything we had was delicious! (See pics) We're from out of town & found this place through Yelp, of course. It was as good as everybody said. I'm glad we stopped here. We'll probably stop here again when we're in town."
5,Try every new place downtown.  This pig is what downtown really needed.  Great (real) craft beer and great wine selection. A homey atmosphere with throw back games. And the best part. A crew that remembers you.  No uppity BS here. This is the real deal.  Will be back.
5,Really good fried catfish!  I was not really fond of catfish until I tried Jamburrito's way of serving it. The jambalaya rice makes the perfect accompaniment for the crunchy delight. The people serving the food are very friendly and the total experience definitely makes Food Truck Fridays a weekly event to look forward to.
5,"Finally came upon Jamburritos while amongst the throngs at Phoestivus at the Downtown Public Market.  They're downtown pretty often, but for some reason I've always missed them.  Not this time.  And thank goodness.  Otherwise I'd have missed out on some cajun deliciousness that's pretty hard to duplicate.

Effectively what they're doing is serving cajun food in a mexican food presentation.  Some of the dishes have more of a mexican flare than others, but at the heart of every dish is traditional cajun soul.  The menu is actually pretty expansive despite being a food truck.  In addition to the dozen or so items they regularly sell, they also have a number of specials (the big special tonight was a blackened catfish).  They've got burritos, bowls, tacos, and even quesadillas.  For my first venture into the unknown, I went with a chicken jamburrito.  Chicken étouffée, jambalaya, andouille sausage, cheese, lettuce and creole sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla.  I also got hush puppies as a side.  Total cost was $10 and it was ready within about 3 minutes.

First off, the burrito itself is huge.  They slice it in half for you which is good because this could easily be shared by two.  I took this one down myself because, well, there was just too much awesome going on.  The burrito was fantastic and I think the two keys that make it are the creole sauce and the jambalaya.  It actually wasn't crazy spicy as I'd anticipated, which made it even more enjoyable.  The hush puppies were also outstanding and they gave me at least half dozen of those.  For $10, I was plenty full and happy.

So if you're in Downtown Phoenix for Food Truck Fridays or an internet connection to Jamburrito's calendar, do yourself a favor and track down this truck.  The portions will more than satisfy and the flavors will bring you back.  And be sure to make room for those hush puppies."
5,"Wow. This has got to be the best food truck experience I've had in Phoenix. As we walked through food truck Friday during First Fridays, we scoped out our options. We checked with Yelp and found this was highly rated. Best decision ever. Thank goodness Yelp warned us that each burrito was enormous because we almost each got our own. We decided to go with the fried catfish and jambalaya burrito and it was soooooo amazing. No lie, they were generous with the catfish and the jambalaya had some awesome sausage too. It came with a side of this amazing creole sauce and I needed more, it was so good. The staff was super friendly and asked for our feedback (which of course we told them it was delicious)!! I was definitely in pain due to fullness even though I shared it with Eric, but I just could not stop eating it! Can't wait to try other items on the menu but it'll be hard not getting the catfish burrito again!  The burrito was $8 but it was well worth it!"
5,"I don't care what anyone else says I love this place! I adore the fact that they divide their menu into sections such as chicken, beef, pork, and vegetarian poutines. They are very generous with their portions, they load up on the curd cheese (which is vital) and don't cheap out on the gravy, or whatever sauce is on your poutine. I think that their prices are highly reasonable, $8 for a box of deliciousness (then again I've paid $15 for a poutine once). 

The staff is friendly, quite knowledgable on their poutine and that is important. The place is small but there's loads to do along 17th so why not just take it to go? 

I recommend the chicken Scottish Curry for all you wondering what it would taste like ... It's pretty awesome."
5,"My Family from Winnipeg asked for Italian and something different - with a vibe and energy that they don\t get at home.  Well we were perplexed and put out some feelers and found 7numbers.  

This will be my new go-to restaurant as long as i have a reservation as the lineups scared me.  Knowing that ""mama"" changes the menu daily is very exciting!!

There were 7 of us and we nervously ordered the family meal.  The calamari was so fresh and beautifully done.....it said fried but there was only a light dusting of breading and just perfectly done.  the 3 salads were all great.

the 3 pastas that night were lovely, simple sauce-- tomato based - perfect. The Veal Lasagna stood out from the pack we asked for a second plate.  

We were not rushed through our meal we had time between courses to drink and talk.  Although it was very loud in the restaurant it felt right and we could still all hear each other and enjoy the atmosphere.

The mains - thank god we had room because they were no complaints.  My lamb shank fell off the bone and tasted fantastic.

I could go on.....but i think I want to go for dinner now........"
5,Haven't been here for a few years. The food was plentiful and well prepared and the service was great.
5,"Travel to Pitt for work and this is always a must if I'm in the area. Burgers, fish sandwich, and pizza(total surprise) are all great and huge beer selection. Staff and regulars are all awesome. Huge Pitt sports fan base that welcomes everyone. Great time."
5,"They are always friendly and welcoming.
Consistently perfect taste of coffee.
The coffee is smooth, bold and not burnt. 
Their brunch menu is good too."
5,"My family and I love Barros pizza!  All of the pizza is delicious but our favorite is the sausage and mushroom pizza. When I call in to place an order I never have to wait on hold, they take my order quickly and are always polite and helpful.  I find it just as easy when we go there to eat. The atmosphere is family friendly and comfortable.  There are TV's with sports on for the adults and one with a show for the children. There is even a play kitchen to keep them occupied and small tables and chairs for them to eat at with friends. It's a great place to go as a family or with a group of other moms to have lunch and where kids can eat and play!"
5,"Great service and everyone is friendly!
Our pedicures were on point and love the fact that they have a kid pedicure chair.  My daughter felt like a princess.
(The owner came up to my group and introduced himself and was really nice.)"
5,"We tried 7 numbers for the first time one Wednesday night. No reservation, we got a table around 7pm and the place soon filled.
We shared the calamari to start and found it a good size for one and very fresh and tasty. For mains we ordered the 'sexy' duck leg and the lasagne. Both where homely and delicious and good size portions. We also shared sides of two tomato salad and grilled zucchini. For desert we shared the strawberry cheesecake which was great. Service was quick, friendly and attentive and the cosy ambience was enjoyable. The meal cost was very reasonable. Recommended highly. Especially when Mama is cooking here herself! ;)"
5,"One of my favorite bars in downtown Phoenix.  Great selection of beers, fair pricing, cool and interesting decor, great music selection - good stuff!  My only slight complaint is that there isn't a lit-up sign outside the bar.  I had a hard time spotting it on my first trip there, staring out the Uber car window lol."
5,"You travellers that say (or the friends who have heard them say) the best meal they ever had was in Italy?

Go here for that experience. There is a palpable difference in where the tomatoes come from, how long it slow cooks, a person who has made a dish umpteen times knows what ""pinch"" of something elevates a dish. 

Rosa and her sons are the cutest and clearly the type of people who genuinely get joy from seeing people swoon over their lovingly prepared meals. Perhaps I am waxing poetical but seriously the osso buco is unreal. There was this hot (ish) oil brought to the table that looked like it has blackened okra in it, was clearly some kind of pepper, and has a slight crunchiness to it and was sublime. I honestly have dedicated a lot of thought to how it was made and the hours it would take me to try and re-create it. 

My cousin took me here for dinner, it being a favourite of her husband and herself and I really want to go back. Many times. I recommended it to my boss and he responded he had been there many times and (smart dude) he takes his wife out on regular dinner dates all over the city. 

It really feels 'family style' in that everything tastes like it's someone's grandma's staple. Can't be replicated since only their hands know the consistency, their nose the correct aroma etc. 

You will leave happy, satiated and desirous of a further visit."
5,This was really the best dinner we've had in a long time we had decided to try something new and we weren't story the fish of the day was cooked to perfection and you know it mouthwatering sauce the environment was like a real Italian place
5,"3/15/13
WOW! This place was INCREDIBLE.  Found about about Food Truck Friday from the internet while trying to find ""Things to do in Phoenix"" since we are from Seattle.  We had the Fried Catfish Jamburitto, one with oysters mixed in.  What a feast to look at, such a great presentation of a unique combination of food and flavors....then it was time to eat.  The flavors just exploded.  Yum yum.  

The cashier and chief had such a friendliness about them and it transfered into the atmosphere as folks waited patiently.  As we know, great food takes time.  

This food experinece makes me want to try more cajun food.  Thanks so much.  We're from Seattle, if you're ever up that way, we'll be sure to stop by.
Dennis and Rose"
5,"A really neat place to hang out with friends. Super cheap during happy hour, and still very reasonable when not. Lots of games to play. Both locations are recommended!"
5,I enjoy the whining pig great bar always seem to meet some cool folks every time I go..  lots of rare brews at a good price also so yeah check this place out if you haven't been
5,"My fav iced lattes (with coconut milk) in the city! 
When you're looking for a treat, the veggie hi-rise on their homemade biscuit is amazing. Only downside is they close so early."
5,"What an awesome place. Found this deal on travelzoo and jumped on it since we like to explore steakhouses in Vegas. Totally forgot  about it and the coupon expired. The GM * Steve was so nice he gave us a FIFTY PERCENT discount on our meal!!!! Awesome. 
The ambience was nice and cozy with dim lighting. Quite romantic. Our server was amazing too. I'd definitely go back."
5,One of my favorite pizza places. I always get a pepperoni and pineapple pizza with ranch on the side. It's awesome. Always friendly staff too!
5,Try the espresso martini! The food was great but that martini was to die for. The staff was absolutely cheery and helpful. It was worth the money and time.
5,"The best breakfast sandwich I have ever had! The entire time I was eating, I kept saying ""Oh my god..."" because it was so tasty. Having this place near my new apartment is dangerous!

The pancakes are also fantastic. Fresh, simple and delicious. They now serve the pancakes on weekdays as well."
5,"My wife and I had an excellent experience at Edge for our last night in Vegas. If you want to have one of the best meals of your life, this is your place. We were warmly greeted by the manager, Shaun. After settling in and looking over the menu, we decided to do the chef's tasting and it was amazing. Chef Steve came out and asked us about preferences and allergies. Our waiter, Bobby, and supporting staff were attentive to every detail.
 
We started the meal with two salads and beef tartare. The heirloom tomato salad was amazing. The burrata cheese and avocado played off the white balsamic marinated tomatoes perfectly. The baby beets salad was great and the pistachios added a nice twist. Now for my favorite dish, the wagyu beef tartare was perfection. Yes, perfection. It melted in your mouth and the caviar added a pleasant pop with each bite. Seriously, don't skip this. Our next course was the seared scallop. It was cooked on point and the chorizo topping added a nice different change from other seared scallop dishes that I've had.  For the main course, our steaks were prepared to our requested preferences. The side of short rib mac and cheese was incredible. It was very cheesy and had a good amount for meat. The pickled jalapeno added a nice touch of heat. For dessert, we had the crème brulee and raspberry cheesecake. The crème brulee was tabled flaming which always adds a nice presentation touch. Working in NYC, I've had a plenty of cheesecake and this one was phenomenal. Hats off to the pastry chef as they crushed it with this. The cake wasn't too heavy and the crust wasn't too crispy. The best part was the raspberry sauce and the freshness of the raspberries themselves. The berries tasted as if they were freshly picked before coming to the table. The sauce wasn't too sweet and had a nice tart. It was the perfect end to the meal.
 
Again if you want a top notch meal, come to Edge. The modern décor, comfortable atmosphere, attentive staff, and amazing food, you will not be disappointed. We can't wait to return during our next visit in Vegas."
5,"My wife and I came here for the John Dory fish and steak after reading the reviews. Did not disappoint. The reviews are right, was a great experience. Will be back."
5,Had a great experience here. Trish did a great job on nails and Tracy gave me a fabulous pedi.
5,"ok ok , i have to say the best taco's i'm sorry but i can eat this all day no joke add a coke to that please ;]"
5,"Great great find in the city. Some of the tastiest italian food in the city (pastas can not be rivaled by any other restaurant in the area) great food - good, but not superb staff, although their personalities make up for the potential tardiness on busy nights. 

If you are doing a group dinner - great place for well sized options, and portions, to order sides, and share, (except mains)  you will be stuffed, and price point is the icing on the cake as they are moderate (and a steal compared to the quality of the food you are getting!)

prepare for a noisy, cramped dining area though. Less so as the night progresses"
5,Love this food truck.  Had some burritos the morning (well ok it was almost afternoon) after a long night out with friends and it totally hit the spot.  The service was great and I even got to sample a hush puppy.  The quality of food was not what was expected from a food truck it easily could have been served in a four star restaurant.  The Cajun sauce was amazing and really brought the whole burrito together with a flavor explosion.
5,"There's not a Waffle House in our area. So I've been eyeing this one for a long time waiting for the right opportunity to check it out since I've always enjoyed the Waffle House in my travels to Atlanta. It so happens that they were paving our street and my wife and I had to get out of the house early a couple of weeks ago.

You seat yourself at the Waffle House and then the waitress comes over and takes your drink order. I also ordered the two waffle plate with water which came to $4.20 after tax. The waffles were excellent after coating them with soft butter and syrup. If I can editorilize a little bit here, this is soft butter, not the hard butter pellets that have been sitting in the freezer. It makes a big difference for me in enjoying the meal. You should never have to melt your own butter.

In conclusion, the food is affordable, tastes great and the service and A/C work just fine."
5,"This place is a very interesting spot that can be easily missed if your not paying attention. As soon as you walk in you'll notice a gigantic chalk board full of beer choices! Mind blown right off the bat!! This is a sanctuary for beer lovers or for those who want to explore the various types of beers. Be warned there are some extremely high alcohol content in some of these beers which makes it even more delightful. Further more, as you continue down the bar you'll notice their are games placed around the bar for your entertainment and pretty cool drawings on the other black boards around the bar. Overall my experience was really great here and I look forward to coming here again with my coworkers for happy hour.  Also you must try the meat and cheese platter which compliments the wine and beer that they serve here!!"
5,"Great  crafted drinks, friendly staff, awesome music! Beautifully located in the heart of the city... I stopped in for Happy Hour and will surely become a regular. Highly recommended."
5,"Fantastic!!! Refreshing to finally taste great pizza. It will be a regular when ever I come to PHX. I'm happy I didn't listen to some of the reviews.... They are so off! Really!!!! One of the comments was he was going to vomit. My pizza tonight was so fresh, hot and full of fantastic!!!"
5,If you like mediocre this is NOT the place for you. The whining pig is nestled under a stairwell off 2nd street like a modern day Harry Potter bar and this place is nothing short of magical. The staff of awesome and the beer selection is endless. I will definitely be back for a grilled cheese and a beer before the next game!
5,"Friendly and efficient service.  Chicken salad is great.. fresh, tasty and filling.  Love their salsa bar.  Nothing fancy, but much nicer thatn the always crowded and overpriced Chipoltle."
5,"Triangle Bar & Grill
Iconic place that everyone should experience. We have been purchasing these heavenly Battleship hoagies for years. It used to be a dirty bar that sits on the edge of Swissvale on Monongahela Avenue. For years I refused to go in alone. After years of improvements, I now have no issue going in an ordering a Battleship on my own. It's not the most attractive dining place in Pittsburgh, mostly take out, and we have never sat in, always take out.  I like watching them make the subs in front of you. I can tell them little or no dressing. I have found a new love, the Torpedo Roast Beef, Sheetz stopped offering roast beef subs, to my benefit, Triangle Bar's is so much better. They offer 4 sizes of great delicious hoagies. The Super Battleship which we have only had once, The Battleship is our favorite, The Destroyer which we have not tried yet, and my new personal favorite The Torpedo. They do offer other sandwiches as well.  Well worth checking out. For years one of our kids would have a friend that worked there, and I knew I would get a great sub, it was a bonus that we took advantage of. Sadly, no one we know is there any longer, BUT.. we always get a great sub!  After 30 + years we have not tried the cheesesteak, I am looking forward to trying one. This is a must experience for anyone living or visiting Pittsburgh. Highly Recommend."
5,"I came here cause the line at Matt's Big Breakfast was too long and I was not disappointed by Jamburritos! I got the super delicious veggie breakfast burrito. It had eggs, creole hash browns (hash browns made with homemade creole sauce, it was yummy and flavorful), black bean salsa and Monterey Jack cheese wrapped in a tortilla. I got mild sauce with mine and it even came with a lollipop. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Phoenix."
5,"I love this place!! I've been coming here for a few months now and I've never had a bad experience... Dan the owner and his wife are always so friendly and professional! Trish is the best!!! I had my gel manicure and pedicure done by her and I'm obsessed! Also love how they're open late so it makes it easier for my schedule. Everything always smells and seems clean, also it's beautiful in there! BEST NAIL SPA IN VEGAS!"
5,"I order pizza and wings here normally on Mondays. It's just my Monday thing. I really should start cooking more, but you know how it goes. You get home from work, you suffered all day from the Mondays. The last thing you want to do is cook. I always call in our order and just swing by and pick it up. The Barro's Special is really really good. I'd say that's my favorite, but my kids don't like all that extra jazz, so for them, I just order the pepperoni. Do yourself a favor and not cook. Just call them and pick up a pizza. If that's too much, they deliver too!"
5,"Great rib eye steaks,soft as butter,cooked perfectly. The beet salad was excellent   Also the creme brûlée.  As good or better than any steakhouse on the strip. Very under appreciated.   Highly recommend you give them a try."
5,Great place to go for happy hour. Don't expect an upscale trendy kind of place. 60 beers on tap every kind of drink special you could imagine and happy hour every day from 1 PM to 8 PM. Fantastic place to go and not spend half your month salary.
5,"Great food; our kids love the meatballs
Nice people; very hospital and friendly"
5,"I'm so glad that this little place is still open, considering so many good ones have closed. Have eaten here for the last 5 years or so. 

Personally, I only recommend the spicy Tofu Pad Thai (and vegetarian egg rolls). Years ago, when I tried a chicken dish, I really did not like the chicken (although my friends did). 
It isn't the most amazing pad thai I have ever had in my life, but whenever I get a craving for it, this is where I go (always take-out). Reliable, not absurdly priced, and friendly owners. Recommend."
5,"All that is greasy and fantastic about poutine. 

I came here late on a Friday night with some friends from good ole Saskatchewan, thinking I'd treat them to some of the finer things in the place we call Calgary. Well folks, treat them I did. 

Three of us split the regular large poutine, and it was everything we were hoping for. Nice crunchy fries, big chunks of cheese, and delicious hot gravy. 

Way to go Big Cheese! You've created some future repeat customers. I'll be back."
5,We never watch a game or have a party without a Battleship hoagie!!!! Always a crowd favorite!!
5,"Super authentic red beans and rice with andouille sausage. It made me feel like I was walking the streets of New Orleans. Super delicious, highly recommended."
5,"New downtown staple. 

Happy hour 1-8pm, 7 days a week? Yes please. 

Cheap food, cheap drinks, bar games, chalkboard drawings. What's not to like about this place?"
5,"We were going to see a show & chose The Edge Steakhouse after looking at reviews on Yelp.  It is a hidden gem and was absolutely fantastic!! We had the beet salad, scallops, heirloom tomato salad, and 10 oz filet....it was all delicious!!! Our waiter was Ryan and he was excellent too. Everything from the food, atmosphere, and service was great!  As locals, we usually stay away from the strip, but we will be returning to the Edge again :)"
5,"Outstanding food and service! The best steak I've had in years. Right away we were given the friendliest greeting and best service. The salads and sides were all excellent. The corn trio was really great. Again, we are from the Midwest and can have a great streak whenever we want. This petite filet we had here was superb."
5,"I want to retract a comment I had made about the Grand Opening Event. I had made a comment while sitting in Walmart parking lot, that I didn't see the Food Truck when I got to the location in Peoria.
However after leaving Walmart heading to back to 83rd Ave on Peoria I looked to my right and there is when I saw the Food Truck in a dark parking lot Strip Mall. 
I went a purchase the Fried Fish and Jambalaya bowls. Which was very delicious and I will go back again."
5,"Love the Waffle House!  Scrambled eggs with cheese and chocolate chip waffles were excellent.  Had the same waiter twice (Jeremiah, I believe) and it was very evident that he's got a lot of enthusiasm for his job.  Hard to have a bad day after being waited on by him!"
5,"My friend lives in this area and was over joyed there's a place for coffee in his hood other than a Coffee Time or the coffee machine at the laundromat. The down side seems to be this place closes early during the week. 

The crap hours aside, the place is mega cute inside. Very cow-themed. Reasonable prices. $1 for a cookie, which might run you $3 at Starbucks. Even the bathrooms are cute.

Lots of seating. Not sure if they have free wireless which might be the reason there was lots of seating. 

I love they keep out a jug of water with some orange slices in it. Amazingly tasty and refreshing. I wish Starbucks/Second Cup would do this. It would make summers a lot more pleasant."
5,"Why do I love The Whining Pig? Let me count thy ways....

1) Happy Hour everyday 1 - 8 pm 

2) ~38 beers on tap and over 100 bottles available 

3) A plethora of wine varieties 

4) Five different varieties of grilled cheese and a delicious meat & cheese platter

5) Games galore! 

You really can't go wrong with this cozy hangout spot!"
5,"I've been coming to get hoagies here for the past 5 years. They are amazing. Sometimes they get a lil heavy handed with the oil and vinegar, but a quick ""hey go light on that"" has always worked. You can't go wrong with a battleship or if you are really feeling it, a Super Battleship. I always order the the Battleship for myself and it ends up being 2 meals.

This is not a place really where you order and sit down to get your grub on. You're best ordering it to go. Don't forget to get a Turner's Tea while you're there too!"
5,"T. IS A.M.A.Z.I.N.G
My new favorite! CUSTOMER FIRST IS THEIR MOTTO! They stayed open later to service all my needs and I did not feel rushed at all. She was a breath of fresh air...."
5,"I am fairly new in town and I have tried numerous nail salons to find someone that gives a great pedicure, but I haven't had much luck...until yesterday.  I checked out Yelp to get some recommendations and decided to give Trish at MD Nail Spa a try.  I was greeted by a friendly receptionist, as well as Trish, was offered a beverage and was promptly taken back to the pedicure room, which was not only clean and beautiful, but also very tranquil and relaxing.  Trish immediately placed a warm pillow around my neck and the pedicure that followed was absolutely amazing.  She was very meticulous and was always checking to make sure that I was comfortable and happy with her work.  The massage part of the pedicure was AMAZING and the hot stones were an unbelievable finishing touch to an absolutely perfect pedicure!!  The manicure that followed was equally enjoyable and well done.  I am so thankful that I have finally found a place that gives their clients the exceptional service that they deserve!!  Thank you, Trish!!  :o)"
5,"Great atmosphere! Awesome beer selection! Killer grilled cheese! I got the star grilled cheese and the Pizza Amber, both were delicious! They also have a lot of games you can play while you're there."
5,Definitely my go to Asian cuisine spot for quick and easy and delicious dining! And they have an amazing lunch special menu!
5,"This place is great. Someone recommended it to me and I'm so glad I went. Other than the fact I waited for a long time (my choice), it was totally worth the wait. 

The salon is so cute and clean and modern. Smells really good with diffusers and a really comfy little sitting/ waiting area. They have a great selection of new and regular polishes (all OPI) as well as a ton of gel colors. 

They have two rooms- one for manicures and facials/ waxing... and one for pedicures. The vibe is really mellow with relaxing music. They did a great job with my pedicure! And I was told that on Wednesdays and Sundays, if you get a gel manicure you get a pedicure for free before 430 pm (I think). 

I keep trying new places in Vegas to try to find a regular spot but I think I found it. Especially for $22."
5,"Waffle Houses are bomb but this one is my favorite.  Not only is it 24 hours but it is super clean and well lit.  There are totally some seedy people who go here but their conversations just make for very interesting background noise.  

As far as the food, the prices are cheap, the menu is semi-a-la-carte and the the waffles are amazingly crisp and perfect.  This is THE Waffle House to visit.  Go now, do it.  How good does a waffle sound right now anyways?  That's right, Pretty Damn Good."
5,"We actually booked a room here the day of because we wanted a hotel closer to the airport so we kind of got the room for a steal at $50 with a few Hilton Points.  The outside might not be super impressive to look at, but the inside was beautiful (as per usual for the embassy suites).  The lobby has a huge atrium with a fountain and nice meeting area. We stayed on the top floor and our room was really nice! I like the quality details like having a sink in the bedroom area and living room furniture was really comfortable.
 
The manager's special is always a nice touch that Embassy offers (though I haven't been to many that limit your drinks with tickets).  The breakfast was great with tons of options, fresh from the grill or the quick buffet line.  The kitchen ladies were super nice and cheerful.  We didn't eat at the restaurant located in the hotel, but it looked tasty and its a good option for travelers who don't want to go far but also don't want fast food."
5,"Was here twice in their first week of opening because of the Sporting Life 10k - once for a banh mi sandwich after I picked up my race kit, and once for a huge cheat meal post race.

Banh Mi Boys is a Toronto institution, so I won't go into details about what it is. This is simply a quick review for their newest location just north of Yonge and Eglinton, which opened on May 2nd.

You can tell the restaurant is new - everything is spotless. It's your typical food counter experience, just like other Banh Mi Boys locations.

In my two visits, I had the duck confit banh mi, five spice pork belly banh mi, fried chicken steamed bao, and the kimchi fries.

The duck confit is still my favourite banh mi from them, ringing in at $7.50 pretax. There is an ample amount of meat and the flavour of it is just out of this world. Kimchi fries are a must on each visit as well - however I would definitely recommend sharing it as the portion size is quite large."
5,"Located in the Westgate Las Vegas Hotel, we were able to get in quickly with a party of 4 & no reservations on a busy Friday night.  Service was great, food was fantastic, prices were a bit steep!"
5,Just moved her from CA and have been looking for a good pizza so checked Yelp and decided to give Barros pizza a try and man am I so glad we did loved loved loved it  sad I only ordered  a small. The crust was thick and soft lots of cheese just like I like it. We had it delivered arrived in the time frame they said. Easy on line ordering. The delivery girl I wish I got her name was so polite and sweet. We will now be regular customers.  Thank you
5,"I've been coming here for many years and i have to say, the place is always a hit for me. It's just one of those restaurants i know i can rely on for a good meal and a nice night out. The menu is great - the food is heart felt - the service is personal - rossa is always there. On the first monday of every month, she even does a cooking class. 

Compared to the danforth location that her sons run, this location is less 'party' and more family."
5,"This place is outstanding! Everything tastes amazing and fresh! Had been to their original downtown location many times and usually you don't expect it to be as good. But let me tell you, far exceeded my expectation! We are making this place a regular weekly spot! :)"
5,"Wow!!  I've been to restaurants all over the world, and Edge is truly at the top of the list!  Steve Young is an amazing chef! Scallops and the Wagyu beef were some of the best I've ever had! I would absolutely recommend Edge Steakhouse!"
5,"We've loved this place for years!  The food is amazing, the chef/owner is super warm and friendly, the staff are wonderful with great warmth and humour. This place is a solid 10/10!!"
5,"This is my favorite place to hang out and grab a beer. Amazing happy hour and awesome bartenders! We always have have a great time when we come here and the rotating beer taps are incredible. I was lucky enough to have Dogfish 120 minute IPA on my last visit - a rare and delicious treat. 

If you're going to a ballgame, concert downtown, or just looking for a good place to grab an lunch beer - The Whining Pig is your spot"
5,Best Italian hoagies in Pittsburgh!! The bread is extremely fresh and prices are great! Been going here for years.
5,"Wow!!  I've been to restaurants all over the world, and Edge is truly at the top of the list!  Steve Young is an amazing chef! Scallops and the Wagyu beef were some of the best I've ever had! I would absolutely recommend Edge Steakhouse!"
5,"Wow, didn't see this one coming. Rolled in @ 930 at the Westgate Hotel in Vegas.  Where? That's what I said too. Blew the roof off. Hands down best Salmon dish I have had.  Swapped out the quinoa side with the garlic mashed puree and sealed a 5 star. Probably won't be back because it's in the Westgate unless it I'm back at the convention center."
5,"What happened? Ever since the move it's been downhill. 1 girl working the register., and 1 cook in back. They have a line out the door, but severly understaffed to handle it. The pizza is still good, but good luck finding a clean table to eat it on."
5,"great food, great coffee. They also just started doing trivia and games nights. So happy to have such a cool place in my neighbourhood."
5,"If you like delicious food, then more delicious food packed into convenient burrito packaging, you love Jamburritos. The blackened catfish burrito [and all the catfish] is ridiculously great. 2 grown adults can easily fatface on a single burrito. K-Sadillas are fantastic as well. If you haven't tried this food truck, do not hesitate, the hype is 100% warranted!"
5,"This place has become, in the last while, our group of friends' favourite eatery to frequent. The service is great and the food is to die for! The specialty poutines are delicious and with over 100 wing flavours there is so much to choose from! I usually get the Wing Platter where you get 20 wings and get to choose 4 different flavours at 5 wings a flavour.

The atmosphere is fantastic especially on a Leaf night or a UFC night, the energy in the massive bar area is just electric. The only downside is once the game or fight is over the DJ begins the music and it's usually just a bit too loud, almost like you're in a club.

There are tons of pool tables and a bunch of different arcade games to be played on by your kids or even for you and your date. Overall this place is a must try!!"
5,"This small, sexy Italian bistro is simply FABULOUS. Mama Rosa mans the kitchen nightly, and her staple creations are pretty much all winners. You can't go wrong.

Choose from small dishes handwritten on the chalkboards, many of which you can always get and other selections rotate. My favourites: to start, shrimp with spicy mashed pee puree, grilled sardines with tomato salsa (THE BEST sardines ever), burrata cheese (silky mozarella-style cheese that's big enough to share). Pasta/lasagnas are authentic Italian and awesome. Personally, I like to get a side of rapini but they also have other veg selections. For mains, the ""sexy duck leg"" is drool-worthy, so good; the osso bucco is sensational, probably the best version of this dish that I've ever had; and the meatballs are dynamite.

Wine list/cocktails (use the ipad to make your selection) and desserts...all are always excellent.

I'm a regular here, and the food is consistent! Mama Rosa even travels back to Italy every once in awhile and comes home to Toronto with a new signature recipe.

Great atmosphere, though it can get a bit loud, but who cares--they play great music. And what really takes this place to the next level is the SERVICE....amazing!!! If you get Jordan, Tzedenko (not sure of the spelling), or the guy with glasses as your waiter (I forget his name but he's also a doll) they treat you like family. 5 stars baby!"
5,"You've seen the sign, you've peeked through the window. You've asked time and time again ""When is the Big Cheese going to open?"" Well my friends, I have an answer for you. Today! And it's a hot little spot. 

It's in the same place as the old Nellie's, so be prepared for limited seating. 9 tables in all, it's a cozy wait when it's busy. But turnover seems pretty fast so far, so your wait shouldn't be too long!

Sporting a menu of 21 different kinds of poutine, these cheesy dishes of potato gravy goodness fall into 5 different categories-traditional, chicken, pork, beef, vegetarian and the all custom built! Oh, but which to try first? My eyes skim the menu like an excited mouse in a cheese pantry.

After much deliberation, I decide on the Notorious P.I.G. (Carolina pulled pork, double smoked bacon and Italian sausage), although after pigging out on poutine during yesterday's Poutine Crawl, I opt for the smaller $7.99 portion. Good choice, Wendy, good choice. It comes in a takeout box. And it's a large portion on its own. Smothered in gravy, cheese curds and with pockets of spice. 

Other items that caught my eye?

Scottish Curry - shaved grilled chicken breast and our own authentic Scottish curry sauce
Donair - authentically seasoned beef and caramelized onions
Veggie Nacho - salsa, sour cream, guacamole and jalapeno peppers

Now... if only there were a poutine platter!

5,"Stopped in for a drink with 2 friends after the Suns game last Saturday and I LOVE this place! Kind of neighborhood feel with a little hipster. At least 5 boards filled with drinks they offer; IPAs, brown bags, wines, mystery wines, mules, etc.. LOVE the games around the bar-Nice touch! LOVED the MUSIC! Will be back! If you blink, you'll miss it, but I love this type of place in the neighborhood! Bravo!"
5,"Edge is by far the best steakhouse I've ever been to. The filet minion was the most tender and delicious piece of meat you can imagine. All of the food was superb. Our waiter, Angel, was an absolute sweetheart, and is very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. He even drew a cow's rear for me to explain exactly where a filet minion comes from. I made a joke, telling him that our table is the only table without a red rose deco on it. He laughed and disappeared only to come back a minute later with a real gorgeous white rose for me to keep. Such a sweet gesture. Ana, the general manager is also incredibly nice. Very helpful and sweet. All around a phenomenal experience. Definitely recommend Edge to everyone!"
5,"Great corned beef hoagie...
The Torpedo was more than enough for lunch.
I will definitely visit again."
5,"I had gone on a recommendation from a friend and was pleasantly surprised.  We had a very nice experience, great service and great food!  We started with drinks, complimentary rolls with butter, and then my 7 oz filet arrived with King Crab Oscar on the side.  The filet mignon was sooooooo tender and was perfect with a great blend of seasoning.  The King Crab Oscar was not lacking - huge pieces of king crab, asparagus and bearnaise sauce - just enough to be the perfect accompaniment to the 7 oz filet.  I was pleasantly full and passed on dessert."
5,"I am truly impressed. We usually never go out for Italian food, because most places don't go beyond pizza and pasta. And why go out for food you can make from home? 

So after hearing the hype, we had to try it. Remember to make reservations! It was packed to the brim. And worth the wait. 

Our group all ordered the family meal for $28 each. At first we were afraid it wouldn't be enough food... I was so wrong! They brought everything that was currently under the Primi and Pasta section to our table. And all of it was wonderful. Lush and simple flavors. My fave was the veal lasagna. And then each person got to order a main dish. Upon my pleasant experience with the lasagna, I ordered the veal meatballs. Wow. To die for. Lovely and light seasoned veal with a heart of Parmesan cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

Maybe not a good first date place because it's hard to hear each other talk, but definitely has good mood lighting."
5,"After my review update, the owner messaged me and wanted to know what it would take to make me happy. I wanted my nail repaired but by the time I could get in the nail had broken off, so there was nothing for them to repair. Within a day or two I had another nail crack and another nail chip. So in all I had 2 chipped thumbs, a chip index finger, and a cracked pinky. I let Dan know of the situation and I asked if he could fix the cracked nail at no cost. He fixed the cracked nail and he also repainted all my other nails and filed them so that the chips weren't so noticeable. The service with Dan was amazing and just for that reason I will give them another try. 

Of course I won't go Back to the lady that did my nails the 1st time period"
5,"This place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. If you like craft beer and want to try something new and exciting this is the place to go!! Great atmosphere and so close to all the cool spots downtown. Lots of room and fun games as well. Staff is friendly and will help you pick out something right for you, always a good crowd too. It's a must visit for sure if you're in downtown Phoenix!!"
5,"Love this place. Have always had tremendous service while enjoying a fantastic meal. I have had the Texan burger, Apple Walnut salad, French onion soup, lounge fries, the nachos, Turkey bacon Swiss pretzel sandwich and the Cajun chicken pasta which is by far my favorite, but they are all excellent choices at a fair price. The portions are huge and you will most likely have leftovers. Parking lot is huge and there are plenty of spaces. Tv's are throughout the restaurant and have a variety of different games on."
5,"The family and I love this place. The pizza is fantastic, they load on the toppings. Definitely try the Chicken Supreme. You won't be disappointed.  

My kids really enjoy playing and eating in the kids area and devour the pizza. 

The price is very reasonable and even more so when considering all the food you get. I highly recommend Barro's Pizza."
5,"What a spot. These guys were what the Beach Boys were talking about when they wrote Good Vibrations. 
Happy hour til 8pm? Vibes fer days
Rich, decadent wooden tables? Vibez for days
Great brown bag deals? Vibes for daze
All the games? Vybes for days
Rustic mellow lighting? Vibes 4 days
Mead? Vibes fur days
Drink menu that is stacks on stacks on stacks? Vibez for days
Grilled goat cheese and fig spread sandwich? Vibes for dayz

Vibes vibes vibes"
5,First of all the waffles are warm and soft and the bisquets are so good. You put honey or jam on the bisquets and ut melts in your house. They sure know how to make any egg dish you want. And the coffee is great. So stop by at a waffle house
5,"Great selection of beer and wine, can't beat the happy hour 1:00 to 8:00 every day. Definitely a must go before or after any sporting event downtown. Staff is fast, friendly and knowledgeable. Awesome atmosphere."
5,"A lovely local cafe with excellent brunch options and delicious coffee (pilot roasters). The food is simple, quality ingredients within a friendly and warm setting. For brunch, I try to get there early before it's too busy on weekends. A note for vegetarians - don't be deterred by the menu -  they are always great about swapping meat with veggie options! Most things can be made veg friendly (as well their veggie breakfast sandwich is delicious!)."
5,"If you see this truck in town you need to run it down and experience this wonderful cajun goodness that is run and owned by Chef Brown. If you have trouble finding this truck around town, you'll have no trouble finding it at Food Truck Fridays. (Additional Info. below).

Chef Brown's truck is infamous for its legendary Jamburrito. Legend has it that the Jamburrrito is  jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla. Intrigued by what I had heard about this Southwest Cajun Fusion, I had to experience it for myself, and I took my husband along for the ride. Just like Indiana Jones looking for the lost ark, we journeyed downtown to Food Truck Fridays on a quest for the Jamburrito.

We discovered the Jamburrito three Fridays ago, and have returned often.The truck serves up food that is fresh, addictive, top quality, reasonably priced, and packed with a lot of punch. You're left full and satisfied because of the cajun flavors and portions. I can see why this truck was given high marks in AZ, and was almost selected for the Great Food Truck Race on the Food Network!!

Recommendations: 

CHICKEN or GRILLED CATFISH JAMBURRITO
We usually order the chicken or grilled catfish jamburrito and some hushpuppies. Oh my gosh!! Heaven in our mouths. One of the things I am particular about are tortillas, and the tortillas Chef Brown uses are spot on. While eating the Jamburrito I felt like I had one foot in New Orleans, and the other in Texas. 

BELGIAN WAFFLES AND BUFFALO WINGS
This order includes one waffle, three buffalo wings, and some hushpuppies with dipping sauce. Best waffle and wings ever!!!! The waffle is crisp and is dusted with bacon and powdered sugar that can be dipped in syrup. Yummy!!!! The wings don't look like your typical wing. They look like mini lamb chops with a little bone sticking out. The wings are meaty, juicy, and have a crispy skin. The wings are placed in a rubb and sauce. Amazing!!! Oh my gosh!!!! My mouth is watering while I type this up.

Stop reading...go and visit..and tell him that Tenisha says hi!!!


Additional Info:
The truck is a part of a food truck coalition that can be found  in the Phoenix Public Market Parking Lot on Fridays from 11am-1:30pm and Saturdays from 8am-Noon.

5,"Took my son there for his 17th birthday and it was great dining experience. For a high end steakhouse it wasn't as expensive or crowded as others I've been to in Vegas. I suppose being in a value hotel/casino like The Westgate hurts some of it cache, but make no mistake it's as good as any steakhouse anywhere.

The service was exceptional and our waiter Bobby was informative and made sure we had a great meal and time. Our steaks were perfect and the sides were awesome. I'd highly recommend trying the bone marrow flat bread and the lava cake dessert."
5,Absolutely sensational tasting food from some of the nicest folks around. LOVE the hush puppies! A must try; look 'em up...
5,Great Spicy flavoring - and it had a kick with tremendous flavor.  Was a good amount of food for the price.    Fulfilled my Cinco de Mayo craving!  Give them a try!  The tacos looked great so I will have to catch them next time for a taco!
5,Very efficient and friendly service! Banh Mi Boys never disappoints. I find them perfect for lunch time. I paired grilled chicken Banh Mi with sweet potato fries and it was perfect. I'll usually get the kimchi fries if I'm with a friend because the portion is too big for one. A bonus for this time's visit: I was short on time and wanted to run to Starbucks across the street. Starbucks took longer than usual and when I came back the cashier actually remembered by name. She called out my name as I rushed by her and gave me my order. Awesome service!
5,Jade Moore is such a delight every time I go. Which is often. I look forward to seeing her because she always cheers me up after a long day.  The food is great and so are the new milkshakes.  The store is clean which is great since I have a cleaning business so I know!!Lol. She always asks if I want a drink which brings up sales I'm sure.  Keep up the great work and I look forward to eating there again as I always do! Steve from #getalifecleanerinc.
5,This is the only place I go to get my nails and feet done cause they're so amazing I love how trish and jimmy make sure that I'm satisfied with my service. They're gentle and takes there time and not just try to hurry to finish. I 10/10 recommend this place plus the interior is so pretty
5,Excel customer service. As soon as I came through the door I was greeted and seated for my services. #happycustomer
5,"Unbelievable service, coffee was velvety and incredible and the breakfast sandwiches are some of the best in the city. The biscuit one is HUGE.... but it is really really good. Come hungry!"
5,"I rarely give restaurants 5 stars, but this place was on point. Easily my new favourite breakfast spot! I ordered a bunch of items on the menu & everything was delicious.  

Pancakes: OMG so fluffy! I haven't had good pancakes like this in a while. 

""Son of a Rise"" brekkie sandwich: I ordered this because it was rated # 1 breakfast sandwich in Toronto. So yummy! I could eat this for breakfast everyday. Fresh ingredients on top of a mouth-watering buttery biscuit. 

Curry Ginger Carrot Soup: Amazing! The flavor was on point & served with fresh bread.

They also had a bunch of fresh baked goods that looked really good, but I was too full to try anything else that day. Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!"
5,THE PEOPLE HERE ARE AMAZING! I had to come here on business for 40+days and have nothing but amazing reviews! Desiree and Priscilla  at the bar are by far the best. The joke  and make you feel right at home!!! Happy hour is a must here. Wanda at the omelette bar is by far the kindest person I've come across!!! Amazing experience all around. Very glad my company chose this place for our home away from home! Ps. Tip well. They work very hard!!
5,Got a meatball hoagie today. It was delicious. The meatballs are huge and juicy!  Would order again.
5,"What a wonderful dining experience! It is truly one of the original classic steak houses left in town. It is impressive as hell when almost everybody that is working the room will come by and check on your table. Not in an annoying fashion, but in a wonderful service fashion.  You just really don't get that anymore. Aside from the fabulous service, the food was excellent. We enjoyed a spicy shrimp and a pea ravioli stuffed with prosciutto and cheese to start. We split their classic steakhouse chopped salad.  We enjoyed the Harris Ranch filet and bone in ribeye. Our side dishes included the heavenly truffle mac & cheese and some sautéed mushrooms.   We finished with a piece of chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream on the side. The wine by the glass is reasonably priced and has a great variety to choose from. I cannot wait to go back!"
5,"Rosie and family provide one of the best Italian dining experiences in Toronto. Don't miss the calamari, veal sausage and lamb shank. Terrific service, food and ambiance are why this restaurant remains one of the most popular in the Eglinton strip."
5,I don't usually stop at food trucks but this isn't your Grandma's food truck! This is a fusion of Cajun and Mexican which makes for a unique blend of flavors just waiting to tickle your tastebuds. I enjoyed the Carne Asada K-tacos which are like street tacos. You have your choice of spiciness and I took mine hot which was just right. The Cajun chips were excellent. The location of the truck in a deserted strip mall off of 83rd Avenue and Peoria near Grand Avenue in downtown Peoria allows plenty of free parking and there are a few tables setup if you'd like to enjoy your meal while it's fresh and hot. Highly recommend checking them out. You won't be disappointed.
5,We split the dry aged ribeye with the chopped salad and potatoes. For dessert we had the creme brûlée.  Everything was excellent!
5,"Not sure as to why there are bad reviews, but also haven't been here long enough  to know what real poutine should be like. I am just glad I found vegan poutine! There are also a couple vegetarian options.Decent price for the amount of food."
5,Finally a place that knows how too do a pedicure!!!!! This place is amazing!!!! Very nice clean friendly!! Best pedicure I have had since in Las Vegas. Been here 20 years!!!!! Thank you so much!!!! This my go too place from now on.
5,Best place hands down. Even if it wasn't close to my home I would drive 45 min to get here. Great service. Clean place great decor all staff is friendly. Julie by far does the best pedicures!!!! I will not go anywhere else. It's only taken me 20 years to find a great nail salon!!!
5,"I have written before to say that Jimmy was fantastic with nails. As I get to know this wonderful place, I wanted to give Johnny a "" high 5"" for giving tha absolute best pedicure I have ever had!"
5,Wow Trent is amazing! He's probably the best bartender I've ever encountered. That is all.
5,"Mouthgasmic. I fell in love and I want to tell the world!

Stopped by for a quick bite and everyone was surprised to see that I've never had banh mi boys before. I've heard great things and bad things about banh mi boys (mostly bad things from my viet gang telling me it's not even close to real banh mi) 

The line was a bit long but it moved quickly and there was a large space to wait for your food. There are tons of options and even for vegetarians/vegans...YASSS!!! I got the tofu banh mi and it was so flavourful, my tastebuds went for their own trip. The tofu didn't even taste like tofu, the mushroom sauce and lemongrass flavour made it soo delish. Also got the tofu kimchi fries and HOLY SHIIIIIZZZZZNIZZLES.. I think I passed out and came back alive. Fries didn't feel soggy from the kimchi, and the tofu slices were huge. Did I mention, I fucking love tofu? Oh man, the flavours made me want to commit sins. 

110% am going to return to banh mi boys. No doubt."
5,"I've been a number of times since opening day, and the quality of the experience remains consistently high. The food, locally sourced and carefully prepared, is delicious, and Dawn, the owner, is always friendly and accommodating. A five-star cafe, if there ever was one."
5,"As I do whenever I review a sub shop, I must state that I'm from DE, and have high standards for subs.  After trying a battleship sub this weekend, I can say without reservation that the subs here are the best in PGH, without a doubt.  If you haven't tried one, you need to ASAP!

Given that I've been wanting to try a battleship for a long while, a friend and I decided to pick one up and have a picnic in nearby Frick Park.  We called in our order, and they gave us an estimate of about 45 min., which worked well given that we had other errands to run.  By the time we arrived at Triangle, our battleship was ready, so we were able to cut in line, pay ($14.75), and be off to have our picnic.

Unwrapping the sub, it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26"" of goodness.  Since it wasn't pre-cut, I tore it in half crosswise, which gave each of us 14"" to chow down on. The sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses, with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables.  The bread was substantial and of good quality, and didn't tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub, as lesser quality bread does.  I ate half of my portion, and my friend was unable to finish his, despite intending to do so.  I ate the other half for lunch the next day, and it was almost just as good as it was upon receipt.

Both my friend and I were very impressed with the quality of the battleship, and it kept us full for a subsequent long-ish walk in the park.  I'd highly recommend it as an ideal picnic item.  Whether you live near Swissvale or not, be sure to try a battleship, since it's without a doubt the best sub in PGH!"
5,Absolutely CAN NOT GO WRONG with a Triangle Battleship.  All our friends call each other if we are going to be anywhere near Triangle Subs so we can all place orders and enjoy the tasty goodness.  Have NEVER had a bad sub
5,Johnny is the best! I've been to many different nail salons and I've never had a technician who pays such close attention to detail and cares for each client. I only pick OPI for my gel polish and they last more than 2 weeks without any chips or lifting. Love MD nail spa so much.
5,"I am a chef by trade, and cook most of my family's meals, and often have a hard time eating out.  A common joke that my wife and I share when we go out for a special high-end dinner is what appetizers will I prepare at home before we leave just in case we are disappointed $100 later.  Well I was on a ""Daddy Daughter Date,"" with my 14 year old and wound up at this waffle house.  Needless to say I was skeptical, the place was virtually empty yet the server was friendly and the place was clean.  Looking at the menu I thought the prices were a bit high for a restaurant of this caliber, but I feel that any sub-par food is over priced.  My daughter, who would have rather been at McDonald's, ordered a plain cheeseburger ($3.25) without the hash browns (they don't serve FF), and I ordered something like a Philly steak melt ($7.65).  Initially I was looking at a sliced steak sandwich but when I asked the server if it was good she said yes but most people like the Philly steak melt better.  I appreciated that as I didn't feel like chewing too much--my teeth hurt.  I was still skeptical but I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the cook who came from outside the building to cook, but meticulously washed his hands first.  It told me that this man was serious about his craft.  Then a wonderful thing happened.  The cook felt that I would be missing out if I didn't have sautéed mushrooms on my sandwich and suggested it.  Yes, I said, yes. The food took a bit to get to us (about 10 mins), but even that was comforting, as I knew that much care was going into this preparation.  We got the food and to my amazement every morsel was magnificent.  I cleaned my plate.  Even my daughter denounced McDonald's as the king of the burger and asked when I will return with her.  ""Daddy Daughter Day,"" was a huge success and I believe in flavor outside of the home again."
5,Barron's never disappoints! My family and I love love love love the Barro's Special pizza. Always friendly faces in the Ahwatukee store. Our kids love the cheese sticks and it's always fun to have a little play area for them to stay occupied. Keep up the good work we'll keep coming back for pizza!!
5,"Wanted to try this place for awhile, its nice to see a place like this near Yonge & Eglington area. Good food, good prices and good selection. Definitely a place to try more than once."
5,OMFreakingGoodness!!! I was confused when I heard about this truck but I just got the catfish jamburrito and it is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!!! And he was super fast which I can appreciate since I only get 30 min for lunch... MUST have!!!
5,Me and my wife came here to celebrate her birthday and we loved it.  We decided to do the tasting menu and had our waiter Ryan pair wines for us.  Im so glad that i chose this place because i got to put our evening on cruise control and the edge staff took care of the rest.
5,"Place was awesome, and the staff she was great and the food came out quick and fast , food was yummy, so don't mine being back and do some shopping and eat some pizza after and wings too."
5,"Great overall experience, wonderful service, the steak was unbelievable that dried aged, and the Butter mashed potatoes were to die for!! Yum"
5,"What a cute, cozy, and delicious café! I stumbled upon this place on Yelp when another restaurant in the area had too large of a line on Good Friday. I am so impressed by this café! 

My group was a party of 4 and a baby. You seat yourself, place your order at the counter where you pick up your drinks and food it brought to your table when ready. The space is kid friendly with enough space to place a stroller, although tight, and there is a small play area for kids. 

I ordered the country spice sandwich with an egg on sourdough bread. Our group also got a tall stack of banana chocolate chip pancakes that we shared. Everything was delicious!! This café has an award for their sandwiches, and I can believe it. I will definitely be back!"
5,"Great place! Probably the best pedicure I have had in years! Nice, clean place. Pedicure and manicures are done in separate rooms. The pedicure is relaxing, the room quiet and soothing. Loved the neck wrap they gave you. Cat gives both wonderful manicures and pedicures. Highly recommend."
5,Jonny was great and did awesome on my mani/pedi and the massage was beyond amazing. My nails were so messed up and Jonny made them look great and gave me great tips on how to keep them looking good. I'll definitely be a repeat client! Jonny's attention to detail is amazing! He takes time and makes sure everything is perfect!! Thanks Jonny!! 4/4/18
5,"Great place to hang out and watch games. Booths have tv with the NFL ticket so you don't need bar space to catch the game you want to see. Wings are on the pricey side at $6.49 for 5 or $10.99 for 10, but this can be easily avoided by ordering the pizza (which is actually pretty good) and wings which comes with two decent sized one topping slices and 5 wings for $8.99.  Best homemade ranch dressing ever!  It's a really decent deal when combined with a $2.50 Coors light on NFL game day.  I also had the munchies platter for $12.99 which was probably almost enough for three people.  Is the food the best, probably not, but hey, it's a bar, they have the NFL ticket and cheap beer, so what more could I asked for beside some good old bar grub?  Looks like their sit down dinners are pretty decent too, but haven't had them yet.  Portion sizes are very favorable. Place is usually busy but it is big enough where space is not an issue. Oh, and FREE POPCORN at the Hostess stand.

Updated: I love this restaurant, why not give it five stars!  A few imperfections can't slight the fact that it is always a wonderful time."
5,"Great food, loved the catfish burrito, St Charles Jamburritos and Carne Asada K-tacos.  Hola Nola. Loved it!  I don't usually stop at food trucks but saw this one and was intrigued by the menu.  Nice people and great food. Doesn't get better than that."
5,"Affordable. Friendly staff. Clean venue. Good portion to price ratio. Yummy food. What more can you ask for?!? I will alwaysssss order thr kimchi fries when I'm here. When it comes to baos, I suggest you try the fried chicken one! Crispy, yet juicy. V large amount of chicken given too!"
5,"My friends have been telling me about MD for a while.. I finally came in and have absolutely loved it! The employees are very nice and friendly. Trish was great and did awesome on my mani/pedi and the massage was amazing. The place is clean and very relaxing. The chairs and decor are all very modern and new! The best part is that it's open late!! So when I want a pedi at 9pm on a Thursday night, I know I can get one (and a good one at that!) I'll definitely be a repeat client! Thanks Trish!!"
5,"I had foodies request that I try to check out Banh Mi Boys to do an updated visit and review, since I last said I went here before I started this account and hadn't written anything up.. But people wanted to know what I thought; I only remembered my last meal being way too dry at a different spot. While looking for lunch, realized there was a Banh Mi Boys near by and finally stopped in to try and order a Squid Banh Mi. My order not only came out quick and super huge (a lot bigger than I remembered), but steaming hot in a fresh, fluffy, soft bread with an incredibly juicy mix of medium Sriracha heat and mayo beneath the squid. This location served me the best banh mi I ever had, definitely blew my socks off today! 

Actually also got a drink, label said it was fruit punch but totally tasted like cream soda 100% hahaha luckily I didn't mind it either way, was a refreshing way to wash down the rest of the food. Today's food adventure was a success!"
5,"Amazing draft and bottle/can selection - so many gluten free ciders and a Pilsner (at least when I went) to choose from, it's wonderful for someone with celiac. The staff were also super nice."
5,"DISCLAIMER: This review has been a long time coming... 

I have nothing but positive things to say about The Whining Pig and this has EVERYTHING to do with Trenton. 

Since the first time I visited, Trenton has provided us with nothing but kindness, patience, superior knowledge, hospitality, & genuine great customer service. Thanks to him we discovered the ""Brown Bag Beer"" & ""Mystery Wine"" ongoing specials. Since we are adventurous and always looking to try something new and enjoy a refreshing experience this is ALWAYS a go-to spot in downtown Phoenix. Not only do we always know we'll get great drinks, but we also know that Trenton will take good care of us with no B.S. As soon as we walk in, we always make sure it is him behind the bar! 

Long story short... The Whining Pig management is so lucky to have Trenton be the face of their Downtown location. He is an exemplary employee and we can tell how much he loves this concept and working here!

You're awesome Trenton, we hope you see this!!

-Amanda & Brian"
5,"I love this place, it's my go-to when I'm in the area with friends. Service is always friendly and you get very good portions for what you pay. The wings have many great flavours, and I was surprised more than a few times at loving flavours that sounded super weird (parmesan garlic Dr Pepper? Yeah, sounds weird but it was amazing). If you go on their mailing list hey send you all kinds of coupons, even things like buy a lunch, get one free (during weekdays) or a free appetizer or dessert. The atmosphere and style is very cabiney/woodsy, but in a good way. I love the tables and even the game area. I recommend it to everyone."
5,"Oh my! What an excellent find on our trip here to TO. Our meals had lots of flavor - I mean lots. Incredibly flakey biscuits. Great coffee; delicious almond croissant. Friendly relaxed staff - and all provided a warm atmosphere with prompt service!! We just met the owner Dawn. She told us the tables come from reclaimed wood at her parents farm...the barn. Natural foods, ethically raised protein - def coming back next time we're in town. Highly recommended!!"
5,"My husband and I come here often.  We are not buffet lovers, but this place is the exception.  Great variety and food is always fresh.  Courteous staff.  I love their tasty crab rangoon and hot & sour soup for starters.  The teriyaki chicken is great also.  Tried the hot & spicy beef today and it definitely delivers!  I highly recommend this place for your enjoyment.  Any negative reports must be trolls working for the competition."
5,"My wife and I came across this place by accident one evening while exploring down town Calgary. 
We both love Poutine, so we went in.  We were expecting Poutine of course, but the range of option they had were amazing. 
They seem to have fun creating seasonal dishes and making them into amazing tasty good. 
One portion was more then enough to fill us both up.  
Will definitely be returning."
5,"By far, is one of my favorite places in Vegas. Ever since I discovered this gem, I have yet to make a trip to the 702 without paying a visit.  And like most great finds, it was discovered accidentally. 

The love affair began 3 years ago as my friends and I left Light (now known as The Bank), in the Bellagio hotel, because it was too crowded. We stumbled upon this great, little place that played amazing music (no house music - yes!), a great crowd (good-looking professionals that don't pull on your arm to talk to you - yes, yes!), and no cover charge or lines to get in (JACKPOT!).  Upon sitting down inside, I turned and notice I was sitting right next to a very-famous MLB athlete. His party had the drinks and champagne flowing all night for our whole section. Needless to say, it was a night to remember.

For those who prefer to stay away from the large, crowded clubs of Vegas - yet would still like to get your dance, conversation, & drink on - Caramel is the place for you. Drinks are strong and tasty  - a bit pricey for some people, but, in actuality, average prices for Vegas.  Staff includes doormen, servers, and bartenders that hustle to make sure you're satisfied. Ladies, there is enough space for dancing so that you don't have to get elbowed or felt-up by some questionable men. Gentlemen, there is plenty of seating available, and - shocking - you don't need the scam that is bottle service to actually sit down. Couples, the ambiance at Caramel is sexy and classy...perfect for canoodling - anything more and you'll need to take it to the 5-star rooms down the hall."
5,"Since the management change, this car wash has done an excellent job at keeping my vehicle in TIP TOP shape :)  They're great and have the latest technology.  Very great management team and great prices!"
5,"Went here on Saturday night and had maybe the best lasagna of my life!!!  I have honestly been dreaming of it ever since and plan to return very soon. You can tell the pasta is homemade and it had big, real chunks of ground beef in a delicious tomato sauce.  AMAZING!!!"
5,"I. AM. A. CONVERT.

I used to go to Elaine Nails but wanted to try another late night nail salon and since MD Nails was just around the corner, I decided to try it. BEST DECISION EVER. 

The spa was very clean and peaceful. I didn't feel rushed at all.

I had Tracy and she is a savior. I had 2 broken nails, one that you could just cut off and another one that was super far up that it would cause my nails to bleed if I did it myself. She loved the hardness and length of my nails so she used this cool cloth thing that held both of my broken nails together so I can continue to grow my nails all at the same time and at the same length. She also saw me struggle while i was trying to talk on the phone and get my nails done so she gave me earphones to use so I wouldn't struggle anymore. Its the little things that count and she definitely took care of me. She was very attentive with the specific color I wanted and she found a way to make it happen. I had an alternative color picked out if i couldn't find my color but she found a color and made it work for me. Shes amazing. Love Tracy. Will be coming here more often!"
5,Awesome food. Don't be fooled by the exterior of The Westgate. Great restaurant and service. Takes me back to the good old days when the customer was #1.
5,"Great place been going here for years. The Pizza, French onion soup, Cajun pasta, burgers, the list goes on have all been good. Whenever there was a probably they've always took car of it. Can really busy during games."
5,"I find it hard to believe that a place like Triangle Bar and Grill only has 8 reviews.  I guess it's just not hipster enough for some people.  Which is fine with me.  I love walking in to this place.  It's never really crowded when I stop by on any given afternoon but they certainly have a steady stream of customers coming in for delicious sandwiches.  The crew behind the counter always greet me with a smile and are happy to make me a sandwich.  I have to admit that despite their many options, I've only tried the Super Battleship, a 2 foot Italian sub.  At only $14, it's quite a deal and great for parties.  It's packed with fresh meats and cheeses, lettuce, onion, tomato and sprinkled with oil and vinegar and oregano.  Some might say it's the perfect sandwich.  It's definitely remained one of my favorites."
5,"We really enjoyed our stay. The room was very clean, bed was amazing and soft. The room conveniently divides into a sitting area and bedroom with close able door, perfect for a family or multiple occupancy. We do recommend ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The atrium style lobby sometimes gets loud and you can hear it from the sitting area of the room if close enough. 
Avery at the front desk was super friendly and welcoming. We used the free shuttle, which ran up to 11pm, to go to a nearby event. Our driver was Jeff, he was very kind and friendly. The breakfast was among the best I've had at a hotel! A made to order station along with a continental style with huge variety. We would most definitely come back."
5,"I had a Groupon for a mini detail ($59). Didn't read any reviews but, my personal opinion is I got excellent service. The front counter people were polite and kept me informed of the status. I wanted them to concentrate on the carpets and seats - thanks to the grandkids- which they did. They also did a car wash and I was pleasantly surprised. Then I come home to write a review and what's going on??!! I know complainers going to complain but, I wanted to share my personal experience.  (Yes, it was a very slow day so maybe they took a little extra effort). I appreciate it."
5,"Cajun/Mex fusion needed to happen, and the happening couldn't be in better hands.

--Nice people, who go the extra kilometer in giving an ETA on food so that it's possible to chill or browse what's nearby, rather than standing right there and fretting.

--Reasonable pricing in relation to serving size, and reasonable serving size in relation to reality. Seven bucks gets you a breakfast bowl that's filling enough to be the whole breakfast (so you're not stuck blowing $20-$25 across multiple trucks to not starve), but the portion's not so huge that you can't justify a pastry from the market stands if one calls out to you.

--Delicious eggs! Soft, fluffy, and worth every second of the wait time.

--Delicious Cajun rice.

--Heck, delicious everything.

--Did I mention how nice they are?

Also, you get a lollipop as a breath freshener. I'm not sure I intend to lick one, but I'm ridiculously amused by having one."
5,"This city needs more Banh Mi and this place delivers! The spices are plentyful, the food is cheap and the flavour is amazing.

The bao was very fresh and hit the spot. If you're going the bao or Taco route, get 2 as they're not enough on their own. The five Spice Pork belly was good, but the Beef Bao stole the show!

Wait times are reasonable for lunch time takeout considering this is day 2 of them being open and the line goes out the door!

Definitely stop by for a quick bite of happiness!"
5,Super cute and clean salon! I am in love with my unicorn nails!!! I was in and out too which was nice.
5,"I love this place. Everyone is awesome. I love  Trish, she does the best gel mani. The hours awesome & you will find the best happy hour deal before 4pm on weekdays!!!"
5,"I had the great chance to visit here during a recent conference in Phoenix, and frankly wish I could have stayed all day!

The beer AND wine selection is wonderfully diverse and the Happy Hour extends way more than an hour during daytimes. I had three very diverse local beers and they were all great quality.

Yes, the food selection is small, but the prociutto, goat cheese grilled cheese sandwich I had was perfect and paired terrifically with the double blonde ale I was drinking. 

The place has wifi, and a bunch of old school board and trivia games. It was a GREAT change from the chain outlets sprouting up all over downtown Phoenix."
5,"Came here a few times in the past year and am finally getting the chance to review it. 

The restaurant, to me, is perfect. The ambiance and food go hand in hand. Food is delicious, I always get the lasagna and it always blows my mind. The appetizers are all delicious and I always have a hard time deciding what main to get because they all sound amazing. 

Location is great, right in eglinton with street parking and cheap green p paid parking all available. Rosa in the front is always welcoming. 

Will keep on returning so long as the food is this good."
5,Just came in for the first time to get a gel manicure. Ti did my nails and I came out amazing!
5,awsome food just got a battleship an over hr ago piles of meat mmmm havent been here in a long time good job guys you get better all the time
5,I went to MD Spa with my wife and two guy friends one night after dinner. Since we were going to wait for my wife anyway she convinced me and my two guy friends to get a mani and pedi with her. Reluctantly we all agreed. It was our two guy friends first time and they had no idea what to expect. We were seated as a group of four and we sat in soft comfortable massage chairs while we dipped our feet into the warm soapy water as the specialist started working on our feet. They were very professional and even provided a light massage which was great after a long day. When I least expected my guys started asking for recommendations for foot care which the specialist provided. After we were done with our pedicure we were offered nice and comfortable slippers and headed towards the table to get to our hands. The specialist was very attentive and took their time even though we were a little past their closing time. We all had a wonderful time and the guys said they will even go back again with my wife lol.
5,"Picked up two battleships to feed some friends from NY.  And since I hear all the time about the NY foods, and have traveled there also, I had to to something to save our city pride!
After the first taste of the battleship it is with pride I can say they all said ""WOW"" they loved them."
5,"TNT is the bomb (no pun intended)!

The machine that you use to place your order for a basic wash is quite sophisticated and user friendly.  A digital video of a friendly woman guides you through selecting and paying for your wash as you choose your options on the touch screen.

I was impressed that for $5, you not only get to take your car through the main system, but a guy brushes the car before you enter and he cleans the windows by hand when you exit.

They also have a $20 for $15 deal that you can purchase though the Yelp application.  Happy car-washing!"
5,Outstanding beer and wine selection with small classic gaming stations.  Would recommend for some long term drinks and a good time!
5,Wow upon Wow! Great food provided by some very pleasant workers! The catfish melted in my mouth. I will definitely seek out this truck again to try another dish :)
5,"As an Uber driver, I use this car wash 3-4 times a week.  Love that they have the 4 dollar express, I can get in and out fast and that includes free vacuum.   Raul, their customer service rep is outstanding.  He is always there to help, with a smile.  He knows the business and helps me if I have questions.  I also get my car serviced there, oil change, as I get a free full service wash.  Never had a bad experience, thanks Raul and the whole crew for taking care of business when I come in for a wash!"
5,"I love this place!! I was in need of a new nail bar after my previous one got bought out and all the good staff left. My friend recommended this place and I absolutely love it!! It's brand new which is amazing in itself, the decor is super cute and the first time I came in, I didn't want to leave! I have been here four times now, each time I have had someone different do my hands but each time they have done an amazing job!! They also have the cutest pedicure room which I have yet to use (I'll wait until summer for my pedicures!) but it's dark so I can't wait to go in there and just fall asleep! And they're open until 11pm. Cant recommend this place enough!"
5,Holy cow YUM! I just moved here and I have never had Barro's Pizza. Sometimes I feel like finding a good quality delivery place can be tough. But not with Barro's! The staff is so kind and our driver Conor H arrived promptly with a smile on his face! I highly recommend to all! Pizza was delicious and garlic bread was amazing! This is a must!
5,Room service made a minor mistake and gave us a goodie tray as an apology. Such great service and friendly staff.
5,"Lovely atmosphere and environment. Always grest food, very flavourful. I just wish the portion sizes were bigger, because the lasagna and veal meatball are amazing. Good value as well."
5,"Oh yes, you gotta go here on Food Truck Friday! The guys are so friendly and they play the best music too. Super blues-y, Creole, Old Louisana style. Had the longest line so you know it's worth it! Their glass coke bottles are the tall ones so you get your moneys worth too. I got the Chicken Jamburrito and couldn't finish the whole thing in one setting. This is a big deal because I'm a midwestern girl and you always finish your meal out there. 

Highly recommend anything with their creole sauce or cheese, just melts in with the rest of the ingredients!"
5,i ordered their red beans and rice with sausage... very tasty delicious... cant wait to try more
5,Fun place to be esp for halloween! :) Great music great bartenders!
5,"Great service, atmosphere is very relaxing and clean. Will come here again just to be pampered. MD Pedicure was best"
5,"They did it again!  Cool atmosphere, helpful bartenders and a huge selection of wine and beer, there is something for everyone.  They might have the best happy hours in town, they are every day until 8.  This might be my favorite Pig yet!"
5,"Very good food, very welcoming environment! Happiest happy hour the staff was all super friendly, sometimes you want to just go somewhere you feel at home and easy, this is your place. I have been to many Vegas spots, this is a gem..locals and tourists, singles or couples should check EDGE out, Mikey was a outstanding making it fun and interesting drinks. He was comfortable and as a women traveling alone, that is very nice. I felt spoiled and the drinks were great and healthy (green tea and carrot juice added to speciality drinks, made clearly by a professional mixologist (Mikey from Harlem ) happy hour priced, was very very reasonable. I can't wait to go back, very edgey and rich environment, dining room was beautiful and bar was sexy!"
5,Fast and great service.  Got a great deal on detailing my car.  They are willing to work with you. All u have to do is ask
5,"Love this place, great food and a good spin of banh mi's in general. I tend to order the Bao's as I can order two different proteins (pork belly and fried chicken!).   

Great that they give you an opportunity to adjust the spice level or even get what they refer to as a ""club banh mi"" which is chicken and pork together!"
5,"If I wasn't married I might ask the chef to marry me! This is the first time that I've had a simple salad and liked so much I actually ate the whole thing.  I don't usually eat salad when out as I tend to splurge but I really needed something fresh that day. So while my husband ordered the steak burrito I got the cajun steak salad. It was a very simple salad, romaine, cheese, steak, tomatoes.  But this was exactly why this was so good the chef used  simple fresh ingredients, nothing overly complicated here except for the perfectly spiced steak which is what took this salad to a five star review. WOW amazing flavor.  My husband loved his steak jamburrito and couldn't control letting everyone know about it.  We went back a week later and were so impressed we are now contemplating becoming Jamburrito stalkers! We will definitely be back!  Thanks Chef Great fusion cooking. -"
5,For the price I couldn't believe all that was complimentary! Free breakfast- made to order of you like and happy hour with free drinks for 2 hours every evening! Nice rooms and nice lobby. Very impressed.
5,"I've been coming to this place since I was a kid, it was also featured on a tv show which says a lot about this place. Make sure you come here to get you a battleship and I assure you that you will be a very happy customer! One of the best hoagies that Pittsburgh has to offer is right here so be sure to check this place out if you haven't already"
5,"The lounge fries... are the BEST!  And for those of you who love ranch, this is by far the best ranch I've ever had.  NPL is a great Pittsburgh feeling stop, with tons of locals and great service.  Tons of TVs so you can always catch a current game, and they even added small TV screens to the booth tables.  The owner is very personable and you can see him checking in with tables on a regular basis.  Definitely a recommended stop if you are in the area but are not familiar with NPL."
5,"I can't believe this place has only 3 stars. I arrived at 7pm on a Friday and only had to wait 2 minutes to place my order.

My food arrived at my table quickly and I was shocked at the amount of food I received for what I paid. I ordered a salad and small side of mozzarella sticks. 

The salad, at its base, is of your typical iceberg variety. However, the overwhelming amount of veggies more than makes up for it. As for the mozzarella sticks, crispy on the outside and chewy cheese inside. I paired then with pizza sauce and was not disappointed.

The staff were very friendly and provided excellent service. I will definitely be back!"
5,"I had the veggie rise, hubby had club sandwich, daughter had breakfast burrito and also had sweet potato soup. Everything was delish and fresh."
5,"This is the best nail salon in Vegas. Not only are the prices reasonable but the salon is impecable. The staff is absolutely wonderful and friendly, Trish will remember you name and make you smile every time!! Their pedicures are great and they will give you a wonderfully long massage. They have different sets of pedicures based on how long you want to stay. Anything from an express pedicure for the busy people to a 60min one if you feel like getting pampered. They have a great selection of colors for gel, regular and acrylics. My favorite thing is that they are open till late and they take walk-ins.
All of their tools are sterilized and they use new everything for each client (new nail file, new sponges) so its a super clean place! 
They also have two cute children chairs if you want to being your child along for the ride. 
They have relaxing music in the back ground and nice comfortable couches to wait on. 
They also offer full waxing services. 
I would 100% recommend this place and it is definitely worth the drive."
5,"its all about waffle house. get the texas chesesteak sandwich, heck yeah its awesome!"
5,"A major surprise off the strip. 
I visit Vegas at least four times a year, stay at Venetian or Aria, and generally build more loyalty points by eating than I do by gambling. I had fairly low expectations when my friends invited me to join them at Edge Steakhouse in the Westgate resort. Certainly it couldn't match the quality of Carnevino or John-Georges...could it?  Well, I'm not ready to say it's better, but it is definitely on par. 
Our group was treated to a small private dining room and a chef's tasting menu with wine pairings. Service was excellent. Starters were the stars. Cauliflower soup, a seared scallop, and sweet prawns raised my expectations for the meal. And they were never let back down. Two types of steak and a lamb roast served family style were stellar. Every side dish was delicious. Special shout out for two types of pureed potatoes. The deserts, although very standard in selection (cheesecake, chocolate cake and creme brulee), we among the best preparations of each that I've tasted. 
Like desert, the wine pairings were delicious, if not inspiring. The chardonnay and the soup brought out each other's hidden nuances.
Best of all, compared to the above mentioned steakhouses at the big-boy resorts, the prices are exceedingly reasonable. 
Bottom line: even though I can't get there on foot, and even though it won't contribute to my loyalty programs, I'll be adding Edge to my list of regular dining spots. It's that good."
5,"Caramel is really my kind of place. I don't really care to club, but lounges I'll do anytime. Its a very quaint space but its perfect if you just to chill and wind down. i went on a Friday night and he DJ was really good. He did a good job of accommodating the entire crowd so everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The menu seemed reasonable and the service was good. I'll be visiting Caramel again."
5,"Great tap list!  Also, happy hour can't be beat.  Cheapest place for a good beer downtown."
5,"I found M.D. nail spa when I first moved to Las Vegas. It's the one on Hualapai. My technician is Trish, she does an awesome job on my nails. I am very fussy about how my nails are cared for and Trish does an amazing job. She listens to what I have to say she always checks to make sure everything is OK before going to the next step and my husband has decided he now goes and gets a Manny Petty at least once a month. They have an amazing amount of polish to choose from both gel and regular.  They are open Monday through Saturday from ten until eleven p.m. amazing and Sunday from eleven to seven p.m. if you're looking for a good solid nail shop M D nail spa on Hualapai is where you want to go"
5,"The carne asade quesadilla was delicious. The meat is sort of like shaved chunks; so you taste the meat. Yet, it's still very cheesy. The $1.99 margarita was a yummy bargain, too.

I've eaten here about three times. Every time, I was pleased. The food is good and affordable. Plenty of seating. More than ample serving sizes. (I think I've seen construction workers eating here every time I've come.) Convenient location just off the 7th St. exit of the 10."
5,Nicely decorated with upgraded massage chairs that are in great working condition.  Were able to accommodate on short notice. They did a great job on my gel pedi. They have a happy hour special too.
5,"If you want to melt your stress away this is the place to come!! They have everything. From the massive choice of colors and techniques, warm neck wraps, TVs and low spa music, tons of beverages to pick from, and literally every employee is so sweet there. Its so adorably decorated and they also have 2 tiny spa chairs for the kiddos! :) T does my nails and she has given me, hands down THE BEST manicure/pedicure that I've had in Las Vegas!! I hope you get to experience the service here...if not, your missing out!"
5,"This truck stands out, just like the first bite of their jambalaya. Living in arizona my whole life, with campbells soup being my only exposure to this dish. I am happy as hell to find this flavor hiding around here.

If you see the truck. Stop and get the chicken jambalaya.  The spicyness is perfect - how the humble master chef manages to blend this many flavors and spices is a mystery. 

Typically you can't find complex flavors and spices unless you dabble with indian dishes (curries and such). This is definitely an experience any foodie should seek out. Pay attention - cos you might miss it."
5,"I love this place! They have great people and great management! Dan and he's wife did a great job for taking care of he's employee but also he's customers!! They are very clean and they always make sure that there customers are always happy. 
I highly recommend this place! 
My favorite girls in this place are Tracy And Trish They are amazing!!! I'm very satisfied!! Thank you so much!!"
5,"Great place, not what you initially expect from the outside I must admit. Talked to the guy at the counter. Things done in house and well the subs are as long as an arm. They arent all bread like some places. I would like to see French fries pop up on the menu but that's me."
5,So amazing! The fried chicken steamed bao was extremely crunchy and absolutely delightful.
5,"Where do I begin?! When you first walk in the decor is absolutely gorgeous and you feel at home right then. We were seated at a gorgeous and comfortable booth right in the dining area. It was wonderful because it seemed as if we were in our own little dining room with the privacy the booth gave us. Then we were greeted by Bobby our server, so incredibly kind, knowledgeable and fun. He explained about the restaurant and how we came at the perfect time as the extraordinary (my words not his, LOL) Chef Steve had just created a new Spring menu.

I love getting all the information I can about the food on the menu so before each portion of the meal we were told what was in each aspect of the dish. For appetizers we had Beet Salad, Bone Marrow Pizza, and my absolute favorite the Beef Tartar with Caviar. It was everyone's first time trying caviar and we are all now HUGE fans. I would HIGHLY suggest ordering any and all of those when you go visit.

Next course was the English Pea Soup with Morel Mushrooms, mind you I am not a fan of mushrooms but I had to try it, and was I surprised as to how amazing it was! All of the ingredients and flavors in the soup mixed together perfectly.

After that it was the main course, I had the 7 oz Filet, which was melt in your mouth perfection. It was paired along with the Whipped potatoes and Lobster Mac & Cheese, I know my potatoes and these were whipped so finely that it was like butter in your mouth, so creamy and delicious. The Lobster Mac & Cheese had the right amount of cheese and lobster, not too much of either, so yummy!!!

My boyfriend has the John Dory, a fish I have never tried before, but was it absolutely delicious!!!! Each bite had more flavor than the next, I think everyone at the table was worried about me for a moment as I was making the weirdest faces but it was that GOOD!!!! A must have!

We wrapped up the meal with the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulle, which I have never really been a fan of at other restaurants, Chef Steve has officially changed my mind on that, at least at The Edge Steakhouse anyways!

I have travelled alot and have been fortunate to have amazing meals but The Edge Steakhouse and Chef Steve's masterful culinary mind and insane talents have proven that I knew nothing before, this, by far is the best meal I have had to date. If you make your way to Vegas you HAVE to come to The Edge Steakhouse, otherwise you are missing out on an amazing experience."
5,"Holy crap this place is incredible. I haven't had a disappointing item. Ordered delivery a few times and was happy so I decided to go in with my toddler, which is generally always a nightmare. But there was a toddler table and a lot of parents with little kids which totally put us both at ease. It was so nice not having the only kid in a restaurant. 
They were super busy but made time to change my order and add on a few more treats. Coffee was delish, perfect. I didn't see only white women either, it was actually a pretty diverse flow of customers from moms with kids, older retirees, young solo hipsters, and all of multiple various ethnicities. Everyone can appreciate an incredible brekky sammy, delectable scones, and fragrant coffee. :)"
5,I visited  this restaurant since they open..good food with a  great view * few restaurant pittsburgh had a similar thing*
5,Come here for your birthday and you'll get to spin the wheel.  You might win big!!!  Oh and the food is food!!  Large restaurant space and bar.
5,"2 catfish burritos (one grilled, one fried) and 1 basket of cajun popcorn (crayfish tails).

OMG!!! Awesome. 

The two catfish burritos are surprisingly different. With the fried fish you can really taste the deep, complex flavors of the rice and beans. With the grilled fish, the blackened catfish flavor really steps up to the front. Either way, this is the best cajun food I've had--I'm no expert though--my taste buds were in love."
5,"My boyfriend never had a pedicure so I wanted my boyfriend to have a good experience and decided to come here. It's my second time here so I knew they would do a good job. 

When we arrived we were greeted and given water bottles. We looked at the menu and both decided to do the hot stone pedicure.

 My boyfriend got Jonny as his nail tech and I got Ken as my nail tech. My boyfriend was relaxed and said Jonny did a good job on his pedicure. Job has an amazing personality and made us both laugh. Ken did a great job on my pedicure. He was very detailed and the massage was amazing. 
 
We both had such a great experience and will be back for another pedicure in the future with them. 

If you are looking for a nice relaxing experience come here."
5,"I've been passing the place for a long time, then tried it because the Subway line was out the door. Tries the Achiote Salad and I've been buying that salad at least four times a month. 

You can't beat the prices for the amount of food on the plate and there's enough of a selection for the kids to enjoy something too."
5,"I have only tried the little bao buns here and my favourite is the crispy chicken bao. The bun is so soft while the chicken and carrots are crisp so it's a very nice contrast. My mouth is watering as I write this. The portion size is also great for me. I haven't seen many places offering little savory foods. They are usually big, more than$10 portions.

Also, If you order on ritual app you dont have to wait in line."
5,This is the coolest in phoenix. Great selection and the bartender gives good recommendations. Alpine beer is the best btw!
5,Hoagies are amazing!  This 1 sentence explains it all. You must try it if you never have!!!
5,"Fantastic service and the food was sensational 
It is pricey so be prepared to spend when coming to this one 
But in all honesty, you can go to cheaper and wished you never spent the money and save it for a brilliant meal here!"
5,"We are locals and have many great steakhouses to choose from. Edge is one of our favorites.  The service is outstanding and Raymond is one of the best waiters ever!!  Felix also is the best and we remember him from the original TJ's steakhouse. The oysters were so good we ordered more! My husband had the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfect. I had the Salmon entree and loved it.  We also had the mushrooms with cheese and that was a great side dish. Edge is famous for their popovers too. Better than any bread basket. We enjoyed expresso martinis that were made perfectly and the chocolate cake was delicious. 

Love the atmosphere of this beautiful restaurant. Will be back soon!!!"
5,"Mamma's meatballs are one of the many reasons to hit this location. Owner  is a reason to visit Danforth location, always entertaining if you sit at the bar :)
The food is always on point at the Eglinton location. The lasagna, rapini, everything I have had is always great and feels like it is homemade and made specifically for you. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, as well as intimate. 
This is more of a southern Italian feel, crusty rolls to wipe your plate after polishing off the saucy morsels in front of you. 
Always a favourite and will always recommend!"
5,"This place has great pizza! We have never been to a Barro's pizza and we moved close to this location. 

We went in and the girl working, I think her name was Jen maybe, told me all their specials and helped me decide. 

The customer service here was great from every employee we talked to. 
Then we got our pizza. We did a walk in order and it only took about 10 minutes to get it on a Friday afternoon. 

Our pizza was so delicious! Thick crust, really tasty sauce and it was so fresh! 
Great place!! Way better than chain pizza places and worth the extra money."
5,"Caramel is beautiful. Saying ""carmel"" like ""caramel"" is weird. Yep, if you pronounce the A, then I'm one of those people who irritates you by not pronouncing it. It's a colloquialism, mmmkay? But, for this bar's name's sake, I say it the way I guess I'm supposed to.

Anyhow. Caramel is beautiful. The service has always been excellent. It's a classy joint where you can get away with wearing your cargos and Chuck Taylors and never hear a word about it. And, this place satisfies those rare urges of mine when I want to go to a club, but don't want to deal with the usual club hassles."
5,"Caramel is one of the best Ultra Lounges in Vegas.  The martinis will knock you on your ass but you will also pay out of the ass.  Drinks are pricey but well worth it.  

If it's early in the day you can stop by for a quick cocktail but as the night progresses the lounge gets hotter.  It turns into a low-key club.  If you are looking for a chic place to hang out with friends without paying a $30 cover go here.  The Bellagio is spectacular and Caramel is a great added touch."
5,"Stayed here over Labor Day Weekend and had a great stay.  The room was terrific, breakfast was incredible - I stay at plenty of hotels with a continental breakfast, but not too many that will cook to order complimentary.  

I didn't get to take advantage of it this time, but they also have a Manager's Reception every afternoon where you can get free drinks.  

I read about people complaining about noise, but I didn't hear any.  Then again, I was on the 8th floor and was adjacent to one of the corner rooms.  You might want to request the top floor if you're sensitive to noise based on what others have said, but again I didn't have any issues.  

The atrium is beautiful and there is a huge area if you wanted to get together with some friends and hang out.  There is also an Omaha Steakhouse on site that is really good!  

Highly recommend!"
5,We love the North Park Lounge and so does everybody else. Tonight at 6:30 there was a 25 minute wait. We were seated within 15 minutes. There combo meals are the best deals on their menu. Pizza and wings. Pizza and salad. Hoagie and wings. Generous portions!
5,"BEST SUBS EVER.  Seriously.  We saw this on ""PA n'at with Dave and Dave"" and it looks awesome.  We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a ""Battleship"" and it was literally 3 feet long, just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  Even better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.  

It's great, fast food.  I can't wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a Battleship."
5,The Food is amazing! Just the right amount of Cajun spice. The portions are huge and well balanced.
5,"Best Freakin sub in da burgh, I live in Cleveland but originally from McKeesport. Every time I come home I will have da Super Battleship hands down best sub I've had thus far!! Steelers for life, down with the browns!!"
5,"I stopped by for a $5 happy hour sangria and I can't wait to come back! Happy hour is ridiculously long and there are games on every table. They don't have a ton of cocktails but there are so many drink options that I can't imagine anyone not finding something they love. 
The sangria was very sweet, so if that's not your thing, go for one of the dozens and dozens of beer options."
5,"They know food! Fresh, top quality, perfectly ripe ingredients, cooked to perfection! We started with the tomato salads, and proceeded to shared linguine w/ rapini & an order of meatballs. Delicious, coming from a couple who cook many cuisines at a high level. And yes, we've eaten in Italy, too. Service was friendly and professional: not rushed, but not made to wait either. Just right. We'll be back."
5,"I've came here several times for pedicures and i enjoyed it each time so I decided to try getting my nails done here as well and after a Not a good result I debated about coming back but I reached out to them about my experience and the boss called me directly to apologize and to make sure that my nails we're fixed up and up to my standard and wow they did not disappoint. He set me up with a appointment right away and I couldn't be happier. they really have excellent customer service 
So i will Continues to support!! 
Also I've been to many nails shops and I've never been to one so ""fresh"" like usually when you step into a nail salon you're overwhelmed by the smell of acetone and nail polish but this one NOPE no smell it's was super nice to actually enjoy clean air while getting my nails done hahaah"
5,"Have eaten here or ordered from here religiously

Place is consistently good. 24 bone in or bone out wings deal with an XL 1 topping pizza is a quick and delicious meal for you and your pals! 

I have gotten their medium one topping only $9.48 +tax which is perfect for just the two of us, its always hot, delicious, a bit greasy(which makes it good) and has the best cheese, to bread, to meat, to crust ratio out of any pizza I have had. 

By far this place is great for a quick slice, a meal, or for some party food while the game is on."
5,"I'm Vietnamese and I never really like ""banh mi"" in Toronto. My sister recommendation ""kimchi fries"" and I should said ""Wow"". The crispy of fries + sweet and spicy of Kimchi are turning out amazing. It is a must try for every visit. I also had grill pork ""banh mi"" which I feel is ok. Two orders cost me around $13.56. Would love to come back again to try the duck ""banh mi"" soon at this place. I give it 5 stars because of the price, the cleanliness, the fast and friendly of the cashier. Good place for something quick"
5,Im really giving this place 5 stars. It was super clean. Fresh hot and never emptied food choices. Nice servers. The food is avg nothing fancy. They got good sushi. Mongolian grill below avg to be honest. I gotta say this place beats dirty stinky Lin's down on 75th.
5,"Yes, that's right, I'm going a full five stars this time. At least partially because I've gotten better at selecting what I love from their menu, but it's all just exceptional!

5 Stars for the grilled pork banh mi! - These are not your grandfather's $2 Banh Mi sandwiches, there's no pate nor tons of mayo, just caramelized grilled pork deliciousness, with sweet pickled veggies and your preferred level of heat. I like mine spicy, just perfect with the sweetness!

5 stars for the fries!  No, not the kimchi fries - I love kimchi, I love fries, the combination, with all the sauce and pork and everything, is just too busy for me. But the fries themselves are dark golden brown and outstanding with a little ketchup and/or mayo.

4 stars for the squid taco! Delicious, well balanced, and the soft taco shell is grilled and tasty, and not nearly as annoying as the bland, doughy steamed bao. I say skip the bao, and stick to the sandwiches on their outstanding panini/baguette style rolls.

Plus there is street parking here, so its a bonus overall, and shorter lines compared to the other more crowded locations.

I've tried all of their sandwiches, most are great, but with balanced flavours, yummy carmelized meat, and overall deliciousness.  

The pork belly and fried chicken club is also recommended and very good, but for me, their #1 grilled pork banh mi is always a winner, loaded with more juicy-seared meat than the belly sub has, plus it's also the cheapest sandwich on their menu!

Go for it, you'll like it!"
5,This place was beyond awesome. I brought my 3year old to have a mother daughter day and everything from walking in to leaving was perfect for my daughters first pedi/mani experience. Te( lady who assisted us) was beyond understanding and polite. Even when my daughter kept messing up 1 hand. Place looked super clean and everyone was smiling and great customer service. Thank you again MD nails will definitely be returning and bring my daughter here for more mother daughter dates.
5,To say that I have an obsession with this place is an understatement! ha! The service is great! They have an awesome selection of beer and wine and an incredible happy hour! Their sandwiches are always delicious and its the perfect happy hour or hang out spot! GREAT for dates and perfect for after work drinks! I just can't say enough great things about this place! DEFINITELY go here if you find yourself downtown!
5,"Jamburritos is by and far my favorite food truck. The chicken jamburrito is amazing, their hush puppies are perfectly spiced, and their homemade lemonade is tart and refreshing. The guys running the truck are unfailingly nice, which makes the experience even better. It's absolutely worth your time to visit them at the biweekly Phoenix Public Markets or wherever else they might be that day."
5,"Incredible from start to finish. We did the family meal which gives you a good variety of 7 Numbers' menu including apps, pasta dishes and mains. 
Great decor, service, menu and the music was fantastic too.
A great place for a low key, delicious Italian meal."
5,"Great food, friendly people, good prices.  Fast service.  What more can you ask? :)  I ordered the fried catfish tacos.  They were ready in 5-7 minutes and delicious.  Better quality fish tacos than most places.  They seasoned everything just right.  See photo.

Too bad I don't have one by my house. :)"
5,"Went to car wash a few days ago after my nephews had a cheetos and Capri sun explode all over back seat, floor, even the doors. Brian and his team were able to get everything clean, my car looked fantastic I so happy with these guys I will definitely be returning to this wash"
5,"Growing up in Swissvale, we got a battleship for every football game, birthday party, and so on.. now in my late 20's my mom and I still have a ritual of going out to shop and then to each grab a battleship for dinner at our separate homes at least once a month. In over 20 years I can not think of a single bad experience with the place, other than the long wait which I will forgive because it's totally worth it."
5,"Thank you jimmy !! Amazing service!!  I appreciate how every time I been in jimmy would always help me save money with happy hour an discounts on yep  mon-Thur.

Thank you so much for keeping me fresh AF ;)"
5,"I can't believe I'm the first to review!

My husband and I saw something about the Triangle Bar and Grill on an old WQED rerun about good places to eat in PA.  We stopped by yesterday and are VERY glad we did.  The Battleship hoagie fed us for 2 meals (3 feet of sandwich with 2 lbs of meat!), and that's saying a lot, we like our food!... and it was only 12.95!  It was one of the best sandwiches I've had, hands down.  We are definitely going back!"
5,Amazing steakhouse! We had the steak & lobster with broccoli. One of the best I've ever had. Kudos to the chef! Everything was seasoned to perfection. Nicely done!! Probably one of the best places we have been to. Keep up the great work..I'll be back!!
5,"I have been twice, I have eaten twice and I have loved twice... it's a fast food poutine place so if I walk in expecting delicious poutine and I get that and more - WINNING!

Most people have seen this place.. It's relatively new (last year ish), its small (seats like 20 ish) and its tucked away by Melrose on 17th ave... about 15 feet to the left (ish). My first thought when I went in was HOLY LOTS OF KINDS... so as my brain is trying to comprehend what I want .. Nacho poutine? Pulled pork? Philly cheese steak? REGULAR? Cowboy? Dessert Poutine? Steak? Shoes? Sink? I'm confused... too many choices. Needless to say, what we had we loved - which I believe was the pulled pork and a steak one.

The reason I am writing this review is because when I returned last weekend I was near ready to order something when I saw what the person in front of me got - and my eyes couldn't comprehend such beauty. A Mac and Cheese poutine. The back-story is this... I'm addicted to mac and cheese in all forms, so to see my favorite thing in life ON TOP OF a poutine my heart skipped a beat. My order had to be changed immediately to this flavor. It's a busy place, with a decent line for 2am on a Friday, all seats filled and the aroma of grease and cheese filled the air. They sell pickled eggs and pickled ""pickles"" (?), which was ""interesting"", they sell T shirts and they sell pop. So it's really a poutine place. 

The beauty arrives. Its heavy, smells amazing and it's hot and gooey. A creamy, super cheesy, hot and fresh mac and cheese piled thick on a really good poutine like they do best. The fries are brown and crispy and hot, the sauce is great and the cheese curds and perfect. This is one carb overload that is HITTING.THE.SPOT.
This is prob the best poutine I have had in a while. Or.... It's the beer? I need to go back very soon...which my waistline will not appreciate."
5,"Three of us ordered a large pizza and two orders of wings for delivery and wow, really great food. The pizza is the best I've had in this area and the wings get in a three way tie with The Portly Piper and Magwyers. Also we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. Bonus!"
5,So so good. I am a big fan of the NY style pizza and Benny's doesn't disappoint and the jumbo slices are so awesome. They are like the equivalent of two regular NY style slices at some other pizza shops and only $4 per slice. They have a limited number of toppings to choose from which is how it should be. I got the cheese pizza and really loved the super thin crust that was both chewy and crispy.
5,"I started my first series of colonics (hydrotherapy sessions) while on vacation in Vegas! The staff here is super friendly and offer great customer service. I was nervous because I had never had a colonic before, but the therapists were calm and walked me through the whole progress. My plan was to come in for one colonic, but instead I ended up having a total of 3 done over the course of a week. It's an interesting experience, but I found them to be beneficial. The therapist and receptionist were informative and super nice. I even ended up buying the green mixture they let you drink after your colonic. It's delicious!"
5,I love this Starbucks. It is right by the kids school so i can drop them off and enjoy. The place us always clean although smaller than your average Starbucks. The people are always friendy and quick to get my order out. I have also dropped my kids there a few times to walk to school and they have always been pleasant and courteous to them.
5,"Super fresh, delicious and cheap Banh Mi in the Montreal area!"
5,"Guns, lots of guns,

Oh my god, if you like very, very, very shiny guns, this is the place to go, inexpensive, friendly people who loveeeeee to talk about their passion and are more than willing to help and advise you .....just a great place to hang out for a few hours and go ""bang"""
5,"P I T A L A N D! Exceptional Pitas baked daily HOT HOT HOT & Fresh!
Whole wheat & White
This place has everything under the sun :)"
5,"I love this place soooo much! I honestly was not originally intrigued by Benny Fierro's because I thought it was a little much to have these massive slices exist and I didn't really believe they would be as amazing as they are! But wow! My two friends kept telling me that they have been ordering jalapeno popper pizza from Benny's and that it was amazing. I felt compelled to give it a go and I have zero regrets, aside from not going sooner! The slices are gigantic and about $5 each, depending. The crust is thin and crispy. The sauce is not overly sweet and the toppings are all so good! The jalapeno popper pizza was a special for the month of July and had jalapenos, bacon and beer cheese on it. Goodness! I have also had their pepperoni, sausage and this month's special, chorizo and onion. I am fully obsessed with this place! I also kind of like that they only have water/soft drinks instead of having a bar. There is no temptation to grab a beer with your slice and up the bill ten-fold. Cheap, delicious and filling...that's all one could ever ask for in a slice of pizza!"
5,"Easily the best gyro I've ever had. Everything was super fresh, but the thing that got us was the service. My fiancee and I split a combo they had avertised. The guy went out of his way to separate it on two tries, complete with our own tziki sauces. He didn't have to do that and it really made an impression on us."
5,"I and family went to their This new location. Wait was aprox 45 min. I guess they were short staffed that day.
I tried their quail kabob and rice. It was spicy but really really tasty. Everything was done to perfection. 
Best place to eat Afghan food. 
Reasonably priced."
5,"Oh this is stellar! Family owned and operated, reasonable prices. I go and get the Greca Salad, basically a Greek Salad with Gyro meat on top. I could probably eat here everyday."
5,"So I recently had food here and from the outside it looks dead and not appealing however as soon as you walk in. The beautiful open space is a fresh breath to look at. 


My husband had the chef special and let me tell you I wanted it. It's a mix of all sorts of kebob. With a salad on a platter. 

I had manti which is mini ravioli with meat in it and warm yogurt over it. It was yummy

We both had the humus with pastrami in it and it was served with fresh baked bread. 

We will be back with family and friends since it's hard to find a halal restaurant that has both good food and good ambiance to sit in."
5,Amazing gyros and they have ramen option here too! Come try it out. Not to mention- they have a Korean beef BBQ dish!
5,"I was here with friends a few weeks back and I must say I was quite impressed by the pizza they serve. They have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising. 

We ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (I remember pineapple as one of the toppings). Hot lips was quite an amusing name!! They give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints. They are also generous with the toppings they give. One slice is totally worth the price!! I prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza. For drinks, I recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk. Anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink. It also goes well with the pizza. 

I will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!"
5,"Very friendly staff! Took my kitten Ryuk in today for a fix and shots. Pricing was fair. Even trimmed his nails. No ""visit fee"" added. Ryuk saw Talia Gattenuo, she was very friendly and up front about any charges and fees. The price she gave me in the AM was the same when I picked him up! She even let me know my baby is super cuddly (which I know) but that just shows me they don't just shove my baby into a cage and ignore him. 

Would recommend."
5,"We LOVE this place!  We decided to go here on a whim, and now we can't stop going back.  The service is prompt, courteous, and upbeat - thanks Andrew!  The food has always been consistently delicious.  And the icing on the cake?  Their prices are great."
5,I love the service.  Manager is very friendly...i come every morning for my coffee and  my banana nut bread warm...always fresh
5,Good staff here there speed of making your drink in a timely manor is very normal like any busy starbucks.  If your order was messed up maybe it was someone being trained or you went in to the drive-thru its going to happen don't cry just inform them they messed up on the order they will be happy to make your order right. You still have good quality and great service.
5,"This was my wife's & I first time doing a detoxification of ion and colonic. Let me tell you it was scary,  do to it being are first time. The staff was so nice and helpful.  We felt welcome right as we walked in.  Very nice staff, professional, & informative step by step. I have always had problems going to the restroom and felt miserable.  After the colonic, I feel wonderful. The rooms are  very clean and comfortable environment. This is where we will comeback too next time in Vegas. LIVE GREAT FEEL GREAT"
5,"I was here for lunch the other day - what a find.  I'm loving that they have a spicy salmon sushi pizza and spicy salmon or spicy tuna roll combo - when all is said and done.  I left full.  The quality of the food was great.  This was a great place to have lunch (it was a weekday, so it wasn't too loud or crazy)."
5,This little spot has quickly become one our family's favorite dinner spots.  The kids bowls are perfect for the littles and the ingredients are always fresh.  You will not be disappointed. Try the marinated tuna and house sauce!  Yum!
5,Feels like some where Is like to take home decor lessons from. The meditation room healing salt lamps sacred geometry everywhere. Feel good energy there that's for sure. My lady was Deanna. I was really scared and not to be completely graphic but ya... I'm glad I went there a 0 expectations because I would hv not gone. But now I'm going back lol. Dear God. It's an adult issue. But if u have stomach issues. Need to detox or diet. Its a good start to heal and cleanse your body. If your anything like me and hypersensitive the healing crisis after is tough. I also broke out bad. But I have so much energy. My chi feels centered. I feel less scattered. My stress levels are down. My immune system is in order. Idk it isn't pleasant if you don't love taking a poo. But there's no shame in taking care of yourself and it's a normal human action. And the staff will definitely make you feel more than comfortable.
5,Great place to satisfy my poki fix.  Friendly staff.  Been here several times for lunch and dinner.
5,"Review: 4.5/5

After reading the stellar reviews of fellow Yelpers and sushi enthusiasts, Bilal and Bernie, I decided to give this place a try. 

Boy were they right! It was amazing! The first impression was great; the decor and ambience were good and it was quite full, which is always a good sign. 

We went for the AYCE. The appetizer shrimp and vegetable tempura was good. The sushi was amazing! The fish was fresh and the rolls well formed. One minor problem: I felt the maki rolls had a tad bit too much rice. Also, the ubiquitous spicy salmon roll was a tad bit below expectations. Nonetheless, the maki rolls were quite good...Especially the dynamite and salmon avocado rolls. 

The sashimi was phenomenal! The fish was extremely fresh and went down very smoothly! 

Service wise, they were great. Contrary to other AYCE joints I've been to, the service was surprisingly quite fast! I think they are also slightly cheaper than other AYCE places. 

Overall, if you like sushi, especially AYCE sushi, this is a must try. It is definitely a winner in my books! Let me know what you think. Bon Appetit! :-)"
5,"I have very thick and curly hair. I usually get my hair blown out at blow dry bar. I came to this place on a recommendation from the spa across from them. Unfortunately I was very disappointed because I did not get what I paid for. My hair did not feel smooth and blown out. It was still frizzy and I could have done better by myself.  I called the manager and explained what happened and how i was disappointed, not only did I receive an ""I'm sorry"" but he invited me to come back and give him another chance.  I was blown away by Brice.  At first I rated this place a 1 star but once Brice spoke to me and shown true concern and compassion about how the business is ran, i changed it to a 5 star.   This place will not disappoint because Brice is there to make sure customers leave happy.   Thank you!"
5,"I can't think of anything I don't like about this range.  It's huge, with options for all types of shooting, good benches, and decent supplies if you need them.  On the main range there are concrete benches with seating on either side for left-handed or right-handed shooting.  There are target holders in the ground at all the various ranges you'd expect, and plenty of target frames are provided.  The frames are pretty large and good enough for a solid four targets at a time, so you have plenty to shoot at during the shooting interval.  The range safety guys are always courteous, helpful, and friendly."
5,"Late review, but I went here on the grand opening. I ordered my poke with salmon/tuna. As far as toppings go, I did the works. A variety of flavors and a good portion. The salmon was great, but the tuna was okay. As a new store, the ambiance was pretty open/plain, but the employees told me there will be several renovations. Looking forward to what they'll do.

Overall, solid experience."
5,"Hands down the best kabob place I've had in Scarborough. The line up might get long in peak hours buts it's so worth the wait. Although their beefs kabobs are great I love the chapati kabob. Can never go wrong with the chapati kabob, order it on your next visit!"
5,"I just moved into the area, and everyone always rants and raves about how amazing Benny's is. I thought it was 100% local just because of how much of a hometown feel is in this place - even though they have other locations, you just feel the Pittsburgh charm of this one. Enormous slices the size of your head. Quick service. Games always on TV. Youthful crowd - which gets pretty loud and crowded on weekends. 

Staff is incredibly nice and everyone working there is very charismatic. Makes you feel right at home.

Only real complaint is the $5 slices. It's a little insane. I'm a originally from Bronx, and we have slices just as big for $1 in New York, but hey, the pizza is pretty alright. Overpriced for how it tastes, but it's still wicked good. A definite ""must-eat"" if you're in the area!"
5,This is a combo quick mart style sandwich shop. They make fresh banh mi sandwiches-2 sizes. Lots of choices for them! These were so good!  The baguette was fresh and chewy and the ingredients were also so fresh and the dressing was fantastic!  Just enough to flavor but not drown out the other ingredients!  Perfect for a quick bite!  We may eat here again this week!  Just 5 minutes from our hotel!
5,"I've had to use colonics over the year and while no one loves them- do they?  Some are easier and more comfortable than others.  It's always been an embarrassment to me and I'm private and prefer to deal with my releases and such alone.  But my therapist was amazing.  She deserves a shout out.
Tiffany!  Thank you.  I know I was so nervous allowing someone to assist me - but she coached me through some really tough cramping and I feel like I had the most productive and caring treatment ever.  In the end she added good bacteria and healthy flora back into my colon along with a natural anti inflammatory.  That helped a lot.  I wish she lived in San Jose.  If she moves there she will have a client for life."
5,"Hal Bliss, Mike Knox and Mike Stone were all extremely courteous and helpful and made our purchase of the car easy. I feel I got a great deal. I love the Mazda 6 I highly recommend the 6pd manual it is so much fun to drive. A 4door sedan that handles like a sports car! Thanks guys!"
5,"One of my fav go to AYCE sushi places anywhere in town. Great service, modern decor, fantastic sushi, what's not to love?! But seriously make a reservation! This places gets packed in minutes! Worth the wait? Hell yes! Fantastic cuts of sashimi and nigiri. Sushi rolls its self quite nice (albeit same everywhere just better tasting!) great handrolls served well. As some other reviewers have mentioned the grilled stuff options are less, but well.. But I'm here for the sushi and sashimi, the grilled beef and chicken was quite nice though :) oh an have the miso soup! 

The desert options I'll mention, ice creams are the same flav as everywhere else (Mango and Green Tea), there was a cheesecake? I think but was just cream.

All in all great place to go to!"
5,"YAY - Pittsburghers rejoice!  Finally a place to replace Pizza Sola/NY style in Pittsburgh.

We stopped in on a random Wednesday at around 3PM to try them out and grab a quick slice.  We ordered a basic pepperoni which was really good.  Is it the best pizza I've ever had in my life?  No.  Is it high on my list of a basically non-existent NY style market in Pittsburgh?  Absolutely.  The service was great, chill guys working hard that really want to see the place succeed.  I will happily be back (probably at least once a week) to continue to support them!

Pro-tip: Don't be dissuaded by the $5ish slice prices, these slices are HUGE and totally worth it."
5,"Nice clean restaurant with a good selection of food. They have all the typical Mediterranean style food but they also have some extras which is nice. I had the falafel pita which was very good. The iced tea they have is also good,it has a nice floral flavor and is unsweetened.

I was greeted very well when I came in and taken care of as I ate my meal."
5,So good. So cheap. I wish I could buy stock in this place.
5,"I ordered a meat lovers pizza and it was really good. The pizza has a generous amount of tasty toppings and cheese with the right amount of sauce. The dough is light,soft and crispy around the edges. I will definitely come back for more pizza."
5,"Cool place. Great, interesting prepared food & delicacies. A real asset to Brookline."
5,Pitaland serves my favorite hummus and Lebanese food! I especially love their roasted red pepper and walnut spread. I also love their dried lentils and grains that you can buy in bulk.
5,"Fantastic pizza, altho they cover the toppings in cheese which I don't prefer, but it's not a big issue. We live around the corner so it's convenient for pickup, we haven't used the delivery service. It's pricier tho, so we don't order here often. Great pizza, the wings are good, if you show up too early and have a long wait they serve beer. Thumbs up."
5,"Des sandwichs vietnamiens à moins de 6$, nous avons un lunch rapide et plus santé que la plupart des options offertes à proximité. Après 21h, les sushis sont en rabais de 30%. Ils offrent aussi une gamme de desserts vietnamiens si vous voulez essayer."
5,Pretty good idea.  Excellent quality fish and really helpful and friendly staff.  Will definitely visit again when I'm back in the area.
5,"Bought a Groupo for this business and it was the first time I've experienced colon hydrotherapy.  As others have mentioned, I was a little nervous but there was really nothing to worry about.  The procedure was easy, the staff professional, and the results positive."
5,I was extremely happy with my appointments yesterday at Primp and Blow North Scottsdale. Bri did a great job with my makeup and Adriana did my hair exactly how i wanted. I had pictures later in the day and felt wonderful. Thanks ladies!
5,Delicious korean food and wonderful people. Love the spicy pork dish and seafood udong noodles
5,"Love love love this place- one of the best pizzas I've ever had, great prices, so freaking good. LOVE the toppings and the mountain of cheese. YUM."
5,I had a bad day and I stopped into my favorite place (Starbucks) and my Brista James had AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! He was so kind he almost made me forget that my car had been stolen less than an hour prior to my visit! Thanks for the great experience!!!
5,"Bubble tea and sushis. What more can you ask for? This place is amazing, oh wait and they also have sandwiches, for cheaper than Subway. I would eat there everyday."
5,"I love Healing Waters.  It's clean and inviting and I've? always gotten a warm welcome.  I was nervous about doing the open system at first but learned that I prefer it. 
Marlow was has been my technician.  She has a soothing way about her that doesn't make me feel embarrassed.   Everything was explained to me very clearly from the start.  
She spent some time learning about me and had knowledgeable recommendations as she shared their product line.  I love their products as well and after her recommendations there are a few I don't want to live without!
I have referred Healing Waters and Marlow to many of my friends.
Tommy and Daisy are great too!"
5,"Staff here are always nice! I used to go to Banfield and we were never satisfied with them as they had long waits even though we made appointments & everything seemed overpriced. I will always bring my dogs here because of great customer service and friendly staff.

The website allows online appointments with vets that deal with specific types of pets. Staff are very organized and do their best to turn over exam rooms.

Getting into the plaza sucks. There's no outlet behind the hospital because the Smog Check blocks it off from the street. Be aware that there's limited parking at the hospital and it may feel a bit tight driving through.

Even though the parking lot is bad, it won't stop me from coming to this hospital. It's conveniently located close to me, staff & vets are great and I always leave in a timely manner (when appointments are booked)."
5,"This place has the best chicken and lamb gyros in Pittsburgh. Both are cut fresh of a spit, the taste is wonderful and is super fresh. The lamb burger is great as well, if your in the the area this place is a must try."
5,"Very Lovley place . Great staff , very clean and amazing service. There prices are affordable as well . I Highly recommend healing waters."
5,"So I went here again a few weeks back and realized I wasn't fair.  All the rolls are delicious, sashimi is extremely fresh and the butterfly shrimp are really good.  All 4.5/5.

But what I really love? The beef tataki - 6/5!!! seriously!! I could eat this all friggin day!!

Yes, it's raw, but oh sooooo good.  

So I gotta upgrade despite the loud small environment.  Food makes up for it."
5,Found a great little place that's sure to be a favorite!  Wonderfull selection and a great price.
5,Yummm! I have been here before and it was ok.This time ..omg the bahn mi is so good..the bread toasted the veggies crunchy and fresh.I was quite hungry so this hit the spot seriously.They have premade noodle dishes and snacks in the front as well.Cheap..yummy food.
5,Always feel welcome at this location..i have a special order.  Always i have it right.  Tnks..
5,"I love this place. I got my leased car from here because I was not sure I wanted to commit to Mazda for full ownership. I grew up with Toyotas. However the service I have had here, especially with Jennifer (she is amazing and deserves all the raises), and my enjoyment with the car means I will be buying from here when my lease ends. This location has amazing customer service and just has good people on staff. People who actually care about other people and have a great attitude. Working in customer service myself I really can appreciate the extra steps they take to make you feel heard and considered. Even though I now live in Surprise I will drive the extra miles to come here because of their service department. Thank you Chapman Mazda!"
5,Want authentic Korean food?  This is it.. More expensive then other states but I give them five stars for authentic taste especially after eating at sushi kims.
5,This is a staple restaurant for me as the sushi is always extremely fresh and tasty.  Staff is also very friendly and courteous. Highly recommend
5,"So, i get that this is sort of a ""concept"" joint, with the biggest slices I've ever seen, but i don't care!
First, the dough. It's thin, but cooked PERFECTLY. The crust is doughy, light, and F R E S H tasting. The sauce is what i would say is traditional - not sweet or too packed with herbs. A nice layer is added to the za, deff not overwhelmingly saucy. The cheese is again, exactly what i think of when i think of a traditional za. Unlike some shops, they don't chuck on a lot. Just enough. Bubbled nicely, not too greasy. 
I just got the cheese this time around. I'm embarrassed to say i couldn't finish the whole slice! Next time, going in on an empty stomach! 
As an aside, i wonder if they will ever have pizza eating contests??"
5,My wife and I needed some supples for the holidays.  We have been here a few times but it is always an experience.  Yesterday they had live music and the bread was being made when we walked in. They brought fresh bread to the kids.  The staff was very helpful.  We got a gyro and a Lebanese pita pizza for a snack. Both were outstanding.  When we got home I opened the hummus which is always the next.  Awesome place.
5,"I took my bunny Oliver here to get neutered.  This isn't my usual veterinary hospital,so I was a bit nervous about experimenting with a new place.  

When I called to check up on him, I was given a lot of information and a time to pick him up.  When I arrived to pick him up I saw the vet who answers all of my questions. (I had a lot.) She seemed to appreciate bunnies as pets and she made me feel well informed.  She was doctor Parker. 

I was happy with the price, the care my pet was given, and the friendliness of staff."
5,"If you're in the market for a new vehicle you need to talk to Michael Knox at Chapman. He was friendly and helpful. We felt welcomed but not pressured.

Michael Knox is professional and personable. He was informative explaining each component on the vehicles we looked at. He was patient and thorough. 

We are so happy with our Mazda CX 5. And so glad to be part of the Chapman family and will definitely go back for our next vehicle."
5,"I've been waiting for a good poki place to open near me and this one is perfect. Fresh food, good prices, so much selection, and friendly staff. They were very accommodating and even came by as I was eating to ask if I needed anything. SO GOOD!"
5,"Coming from California, I wasn't sure if Vua could compare to some of the authentic asian food featured in California. However, Vua tastes just as good, if not better. The staff that makes the food only really speak French. But, not to worry: All the cashiers speak excellent English! I recommend the #7 (BBQ Pork)  Banh Mi Sandwich. If you're willing to spend  few extra bucks, pick up some egg rolls when you check out. They're some of the best in Montreal and worth it..."
5,The best AYCE Sushi Buffet in Mississauga!  Sashimi FRESH.  Yummy!  Services have improved!
5,"Big portions!! One platter and a couple appetizers are enough for two people. The hummus is fresh and delicious. Baklava was delightful. Service is lovely, but I think the waitress was a bit nervous or new.

The best thing to get is the Doner which is a rotating selection of meats of the moment. Included rice, red cabbage slaw, and assorted grilled veggies.

Decor is nice and bright and inviting. A great place to bring a family of any size!"
5,First time ever having this done and I have to say it was a great experience. The staff was very professional and polite. I felt very comfortable and at ease about the process. Everyone is very knowledgeable and genuinely care to make you feel better. I look forward to seeing how much better I'll be feeling in the future!
5,Chicken shawarma was excellent! Not spicy at all thank goodness! Hubby got the gyro and that was excellent as well. Very nice people (owner?) they let us in even though they were closing. Great place! Better than grinders!
5,"I know a lot of people that go way out in the desert to shoot. With BASF so close, so cheap, so safe, & so nice, why would you go out to a remote location?

A mere $7.00 a day (children free) gets you access to the single largest publicly funded and publicly accessable shooting range in the WORLD! Most other ranges of this size and this diverse are military only. 

Take advantage of this national treasure and go! The people are super nice and the firing line is well regulated. Supplies are cheep and there are some great classes.

Updated Review
============================

I went there last Saturday.  It was the first cool Saturday after a long hot summer and deer season approaches.  As you might imagine - it was PACKED and we had to wait about 45 minutes to get a table to shoot from.  there were other unused areas (small bore, silhouette, etc) that could have handled the overflow with ease, but for reasons unknown they kept them closed.

I still maintain that the old men working here are very thorough in their job.  They are safety conscious and don't mind helping novice shooters - and they do it all with a very friendly, warm, and congenial demeanor.  The lady in the booth where you pay is extremely nice too.  However the young lady at that runs the range from the officers box is an absolute beeee-yotch!

She was gruff, kurt, short, hot headed, rude and makes me reconsider the whole Ben Avery Experience.  If there is anything I hate it's when you are trying to walk the tight rope and be on your best behavior and some one jumps your @$$ for minor minor infractions and treats you like a life long hardened criminal.  Seriously I think she needs to find a way of dealing with the stress of her job and not venting it out on every one at the range.

The last time I went, the rifles didn't have to be in a case, if yours wasn't they had a loaner for you to use and it was no problem.  I arrived this time sans case and they lady that took my $7.00 said the same thing she said last time ""No problem.  Take your gun to the Range Officer and she'll give you one.""  When I showed up the Female R.O. jumped me six ways to Sunday about the case.  If they are having internal communication issues, that's their problem and I should never be the wiser.

I still like the range and it is still one of my favorite things in all of the valley, but the next time I go, I hope she treats me better.  I'll turn the other cheek once - next time it involves paperwork and a letter to her superior."
5,So good! I miss this place. I use to go all the time when I was younger and danced at the nearby dance studio.
5,"Top notch  service. Absolutely  no pressure from the sales team. Our salesman Michael  Knox,  was nothing short of amazing. We were in and out in few hours, with our new car. There was no bullshit from the get go, and all parties walked away happy. I will certainly  recommend  Chapman  to everyone I know."
5,"I get my Mazda 6 serviced at this location. Jennifer F. is my service consultant and does an outstanding job taking care of me each time I bring my car there. She always talks me through my maintenance plan, never pressures me for services that aren't specifically needed and truly looks out for me and what I need.  It is so refreshing to have someone who knows their job, does it exceptionally well, and cares about you as a person not just trying to see how much they can add on for additional services to your vehicle. Thank you Jennifer and the team of mechanics who take great care of me and my Mazda! This location is the best one our there!!"
5,"The food is better than Bamyan and Naan/Kabab ! Portion size is a lot bigger, I never regret going there all the time. Food is great. atmosphere is very noisy and so many people come there. 

Try to avoid weekends if you want to eat in peace!!"
5,Amazing food! Very affordable! One of the best Oriental food places I have ever been to in GTA. Strongly recommenxed.
5,Great customer service. Love the gyro with some fries combo reasonably priced. Never been here before but I would recommend coming here for lunch or a great afternoon meal. They gave salads and some other things on the menu I'll have to try i like greek food so yum :)
5,"this place is amazing, very caring and knowledgeable. Their prices are reasonable and no long wait times. They even sent me a condolence card when I had to put my Buddy down , that is Huge"
5,"Pitaland has my heart. Upon entering the first time, I walked over to the viewing window to admire the pillows of pita going by on the conveyor belt. Seconds later I am invited in, given a hot pita, and practically a mini tour with invitation to bring my kids next time. This family business is amazing. This is a gem in this city. 

The food is simply addicting. Fresh, flavorful, and all at very reasonable prices. We always get a bag or two of pitas, spinach feta pies, stuffed grape leaves, tabbouleh, cucumber yogurt, and more. One of our greatest discoveries is that you can get sliced gyro meat in their freezer case! 

The cafe inside is probably one of the best kept secrets around. The falafel plate is a steal and they make our favorite falafel in Pittsburgh. 

Trips to Pitaland are pretty much a weekly thing since that first visit. You will not be sorry for stopping in! What should you try? One of everything!

Editing to add that they have the best French fries!!"
5,"For the location being rather small, they are fast workers. Everyone is really nice and Keisha is so kind. She's very welcoming and so sweet. It's a great start to the work day when you encounter nice employees."
5,Well I've been here a bunch of times and they never diappoint. Love the atmosphere and the food is very large portions.
5,This place is fantastic. Been here for lunch at least 50 times with my coworkers. Satay soup and Pad Thai are awesome...
5,"Went for the first time today and was terrified about the experience! 
I must say that it was a comfortable experience and Tommi made it even more comfortable. She put my anxiety to rest and educated me about the process. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and professional! I would highly recommend Healing Waters for any of the services they provide!"
5,Great people. They take great care of my animals. A little pricey in some areas but overall worth it!
5,"Best gyros and shawarma in Pittsburgh!
Greg and his staff know how to cook. Lebanese house salad is awsome. The best in Brookline and the best gyro EVER! Keep up the good work. The specials may make you eat way more than anticipated..."
5,"Excellent service from start to finish. Michael Knox is personable and kept the process as short as possible. Buying a car is something nobody looks forward to, but he made it easy and quick. Highly recommend Chapman Mazda and looking forward to future purchases from these guys!"
5,I love that this market is in walking distance to my house and has all the middle eastern spices that I need. But on top of that their lamb burgers are AMAZING. I'm here all the time getting one for lunch or dinner. I may start having the lamb burger for bother lunch and dinner haha.
5,"Views are ....wow. Sitting on the 44th floor of the hotel. I got appetizers to share with my table. Calamari was very good, flat bread was good as well, and the chorizo meatballs were not like your regular meatballs. I got the ahi tuna as my main lunch item and it was a very generous portion for $26. It is more on the pricey side however, but it was an acquired taste. Someone on my table got the trout for $21 and it was very good and the best he ever had. Another person got avocado toast for $15.  They have many different menus and I really want to go back to try their breakfast, brunch, midday, and dinner menus!"
5,I did not buy the car from Chapman Mazda but they helped me in the process.  They quoted me a  good price of the Mazda 3 right off the bat.  It was easy contacting them via email and phone.  If you are close to their location i would recommend going Chapman Mazda for your new/next Mazda.  Their price is the lowest in the valley that few other dealers can beat.  Ask for Kim Yett. He was very professional and helpful.
5,I just traded in my old mazda for a new one. They gave my mother and I an amazing deal that helped us out.  Amazing staff. Great service and easy process. Bill Lohmeyer is an amazingly honest sales man who is trying to get you the best deal. Would recomend this location and Bill to anyone who would love a mazda!!!
5,"Best place for a blow out. My hair always looks amazing after I visit here. Decor is fresh and nice, staff is good, just a overall good experience."
5,"Late on Saturday night I came home to find Sadie, my 14 lb Yorkie Poo, with hives.  After some research on google, we determined that it was safe to give her 25 mg of Benadryl.  The next morning I awoke to find her in worse condition with swelling around her snout.  We hadn't established a vet since we moved to the NW side of town, so I turned to yelp for a local recommendation.  I called and asked if they could take her as a walk in and they said yes, there are 3 people ahead.  While it did take about an hour to be seen, they were very nice and apologized profusely explaining that it is normally much faster, but there was only 1 doctor working that day.  They were extremely concerned and caring, which helped reduce my anxiety and assured me that we were in good hands.  The vet determined that it looked like an allergic reaction or insect bites and treated her with a steroid shot, antibiotics to administer at home, and instructions to continue the Benadryl for 3 days.  After the shot her swelling immediately began to reduce.  They even called a few days later to check on her status.  I also like that they gave me a price breakdown and options before proceeding with her treatment.  The price was about $100 for visit with shot & antibiotics."
5,"Best pizza I had in Pittsburgh. And certainly the biggest slice. Crust is perfectly crisp, sauce has the perfect about of sweetness, with the perfect amount of cheese on top. 
Service was great as well. 
We will back. And recommend to everyone!"
5,Got the Beef and Chicken Shawarma with 1/2 rice 1/2 salad. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!! Definitely found a new spot for a quick lunch!
5,"Great flavor, fresh ingredients and friendly staff. I usually get the Greek salad with chicken and extra feta but I also like the spicy gyro if I'm in the mood for something a little less healthy."
5,"This spot has become a regular dinner grab for my family during the week.  The fish is always fresh, which is really important!  The protein portions are a little small but still good for the price.  Try the marinated tuna!  It is a perfect combination with the house sauce and you will not be disappointed.  Also, I love that you can get greens mixed with rice as the base.  This variation adds a little different texture and lightens the bowl up on carbs just a bit.  

Have little mouths to feed?  All three of our children love the kids bowls!  They are filling enough for the kids without having leftovers.  

The staff is very friendly.  Every time I walk in the door I am greeted right away by a smile and a hello.  This poki spot is on point.  :)"
5,Delicious pitas and their fries are delicious and fresh as well. Their not your typical thin ones. Their seasoned and thicker. Their very friendly and bring your food to your table if you dine in.
5,"Good before, great now. The mobile pickup section has me feeling like a dope for not ordering ahead. Also, they now have Nitro, so that's nice."
5,"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! Period! For $5 you get the largest slice of hot, fresh pizza you can imagine and a drink! Usually very fast and usually plenty of space to dine-in. Been to other Benny's locations in Virginia (where Benny's originated) and the quality matches the locations in Virginia. No other pizza place in south side, or Pittsburgh, compares to Benny's"
5,"This a hidden gem in Gilbert! Love the bowls with tuna!! Friendly staff, clean and good food."
5,"Was there today--after the recommendation of many locals, took a relative to check it out. Great selection of fresh food in the market and amazing cafe food that came quickly. Pastries are also wonderful. They really need another location in the city so I can visit weekly!!"
5,"Coup de coeur ! (oui, tu as bien entendu, un gros coup de coeur même)

Nostalgique de la cuisine vietnamienne de ma mère, j'avais vraiment envie de (re)goûter au fameux banh mi comme je les aime.

J'avais entendu parlé de Vua Sandwich, sorte de fast-food vietnamien. Il fallait donc que j'y fasse un tour pour avoir mon premier avis là-dessus.
Près du métro Berri-UQAM sur la rue Saint-Denis, le restaurant est ma foi un peu caché : il faut bien apercevoir le panneau !

Le truc, c'est que vous avez le choix, mais vraiment : banh mi donc, d'autres variantes, des entrées variées (rouleaux impériaux/printaniers), sushis et des desserts typiques vietnamiens gourmands. Sans oublier les boissons.

Quand tu croques dans ton banh mi, c'est un bouleversement pour tes papilles gustatives. Tu distingues bien chaque ingrédient concocté soigneusement dans ton sandwich. J'ai été vraiment bluffé : il faut bien prendre son temps pour savourer et apprécier ton plat.

Et la cerise sur le gâteau : des prix vraiment attractifs et défiant toute concurrence, pour des étudiants comme moi!
Pour le banh mi le moins cher, comptez moins de 3$ (taille régulière) et 3,75$ pour la grande taille.

Le service est rapide et efficace. Il vous prépare votre commande sous vos yeux (un peu à la manière d'un Subway) tout en ayant le sourire. Excellent point là dessus.

En revanche, l'intérieur est très petit. On peut manger sur place, mais je vous conseille de prendre à emporter, ce sera plus simple.

Clairement, on mange à sa faim, et ce n'est pas pour me déplaire."
5,"Although I did not buy Mazda at this dealer, I received excellent service when I took my Mazda there for service 10/1/16.

The low traction light and the low air pressure light were coming on.  I had the oil changed and tires rotated at Big O Tires on Happy Valley Rd in north Phoenix.  Apparently, they not only did not do an alignment after rotating the tires, they did not torque the lug nuts enough and one of the wheels could have fallen off!!  Also the fluids that Big O Tires said they ""topped off"" were low enough the tech at Mazda did not believe they were done!!

After fixing all of the problems they washed my car and charged me NOTHING!! 

Side note: Stay away from Big O Tires on Happy Valley!!"
5,This place is the best!!! The pizza is delish!! The slices are huge!!! But the best part was the service so friendly and welcoming..It was our first time and it wont be our last.
5,"Great service!
The colonic was a very good detox and I feel much better then I did before! 
I will be coming back for sure."
5,We stayed in the hotel. The restaurant is beautiful and the view incredible. The service was standout from start to finish. The menu is interesting and varied. We had the Branzino which was tender and nicely seasoned. The beet salad was a touch too acidic for our taste but he oysters were fresh and beautiful.
5,"I love blow out bars. There is nothing better than paying to get a little pampered to feel even more beautiful than you already are. 

I was in Scottsdale for a wedding and looked up local blow out bars and found ""Primp and Blow,"" only 10 minutes from where I was staying. I went with my aunt and we got blow outs on the day of the wedding. I had Tor as my stylist and I loved every minute being there. She was sweet, fun, and knew exactly what I wanted. About 30 minutes later, I was walking out with the voluminous blow out I asked for.

Here is the best part, I got the blow out on Saturday and it was done so well, I was able to keep the style for about 5 days after. That is the best part of a good blow out, and Tor answered all my prayers, left me feeling beautiful and allowed me to sleep an extra 30 minutes everyday!

I wish there was one closer to me in NJ!"
5,Was exactly what I wanted - was craving duck bokki and bi bim bap in a hot stone pot and that's what I got.
5,"Excellent range!

Im not sure what Patty O is crying about in their 1 star review. Maybe she should take the tin foil off of her head.
If you go during a peak time, you WILL be waiting.
If you think you are going to show up on a Saturday, pick any holiday weekend, when its 79 degrees outside, after 10am...and shoot? Not happening.
Be smart people.

Range is set up real nice. Everything runs well..from cease fires, to range going hot, to everything in between.
And don't let a range safety catch you doing something fubar..man they will chew you out!
Price is awesome, especially if you have lots of time, and ammo.
I just got my Ar10 the other day.  Soon as my ammo and bipod are delivered, im gonna head out there and tear some shizzle up"
5,"Went for brunch, price is comparable to other brunch places $14-$18. Give this five stars for the atmosphere and the view. View is to die for, you can see all of downtown core and cn tower. Although it was -30 outside that it hurts to walk around, the sun and floor to ceiling windows on a nice sunny Saturday made it feel like summer all over again. The servers were also super nice and allowed us to chat and soak up the sun for another hr after we paid.

Would definitely want to come back at night for the night view and in the summer for patio weather and we can see this view outside."
5,"Great food at a great price! Fresh seafood and calm, clean atmosphere. Lots of options. I will be coming here often!"
5,"Cheap
Delicious
Quick

I've only ever had their banh mi sandwiches because I can truly say I'm addicted to them. I had their vegetarian banh mi one day when I wanted something cheap. I was blown away by how delicious and filling these sandwiches are! I usually grab 2 (one for me and one for the bf) and it amounts to just under $10.00.

I only ever say 3 or 4 things
""Number 14 (vegetarian banh mi - tofu)""
""Brown bread""
""Everything on it""
""Mild""

And in minutes the deliciousness is brought to the cash.

I guess it's classified as fast food since the whole process is similar to what you'd experience at subway but the taste is far beyond your typical tofu wrap.

Actually this review has me craving one right now..."
5,Always fresh. The best AYCE in mississauga comparing to the other places. Food quality is definitely the best.
5,"My new go to place for hummus, pita, and all sorts of Lebanese food. The Cafe is new and I'm dying to try some of the delicious offerings. Wide selection of dried legumes, olive station, pastas, grains, and pantry staples at a decent price. Huge variety of Greek olive oils too."
5,I've been to Prince Sushi over 3 times and I love it every time. The food is fresh. They serve all-you-can-eat dinners for $25 per person. Everything tastes so good. The restaurant is small so servers move around quickly. The food gets to your table fast. Did I mentioned the food is fresh? It's a hidden gem.
5,"Finally had a chance to try this out and realized what amazing quality is just down the street from us! Definitely a hidden gem in Matthews / Mint Hill! We had sushi and hibachi and both were great. The prices are phenomenal, we will come again for dine in and take out. Clean and very friendly! Well done."
5,"Holy crap! Amazing!
    I know talking about poo and colonics is awkward and taboo but this place has made me feel human again. If u feel sluggish, not yourself, and no joke, have back problems this place will make a huge difference. Worth every penny and The staff is so nice and so helpful.  
     The location is a bit hidden if u don't know the area, but if u call, the staff is happy to direct you. So why are you still reading this. Go already. ; )"
5,"Poke, where have you been all my life? I was thrilled to see that a poke place had opened in the Gilbert/Queen Creek area and even more thrilled when I ordered my first bowl and tasted the deliciousness. I'm a huge sushi lover but I think I now prefer the bowl style as more filling, generous with the fish, and can be totally customized. 

My magic recipe is salmon, tuna, and yellowtail (for a rainbow roll effect) with spicy yuzu citrus and furikake, topped with all the greens, avocado, sriracha, and eel sauce. SO healthy and so yummy that I think I could eat here every day. (Confession: already been here 4 times in the last 2 weeks.)

Poki Point itself is very clean, everything fresh, and casual vibe. Staff is friendly and helpful for poke newbies like myself. And they have a rewards stamp card, which I can see myself filling up in short order!"
5,I saw this place while I was walking in south side with a friend. All I wanted was a slice of cheese pizza. I went in and saw it was $4.. I was surprised but bought a slice anyway. When I got the pizza I was like oh that's why it's $4. The pizza was huge and takes up 2 plates. The pizza tasted delicious and the crust is crispy. I enjoyed this small little gem!
5,"Went here for lunch with a friend and was very satisfied. The employees behind the counter were super friendly, the restaurant was very clean and the food was delicious!  I got a salad bowl with marinated and plain tuna, spicy crab, edamame, green onion, pickled ginger, and seaweed salad. I found the tuna to be nice and fresh, no fishy smell or taste, and all the sides were just as fresh. I also felt they gave a really good amount of protein, so much in fact I didn't even finish it all and I got the smallest size. I definitely will be coming back!"
5,"Came in yesterday for a blow dry for a holiday party. I explained what I wanted and was treated to a great head massage while I was shampooed. There is an iPad provided that has magazines to read while you get your hair done. My hair ended up looking great and lasted all night. Overall, I was very happy with my experience and will be back again."
5,"I was referred to Healing Waters by a close friend that raved about them and now I see why! The care I have received has been incredible but what surprised me most was the exceptional service I received. Every single employee was kind and understanding. They went above and beyond to ensure I had a positive experience. Specifically Marlow, the specialist that has been taking care of me. Her personalized attention and willingness to help improve my results has really made a difference in my health! Thank you so much to Marlow and the Team! You're awesome!"
5,"Just purchased my first Mazda over the weekend and couldn't feel better about it. Easy, no-fuss buying experience, all thanks to Michael Knox and the team at Chapman Mazda. Michael was helpful, fun, professional, and the price we agreed to is the price I paid; no surprises in the financing office. As a former Audi owner, this is something I definitely appreciated!"
5,"Love this place!!! 

Their cheese is amazing and they really pile on the toppings so if you're not used to it or it's not your thing then try to be minimal with your topping selection.   I learned not to order ground beef on my pizza because it's just too much but I really enjoy a simple pizza from them because the ingredients are fresh and tasty. 

The colonel's pizza (ranch dressing instead of sauce with strips of chicken .. ) is really an amazing pizza,. Once I accidentally received this pizza as mine was mixed up with another person's order but I gotta say it was amazing and I never would have ordered something like this myself, so thank you!"
5,LOVE IT and very much worth it's price and service.  Came all the way from HAWAII to expereince and love it and will always go there whenever I am in Vegas great friendly staff that really cares of the well-being!!!  Aloha and Mahalo - Monica the Hawaii Doggie Mama aka Cocojor!!!
5,"Excellent slices of thin crust pie with tasty options like garlic and mushroom or chicken, ranch and cheese. Huge portions of pie and great place to stop in and have some good pizza right out of the oven. Great ambiance too."
5,If you like thick hardy pizza towered with toppings this is the place for you! Good bang for your buck and some unique topping and sauce choices
5,Amazing food and very friendly service. Ordered a mixed grill plate and was not disappointed. Definitely worth a try!
5,"Really great food, staff is friendly and gives great pointers on what to order and their personal favorite mixes. I would love to come back here and I'm from Tucson about an hour and a half away."
5,The guy at the counter was really nice. I was happy to find a place that had healthy food (not to me tips delicious green food in particular) open at 9am. That extra hour earlier than most restaurants open around this area made all the difference for me and because of that I will be returning! The place was very spacious and clean. The menu was clear and organized. They were friendly. The food was great. I like that they had several options for vegetarian food as many Greek places do. And they make the food themselves instead of hiring Mexicans to fry their food for them like most other establishments. I am happy to support a restaurant like this!
5,We stopped here on our way to Sedona. We were not disappointed. The jalapeño hummus was memorable. We could not stop eating it. I had the spicy gyro & my friend had the regular one. They were both superb. Best gyro I've had in a while. I would recommend stopping by if you live or are passing through Phoenix.
5,Loved it! Got salmon and tuna bowl with rice. You can add SO many different things to the bowls. Make it as spicy as you want. Love that in addition to all that....you can add a scoop of spicy or regular crab meat! Woo hoo! Great customer service as well! Wish it was closer to my house!!! :(
5,"I just love this place. Everything I've had from their cafe menu has been fantastic. I just finished scarfing down the Lebanese House Salad with Gyro meat added, and it was so delicious that I felt compelled to finally leave a review. The salad is so fresh and packed to the brim with toppings and meat, plus it came with ample pita pieces. Well worth the price. Of course, I also scooped up a couple pieces of Baklava - their's is the best I've ever had. On top of the delicious food, the service is always so friendly. I also love perusing amongst the grocery items while I wait for my food. My only complaint, and it's really not that big of a deal, is that I wish they were open a little bit later. However, I understand the desire to close up and get some work/life balance. This place is not only a Brookline gem, but a Pittsburgh gem. Make the trip! You won't be disappointed."
5,"One of my favorite spots to get a gyro in Phx - So hard to find good/real Greek food here.  Usually stop by at lunch time - great staff, great food"
5,Finally we found a great Mediterranean breakfast with Lebanese hospitality. The price was so cheap and great taste. We always come her for grocery shopping and lunch food. Yummy
5,They have best Korean style Chinese food in Pittsburgh! And you can use Samsung pay at this restaurant!!
5,"My husband and I have been here several times and  have loved it.  If they keep up the quality, cleanliness, and customer service they will be very successful.  The one thing the last time I was there there that was rather annoying especially since it was my birthday was that both my husband and I wasted avocado on our bowls and they did not have anymore prepared on Friday night ready for customer and we would have had to wait 10 minutes which lets be be for real by the size of the container it would have been longer then 10 minutes which goes back to why are you not top of your food prep when all your food is RAW!  Still love the poke though.  I just prepare myself that they will not have all the yummy stuff I love and when they do it's a bonus.  But to be truly honest the only issue I have ever had was the avocado and they had it it was just not prepared. The fish is always fresh!!!!"
5,"Poke point was really good! I had the marinated tuna and it was yummy! I had it on salad with house sauce and spicy mayo, I thought it was really good! My daughter had the chicken and my niece had shrimp! They loved poki point! We will definitely be back!"
5,"Yum!!!
Great little quick bite& worth every cent.
Nice little walk from Chinatown.. definitely must try if you're in the area."
5,Great food...great taste. Ordered the chicken shavarma and curry chicken platter.. tastes great!
5,"Holy Sh!t (literally)!  This place rocks!!  My husband has recently lost over 30 pounds and realized that he had a build up of toxins in his body.  A friend suggested that he visit Healing Waters.  I know my husband isn't feeling well if he is considering getting a colonics treatment.  Before I knew what happened, he was booked and leaving the house.  I am usually the one who does ALL of the crazy things in our household and I couldn't believe he was beating me to this one but rather glad so that I could hear all about it.  He came home and looked amazing!!  He told me he felt about 70% better and that he had scheduled a colonics for both of us in 2 days.  I got a little nervous but decided, what the heck.  Two days later we arrive and are greeted by the receptionist and colonic specialist Diona, both are fantastic!  Diona made me feel so comfortable.  The first time she tells you to ""push"" in front of her, it's a little awkward but you get over that very quickly and before you know it you are having full conversations with her while pushing everything out.  I was amazed at the things that came out (yes, you watch them go by) and afterwards I had more energy than I had had in a long time.  It truly is an amazing experience and we will be returning weekly for awhile and then switch to monthly.  Think of it like changing the oil in your car :)"
5,"Wasn't expecting such an eye opening experience,but I did at Healing Waters. Everyone was very welcoming and my attendant ,Michelle was very efficient and had a wonderful energy. I will be visiting again soon. All My expectations were exceeded !!!"
5,"My wife and I are both of Korean descent. We have eaten at the best Korean restaurants in Northern New Jersey in the Palisade Park and Fort Lee area and we can both unequivocally say that Korea Garden has food that is comparable to those restaurants. We have had the bi bim bap which was the best ever. Other outstanding dishes were the cham pong (spicy seafood noodle soup), soon du bu (soft tofu soup), kim chi jii gae (kimchi stew), bul go gi (marinated beef), ja jang myun (noodles in peking sauce), tang soo yook (sweet and sour beef) and the sweet and sour chicken. It is rare to find a restaurant that can make Korean as well as Korean-Chinese dishes this well. The service was fine. The owner and waitstaff are very nice. Try it you'll love it. Don't be fooled by the exterior or neighborhood."
5,Incredible pricing for all day range use.  Very big range with options for all types of target practice.
5,"I was not expecting the world coming to this restaurant but our server Tamara was exceptional. We were a large group (9) of ladies out for our friend's birthday and not the easiest group to deal with. She was calm, cool, collected, and confident throughout our entire service. She gave great recommendations and guided our experience for those of us who were first-time diners. From a manager in the restaurant industry - I would be so proud to have someone like her on my team. 

Give this girl a raise."
5,"Best Sushi around! Me and my wife haven't been out in a while and were so impressed with service and selection! We went on a Monday and they had specials on sushi and sashimi.  Chef let us try a jalapeño and cream cheese roll (which now is what we are going back for) and it was Delish!  Loved everything! I had some Saki, which was reasonably priced. We got full on some gourmet sushi and then had a hibachi dish as entree. It comes with a creamy white sauce which is to die for! My wife loved that the Chef and staff said Hello so nicely to everyone walking in! We will definitely be back soon!!!"
5,"Pleasant staff , with soccer playing on the tele. Pretty wide section of food  . The salad was gyro meat so much food . From what I can tell with people around me everything comes stacked so you will leave full. Now the pricing is pretty normal . The special was a gyro with your choice fries or salad and a drink for 7.99. A salad with meat and a drink ran me 6 bucks . But if you are in area, or waiting for your partner to finish shopping at last chance I recommend going to this place"
5,"I have to say, I was very nervous at first but Sue accommodated and eased me into the process. The colonic left me feeling much better and I did the hyperbaric oxygen chamber as well. I liked that they provide a probiotic formula in the colonic, an all greens mixture drink as well as tea. 
Both experiences were intimidating at first but the help I received eased much of my tension. I'm due to go back next week!"
5,"Fortunate to have Benny's here in the Southside. A VA gem that snuck over the Mason-Dixon Line. Ridiculous large 30"" pizza NY Style, cannot be beat."
5,Authentic food great service. The quality of the meat is amazing! Complimentary olives and bread gets your taste buds ready for the rest of the meal. If you want to experience authentic Turkish cuisine outside turkey then this is your place!
5,"Seriously, great food!  Everything was delicious and the staff was so helpful for my first time.  Can't wait to go back, again and again!"
5,Had their grape leaves and gyro at the farmers market yesterday and it was soooo good!!!
5,"Poki Point opened 4 days ago and I've come 2 times since then. Great Poki spot in the east valley with great fresh ingredients, a clean environment and friendly knowledgeable staff. I will definitely be a regular here and recommend it to anyone."
5,"Heal Hydrate Cleanse Renew Purify!! Love the colon hydrotherapy there, it's addicting!!!"
5,"A top choice for yummy food, good prices and super efficient service.

If you go after 9pm you get a 30% discount on most of their food.   Good for packed lunches the next day."
5,Very informative and friendly. Not many vets will examine a tree frog and even less know as much as Dr. Kollias. My husband and I were super impressed! We will be bringing in our dog as well because we felt super comfortable at this vet. I would highly recommend this vet to everyone.
5,"Bring your platinum card, this place is pricey.  

That being said, the view, atmosphere and quality of the food and cocktails is phenomenal.  The pool is slightly awkwardly located, but definitely adds to the stunning views over the city and waterfront.  

All the salads are fantastic and well layered.  The skewers are well cooked and seasoned.    It don't forget to leave room for desert and the delightful tres leches."
5,"Braden curled my hair, loved it! Received many compliments :)"
5,"I love sushi, and have had my share of mediocre meals when looking for good sushi.  I wasn't sure about Osaka, but decided to give it a shot one lunch hour about four months ago - I'm really glad that I did!  I've definitely become a repeat customer.  

The sushi is fresh and expertly rolled - it doesn't fall apart.  The crunch roll is VERY yummy.  I usually get the sushi and sashimi bento box, it runs about $11 and comes with salad and soup, and more than enough sushi and sashimi - I've never gone away hungry and more than once have been unable to finish it all!  

The service is decent, it's never been bad.

I absolutely recommend this to my friends!"
5,Dylan just made my daughters birthday we had such bad luck today and he made it much better thank you so much! Our drinks are wonderful as usual they are always busy but my favorite Starbucks store to go to
5,"This place is really cool! 
My husband and I came here with one of our friends yesterday. We have several different types of guns and it was our friends first time going shooting at an outside range. 
The shooting range is in a great location. It's right off the I17 and carefree highway. 
It seemed like a very organized operation. We watched a video upon arrival of the ground rules. We then got to pick out our targets! The prices were great for the targets and the admission. We really loved that it was so inexpensive and its unlimited time. When we got to our numbers slot we were able to set up our targets. We had a lot of great help from Jerry. He explained everything!!! Very helpful! We also had problems with one of our guns and was trying to help all he could. All the volunteers/workers were great! Very friendly as well! They also helped with my and my friends grip and stance! I can't wait to bring my family back who haven't been shooting before! This is a great place for beginners and the novice!!"
5,"Great, relaxing atmosphere with soothing music and a hospitable host who offered teas and water. Waited a few minutes as we were early for our room to be ready. We did the ionic foot bath which pulls out the toxins from your body and allows the practitioner to determine what's the cause of many aliments occurring in our body. Enjoyed the tea and the soak and was informed of what needed to occur in order for things to be settled in our body. They also have specials for combinations of services they offer. Groupon also has deals every once in awhile. I've also had many colonic sessions here as well. Those were worth it!"
5,"Excellent customer service. No hassle! Michael and everyone at the dealership were friendly, professional and kind. Seriously such a quick and hassle free process!!! Stoked for my new SUV and my continued business relationship with this dealership! I would recommend friends and family!"
5,Been coming here for their roti and curry brisket for years!!! Has not changed one bit! Still amazing still delicious still the same price!
5,"Not only is this place great quantity value for your money (especially on the super cheap lunch specials) but the food is high quality and delicious. The sushi, hibachi, and everything in between are all 10/10, and there's nothing on the whole list of appetizers that I haven't liked. Service is fast as well, and as long as the restaurant isn't packed and your party isn't enormous, you will frequently get your food before you've finished your soup and salad. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone."
5,Biggest pizza ever! Service was quick and friendly and it was well worth the price. Ordered by phone and it was ready for pick up in less than 30 min.
5,"Love Bri! She is the best. I won't let any one else dry my hair :) I've been going to Bri for 3 years now, and I will continue."
5,Osaka is so good and reasonably priced! The staff is also extremely nice and helpful. I love their hibachi chicken and avocado rolls.
5,"Everything we have had here is really good!  You can't beat their lunch special for both sushi and hibachi. You always get a warm welcome when you walk in and the owners are very friendly. We love coming here and they are a welcomed spot in Mint Hill! 

Try the stuffed jalapenos, they are awesome!"
5,"Visited this newly open business on 8/16 and have to say we fell in love with it. 

Everything was clean and ingredients were fresh.  I chose a large bowl with Ahi, salmon and marinated ahi with house sauce on a bed of greens and brown rice.  For toppings, I chose cilantro, edamame, avocado, seaweed salad and cucumbers. Topped it off with spicy mayo.    I now have dreams about this bowl!  So good!

We will be back and recommend to friends."
5,"SO cute and very asthetically pleasing. Located on the 44th floor of the Bisha Hotel. Got seated near the rooftop view. 

Didn't have a reservation but got seated at the bar while we waited. Only waited about an hour (which was okay because of the last minute decision to go)

Food was soooo delicious! I tried the avocado toast and the coconut pancakes. The toast was delicious and the cherry tomatoes weren't too sour and a good touch. The bread itself was cut thick to hold all the toppings put on the toast. Highly recommended. The coconut pancakes were so sweet and delicious, thin easily foldable pancakes topped with small dices of mango, pineapple and kiwi. It was also sprinkled with a coconut shreds. Very dessert tasting and if you have a sweet tooth in the morning/afternoon, I would recommended this.

Would love to come back for brunch again and maybe even dinner! Food was great and the restaurant was very beautiful."
5,"Yummy! Variety, convenience and enterprising spirit, a rare combination for downtown Montreal imho. Enough said. 

Apparently I need to be a little more long winded to qualify as a yelp review. So here you go, more words: Sandwiches, sushi and Vietnamese dishes are made fresh. If it's more than 8 hrs old they give you a 30% discount, i.e. after 6pm-ish! You'd be hard pressed to find that kind of enterprising spirit in Montreal.

Sandwiches are as good and almost as cheap as on Spedina in Toronto, or Bolsa in Westminster/Garden Grove.
I've been going to their original location on St. Denis for 5 years and finally I can now go during work hours to this new downtown location. So looks like these guys will not be the typical fly by night deli that plagues la centreville. Bon courage mes amies!"
5,Great pizza .. very filling quick service ... I always order these guys through the Livery and I must say there is not one person in my home that has not complemented pizza. Each piece of sliced must weigh at least 5 lb LOL you definitely get your money's worth from this establishment the very courteous and timely I have never had an issue with it and I know numerous people that order from this company and they are fabulous.
5,"Super delicious!  After having mediocre experiences at other Poki places in The Valley this place got it right!  Super fresh ingredients, tasty sauce and extremely quick in and our service make this place a winner!  Had a large bowl with everything and the kitchen sink in it.  Very fast fish, excellent sauces on a bed of fresh spring mix.  Super Yummy!"
5,"Since moving to Pittsburgh four years ago, I have been searching for great pizza.  I'm looking for a thin crust, chewy and crispy, with the appropriate amount of sauce and cheese. The problems I've run into with most Pittsburgh pizza are many. In most cases, there is an obscene amount of cheese and the topping are underneath it, which means the cheese can bond with the sauce and adhere to the crust. When you bite into it, the toppings cause that thick later of cheese to slide off in one bite. Drives me crazy. Aiello's is good, but its not great. You know who makes GREAT pizza in Pittsburgh? Benny Fierro's on the Southside.  First of all, their pizzas are enormous. One slice is just about enough. Next, they make it right - thin layer of sauce, the right amount of cheese and toppings on top, where they are supposed to go. Finally, everything tastes perfect. The sauce has good flavor and the crust is delicious.  Get a gargantuan pie from Benny Fierro's for your next football party. You will not be disappointed."
5,"Went in today to carry out a couple of orders and this place did not disappoint.

I was very happy to find that the Value, the Selection, the Service, and the Portions were Top Notch.

This is a ""fast food"" and they do it well.

I will be back!"
5,"Walked into this place just as they were about to close but managed to score a delicious grilled chicken Banh Mi sandwich for 4$ before they did!
Variety of sandwiches and other options as well to choose from as well. 
Really liked how fast they made our food and how friendly there were. Def worth checking out!"
5,"delicious!!! really fresh ingredients, everything tastes like its made from scratch."
5,"The food here is delicious. Amazing sushi. The place is small and packed. The line was out the door, it was a Saturday at 6:30 pm, so I should have expected it. We waited 50 minutes to be seated but we had nothing else to do, so I didn't really mind and there were so many people there, I figured it would be worth the wait.
The servers were really friendly and I loved every single kind of sushi we ordered. It was like every new one that came out was my new favourite. 

I like it much better than Wasabi, even though the place is very small. We looked over the menu while waiting and ordered as soon as we sat down. We ordered way too much and had to ask the server to cancel the rest of our order.

I had a very enjoyable dinner and left stuffed silly. I will definitely visit Prince Sushi when I am back in the area. I liked it very much.

$20 for AYCE dinner Saturday."
5,"Tried this place today with my cousin. The poke was good. The atmosphere was nice and clean. The service was prompt. The only thing is that the portion was very small for the price. I expected a little more than what I got. If I am craving poke, I would go here, but not all the time. I'll have to substitute for chipotle, at least it was $5 cheaper and you get more for your money. If it was priced lower, I would come more often."
5,One of the best in and out vietnamese sandwiches places. Couldn't tell you about their whole  menu. The Vietnamese sandwiches quality and selection is as good as it needs to be for the price. Staff don't waste any time.
5,"Had the colonic cleanse and ionic foot bath detox.  
Was a great Deal! I was very depleted I noticed a few hours later, but I'm so much better after replenishing with probiotics and water hydration. I  feel so much cleaner and have not had any more digestive problems since. It's been more than 2 months now. My wife was happy with her results as well and wants to do a biannual cleanse now. Definitely worth it."
5,"We purchased 2 guinea pigs from petsmart. The staff at lone mountain animal hospital asked about our experience with petsmart and what information we were given after our purchase, which was nothing.. the staff then printed out information for us and told us a trusted site to look at any information about our guinea pigs. I am so grateful for their help. We had to bring our guinea pig in for an extra claw that was hanging off. They took care of it and then called the next morning to make sure everyone was okay.

They are super caring."
5,"The reviews for this place stand true. If you haven't tried Turkish before, try Pasha out. The staff is very helpful and attentive. We wanted to try a lot of stuff so we went for the sampler appetizer, and sampler kebabs. The pide and the kunefe )dessert) are really worth trying."
5,Extremely friendly and patient. My onyx was attacked and required extensive medical care which took approx 8 months to treat. (Contracted MRSA in addition to the attack). They were understanding and patient in reference to monetary payments. They advise us on the best treatment options and completely explained all risks and answered my many many questions. I feel comfortable bringing my babies there for check ups shots and all other required visits.
5,Coleen was great. She stayed with me the whole time to massage my stomach. She was very helpful and kept me relaxed. I really like the Libbe open system..everyone should try it. I felt soooo good afterwards.
5,"We found this restaurant through Yelp. The first time we decided to stop by and do take out because the kids fell asleep driving back from the science centre. We ordered a dish that had 3 different types of meats. Grilled chicken, Lamb kabobs and grilled beef. It was soooo delicious. Today, we went to the science centre again and stopped by to eat there. The service was very good (prompt and accommodating). I was bummed out that a few of the lamb dishes were not available, but what we ordered was still very good. I can't remember the name of all the dishes, but we ordered the zucchini pancake, shepards salad, the Turkish style lamb gnocchi and the amazing desert that has ice cream and cheese. We will definitely go back again when visiting the science centre."
5,"this is my second favorite sushi place, right after 168
the food is fresh and amazing, the staff is nice and attentive my only problem with this place is that its way to small they should get a bigger location !!"
5,We have 3 dogs in our family anytime we go there the dogs are treated so well.  If you have any questions they are happy to answer and explain.  I recommend them to family and friends.  Everybody I have encountered there are very helpful.
5,"Food Heaven! Don't miss out
This place works as a grocery store and a cafe.. And believe me when I say the have amazing food here..
The Mana'eesh are amazing, so is the Shawarma! I don't think you can go wrong here.
I had the Shawarma it was out of this world good.. The pita alone is so fresh, so tender.. Just delicious.
Also the prices here are pretty good"
5,"We found this wonderful place years ago with our last boxer, and returned when we got a new puppy last year.  Every vet and staff member at LMAH treats our dog like he is the best dog ever, with lots of love and attention.  Our pup needed emergency surgery last year, and they answered all our crazy pet parent questions with patience and understanding.  We have also boarded him there, and he thinks he is going to camp every time."
5,Their hummus is so good!!! Not expensive and very fresh! Also have very fresh produce and very good gyros
5,"This is a real 5 star review from someone not affiliated with Pitaland. I've been going to this place since it was next door to Party Cake Shop and called Chahines. Good luck finding better pita bread or spinach pies. I live out of state now, but when I go home, I load up on the spinach pies. Seriously, it's worth a drive from across town. And the hummus which I am eating now is likely the best i've ever had."
5,"My Husband and I went here tonight and we were absolutely blown away! The Poki was AMAZING!! Very fresh, lots of options and they give you a LOT of food! Not only that, the service was impeccable. Only thing we wish is that there was a smaller size option, we both ordered regular sizes and were absolutely stuffed! We will be back, I won't be surprised if we are here multiple times a week!!!"
5,"Pasha authentic  restaurant is the best  turkish cuisine, I've ever seen in Toronto. The warm environment and friendly service is making the enjoyable hours unforgettable and gives you the expectations. I tried ""Beyti kebab"" and as the desert  ""künefe with ice cream"" on the top and I can only say that if you haven't  had that experience, I suggest you to come by and add new tastes into your lives."
5,"Stephanie did a great job with the wash/scalp massage!!! Very impressed. I have curly thick long hair, and she did a great job styling it. 

The salon workers were all very kind, on time, and sure to make sure I loved my hair...which I did!"
5,Ahhhh Pitaland! I love this place everyone is friendly who works here and very knowledgeable about products. They even offer tips on any dishes or how to prepare something. The bakery department is wonderful I love love LOVE there pistachio baklava!! To me personally I think it deserves a award because it's the best in Pittsburgh area hands down! They even have a small little olive bar area where you can take some home. They have tons of dry food and cold/frozen food as well. I always recommend this place to people looking for that hidden gem!
5,"Such a great find in Matthews/Mint Hill. The sushi is always fresh. My favorite is the Alaska Roll with salmon, cream cheese and avocado. They also have the best hibachi veggies I have found anywhere. Everything is seasoned really well. The service is always great, and the owners are very kind. They have great lunch and sushi deals during the week as well so it doesn't break the bank. Highly recommend!"
5,"I'm giving them 5 stars because I loved the crazy salmon roll and my hibachi chicken was NOT dry.  Whoever the chef is, hats off to you!"
5,"Ok what I liked about this place is so new age. It's very relaxing when you walk in. 
My therapist made me feel comfortable as she lubed a tiny tube and I eased myself down with the relaxing sounds of the ocean. The room smelled kinda like potpourri and a puffcloud of powder....
She slowly turned the water on with a clear mixture of good bacteria as she filled me with her warm liquid. I felt myself tighten but she rubbed my stomach and helped me relax as I filled till I couldn't take it any more. 
Mmmmm I moaned as I released the fluid that filled me into a covered bowl and I got to watch a waterslide rush next to me of toxins and crayolas and matchbox cars. Little children I've eaten at preschools swam by waving in happiness of their freedom. 
Yes...Healing waters. I felt so clean and refreshed and energized after I left you. I can't wait to go back!."
5,"This is such a hidden gem. The pizza I had was veggie and it was amazing. It's how pizza should always taste. The crust was perfect and the amount of toppings you get is worth the money. Even that, the price wasn't too bad. Overall a really nice place."
5,"Gluten-Free paradise! This is the first GF meal I've had with a ""bread-y"" component (pancakes) that didn't make me miss the real thing. First of all they have a pretty good GF selection and most of thier syrups are GF. Second, well thier GF pancakes made me cry. I literally teared up. They were better than the NOT GF kind. Amazing! Third, the waitress we got was extremely knowledgeable about GF and answered several of my questions before I even asked. 

Easiest stress-free Gluten-Free dining experience I've ever had.

Thanks for a wonderful Saturday brunch for the family."
5,"I'm a recent convert to the poke life and can't get enough.  This place is tucked away and doesn't look incredibly exciting, but a total gem.   The staff was really friendly and the food was fresh and delicious.  

This plus the proximity to my house is going to get it into the regular rotation.  Delicious, affordable and convenient.

I'll be back, and often."
5,"Great knowledgeable staff.  Always friendly,  true animal lovers.  I've been taking Sasha my mixed breed pitty,  two cats and a yellow belly slider turtle for years.  

The vets here have kept all my pets happy and healthy."
5,"For the money, it's fantastic. I'm vegetarian, and finding a great sandwich can be tricky. I LOVED their vegetarian sandwich. So freakin' tasty. Also, we got 3 (!!) homemade drinks, as when you buy 2, you get a third free, so we tried a milky iced tea with jelly, lemonade with berries and the sweet basil seed concoction. I loved them all. My husband and I ate well, all fr $12. Can't wait to go back and sample more goodies!"
5,"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! I've gone just about every week, sometimes twice a week for the last 2 years.  I absolutely LOVE everyone that works here!  I have very difficult ethnic-like curly, frizzy dry hair and I come out of the salon with silky, smooth, shiny hair within 35 minutes. I never have to wait & all the stylists are very, very friendly.  I don't understand why some comments say anything negative about the staff...that must have been  ""old"" staff. Dee, the manager is so wonderful and super kind! The sylists, Taryn, David, Ashley, Danielle, etc. etc. are ALL phenomenal!  Primp & Blow is a MUST & a life saver for me!  They do everyday looks or styles for special events, pictures, interviews, etc. Stylists do not push products on you...which I LOVE."
5,"First time here. Great service. Nice view. Side portions were large I liked the green beans. Chicken looked good too. Salmon was alright, nothing spectacular and had no sides. the for 2 portion is actually for one person unless you don't eat much. It's a great place to hang out. Five stars for service and vibe."
5,"Great food. I went and got a 10-inch Banh Mi for less than 5$. Tasted great! They also have other stuff, such as fried rice and sushi rolls, although those are prepackaged and slightly pricier. They have lovely decor with bright, vivid colours that really give a trendy vibe to the place. The shop is actually pretty small, though, so there are only a couple tables to sit down at.

(fyi they only accept credit for purchases of 5$ or more)"
5,"Our go to place for sushi. Fast fresh good flavours. AYCE and menu ordering, I like that. Great for takeout, they are always quick filling the order.  We love the salad dressing and the flavour on the spicy selections.  It can get busy so don't show up at the dinner hour and expect to sit immediately."
5,"This place is my new go to sushi spot! It's so yummy and I get to build my very own bowl. I've gone a few times and the employees are friendly and helpful. In addition, I had to call for a menu because my baby just fell asleep and I didn't want to wake her up. The employee Arlinda kindly brought me a menu, I ordered over the phone and she brought me my food. Thank you so so much!!!"
5,"It had been about 15-20 years since I've been to Ben Avery shooting facility but I decided to go out just this last Sunday. I was impressed by all the improvements they had made since the last time I was there. The biggest thing that I liked was their consistent approach to safety. I actually wasn't thinking during a cease fire and just walked to the table to put my ear phones down and they were on the loud speaker in less than a second explaining that rule out loud. They also did it in a way that I wasn't pointed out and chastised for being the one who messed up. I noticed that was how they did it throughout the day whenever something like that happened. I guess what I'm saying is that you can tell that safety is their number one concern there, but they do it in a manner that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. I think this helps when it comes to safety because the shooter (Especially a beginner) doesn't feel all flustered worrying about being pointed out for doing something wrong and can focus on the task at hand, and doing it right. Anyway, it has definitely made a ton of improvements over the years, the people there are very professional and are quick to help you or answer any questions that you might have. The price is reasonable and they have whatever you need there just in case you forget anything. Very much recommend this place for taking the guns out shooting, especially if you have to sight in scopes. You will be better off sighting your scopes in here rather than an indoor range for sure. You can set your target anywhere from 10 yards out to 100 yards out at the same shooting table. They even have a 1,000 yard range, but you might want to call them about that one before you go because I didn't see anyone over there when we were there. Awesome job Game and Fish for making this a better place to shoot!"
5,Had one of the best meals in a beautiful Afghan restaurant. The experience made me feel like I was a royalty. Guaranteed to please all foodie senses out there. They have awesome hot sauce dips and their meats are cooked well. Scarborough deserves this beautifully decorated restaurant for family & friends to enjoy
5,Best pizza I have ever had in the whole of GTA.... Their crust is soft and the pizza is rich and flavorful... Their cheese is very rich and each pizza is unique
5,Very very good food and service. Their appetizers is super good; very specific. The pickled choices are terrific too. Really enjoyed it.
5,Went twice this week and want to go again.  Food is fresh and a great variety of flavors.  I highly recommend their house sauce.  So glad this place opened close to home.
5,"My colleagues brought me there and it's a good place for curry stuff at such reasonable price. Paying 8 dollars you will get a big bowl of curry beef and you can finish the rice easily with the curry soup. Big, Yummy and good price"
5,"I was so impressed when me and my boyfriend got take out from here! Great prices and the food is huge. The employee that assisted me was extremely friendly and greated me right away. I ordered pita and humus, a falafel, and a gyro and they were amazing! The interior is clean and very nice. They have seating in their cafe. I will certainly be back!! Pitaland is an absolute gem!"
5,"This is the place to go for colon hydrotherapy! Clean, friendly, and very accommodating if you like your privacy. I personally want to be alone for basically the full session so this place is a life saver. As someone who used to go to the bathroom once a week, colonics cleansed me of all those toxins"
5,"I leased a vehicle entirely over the phone. It was quick, efficient, and ended in a great deal (considerably below Edmunds TMV). Car was then delivered to me in Tucson. Bill Lohmeyer really went the extra mile, literally! He even retrieved and shipped some important belongings I carelessly left in the trunk of my lease return. I highly recommend Chapman and Bill Lohmeyer."
5,"Shannon is amazing, I was going on business and she made my hair look amazing. Great decor, friendly staff... I would definitely recommend this place! Not sure all the low ratings..you will not go wrong with Shannon!"
5,"My husband and I moved to Toronto about 4 years ago and were struggling to find even a decent pizza place. We stumbled upon Pino Pizza last month when my in-laws were visiting and we were in Oshawa. We yelp'd it and took a chance. No looking back! The pizza is awesome, portions amazing and just overall amazing! It's so unassuming when you see it (it's kind of hidden). I can call it a hidden gem!"
5,"Pita Land, olive you.

I don't know why I don't come here everyday.

It's a great little market, where you can get delicious Mediterranean/Lebanese/Middle Eastern groceries. They have fresh made hummus, dips, pita bread,  you name it! And everything's reasonably priced (don't have to shell out too many leaves for my grape leaves ...) 

Best of all, in the last year they opened a cafe inside. It's damn delicious and cheap to boot! The gyro, lamb burger, french fries with rosemary dip, flat breads are all excellent and won't disappoint!"
5,"Got my weaves flexed and blowouts all at once. I'm a happy camper as long as jimmy brings home chipotle. 

That is of course as long as it's not chipotle from the grayhawk location, because I'll be asleep before they finish wrapping the burrito (they're too slow)

Anyhow. I love my blowouts ... Fantastic job girls, even though no one seems to like my weave."
5,"So most of us do not like dealing with Car dealerships, and I normally always call the internet department as you seem to get better service and are not subjected to the salesperson who swoops in as you walk from parking your car!!

We were in the final stage of deciding WHICH car my wife wanted and wanted to test drive one last model as she had a day off and we were running Errands.  We stopped to test drive one more model and decided that was the one......   We were working with another dealership, but they had very little stock. 

So before we walked out the door, they asked what they could do, with very low pressure. We told them and they surprised us by responding positively. 
After some back and forth, we ended up getting that car that day (they had one in the color we wanted with just 4 miles on it). 

So not a bad experience!!! Ask for Daisha Doolittle. Not only is she a salesperson, she actually is a Mazda zealot!! LOL!!!!"
5,"Absofrigginamazeballs!  This place is the bomb!  Great food, friendly service and a little grocery in the side. Who could ask for more!?!  The falafel pita will astound. Yummers!"
5,"Do you like pistol shooting, rifle shooting, 1000 yard shooting, archery or sporting clays? Well if you answered yes to any of these then you need to check this place out. Not only do they offer it all but the staff is amazing. We have been twice to the sporting clays area and we will be returning for more."
5,Went to Ahipoki Bowl and learned poki bowls are okay... but then I went to Poki Point and realized I LOVE POKI Poki Point is the best poki place I have gone to and the staff is always so polite Love love love Poki Point!
5,Just had the Pizza Pino Special but asked for thin crust.  My new favourite thing you gotta try it
5,"A friend talked me into doing this so I was quite nervous.No need to be, great staff, very professional,most of all CLEAN. I am impressed and more than pleased that I went. Yes, I will return."
5,"Pita Land has the best pitas in the city, hands down.

They also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, technically, they are not pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls. Which is even better. 

I brought a $8 jar of tahini from Giant Eagle and came in here two days later and saw I could have brought twice as much from here for the same price. Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.

They also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good."
5,"Pasha is a fantastic Turkish experience. We stumbled upon this place and were incredibly thrilled with our food and experience. 

The service was so very warm and hospitable -- we were well attended to, not rushed, and felt as if we were being welcomed into someone's home. In addition, the food came quickly. The decor was formal, with colourful drapes and eclectic ceiling tiles. Definitely a great place to bring guests. The food is even served on wood cutting boards.

We came on a weekday, so we didn't get to experience the full menu.  However, we loved the Turkish ravioli, which comes in a yogourt sauce.  The food is all Halal, so that was a plus.

All in all, a place we'll definitely be coming back to again and again!"
5,My husband and I love this place! The servers are always so nice. We love the crispy salmon roll sushi and steak hibachi. If they are not busy they'll even bring out some amazing appetizers on the house for your table.
5,"Dr. Taylor Parker has been wonderful to all of my rodents. They all feel very calm and happy to be in her presence. When there is an issue, she is always completely professional and is thorough to explain both the problem and different ways to solve it. She is the reason I keep coming back to Lone Mountain. Great Job Doc!"
5,"Prince is King! 

They might as well change their name from Prince Sushi to King Sushi because this place is amazing. It's definitely my favourite ayce sushi place in the GTA. I have been here several times, and each time was just as satisfying as the last. Prince is located in the Courtney park plaza next to AMC Theaters and Wasabi. It's a small little restaurant and always busy, so I recommend making reservations if you plan on eating here. I don't know what it is about this place, but the sushi is amazing. I would compare the quality with not all you can eat places.

The first time I went here with my gf, we ordered while standing in line LOL. Yes, that's how hungry we were but it worked. As soon as we sat down, the waitress took our order and we were served almost instantly! 

So tip: if you have to wait in line, grab a menu and start ordering. Just don't make the same mistake we did and order everything on the menu. We had to flag someone down to cancel the rest of our order which is probably the most shameful thing an aycer can do. 

Regardless, this place is great. I just wish it were a little bigger inside so they could sit more people at once. Oh well, I'd definitely come here again (and again)."
5,Had a great experience here. Staff was helpful in picking out what to add to my bowl and house sauce was delicious! Will definitely go back!
5,"My wife and I attended the Sure Shots class for novices last night and it was excellent. Jennifer Tipton is in charge of the class, but there are a number of outstanding instructors participating including Katherine, Kevin, Russ, and Rob. The classroom instruction included safety practices, firing range protocol, and hands on training with rifles, revolvers, and semi-automatic hand guns. Each class participant knows how to properly load, hold, aim, fire, and unload each type of gun prior to heading over to the range to actually fire the weapons. While on the range there is ample one-on-one assistance to ensure a successful shooting experience for all participants. As one with cross dominant eyesight (right handed with left eye dominance) I was shown how and practiced shooting right handed and left handed.  Throughout the class all instructors were knowledgeable and personable. We certainly felt at ease and are looking forward to shooting at Ben Avery in the future. Kudos to Jennifer and the other instructors for a great class."
5,"I am so incredibly happy that this opened on my side of town. This is the BEST poke in the valley, and previously Ali Poke Bowl was my favorite. They have every topping, every type of protein, and the flavors are right on. I have so far been to every poke restaurant that has opened within a 45 min radius of me. Their prices are not any higher and it's bigger servings than other poke places too."
5,"Got to the Shotgun Skeet/Trap area at 7am on New Year's Eve... the ladies behind the counter were VERY polite and helpful. They had me watch a quick safety video, answer a few safety questions and off I went to trap field 7...it was not yet daylight so the trap field lights were on...I shot 100 rounds and as the sun rose there was a natural transition to daylight. Postcard material for sure!!! 
My RSO (Mike?) was very helpful showing me how to operate the card reader and very welcoming. I had a GREAT first time experience and will definitely going back! I highly recommend Ben Avery..."
5,"I go here for the amazing Soft shell crab, Gyoza, Teriyaki  & Sashimi meats and the mustard sauce. I've been here about a hundred times over the part four years. It's my go to restaurant for AYCE Sushi!

Tip: Make a reservation before you go here.

You may experience poor service on some days, but try to get it sorted out with them if you can. It's a fast paced environment, just try to prepare as much as you can, review their menu online and try to have an idea of what you want before you go. It will help."
5,"Best pizza ever (well, in the GTA anyway).
Great crust, sauce, and toppings. 

Great for takeout. We don't live in Ajax, so delivery is unfortunately not an option.

Eat in is ok- atmosphere is like a small town diner without boothes -  but you go here for the pizza, not the decor. The pizza more than offsets it though. 

Highly recommend it."
5,"Third visit, that says something, and it keeps getting better.

Only thing is they only take debit or cash, so be prepared. BUT also be braced for big flavour. While it comes across as a Vietnamese pho joint, you really do want to venture beyond that section of the menu.

I went with my best friend at 5:20-ish for dinner, and there was hardly anyone in the usually bustling little restaurant. Hence, the server seemed to be in a better mood. We ordered the small satay beef pho ($7.50) and the curry beef brisket with roti ($12.95), both to share.

The satay beef pho arrived within 5 minutes of us placing the order. When it arrived, we knew we were going to have to spend the $0.50 for take-out containers. The portion size could hardly be considered ""small"", it was definitely a mammoth compared to any bowl I've ever seen. The satay pho was nothing I've ever imagined. The soup stock was richly layered in terms of flavor and texture. The warm spice that wafts up with the steam, then the milky sweetness of coconut, then a mild tang of pineapples are but some of the flavours I most appreciated. The soup was also creamy from coconut milk and had surprising pieces of chopped roasted peanuts here and there. All these make the super tender slices of beef and pho themselves nearly sidekicks.

Then, halfway through our pho, the brisket curry and roti arrived. Both smelled amazing (though it also made it clear that I will be washing my scarf as soon as I got home). You know how most places try to rip you off by giving you a bunch of potatoes and two itty bitty chunks of meat? Well, this was not ""most places"". There was enough of that perfectly cooked, not-yet-disintegrating brisket drowned in an abundance of liquid gold - the curry gravy. And thattipsti...oh boy that pillow of fluffy, crispy, doughy, buttery roti. Words can't describe it, you need to have that roti, tear it with your very fingers, dunk it in the curry sauce, and send it straight in your salivating mouth.

I packed most of the curry as leftovers (yeah, we tried to finish, but obviously failed by a pretty wide margin).

Including tips, our dinner came to $25 flat.

Come again? Do you even need to ask?"
5,"The service department is amazing. The girl Jennifer and guy who I think is.. Nathaniel.. Are sooooo courteous. They are knowledge and honest. They work out a good system with enterprise rental car.

The auto shop department has been wonderful too... Had to use them twice. They are quick. And give decent prices and found ways for the fix to be cheaper if possible. They also explain what was going on and what they had to do."
5,"One of our favorites. Service has improved with Stephanie running the show these days. Big fan of the beef teriyaki and the seaweed salad, but it's really tough to go wrong with any selection on the menu. Big lineups on the weekends tell you that this place knows what it's doing and the general public agrees."
5,"Stopped by when we were in Toronto.  The service was not the best, but the sushi was top notch.  Probably some of the best rolls I've ever had.  Everything tasted fresh, sushi did not have excessive amount of rice unlike most other AYCES places.  Would definitely come back here next time we are in Toronto area."
5,"After deciding to buy a new home while still owning one, I write my first Yelp review, after the very long and tedious wait. After a few months of being frugal, for once in my life, I told my wife it was time for our much needed date night. Of coarse she picked my favorite... sushi! I have to admit when she said lets just go somewhere local I was a little weary at first. If you read some of my earlier reviews, not only do I love sushi, but I can also be a bit over critical on sushi restaurants. I typically do not like your local downscale sushi joints. They tend to be, lets just say.... quantity over quality. I am really pleased to say that after the dinner I just had, I was completely 100% wrong. After my first few bits I looked at my wife and said ""I am going to Yelp the crap out of this place when we get home"".


At first sight, Osaka is certainly not eye opening place, but it is certainly a diamond in the rough. In this case, great food and service in a small, older strip mall. We were definitely well greeted and well treated from the start. The restaurant wasn't super busy but it did have a good amount of people there. We sat at the sushi bar and all of the wait staff served us throughout the night. I miss that type of service from restaurants when all of the servers work as a team. The sushi chefs were extremely pleasant and were very talented as well. 

As soon as I started seeing the sushi coming out, it made me start to rethink my position about the food. It appeared to be quality and quantity. As usual I ordered a bunch of different rolls and appetizers. They also sent us out a couple of appetizers on the house for us to try out as well. They gave us a tuna carpaccio and a crab salad app that were both to die for. The crab salad came out on fire as very aesthetically pleasing. We also got their volcano roll, tuna trio, the godfather roll and the kiss roll. All of them not only looked amazing but also tasted out of this world. I completely loved all of them. I am not a huge fan of cream cheese in my sushi so I was only able to eat a couple pieces of the godfather but it was really good. The one huge kicker about all of the amazing sushi is that pretty much all of their rolls are under $10. That quality of food, specially for seafood is almost unheard of.


Ultimately, I was happy my wife picked Osaka. I am also glad that I broke the local sushi bar stereotype as well. Certainly, I am excited that we found such a great sushi restaurant near our new house. Definitely give it a try if your east of the city one day."
5,My friend and I stopped to have some good food.  We were not let down.  I had a panzerotti and my friend had spaghetti and meatballs. We also split an order of garlic bread with cheese.  I could only eat a third of it as it was HUGE.  The garlic bread was seasoned just right and had a pile of cheese on it.  Her spaghetti sauce was meaty and full of meatballs.  Definitely will be back again soon!!!
5,This was my first time at a place like this. I purchased a series of six treatments and Marlow took care of me 5 out of the six times. Marlow is a very knowledgeable and caring person. She guided me through the process and set me up with great supplements to further my cleansing. She also added different supplements to the colonic to enhance the treatment. I highly recommend Healing Waters.
5,"We were in search of good pizza and we found it! The slices of pizza are absolutely huge. They need 2 plates to serve them and they still hang off the plate. We ordered our slices and sat down. They were ready within minutes. It is a no frills kind of place but they also seem to do a booming take out business. We enjoyed watching people come in to pick up their pizzas in boxes that barely fit through the door because they were so big. You almost have to have the address to find this place because there is no big sign, only a sign on the window. This will be a must for our next visit to the area."
5,Racquel (spelling may be bad) did an AMAZING job. My hair and makeup was perfection for my engagement photos. Thank you!
5,"Everything is on point! Ever since I discovered Pasha I have been bringing my friends and family to here. Their pasha mix, Turkish tea and kunefe are my favorites, and service never disappoints. Great value for the excellent quality and quantity."
5,"Outstanding shooting facility. Very safe range even though they were kind of anal about stuff, I see why they do it. They even had a mini gun at the east end of the range. This place is massive and it looked like they host a plethora of shooting events. too bad I'm about 7 hours away or I would be here every weekend for sure. Also its pretty inexpensive. They allow full auto fire, suppressed guns, rapid fire, and all sorts of different target range options. I am very impressed."
5,This blow out shop was a pleasant find. I was in town for a wedding and new I wanted my hair done for me. I Goggled a place near my hotel and this one came up. I called and made an appointment. They sent me a reminder via email. Not sure what to expect when I arrived....... But it was a lovely place. Clean friendly convenient for where I was staying. An excellent choice.  I looked fabulous when I left. They also can do your makeup if you make arrangements in advance!!  I did not but if I'm ever back I wound certainly go here again!
5,"We come to the original pancake house every time we come to pittsburgh. The food is always good, the place is very clean and the staff is super friendly. Today when we were there the manager heard our daughter getting upset because there was no more marshmallows on the smores pancakes we ordered for her and our son to share. The manager out of nowhere came over to our table with a little bowl of marshmallows for her. Then before we left he stood and chatted with us and gave both our children a pack of Oreos. They make you feel welcomed, not rushed and the food is on point. If you get there early in the morning you will have a wait but it is never really long. We got there at 11am and the place was not very busy, quite and the food came out very quick."
5,Friday night 9:07pm 7/8/16  James the man! Customer service on point!! This here review is because of James.. thanks bruh!
5,So good and the place was petty cool on the inside. Went 2 says in a row while in Pittsburgh. Cornbeef hash was awsome!
5,"I was in the area on business a few years ago and decided to drive and being a few rifles and ammo with me to check this place out. Great range, great RO staff. After a day of shooting  after I was finished packing up and was about to leave. The RO walked up to me very quickly and I thought what the hell did I do wrong, time to get a free lesson and chewing out. He said ""I really liked the way you packed up your rifles , thanks for that"". I was like ""OK thanks?""
Great range and I am glad they keep the morons in check. Last thing I need is to get shot by a fool with a gun."
5,My beloved 12 yr old Chihuahua suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed from the neck down. Dr. Jennifer Kres and her caring staff made a difficult time a little easier. I held him in my arms and felt at peace knowing we came to the right place.
5,Absolutely amazing! Huge slices for a reasonable price. Great weekend steal after a night out.
5,"We've taken our dogs there for years and the service just keeps getting better!  Speaking of service....Just today (7/17/2016) after picking up our excited female Lab from a week stay in boarding, my car's battery was dead. One of the ladies from the vet came out and gave my car a jump start. So thankful for the people who work at Lone Mountain!"
5,Bill was great! He spent a lot of time with us and helped us get a good deal on our new car! Very friendly and professional staff
5,"I just had the best lamb burger in Pittsburgh. I'm not usually fond of too many places that make lamb because I think lamb is tough to make. It's also an acquired taste. The lamb burger here tastes very fresh and I had it made medium since I've never been here before but mine came out a little medium rare, which is actually my favorite way of having a burger. It was very juicy, flavorful and topped with some feta cheese. My mom had the chicken shwarma which was marinated with 100% flavor. If you like your food bland and you're afraid of delicious and strong garlic taste in your food, stay away :) I had a bite and it was very tasty. I will definitely come back again some time for other items on the menu."
5,"I haven't been into a good Asian/Korean restaurant like this In a ver long time I got number 2, 14, and 45"
5,"I'm a native born Korean and this place is very close to the food in Seoul.  Some slight differences (such as using ground beef in the Bi Bim Bab rather than shredded beef) but overall - extremely authentic.

The staff was always courteous.  But once they realized we appreciated the food and service, we were treated like friends.  My husband was scolded for being too thin and was continually inundated with extra servings of Korean side dishes (Banchan).  I just grinned as this too is so very Korean where Love and Friendship are spelled F-O-O-D.

We'll be back!"
5,"Your everyday create your own poke bowl place. Lots of topping and options. A couple of the poke places I tried didn't have tofu so was happy it was an option here. Got white rice, tofu, the lemon vinegrette dressing, furakake, seaweed, cucumber, edamame, sesame seeds, and ginger. Love poke bowls, light but filling and you get grains, protein, and veggies. I liked the dressing they gave me. Wasn't sure what was vegan and was short on time so just chose the vinaigrette but they had a bunch of other sauces I would want to try. They serve soft tofu so if you don't like soft tofu out of luck there. But could just pile on the edamame and veggies. I really liked the bowl and their ingredient options, would come here again. Also like the location, high seating and not too busy."
5,"The employees here are amazing! Even with long lines, max wait is 7 minutes. Ordered the most complicated drinks and they were perfect. Awesome service, delicious drinks."
5,Loved it.  Nice little secret in a crummy area of Oakland.
5,"I actually went to the new location at the Scottsdale Waterfront, and had my hair done by Lauren last Friday.  I made my appointment by phone, and then immediately received email confirmation, which was a very nice touch.  Had to call back to see if my appointment could be push up to an earlier time, and they happily reaccomodated, which was a relief.  I got there right on time and was greeted promptly and offered a beverage.  Declined the beverage, got seated and tried to see if they could do anything with my crazy, frizzy, curly hair.  I wanted a blow-dry with a curling iron touch up, and Lauren said she could give me soft curls with just the blow dry brush.  Skeptical as I was, we preceded to the shampoo bowl.    Fabulous shampoo with scalp massage, then on to the blow dry.  I had to take my glasses off, and I am blind as a bat without them so I couldn't see anything clearly at all.  When she was done, she asked if the curls were good enough, and when I put my glasses back on, i was stunned beyond belief!!  I have never, ever, in my life had such a good blow dry!!  Hair was soft, shiny, sleek, with movie star curls!!  And to top it off, they lasted through till Monday!!!  Lauren is a genius with a brush and a blow dryer, and they have just made a customer for life!!  

Thank you Primp and Blow!!!

Alli"
5,"Honestly, the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. They use the best ingredients and the food is delicious.  
They are always sending out good coupons in the mail. Their Monday thru Friday specials are quite the deal. The pancakes are amazing and the service superb."
5,"We lost our sweet Potato and the staff here were so kind to us during the process and even sent a sympathy card signed by everyone tehre later.

I was very personal and I felt love from this office. Thank you"
5,"I cant even begin to describe how grateful I am for this animal hospital. I had to rush my dog is yesterday and I was a frantic mess, I had a very hard time trying to get my dg her medication and I called them thru out the day and everyone I spoke with was so  helpful and went above and beyond to help me. it means to world to me that you care for me and my dogs. truly the best , worth the twenty mile drive . love dr.parker and all the girls!!!"
5,"Great dealership with two very competent, very cordial and straight up salesmen named Scott Sullivan and Mike Knox. They will do their best to give you the best deal while working quickly and honestly. I was so worried about getting taken advantage of and if I had just gone here to begin with I would have saved myself so much time and worry. Purchased a beautiful Mazda CX 9 with all the upgrades at a price I'm happy with. When my husband needs to car we will drive the hour to get here and work with Scott and Mike again for sure. Thanks!!!"
5,"I just went to pizza Pinots tonight after hearing about from my many friends and coworkers and all I have to say is it was worth the wait. i've tried all the generic pizza places like Domino's ,Pizza pizza pizza nova, and Pizza Hut. But this pizza  is made with really good ingredients and great cheeses. But most of all the dough is very edible. So if you live around the East end I encourage you to deafly swing by and grab yourself a pizza."
5,"They do a great job!  I have very curly hair and they are able to get it smooth.  I was afraid I was going to have to upgrade to the hot tools to get my hair the way I like it, but it wasn't necessary.  It's a beautiful salon.  I definitely recommend Primp & Blow."
5,My friends and I came here after a long night of drinking and dancing. Their pizza slices were huge (like the size of two pieces of pizza) and delicious. They were super friendly and gave us each a side of ranch. Hurrah for Benny's!
5,"Great location, right down the road from the interstate. This is my go to place before work. Now it's no different than any other Starbucks when it comes to great quality, but the drive-thru can become very busy during the day. I've found it better to head inside if there are more than 4 cars in line. 

The staff is always very friendly and acknowledge you as soon as you enter. I appreciate a staff that lets you know that they'll be with you and constantly makes sure you're not forgotten when they do get busy."
5,Oh ma goodness! The falafel pita sandwich is ah-maz-ing. I won't be able to resist coming back. Staff is very pleasant and friendly as well. What a gem!
5,"Best pizza around. The Pino special is the best. The medium is enough for 2 people! The decor is very basic, but the staff is friendly and the food is really good."
5,"I LOVE Vietnamese fast food! This place has all the basic Vietnamese snacks like nem, banh beo, che (sweet bean drinks) for such a reasonable price. They also sell Vietnamese coffee for only 2.95 or something around that price and bubble tea. Their sandwiches are their signature products. The Saigon Dac Biet is my favorite, with pate, ham, and pork...so delicious. There's also an amazing vegetarian one as well. All their sandwiches are good actually, it's not a hit or miss kind of thing, though I recommend getting the Viet ones not the regular ""Western"" sandwiches. Their sushi is mediocre, I wouldn't go there for sushi for sure. They also have cakes and pastries here and there. Service is decent and there's a great lounge upstairs on the top of Thai Express that is nice and quiet (if you like that kind of ambiance and prefer noiseless areas than the main dining area) This is my ultimate food spot when I hit St. Denis street. A definite must try!"
5,"One dark and gloomy evening, I peeked into the cage where my lady rats live and I found our fat little fluff ball of a rat sprawled in an unusual and uncomfortable position, like an old lady who'd fallen and can't get up. Concerned, I lifted her and she was completely limp in my hands. Upon further inspection she seemed to have lost her balance and motor skills, causing me to fear that she had been victim to a stroke or some other hard to rebound from problem. Fearing for the worst, my boyfriend and I stayed up until 3am cuddling and coaxing her to nibble some food or have a little water. We kept a close eye on her throughout the next day, and there were a lot of tears because we legitimately feared she was on death's door. It wasn't easy for us to find a veterinarian who would take in rodents, as their small size makes them harder to diagnose. Everything from drawing blood to surgery is exponentially complicated by the fact your patient is less than a pound (though Newt, bless her heart, comes pretty damn close)... When he found these guys, my boyfriend rushed Newt over as soon as he got off the phone. Upon check in, his stress levels were diminished by how NICE everyone was, and how genuinely they seemed to care about our little girl. A lot of people are dimissive of rats, if not outright hating them, but she was given thorough care and given lots of love in the two days she stayed in their care. When the vet who took on the case wasn't scheduled at the location the next day, she STILL made a trip over just to check in on Newt and left a voicemail letting us know how she was doing. We appreciate that a lot. When we checked in later that day, we were told that Newt had garnered a lot of attention as everyone wanted to see the sweet little squishball. Again, this made us feel very relieved and comfortable leaving her in their care. When we picked up our lady today, she was doing SO much better, back to her old self!! We were given a diagnosis, meds to give her, and many compliments on what a lovely little being we had on our hands. The staff didn't seem annoyed or bothered by our calls to check in on her, and they were very upfront with us about our options and the costs associated with them. 
So, while I generally don't like going to the vet (means a sick pet, lots of worry, expenses, etc.) I'm SO happy to know that if ever one of our bubs falls ill again there's a wonderful staff here to take care of them in their time of need. Half the battle was just finding someone who would care for rats, so knowing we can come to Lone Mountain Animal Hospital provides great peace of mind."
5,"Love this place, I think it is one of the best korean restaurant here in town... my kids love the seafood udon soup."
5,"We are definitely in trouble! We went back to Poke Point to grab another bowl. I foresee so many poke bowls in our future. 

So, after my last review regarding temps, I received a message from the biz and was very happy and impressed they got back to me. Mostly, they seemed to have adjusted something so that my rice did not heat my proteins and isn't hard. Way to go!

So good! I also tried the Yuzu Citrus sauce this time and it matches my palate much better! Had the regular bowl and it was perfect for lunch! Yay, I love supporting local buisnesses and we apparently love poke even more now that it's in the neighborhood."
5,"I just leased a 2015 Mazda 3.  Didn't think I was going to end leaving with a vehicle; wasn't sure they could make a deal since I still had time left on my lease.  What a nice surprise!  They worked out in my favor and I could not be happier.  The salesman, Celso, was very professional, and bent over backwards to make sure I was completely satisfied before pulling away with my new car.  Buying/leasing a vehicle I equate to as painful as a trip to the dentist; and quite honestly I would rather do that than walk into a car dealership; however, Chapman Mazda is very professional, courteous and I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.  I think the whole process took maybe....two hours, if that.  The finance guy was fantastic.  This is not our first rodeo, leasing a car, so we knew what to expect, and quite frankly were dreading the finance process as it is so long and drawn out.  Not with this guy though, he was fast, informative, and we were out of there in about 10 minutes, my kind of paperwork!  All in all, it was a very painless process and a nice surprise they were able to make me a deal I could not refuse.  THANK YOU Chapman Mazda!  Thank you Celso and Mr. Finance Guy!"
5,I love the food here! Everytime I am in Toronto I try to stop by. They make the best kebabs! Hands down! I usually get the chicken breast and ground chicken kebab skewer combo and have not been disappointed each time.
5,"We have been going to LMAH for at least 10 years, but our most recent visit has made me love this place so much more.

We had a military macaw and his name was Ozzy. One day, he was acting very strange and started bleeding out of his rectum. LMAH is one of the only places that takes care of birds, so we went there. Once we got there, everything seemed to be okay and we went home. Later that night, he was acting strange again and we went to an Animal ER with VERY LITTLE satisfaction. So the next morning, we went back to Lone Mountain.

They took some X-ray's and behold, he was a she and she was passing her very first egg. It had, however, gotten stuck and broken inside of her. They had to surgically remove it. After her surgery, the doctors called up 3 times a day to keep us in the loop and kept her over night for observation. She ended up getting a major infection and we had her put down. It was very sad. We had her cremated and they took her paw print and cut her tail feathers so we could keep them.

About a week later, we got a card in the mail signed by every staff member saying how sorry they were. I thought it was incredible how wonderful each person we encountered was. This place is just amazing."
5,"War viel Betrieb morgens, trotz Hektik sehr freundliches Personal! Größere Bestellung aufgegeben, alles schnell und vollständig bekommen! Ausserdem lecker!!!!"
5,"Cancel your order everywhere else. This is the place for pizza. Makes the others taste like microwave pizza. Toppings a plenty and very generous. Great old school restaurant, like travelling back in time. Can't wait to visit again. Also order in all the time. Just as good at home. Great value, great time."
5,"Came out with a few friends for a birthday dinner. First of all the food was phenomenal - I would highly recommend the garlic bread, wings, onion rings, and especially THE PIZZA. What really made this experience amazing however was our waiter. He checked in on us all night, played music that we enjoyed, and even threw in a complimentary dessert (I've attached a photo)! This is what you call service - and for that reason I will be returning to Pizza Pinos."
5,I am so grateful that Lauren at Petsmart referred me to you. The entire staff is very nice and professional at the same time. The doctors are very thorough and explain things in a simple way. Everyone is very caring and I am referring my friends to take their furry family members there.  Thank you so much for taking such good care of my family pets.
5,"Cheap. Cheap. Cheap.
For the price the food tastes fantastic and fills you up nicely. It's perfect for students or for anyone needing something to eat during a quick lunch break."
5,"I have been to many blow dry salons in Los Angeles, Nevada and Arizona    and Primp and Blow by far is #1 on my list.  

I'm all about decor and cleanliness and this salon gets it right. The lighting, the chairs, etc, it gives off the impression that this is a high class establishment and who doesn't want to go to a high class establishment???

The staff was extremely friendly and courteous. I always judge a salon based on how their employees look and if the owners are ever in the store.  I hate how if you ask to speak to the owner or ask if they're ever in and the response is no. My first time in the salon and the owner was there getting her hair and makeup done! Don't ever go to a salon to get your makeup and hair done and the owner wouldn't even get their hair done there.

My hair turned out great and people at the party I went to afterwards complimented me on my makeup all night. I love a great smokey eye and Primp & Blow got it right:)  They catered to me and I truly felt special after I left. I will come here and get my hair and makeup done before any event that I have to go to. Its so worth it!"
5,"Really impressed. Great food. The falafel is some of the best I've ever had and the spicy euro is beyond delicious. It's weird to say this, because almost all edamame tastes the same, but the edamame I got here is now my favorite. I've lived in the area for two years and just tried this place, but it will be a frequent spot of ours for takeout dinners."
5,"This was a brand new endeavor for me. Prior to receiving my first colonic, I hardly knew what the process entailed. All I really knew was that it was meant to clean out your digestive tract, and that's about it. Needless to say, this made me very nervous to get one, but an employee there by the name of Eliza, referred to as a colon hydrotherapist, helped me feel at ease almost immediately with her professional demeanor and friendly attitude. Once I decided to go through with it, I was escorted to one of the rooms where the colonics are performed and noticed that it was a peaceful and comfortable environment, with soothing music in the background and kept up with upmost cleanliness. Eliza was designated to help me throughout the experience, so my nervousness by this point was at about twenty percent. She explained to me in such clear and simple detail what my role and functions in the experience would be, how I would feel during and after, and also respected my privacy with exemplary respect. Being the reserved and timid guy that I am, I appreciated the fact that everything was explained so well that I didn't have to worry about any unexpected surprises, because in all honesty, the process sounds a bit intimidating at first, but here they treat you as a top priority and adapt very well to any needs you might have or any requests you might make so that your personal experience is as best as possible. Once you get settled into a hospital gown, you are asked to sit and position yourself onto a table that is specially designed for colonics. After that, you will be asked to insert a thin tube into your anus, lubricant jelly provided, with specific instructions. By the way, this experience is as private as you want it to be. It may take a few colonics to feel like you can do it yourself without a problem, but in the meantime the employees will only stick around if you request their help/presence. However, they will knock on the door of your room occasionally to make sure that everything is going smoothly. Anyways, after the tube is inside your rectum, the colon hydrotherapist will help you get things started by commencing water flow inside your digestive tract. Don't be surprised if you feel a rush of cool water, that's just the colonic machine doing its job of keeping a constant flow of water going in and out. After it is all over, you will be instructed on how to carefully remove the tube and clean yourself up. You will be given every tool and instruction necessary to ensure that you stay clean and feeling calm from beginning to end. As I can now attest, you will feel rejuvenated, clean, and healthier than ever before. I learned that colonics are good for expelling toxins from your colon, maintaining control of your weight, and cleaning out any unnecessary and unwanted buildup, among other things. I will definitely be back to get another colonic soon, and if you have yet to experience your first colonic or receive one on a regular basis, Healing Waters is all about helping you be your healthiest self, and will ensure that you get the best treatment possible so that every visit is a pleasant one!"
5,"With a growing popularity of hydrotherapy I decided to refresh my memory of the procedure and bought a groupon to healing waters. The place has a relaxing vibe to it and people are very friendly and laid back. My therapist made me feel very comfortable and explained the procedure step by step. During the session the she also discussed different foods and the way they affect our digestive system. It's not easy to be completely relaxed during colonics but healing waters made it feel more like a spa treatment, I'll definitely be back."
5,Stopped by here again this weekend on Saturday morning.  What a great place too shoot.  The RSO do a great job of making sure people are safe.  We spent the morning shooting hand guns.  My pops even came out too.  Just follow the rules and you will be fine there.  If you make a mistake they will let you know.  Just take it and move on.  Me personally I think they can be to lenient on people.  Great place to come and shoot.
5,"Really excellent food.  We started with the Acili Ezme which is a garlic and tomato spread (on wonderful, warm bread).  They don't skimp on the garlic (which is a favourite of mine).  The Inegöt Köfte (Turkish meatballs--which aren't ball-shaped at all) was delicious.  Really unusual and fantastic spice combinations.  The taste buds were dancing.  The Karisik Pides was a mixed combination of all the pides (sort of like pizza) they have.  So you get a sample of everything.  Fantastic flavours.  Too much, though!  We couldn't even finish half the meal.  Not even close.  Great food, great portions and the service was perfect.  I'll definitely go back and work my way through the menu.  Highly recommended."
5,"Parking: is a problem, but mom parks in the handicapped spot.  

Mom says this place is hidden behind Denny's.  She's been here before but remembered it when she was driving down the hill.

Mom refused the menu because it was overwhelming, and it unfolds like an accordion.

Mom really really likes the Sour Cherry Crepes.  Mom loves the cherries and next time she's excited to try the homemade whipped cream.  She refused the whipped cream today because she assumed it would be out of a can.   Mom says she will ask for her cherry sauce on the side next time because she would like for it to be more tart.  Perhaps she'll ask for a lemon?

She likes the flatware.  She says it's not flimsy."
5,"Absolutely delicious Banh mis that are well priced! They have lots of other small convenience store snacks. 

They're in the basement so don't miss the entrance!"
5,"Great service & a happy team. The line was crazy long So they just gave me my coffee Bcz I waited like 7 min in drv thru
My order was for a double- they gave me a single but I'm not stressed over a free single"
5,"Sure, it's got an interesting menu, and the shawarma is pretty good but I just watched the man behind the counter make a dash to the corner of the dining room, grab something and move even faster, waving his arms toward a car backing out of the parking lot. A lady had left her purse at the table. This man instinctively noticed it and acted. I don't know if he's the owner or the manager but what I do know is that this man is a fine example of human behavior and I believe he needs recognition and patronage. Come visit Greek Pita, have shawarma, ramen, udon, a gyro, edamame, rice bowls, a burger or even a salad. Seeing this simple act of humanity made my day after a long shift in a busy Emergency Room. I'm glad I stopped here on my way home after work. I will do it again."
5,"We really need to call this something besides pizza. It is the most amazing pizza we've had. 

We've lived in Ajax for 15 years and have only recently discovered this place. The scope of review for us is limited as we've only had pizza there despite their other items. 

The pizza is amazing. The crust is thick BUT very light. We had the 3 meat variety each time with differing choices. Absolutely delicious. 

The surroundings are very un-modern, sparse even hut I can't remove star for that as it seems to add to that neighbourhood independent hand made ""pizza place"" we all remember as kids. 

The staff are friendly and easy to deal with. 

It's about 30 bucks for a 3 topping XL and it takes about 30 minutes to get it. It's very thick with enough cheese that you'll never want to order extra. The filling is thick, the sauce home made and tasty buy not dominant. 

It's been an excellent and consistent experience every time. None of us can imagine ever eating a chain pizza again."
5,"The pizza is delicious. Very cheesy & thick, so don't get thick crust or extra cheese. You will probably need a fork and knife to eat it. The cinnamon balls are really good too, you have to get them!"
5,"I want to live in Pita Land.  I'm thinking of applying for dual citizenship so I can give their fantastic food permanent residence in my happy belly.

I don't know what to recommend more highly, their fluffy glorious gyros (which were the best I've ever had in a city of good gyros), their juicy feta lamb burger, their fresh baked pizza flat breads, their home made baba ganooj and hummus, their massive Mediterranean grocery supply, or their fresh baked pita's which you can watch coming off a conveyer belt carrying them fresh risen out of the oven!

Low prices, big portions, and delicious, perfectly prepared, home made fresh fare.  Go to Pita Land and treat your taste buds to a magical journey to Lebanon's finest!"
5,"I love this hospital. I took my bulldog in for a spay and found out she had something much worse going on and Dr. Bryan was so amazing with her and me. She kept me abreast of everything that was going on and since I explained to them I really didn't have a lot of money she was very ""real"" with some of her recommendations dependent of the outcomes. Gratefully things turned out better than the worst case scenario and now my baby is home relaxing. Thank you Dr. Bryan!"
5,"Always our go to Pizza place in Ajax, love the Pono Special, so much cheese and very filling!"
5,"I love the location, and it has a drive thru. It's convenient when you're in a rush or don't feel like getting off. Every one is so friendly. Service is always quick. If you happen to walk in they greet you as soon as you open the door. Oh and they have yet to misspell my name."
5,I recommend Primp and Blow to anyone who comments on my hair. I've been coming to see Bri for 4 years now every Monday without fail and my hair is always perfect and so much healthier than it ever was before I started coming. My hair stays clean and perfect so I don't buy any hair products anymore because I only have to come once a week.  In the end I'm sure I save money by not having to buy all these expensive hair products. I've tried other blow out salons prior to primp and blow and none were near as good. That's why I'm a loyal customer!
5,"The grilled chicken is definitely my favourite sandwich. Juicy, fresh and cheap. You got me vua. I seriously eat it way too often do yourself a favour already and go get it."
5,"This time I brought my partner in culinary adventure and I ordered a Gyro and some fries.  My wife ordered a falafel plate.  She said it was the best she's ever had.  I felt the same about my Gyro.  The fries were great.  They're seasoned with something I couldn't identify and served with tartar.  Awesome.  I wish you could order a small because for $4 it's a huge basket.  Way too much for a side with a sandwich.  Miriam helped me out and I did finish them.  They were too good to waste.  I also took a square of baklava home and again it was the best I have ever had anywhere.  This place is a treasure.  If I lived near here, I would be here all the time."
5,Looking for REAL pizza? This is DEFINITELY the place!!! The pizzas are loaded with toppings and cooked to perfection. The wings are perfectly crispy and big. And don't ever forget to order the Pino sticks! Every bite is heavenly.
5,Score ethnic food! I will say that I love their hummus. It's very tasty as well as their pitas (which appear to be sold all over the city). The staff is friendly and helpful and they have many things that you can't find anywhere else.
5,"I LOVE this place. Mint Hill Mathews area with this exquisite sushi?! Shocked and thrilled. Meat to rice ratio is generous, prices are a dollar or two cheaper per roll than anyone else in town, GREAT specials, friendly staff, Do yourself and others and favor and check it out!"
5,This is by far the best shooting range that I have ever used. The available ranges for all shooting sports as well as archery are outstanding. I have used the public use range many times as well as the specialty ranges for both pistol and 3 Gun matches. If you are looking for a safe place to shoot or compete this is the place.
5,"This is the greatest place ever if you want a healthy, happy body. With the body having stress, meds, breathing the crap air , all this and so much more build up in your 55 ft colon. This heals everything from head to toe. Gets parasites, yeast , out i never in a million years would i have believed the build up . I would shout it from the roof top that everyone needs to get this done. I believe it helped me with my not needing oxegen 24/7 . 13 months in a row in hospitals. I had the Oxygen tube done monday . If you  confined spaces wont be good for you. It oxidizes the outside of your body. Amazing makes skin soft , feel younger. And a person there told me when he was sick with flu or something he couldn't shake. He went in and he felt great after said he couldn't explain it but weird. The staff are very knowledgeable about everything involving the health of your body. Just amazing. I had stopped going and stopped taking care of myself and taking care of my mom with damencha , she passed 2 months ago .And Im back on Oxygen and can hardly get out of bed. Im trying to get a life back without her and being depressed . So This time i will go once a month for my colonic. Even helps with sinius. Dont let the doctors make money by making us sicker with scripts that we most likely dont need. God Bless"
5,"Franchement c'est un grand 5/5 pour Vua. Quand je n'ai pas apporté mon lunch entre deux cours, c'est toujours toujours ici que je vais !

La nourriture est vraiment bonne aussi bien leurs sandwichs, suchis ou plats chauds. La dernière fois, j'ai pris un plat nouilles Soba au poulet. Le poulet était tendre, les saveurs disctinctes et la serveuse m'a offert un rouleau impérial qui lui aussi était bon !
Les sandwichs sont délicieux, mention spéciale pour le poulet grillé et celui aux boulettes de viande et le tout pour un peu moins de 4$ (taxes inclues).`

Les prix sont parfaits pour des budgets étudiants, on ne fait jamais la queue plus de 10 minutes même en plein coup de feu. A l'étage, il y a toujours de la place !

En un mot, Vua, j'adore !!!"
5,"All I can say this is an amazing experience.  Diona was my technician and when I had my first session she helped me through the first part and understanding what I was seeing.  This helped me to be more aware about what my body can digest and what my body can't.  I recommend getting the 3 sessions which you get a discount.  By the time of my third session i was all cleaned out.  When you see just bubbles that's just built up gas that's more important than actual waste coming out.  If you feel a little uncomfortable ask for some lavender and a heating pad.  They even have a massager for your stomach.  I seen complaints on here about being left alone. All you have to do is ask and thy will stay in with you, but once you get the hang of it you should just relax and enjoy your alone time understanding your body.  I recommend everyone get this done that bloating feeling you feel in your stomach will go away I feel so much lighter after having this done.  I will be back every quarter.  Diona thank your u for educating me!"
5,"OK...I have found the jewel in the desert GURLS!!!  I went to Primp and Blow just to see what it was all about as I live in the neighborhood...I was greeted by the kewlest staff who made me feel welcome immediatley, I was offered the red carpet, white glove treatment for an amazing deal to check out what they offer.  I have gone back a few times for a ""Feel good"" and have discovered the answer to the ""unruly fuzzy hair blues"" ...KERATIN TREATMENT Baby!!  Are you serious???  This treatment is amazing, my hair (Normally takes forever to style) is silky smooth, looks amazingly healthy and takes about 10 minutes to dry and NO ironing needed!!!  The staff was so kind giving me all the options prior to my treatment to make certain it was EXACTLY what my lifestyle and hair needed!!!  I LOVE this place!!  Treat yourself and call, thank me later ;)"
5,"I started to come to Lone Mtn Animal Hosp, like 1995. I have always liked it here, never had any problems.  There was one vet i did not like there 10 years ago, but, now thats it. I cannot tell you how many times I have been here, my one dog ""Sugar"" had Addison's disease. So i had to take her to get a shot every 27 days, for MANY years. I helped my friend get her poodle fixed here, My daughters little dog got fixed here. I have never had any issues here, and have never really been HAULED over the coals with add ons! The boarding is great, they really do care about animals. They follow the rules of having strays go to animal control, which I like. Most vets RESELL dogs asap. Dr. White is SUPER SWEET!"
5,Best new pizza place in the south side area! I was soo upset when pizza sola closed down and then was taken over by new owners...but i have found my new go to in Benny's. Ginormous slices for $5 each...$1 cans of pop. You can stop in and get full on $6 even! I love it...hope you guys are here to stay! Seems like you have made a great impression thus far. You'll be seeing me. Keep a slice of mushroom hot!
5,"I love restaurants that serves food that are unique to the area. My family and I went here last night. My 11 year son was not keen on the idea of having Poke for dinner,  but after eating here,  it completely changed his mind.  In fact, the next night,  my son had asked if we could go back again for dinner. We did! They have a good variety of fresh ingredients to make different combinations of poke bowls so you can change up your order everytime you visit!"
5,"Delicious! Probably one if the best all you can easy sushi restaurants in Mississauga. Server was great even to accommodate our big group of 9. Sashimi was fresh and rolls were nice and big. Our table kept ordering beef tataki, which is a thinly sliced rare beef, a must try. Service was good, and food was excellent and served quickly. Will come again."
5,First time trying a poki bowl and will definitely be coming back. Staff was very helpful.
5,"I took my bunny, Mildred, as a walk-in emergency. They saw us quickly, and allowed all family members in the back. Yes, fees were a little high, but not anymore than to be expected and not higher than I've experienced at other animal hospitals. Dr. Lee was very informative and very honest, and remained empathetic when giving us the sad news about Millie's cancer. Needing to take your furry family member into the animal hospital is never a pleasant experience, but the doctor and the staff made it as comfortable as possible for all of us (most importantly, Millie.)"
5,Torontoda gelinebilecek en iyi türk restoran? hijyen lezzet ve güler yüzü bulabilece?iniz nadir mekanlardan. Pasha poutine ef sa ne patates k?zartmas? da kocaman bir alk?? ald? bizden. So?uk ba?lang?çlarda oldukça iyi herkese tavsiye ediyoruz
5,"Ionic Foot detox really does work.  I was skeptical- I was the only one that knew I had challenges with my gallbladder- of since I have cleared up.  
My water turned a forest green- just as it stated.  I have had several Ionic foot detoxes  and each time the water was actually different.  For me it worked and I felt great afterwards. 

I love them!!!"
5,See deandra for colonics she's so sweet and the receptionist is also. Will be back for a foot detox. My head felt less foggy and clear after my hydrotherapy and I didn't go for the whole hour.
5,"Surprised! And will definitely come back! 

I have known about the Richlane plaza for awhile but never really dabbled into the food. I went on a very late night and was very hungry. They are quick with what they make. I ordered the fried chicken rice which was remarkable. One of the best rice dishes I have had in a very long time. The nuttiness and the herbs as well as the way it's grilled and fried made the chicken rice dish an excellent choice for me. It was rich in flavour and very filling. It was only eight dollars. I also got true spicy peanut and beef noodle which was another flavourful adventure. It was not too spicy but another heart warming dish with various spices. I was also surprised to find pineapple inside. Reminds me of a Thai dish. Overall very satisfying dishes both for eight dollars which usually out in downtown portion and ingredient wise would definitely cost you more."
5,Amazing pizza. The slice of pizza I ordered is the biggest slice I ever seen.  Really good local pizza joint that makes amazing pizza
5,"I had this place bookmarked for a cheap spot to eat, and I finally got to try it when I was on my way to the Old Port and knew food wouldn't be cheap there. Holy cow how the hell is a 10"" sandwich under $5 here? And it was so good!!! I had the BBQ pork with jalapeños. Usually I don't like bahn mi but this place rocks!"
5,awesome ! try there guyss ! i am from turkey and they literally do the same delicate turkish food which we eat in turkey! lentil soup and lahmacun are awesome as well !!!
5,"Was here Saturday and Sunday.  There can be a wait, but I am a early riser so I miss it.  Sunday I got there around 13:00 and waited maybe 20 minutes.  The staff is so great and awesome.  People can complain there is a wait.  That can be true.  Get up early and start early and be done early.  Someone mentioned a good ole boys club.  I have been coming to this range for around 34 years and have never seen anything to suggest this.  Great place to shoot the range personnel do a great job of keeping it safe too."
5,my go-to for viet food in richmond hill... best pho in town .. something ppl dnt know is that the owners split off from kim po and founded this place... kim po got more expensive while this place stayed cheaper for a while... now they are about the same price ... this place still gives larger portions than kim po and better quality imo ... big fan of the curry and vermicelli dishes as well
5,"Love it!  The new cafe is beautiful and the food great.  Traditional gyros still great plus good selection of new sandwiches/dishes.  And as always, great hummus and greek and lebanese salads.  
Also, definitely THE place to shop for mediterranean cooking ingredients."
5,"On the hunt for a local pizza place after a night of drinking, we found Benny's. Luckily we got there right in time to get the 2nd to last pizza of the night. We had no clue what to expect. We watched them put a pizza in the oven and saw how HUGE it was. Thankfully realizing it wasn't ours. But wait, there goes the next pizza in, ours, and it was just as big! They boxed it up for us and we were on our way. However, our Uber was a little small and we couldn't even fit the pizza in! Laughing hysterically we had to hold the pizza on our heads just to get it to the hotel. 

My eyes popped out of my head when I saw the size of the pieces. It was as big as my head! Amazing crust, great toppings, chewy cheese, and 100% great pizza!"
5,"A unique pizza experience!

I love dining in retro places, particularly the retro places which are kept clean and this is one of those.

You would walk in and first thing you would notice is that they have classical 70-80s songs playing, you walk a little further and see that all the walls in this place are occupied by photos of historical Ajax. Since I have literally moved to Ajax 2 days ago, i got to learn a lot about Ajax's history through this! cool.

We ordered a deal of 1 medium pizza and 10 wings, added 3 extra toppings to the pizza and the bill just came up to $30, very reasonable!

Now the pizza they have is very different than your normal day to day pizza, they do thick crusts, but unlike other pizza joints, they aren't stingy with their toppings and cheese. SOOO MUCH CHEESSE! and its high quality too. The grilled chicken on the pizza had flavour as well.

The wings were cooked good and the blue cheese with it went perfectly, but the hot flavour is just frank sauce all over it.

Would definitely be coming back here.

Note: It does take a little while for them to make the pizza."
5,"I recently purchased a vehicle from a co-worker that has had Chapman Mazda service this vehicle for it's whole life so I decided to take it back in there to continue service.

I went to their website and contact Sally McNulty and she was awesome. She was very inviting and setup a drop off time, pickup time and service being performed.

I went to pickup the vehicle last night when it was completed and she graciously greeted me and let me know the condition of the vehicle and all services performed.

Overall I am happy and will be back. They went the extra mile and cleaned the outside of my vehicle.

Thank you!"
5,"The best pho place I have been to in my opinion!  And I love pho! Unsure about any of the other food they serve there,  as the pho is just so good I don't bother getting anything else.  
Only con I can think of,  is during summer sometimes,  may get a bit warm while eating the delicious hot pho,  since the store is open air to the rest of the mall,  which doesn't have that great air conditioning. 

Definitely would recommend to anyone,  I eat here on a weekly basis,  even twice a day sometimes."
5,I love this place so much. The staff there is highly knowledgeable and every one is so sweet. Annie is my favorite and the only one I see now.
5,"Ben avery is always a great place to go shooting, it does get busy on the weekend when all the 9-5ers come out to shoot. If i can i go during the week heck i was their yesterday 5/26/10. Its a bit of a drive but they open at 7am during the summer months so you can be out shooting while its not 100. 

If its your first visit you'll have to watch the safty video, its only a few minutes long.

I guess the worst thing about this place is the morons who can't follow range commands."
5,"First time at Benny's, the slices are huge and very delicious. Loved the vibe inside and Nick was great to talk to. I'd definitely go back."
5,"I absolutely love this hospital! Not only close to home but, the care that everyone from front desk to Drs provide my dog is fantastic! They even call me to follow up and I so appreciate that. Thank you and the entire staff for a good experience while we dealt with our dogs surgery!"
5,"Heaven.... I was in heaven while strolling through this place. Run by a lovely family who enjoys providing quality food and working with each other. It is contagious and it's what I think of as a happy place because the vibe is good.

I met the owner on a food tour calls Bits and Bites, which I also highly recommend, and he explained the store's history. He is the American dream come true. The pita machine was imported and it was breathtaking. Hot delicious pita is made right there on site and then you can buy an assortment of dips to make your treat complete. They have all the middle eastern staples you could want to make your own authentic food at home if you wish.

They also have a counter where you can prepared food. On my list is the fried cauliflower with hummus. Talk about a power food! So, yeah, make a trip and take it all in. You can get some delicious food, groceries for your pantry and some delicious desserts to go."
5,We had a great experience! Both the food and the service is top notch. The specials will have us coming back for sure!
5,"I love this shooting range. I am from California and unfortunately we don't have this type of place near by our house.  Whenever we come visit our friends here in Anthem we always stop by for a session. 

The range is well ran and safety is the at the forefront of all of the guests mind. There our plenty of people on site making sure all of the patrons are being safe.  They have cease fires every 15 mind in order to allow people to put up new targets."
5,Pasha most delicious Turkish food I have ever eat in Canada ambience is amazing the service is top and the staff is very very friendly. I would recommend this food to everyone I know. The food is on point it was the 3rd time I came here and the food never change the quality. The meat and bulger and the veggies are cooked so well.this is what I like about the restaurant a lot. They serve bread and olives(without any charges) I ordered grilled chicken thigh and lamb chops it was very tasty and well cooked. The waitress came often to ask if we need anything which we like too. Will go soon again
5,"This place is amazing! The bacon was crispy the pancakes were good, honestly the experience is great! I would recommend the Dutch baby, it is an interesting bowl shaped pancake with thicker dough that has lemon, powdered sugar, and butter on the side that can be placed on it. It has such a good taste I would most definitely recommend it!"
5,"For those with late-night hunger pains, or interested in an incredibly satisfying greasy blend of cheese, tomato sauce, and crispy bread to really hit the spot, look no further than this welcoming pizza shop.

The staff is so down to earth and friendly, and the ambiance is low-key and generally quiet.

Things i liked:
-Each pizza slice is the size of your head (on average). 
-Reasonably priced for the portion size and quality
-A satisfying pizza to ""hit the spot"" when you're in the mood for something savory, greasy, late-night
-menu changes periodically (basil and balsamic was my favorite!)

Things I didn't like:
-toppings can be low quality e.g. mushrooms that look like they came from a can

Overall, a great place to grab a hefty, filling slice of pizza! They will not disappoint, just don't expect anything gourmet."
5,"Literally imagine a hole in the wall type place, white walls without any decorations, nothing visually pleasing to look at, but you don't care because you are literally sensory overloaded by the smell of the food from the kitchen upon entering the restaurant.  You get the impression all the owners care about is serving authentic, distinct and savory food rather than the fluff.  The food was even better than the smell that preceded it.  I went with the bees stew with noodles for a late Sunday lunch and only had room for scoops ice cream for dessert!  A tad expensive but well worth the price."
5,"I just ate here last night and was very impressed! The decor, atmosphere, and ambiance is great with no screaming kids,  overly loud music, or clanging dishes and utensils. The food tasted delicious and I'm pakistani so getting me food that I like is difficult since I'm used to masala and spices in my food. My husband and I  ordered chicken sautéed and Karisik and both tasted very good. The chicken entrée was comparable to pakistani chicken jalfrezi and the Karisik was a flatbread with various toppings. It is a great dish if you want to sample the pides and don't know which one you like. The serving size is generous. We both ate until we were overfilled and still had leftovers. This was after a 17 hour fast so that must have been a lot of food. Also, the service is exceptional. The severs are very polite,  friendly, and accommodating. We got our food only about 10 to 15 mins after ordering so basically we were in and out in an hour. You can't say that for many restaurants these days! I will definitely be coming here again.

PS: This used to be called Anatolian. I suppose it's under new management."
5,Best pizza place in Pittsburgh. Great service and takes only a few minutes to make. Never been disappointed. Location is prime in the heart of south side. The special pizzas are very unique and a must have. Recommend this place if you are in the mood for pizza.
5,"I love this range! You're out in the desert shooting like you're really in the wild wild west -- hey you are! The whole system is extremely well organized and safe. When you get to the range, you have to check in and pay. I think it's like $7 per adult. If you've never been there before, they'll make you watch a short safety video, or you can watch it online beforehand. Then they assign you a lane.

Load up your mags and get your stuff organized. They do breaks every 15 minutes. During the break, you clear out your weapons, leave them on the table and step back behind the yellow line. The range safety officers come by and check everyone's weapons to ensure everything is clear. Once they give the go-ahead, you can step out and set up your targets. Some lanes go back as far as 200 meters in the main area.

Once all the targets are set up and everyone is back by their tables, they'll signal for everyone to put eye and ear protection back on (they're mandatory during all times of live fire). Then you can shoot until your heart's content until the next break.

I find the range safety officers to be incredibly helpful. Yeah they bark out orders once in a while, but that's for everyone's safety. You're not supposed to touch anything on the tables during breaks, for example. Cell phone, empty mag, whatever. Don't touch it without permission. If your hand touches that table, you'll get a warning over the loudspeaker. I don't find it mean, it's just safety measures. I wouldn't want someone bumping and accidentally firing a weapon that was loaded while I was out changing targets. 

Bring cold drinks. It's outdoors, but the tables are covered so you're not out in the sun the whole time. They don't allow food out on the range. There is a food truck out in the parking lot though so you can go eat real quick. 

Saturdays get wicked busy. First come first serve and there is always a wait after opening. Better off going during the week."
5,"Place is great. Fresh tuna and yellow tail. Amazing toppings. Give it a try, like it. Very light and healthy."
5,"We go here sometimes when we don't feel like going far. The food is ALWAYS good and there is enough of it to make you full.
This time around, we had a coupon to use so we made use out of it. We got two nice filling entrees for a quick meal. I got a spinach omelette with three pancakes and my husband got an egg entree with three pancakes. We will be back !!"
5,"This seems to be the only Starbucks in the valley that knows what they're doing. I am in and out, drive through & inside, every time with a perfect order. Friendly staff. But more important, perfect order. every. single. time."
5,"Recently moved into the area and I've already had pizza from here half dozen times. Everyone that I know that I've given pizza to has said they need to open more locations. 

The pizza reminds me of deep dish pizza. It's not too doughy like Pizza Pizza pizza but not too thin. It's just right! Having the cheese on top is genius! The toppings won't slide off like other places.

The wings are also very good. Not too small or big with a good amount of meat on them. The recommendation of honey garlic and hot sauce was one of the best flavours I've had.

Staff is always courteous and efficient. Only thing I can complain about is that the pizza can't come fast enough!! I need it now!!! Sooooooo good and worth the wait!"
5,"Really awesome facility.  Our Doxie had surgery, and the healing process (stitches) did not go as well as the surgery.  Dr. White, however, redid our baby's stitches TWICE at no extra cost!  I could not believe it, and I will always be grateful to her and her facility for saving or Doxie's life.  Special thanks to Jennifer and all of the support staff for following up with us by phone re how our baby girl is doing.  I highway recommend this facility !!!!"
5,Great expierence every time I come here. This particular store is always clean the staff are very friendly. They know my my drink by hart when I come in. Hot Grande Vanilla latte 3 pumps of vanilla kid temperature. Other Starbucks either put too much sweetener or not enough. I always feel unsatisfied. Not here. Thank you for your consistency and my favorite barista Sarah!
5,This is my only experience with a colonic but   I will be booking another one soon. I lost 6 pounds once I stepped on the scale and my belly ache is finally gone. I came for migraines and bloating and I am hoping that I will see a major improvement soon. Abby was very sweet and helpful. I couldn't ask for a better first experience. The place is clean and tidy!
5,"The waiters are so not nice, polite and understanding! We meant to order a bunch of sashimi, but had accidentally checked them off in the sushi column. The ordered arrived at our table, we apologized for the misunderstanding, they took the plate back and gave us the intended sashimi! Most other AYCE places would've given us a dirty look and would make us eat the order. As always, the deep dried items were crispy, hot and well-seasoned (personal favourite is the deep fried coconut shrimp). The sashimi, sushi, rolls were delicious and accompanied with only a tiny bit of rice. My advice: call ahead and make a reservation, even on a weeknight."
5,"Great food! Great staff!

Walking into the restaurant, felt like a small town lounge spot, with a couple dozen people talking, and playing cards.

I was reading through yelp reviews before deciding to drive to Ajax from Scarborough for pizza and i saw a photo with the comment: ""two adults could not even finish a medium 10"" pizza"". Being skeptical, and very hungry i decided to try this place out with a friend.

Special: large 1 toping for just under $11.

That pizza was split between two hungry 20 year old guys. It was one of the best (and cheapest) pizza i have had.

There was only one toping, but plenty of it, and the cheese and sauce were plentiful also very good. 

Definitely plan on going back."
5,"We bought our Miata from Michael Knox at Chapman Mazda, and were very pleased with the service and very competitive pricing. So, when we were in the market to lease a CX-5, we again turned to Michael who again came through with best pricing and very professional service. Highly recommend!"
5,"I had a friend introduce me to Korea Garden a little over a year ago.  And quickly fell in love.  

On this small, one way street you will find a few hidden restaurants in Oakland.  Korea Garden is hard to miss - but please don't - you won't regret it!

Pretty much every time I've gone I've gotten the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap and on the ""specials"" menu are some dumplings and of course the variety of small plates.

I am a huge dumpling fan.  I've gotten dumplings at many different Asian restaurants - all of which are different.  But there is something about these dumplings.  The sauce, the crunchiness, just everything is SO good!  I highly recommend them.

Bi Bim Bap is best when you get it in the hot bowl - making it the Dol sot bi bim bap.  It warms everything in the bowl when you mix it, but also gives you some crunchy rice.  Get some of the Korean hot sauce (ask for it if they don't provide it).  It (in small amounts for my wimpy self!) just adds the perfect amount of spice to it.

Korea Garden is a must go for some amazing korean food.  Go check it out!"
5,"Primp and Blow is  amazing!! The staff is genuinely the nicest group of ladies you will ever meet. With every appointment, I am always made to feel like a V.I.P client. My appointments with my stylist were always on time, which is a huge plus! I will continue to book appointments with Primp and Blow because I've never been disappointed with my look."
5,Lone Mountain is exceptional. My girlfriend and I have three babies and both adore Dr. Parker. She is wonderful and always has time to answer all our questions. I was so scared when I found out my older female had kidney disease but she has been with us every step of the way. The front desk girls are awesome as well. Please give them a try if you're in the market for a new vet! Pricing is fair as well. Thank you LMAH!
5,Unmatched experience for customer service and flavor. Seriously above any other pancake spot in Pittsburgh
5,Decided to visit this place as a bday treat...I was not disappointed. Wonderful service (my glass was never empty) & amazing fresh food. Enjoyed everything I ate & took a whole bag full of take out. I would visit here again...hopefully soon.
5,"Visiting the area I was so pleased to find this spot. Not only was my hair fantastic, I able to book an appointment online on the same day. I was treated upon arrival to delicious infused water, fresh coffee and chocolates. Cute, clean and efficient this spot even gives you a complimentary umbrella so you can preserve your doo on the way to your car."
5,"This place is amazing, the fish is fresh and the concept is outstanding. I love the fact I have a healthy choice for food right next to the gym."
5,"A nice simple Viet restaurant in a small food mall.  Great for all, friends and family.  They have a wide variety of items on their menu, my favourite is the chicken pho and the chicken mong.  The chicken and beef curry is also very good."
5,"I was fortunate enough to get to go to Primp and Blow to get my makeup done for my wedding. It was truly an amazing service! My makeup made me glow and lasted all day even in the Arizona heat of August.

From the appointment to my final touches, it was wonderful. They got me right in, made me feel comfortable, kept me hydrated and made all the adjustments I requested along the way. If you have a special event or wedding and you want to look your best, go to Primp & Blow for a wonderful service with the best products and staff!

They even did all the hair for my family and nieces and they were beautiful!"
5,"This place is amazing and anyone who isn't giving it 5 stars is crazy. My husband and I just moved to Brookline from NYC and when we discovered this place I felt like I struck gold. The pita is incredible...like the freshest most delicious pita I have ever had. The baba ghanoush is fantastic and smokey...omg. I could eat that every day. I had the spinach pie with feta cheese and it was yummy. My husband liked his gyro, but next time will ask for a little more sauce. Pitaland is super clean, the employees are friendly and the food is the real deal. I plan on making it one of my regular stops."
5,"We came here to get a tea for my cold. They have a great white defense tea. Lynette was very helpful. We'll definitely be back next time I have a cold. 

Just a heads up, they're closed for renovations mid January through early February."
5,"Love Pitaland!  I have shopped there for years.....the remodel is beautiful.  Such a friendly staff. The pita bread is always so fresh.  The last time I was there I tried the Muhammara, it was amazing!!"
5,"ATTENTION TO PREGNANT WOMEN!!!!

I'm new to Las Vegas.  My hubby and I just moved from California.  

Little Background before I went to Healing Waters:

I'm about 8 weeks pregnant and was having severe morning sickness and diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum.  Look it up!  Women have died and many abort their children THAT THEY WANT TO KEEP because of the absolute severity of it.  I was in so much pain I wanted to die - and I'm NOT kidding!  

My friends and family were extremely worried and everyone was telling me that I was losing all my weight  and that I look very sickly and grey.  I could not keep any food down - I was even puking up ICE CHIPS!  That's how sick I was.  I went to the emergency room and even had to have an IV and to be put on medication (Which I am VERY against going to conventional DRs and especially getting meds - esp when I am pregnant - esp during my 1st trimester)  Well needless to say, going to the DR did not help me.  I only took one pill and then read the instructions which say - do not take in 1st trimester - WHAT WAS THE DR THINKING!!

To HEALING WATERS
 
My husband and I have heard of hydrocolonics -especially because they are trying to outlaw it in California.  So I looked up a place that had decent reviews (RIGHT HERE ON YELP) and found Healing Water.

I was in such diar need of help, I was afraid they would turn me away, because I was panting, had severe back spasms, couldn't sit or stand only lay.  I was crying and thinking wow- they are going to tell me to go back the emergency room - BUT I WAS WRONG.  

They (extremely sweet, compassionate, loving) ladies escorted me back with gentleness to the colonics room.  The room was low lit - exactly what I needed - the sound of very soft instrumental music was playing in the background along with the sound of water.  It was very soothing.  My husband was with me and helped me onto the  colonics bed.  Tiffany was the one who helped me.  She talked me through everything.  

Even though I thought this would be very invasive and I would be exposed, she saw nothing.  I was covered with a towel, she just had to feel around to place the tube in my colon - (I was so sick I couldn't do it myself) and she started the machine.  I let me know that I was very toxic (as I had not had a bowel movement in 3 weeks).  

ANYWAY, I finished the colonics with my very wonderful supportive husband by my side and have went back again to clean the rest of my colon.

Every since I have been there, my spasms have totally stopped, my friends and family told me that color has returned to me and I have not had morning sickness since I had my colonics.  WHICH IS CRAZY!!!!  Because I am only in my 8th week!  It's suppose to not stop until at LEAST my 12th week!  

I am now completely sold on this place.  Everyone who works there is extremely knowledgable.  I not only was able to clear my colon, which allowed my liver to release pint up toxins, but was advised of a diet according to my blood type, and was given a ton of information on Ph in blood and body and how that can affect the yeast that grows in your intestines and how that effects even the food you crave.  

I recommend anyone to come to this place.  If they ever do a membership program, I will be the first to sign up!

Kudos to TIFFANY
Kudos to HEALING WATERS!"
5,"We just bought a new Mazda 6 and had a very fast and relatively painless process. Thanks to Bill Lohmeyer for helping make the process easy and accommodating to our travel schedule since we had to come from out of town. In my opinion, we got a great deal that beat all the other valley Mazda dealerships and they were so much easier to work with over the phone!"
5,"Not from Phoenix, but didn't want to be shopping hangry! Excellent gyro special with salad or fries and a drink for $7.99. Must be a local favorite because the Uber eats delivery guy said sometimes he just sits in the parking lot to get the next call."
5,"The best service department I have ever experienced in The Valley.  Courteous, professional, straight talk.  Rob Faucett is a gem, he really took care of me on a recent visit when I needed a quick turnaround time on my CX-9.  With so many other disappointing service departments I've experienced the Chapman Mazda service department really gets what a customer experience should be all about."
5,"Always great service, great food, & a great price!!! What more could you ask for? For a special treat, sit at the sushi bar and watch the magic happen."
5,"Absolutely love this place! The staff is friendly & attentive! I have Crohn's disease & moves here from Northern California with a bad bacterial & yeast overgrowth in my intestines, Healing Waters helped me in so many ways! After getting a handle on all of that they helped advise me on a liver & gallbladder detox, which has drastically improved my skin, digestion & overall health. This place not only provides the services on their menu but go above & beyond to help you better your health holistically! Everyone is always smiling & inviting! Great atmosphere! They even have a relaxing meditation room you can use free of charge, with Himalayan salt rocks lamps & a beautiful crystal singing bowl. I buy their colonic & ionic foot bath packages regularly! I've attached some photos of the incredible foot baths, which have helped us in deciding what detox or cleansed are the best actions for me, based on what comes out in my foot baths."
5,"OMG Amazing! Had Pitaland today at the Swissvale Farmers Market. They had quite a large menu for having a pop up stand at a farmers market. I ordered a gyro, a spinach pie and meatless grape leaves. Took less than a minute to get my order ready and it was extremely fair in price. I would've taken a picture but I devoured my food. I will be back and can't wait to checkout their main location."
5,"This is my favourite sushi place in Mississauga and I try to not let too much time pass between my visits. Can be a little tricky to find a table during the holidays due to it's small-ish size but no problems otherwise. Their rolls/sushi/sashimi are are consistently exceptional. Favourite items on the menu must be the beef onion rolls, shrimp skewers, and green tea ice cream. 

I usually go for the all you can eat with my friends, and occasionally we find that they serve us less amounts than we ask for. Not a problem as we can always order more."
5,"My Son & I visit the Ben Avery shooting range several times a year. It's located off of Route 17 with a one way travel time of about one hour or so depending upon traffic, etc. from Maricopa. (It might seem far but really isn't much further, time wise due to highway speed limits, than Casa Grande) The cost is $7 pp with sighting scopes available for a rental fee of $1--can't beat that! Currently the range is open Wednesday thru Sunday--it's closed Monday & Tuesday.

SUMMER HEAT NOTE: During the hot weather, the range closes early in the afternoon. It just gets too hot to continue shooting when it's 110 degrees!

This is a managed/fully staffed range, meaning there's a Range Master and many Safety personnel who ensure there's no firing during a cease fire. The usual firing time is 15 minutes, then a cease fire warning in one minute is announced, then the cease fire is called. Everyone MUST clear their guns and cannot approach their shooting area for about 10 minutes. This time allows for anyone to replace their targets or adjust the target's range. The downside to safety is, this takes time which is OK with us. We were assigned our SHADED shooting area seconds after the signal was given to resume firing. Therefore lane assignment timing is a time factor. First time shooters are required to watch a short video on the operation of this Range. There are restrooms and a food vendor on site. Parking is not a problem. A wide selection of paper targets is available but there are NO AMMO sales or gun rentals. The Range does supply wooden target frames that must be used. Your shooting area/table is similar to Casa Grande but with two small stools for sitting---I recommend to bring some folding chairs for comfort!

I consider this one of the best and safest shooting ranges around. The staffing ensures it's safe! When we visit other unstaffed ranges, it's always interesting to watch people who don't know what they're doing. They will just walk onto the firing range without calling a cease fire! They just don't understand that they become a moving target at their own risk! You can attempt to explain what they are doing wrong but it usually ends up with a "" I thought you knew what I was doing!""

Here's the website address for additional information and to confirm opening/closing times:

5,"Dr. White is amazing! She saved my dogs life when he had parvovirus as a puppy. Due to the parvo, he had a lowered immune system and we made frequent visits to the vet for ear infections, and other sicknesses that occur in dogs. Dr white has always been professional, she tells me exactly what he needs, and gives me recommendations, but NEVER has tried to nickel and dime me. Her recommendations have always been what's best for my dog and unlike other vets she doesn't try to get me to spend unnecessary money on things that don't matter. I live pretty far away from lone mountain animal hospital but it is worth the drive because I know they have my baby's best interest at heart.  He's two now and healthier than can be thanks to this place! They also take walk ins with little to no wait time most of the time. I can't recommend this place enough. They really care!

Also, a front desk receptionist(I'm not sure of her name) always calls my dog ""the little parvo survivor"" every time we stop in, even if it's for a nail trim. It's been two years since this happened And the fact they still remember him makes us both feel special!"
5,"Went to Chapman Mazda to lease a 2015 Mazda 3 and my salesperson Daisha was amazing! She went above and beyond to make sure I got a good deal. She didn't try to pressure me and she was extremely friendly. Steve in finance was very cool as well. A lot of laughs.

Anyone looking for a new or used Mazda need look no further"
5,"A hummingbird with a broken wing fell into my lap this morning. You have to obviously try to save it's life. Most vets are closed on Sundays but the ones that were open recommended me to call this place they take birds exotic animals and basically every kind of animal. I was lucky they were open on Sunday took my little hummingbird in they called it a good Samaritan thing and didn't charge me for seeing the bird, examining it and passing it on to a rehab person. I mean what else could you ask for from a vet hospital open on Sundays they see every kind of animal and had true compassion for animals. Recommended five stars."
5,"helpful staff, amazing colonic. D is heaven sent, friendly, relaxing and a genuinely beautiful spirit. I can't believe the things the colonic has helped with- skin, stress, digestion, indigestion."
5,"Nathan was very helpful, polite, and knowledgeable.  The service was great & they even hand washed our car & leveled off all of the fluids for our free 1st oil change.  All of this was done very quickly & well."
5,"Four of us were looking for a lunch spot and accidentally found Poki Point. We all had regular bowls. I had the ""Point"" which is a great mix of seafood, veggies, fruits and spices. Loved it and a lot of food! My family had chicken as the protein and they all loved it. Not as pricey as similar in the area. Friendly staff and very fresh and clean. We will be back."
5,This is simply perfect for late night drinking/hunger munchies food. The pizza is super huge so go hungry.
5,"easily my favourite pizza joint in Ontario.  nice thick crust, plenty of fresh toppings and cheese to give it that wow factor."
5,Awesome hospital. They take in and treat strays. We found an injured bird and they took him in! We love this place. :)
5,"I'm in Pittsburgh for some work, and craved Korean food. I was skeptical of coming here because of the reviews, but I was here during lunchtime and no one is in the restaurant, but me. Maybe this is why I feel like my food is much higher quality than others did. I ordered dukbokki and sundubu jjigae (which is my ultimate comfort dish if I'm eating Korean). He waiter is really friendly (is this family-run?). 

Service was perfectly fine and he made sure I always had a full glass of water. Food is fresh, it's not top notch (because I was lucky enough to go to Seoul, but it ultimately doesn't matter, plus I live in Philly so restaurants there are great), but I thought it was great and prices are perfectly fine. 

People try and find such cheap food/labor for cuisines that aren't as common in the US, so I never try to argue about prices to a reasonable extent. This is great for people who want a lowkey lunch or night, looking for their Korean fix. Then again, I was the only one there at around 2:30 in the afternoon. 

Wish they served kimbap, though!"
5,I was very nervous to try this. My husband and I are trying to get healthier and a friend recommended this place. The staff was very helpful and nice. Answered my million questions and made me feel comfortable.  The procedure wasn't bad at all. Thanks to your awesome staff!
5,"Had an amazing breakfast here this morning.  The breakfast table, foul, and pastries were all amazing.  Very friendly staff.  Picked up some olives, feta, and pita to go.  Wonderful."
5,Délicieux !!! Tout simplement bon :) j'adore . Il y a plusieurs choix!!!! Plusieurs tailles de sandwichs
5,"I'm not posting this review for the coupon, didn't even use it
But this place is great. Our server was awesome, so lovely. Great service.
Decor is so beautiful, Turkish traditional, very cosy which matches the Turkish music.
Food was awesome. I had Adana kebap, so tasty and very close to authentic Turkish cuisine. My boyfriend ordered Kari?ik pide, was not bad but not so great. 
Künefe, on the other hand was amazing, perfectly baked. Künefe is baked in a steel dish on direct flames, can be easily overbaked and burnt, but this one was the best künefe I've ever had in Toronto (I tried it in 3 other restaurants).
The only thing is the price, one could say it's a bit pricy. 
After all, I'll go back there for sure"
5,Such a great grocery store and restaurant to have in Pittsburgh. I love to get gyros from the Cafe. It's great to be able to buy hummus and pita bread when you're craving it and have it for lunch at work. They sell foods you can't find at Giant Eagle and everything is authentic.
5,"Very safe place to shoot. Friendly staff and most of the time are watching out for those newbies who don't know how to handle a weapon. Best place to go shooting. After a bad experience at shooters world , this place became my number 1 place to shoot."
5,Great tasty food. Love the chicken shawarma platter and salad. The fries are the best in the area. Owners are extremely customer service oriented. You won't be disappointed.
5,"Love this place. I've been taking my dog here since 2015. There's never a wait when we make an appointment and our regular vet, Dr. Lee, is always very sweet with my dog. It's a little expensive but I think its probably consistent with most other animal hospitals."
5,"So pleased to have found Lone Mountain. We are new to area and needed an avian vet. After a bad experience at another local ""recommended"" avian clinic was so relieved to have found Lone Mountain - a much better alternative! Though I understand all their doctors are experienced with all animal types, incl exotics, we were lucky enough to get Dr. Starks who is wonderful, knowledgeable and a bird owner himself. Staff is professional and always able to get us in when we need an appt. Great solution for a vet clinic ~ thank you Lone Mountain!"
5,"My favorite Korean restaurant around. I've spent a substantial amount of time in Korea and I'm preparing to move there permanently. This restaurant makes me feel at home, in Korea. Very authentic. The spicy pork is amazing and the Bulgogi is pretty great too! Staff if always friendly and food is always made fresh. For all you Kimchi lovers, this Kimchi is as good as it gets. Absolutely phenomenal! The only negative aspect is the parking situation. There is no near street parking so you usually have to park quite a journey away and just walk. But, it's worth it! Five stars, hands down."
5,"Specific to the Clay Target Center.  My son is an avid shotgunner.  He loves the sport and right before his state tourney his gun started acting up.  With very little time before his competition the folks who work at the range were all hands on deck to find a solution.  From the wonderful Chainsaw to the amazingly helpful guy who runs the snack area - Dr. McCraw - (who I've heard is an amazing shotgunner and coach) they came up with a solution that allowed my son to shoot well in his competition even without his own custom fit gun.  

Everyone out here is knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and super supportive of the kids.  As someone who was not raised around guns or ever participated in this type of activity I appreciate all the help I've been given making sure my son is trained, safe and has a ton of fun."
5,"Best middle eastern food around. Both groceries and hot foods are incredible and authentic. 

Having grown up in a Lebanese household, I know what middle eastern food should look and taste like, so believe me when I say Pitaland gets it right. 

Their pita bread is the best I've ever had. Their meat, cheese, and spinach pies are always in my fridge in case I want a quick lunch. Their labneh is incredibly addicting. 

Their cafe offers gyros, which are very good. They also have fattoush salad and it's my favorite thing on the menu. I get it with chicken. 

The staff is mostly made up of middle eastern individuals, so they know what they're doing. They're very friendly as well and make relationships with the customers. 

Highly recommended!"
5,"I've been here multiple times with friends and family and I've loved everything I've had!  I've had the buttermilk pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, pumpkin pancakes, Swedish pancakes, and a blueberry blintz.  The bacon and sausage are delicious, you can tell it's of good quality.  They use real maple syrup and cream.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality."
5,"This place is magnificent. I'm vegetarian and there were plenty of delicious sandwich options, all for about $3.  If you're going veggie, I would get the vegetarian chay on the Banh Mi menu - it is more flavorful than the avocado (my husband got the avocado - and I won.)

It's deli counter service, but there's a patio and some seating indoors. 

Great location too. Right across the street from the National Film Board. Great for a sunny day and a walk on St. Denis before a movie."
5,"Love this place. We seem to be there once a week or so. Nothing overly fancy, just really good food. Spring rolls & the stuffed jalapeño appetizers are awesome. The miso soup is really good too! The sushi always rocks. We've taken down an ungodly number of Godfather rolls & crispy philly rolls. And for dessert, fried green tea ice cream. Always leave this place very full & very satisfied. Staff are super nice too. And at leas for this year, they're doing an all you can eat special, $20 (sometimes $15) a person, whole menu is all you can eat. The catch is if you order too much sushi & don't finish it, there's a penalty for each piece not eaten. So bring your appetite if you wanna try it out."
5,"Amazing food , beautiful place and very polite staff .  We were 4 people , ordered 4 dish appetizer and the kabob combo which was big enough for 4 people  Defiantly coming back"
5,"This place is amazing. Their bread!!! Delicious, soft pitas made fresh in store, plus many other kinds of middle eastern flatbreads. I bought delicious Lebanese olive oil here, tasty baklava, lots of cheap legumes. Definitely a place that made me wish I had lived in Brookline!

I almost forgot about their spinach pies and cheese pies... soooooo good."
5,"Being a traveler and compared to the other major cities that I've been in, the breakfast was actually very well priced for the quality.  I love how their menu allows you to build your own plate to some degree since many items are broken out individually.  I went in mid-week and was quickly seated.  However, most importantly...the bacon quality is really really outstanding."
5,"I've been hankering for some Greek and since I missed out on the festival I was happy to find Greka almost tucked away. 

The woman who greeted me, I'm assuming the owner, was very friendly and welcoming. I ordered the chicken and beef platter, which she brought to me along with cutlery and napkins. The meal itself was good, but for the price couldn't be beat. 

I'll definitely stop by to grab a gyro again sometime."
5,"I've been here a few times, and for a municipal range, This place is amazing.
What make me want to comment was some of the low ratings others have given because the range masters were too strict, or yelled at people. I find that puzzling. Their careful oversight of the other shooters was one of the things I liked best about this place. I know that I know what I am doing with a gun , but my assumption at a range, or driving a car down the freeway, is that every other person that I don't know is an idiot, who might do anything, at any time.
Guns in the hands of strangers are dangerous, and the zealous inspections of the tables and respect for the shooting line, lowers the risk that someone will accidentally putting a hole in me. The range masters may be over kill sometimes but better that than just plain kill."
5,They have a great crew working here. Range is always clean. I'm here once a week.
5,"I just want to give a shout out to Lone Mountain. My dogs are frequent guests.  Truffles and Lily have been coming and staying here for a while. The staff is wonderful I seriously couldn't rate one better than the next!

We trust them with all our hearts.  I've even gotten texts from them while we are on vacation to let us know that our furry babies are fine!

Thank you !

The Fann fur family !!!!"
5,Not a big seafood fan but the crab meat is amazing! Made me change my mind about seafood now that I've tried Poki Point
5,This is the best pizza I have had between markham and oshawa. It has a crispy bottom and soft dough with lots of topping. My boyfriend and I split a medium and still have almost half a pizza left over. We will be coming back. Great server too.
5,"I had an awesome experience yesterday.  Jessica did my hair and makeup.  I wanted something a little different, so I told her to flip my hair out.  At first I was not sure, it looked so different, but the more I saw it the more I liked it.  Then she did my makeup, I told her to do whatever she thought would accentuate my eyes.  I told her to pick any color she wanted.  It looked awesome.  My hubby looked at me and told me I looked like a Bond girl. I was very happy with my experience and I can't wait to book another appointment with Jessica."
5,"I have enjoyed working with Jesse McMahan, the general manager.  He steps up to the plate and does a wonderful job.  He is a man of his word, which gives him 5 stars in my book."
5,"This was my first experience with a colonic. I was nervous, but Eliza talked me through everything.  She was willing to leave me alone when I needed and able to help from just a buzzer away. 
    I was very happy with my experience at Healing Waters.  I have already booked my next appointment!!"
5,Fish is always fresh. I like how you can customize bowls. I wish the staff was a little friendlier. Our weekly stop for poke.
5,Heidi did my blowout and given the massive head of hair I have I was duly impressed with the speed she completed it in.  Salon is spartan but uber clean  I will return. If you have thick curly hair ask for Heidi!
5,"I love roti, but I couldn't find good place in Toronto. However this restaurant's roti is great!
Pho is good too."
5,Overall I love this location. Plesant smiling employees. Fast & knowledgeable in products & menu. Even the 2 pups I see on the patio every morning from the drive thru.
5,best pizza in south side. huge drink selection. awesome atmosphere. $4 for a slice that could easily feed 2 people!
5,This is an amazing Animal Hospital. Dr. Taylor Parker is by far one of the best doctors my animals have had the pleasure of seeing. We have a one-year-old staghound that is also known as the delicate dinosaur and dr. Parker is the only person to take care of all her needs. She is very knowledgeable personable and takes time with all her patients and their parents
5,"Hidden from view but a sight to see!
Walking in I was casually greeted by the hostess, warmly wrapped by Winehouse on the speakers, maneuvered masterfully by the simple-to-read menu, pleasantly pleased with the poke (seafood) and afterward comforted by the clean (and individual) commode. 

They have 4 static dishes, I chose 'The Point' (pic below), and a ""build your own bowl"" section to their menu. While they barely opened a few months ago, one criticism I could offer is while the drink selection was good, it's a bit limited. I'd like to see it expanded to include more imported items and lemonade style offerings IMO

The interior design is very well done, food was very good and if your particular dining partner prefers this over Chipotle, like mine did, than this may very well become one of your new favorites spots in Gilbert too."
5,We just bought a car for our daughter at Chapman and what a pleasant experience. We are from California and our daughter is in AZ. We worked with Bill Lohmeyer and he was awesome. Good people. Very down to earth and straight forward. Quick & easy! We appreciate all the help!
5,"Best restaurant ever !!! Awesome service, the server is very friendly and nice, very clean, cheap and delicious food!!!! If you sushi/sashimi lover this is the place to go !!!"
5,"This is the single best place in Pittsburgh to get a slice of pizza. It's bigger than your head, so start with just one slice, not many people can finish more than that. And in my opinion you shouldn't order one with toppings since they're not cooked in the pizzas, they're just added on top and reheated. But it's an excellent slice, New York style, thin crispy crust, zesty cheese. One small criticism, I wish they'd keep a container of Gel GRANULATED garlic to sprinkle on top, not the garlic salt that they have since it makes the pizza too salty. 
If you remember Pizza Sola on Carson St., that used to be good, but it is GONE now. It was bought out and renamed almost identically as ""Sola Pizza"" and is no longer any good. Benny Fierro's is almost as good and a bigger slice. Decor isn't anything to write home about and the staff are ""minimally functional"" at best, so you're not going here for the ambience."
5,"We went here for the first time
Staff is friendly and the ingredients are fresh
Very impressed with poki point
My teenager loves this place
Hope to see more of these fresh food places"
5,"I had not been to healing waters in quite some time and was pleasantly surprised in the renovations they had done. It's completely remodeled and is fresh and updated. Tommy was my therapist and she was wonderful. She was gentle and made me feel very comfortable. I tend to get nauseous and she gave me  peppermint to smell along the way and that made all the difference! After my session, she had a nice chat with me about what may help me going forward in the future. I really appreciated that information and guidance. I will absolutely be making this a regular part of my life again. I feel so much better this morning!"
5,"Yup,  I'm  at it again. Took my mom in to try the falafel. Still tasted as deelish as the past few times. I love that the food is consistently prepared the same every time. 
Now I have a full belly and am one happy camper."
5,Bill lohmeyer and Mike Knox really went out of their ways to help us find the best car in our budget!!! They were super helpful and honest!!! I really had a great experience looking for our car and they were super!!!! I wish everyone could have a great experience like I did!!!! Ask for these two to help you can't go wrong!!!
5,"Amazing food and quality , taste is so authentic , has a prayer room too .. Wow .. My fav place in Toronto"
5,"I just moved to this area from Illinois where I was a member of a private sportsmans club.  I was cautious at Ben Avery based on some negative reviews here and on google.  
I visited on a Thursday around lunch time.  The woman who took my shooting fee was friendly and offered me eye, hearing protection and targets (which I did not need).  To the RSO station (at this point you should have your eye and hearing protection ON if the range is ""HOT"" (people are shooting)), I was immediately greeted and asked what distance I would be shooting, was given a table number.  The shooting areas, benches and stools are clean and in good condition.  Brass is policed and not littered everywhere, like at many other ranges, clubs I've been to.
On to shooting - watch the video on youtube.  Their safety rules are simple and straight-forward.  Follow them.  Their are several RSOs to help, answer questions, etc.  They have cease-fire every 15 mins - which is great because it gives you more opportunities to check and reset your targets, etc.  The RSO announcements are clear and provide frequent reminders of rules, etc.
The RSOs I encountered were friendly and helpful.  I suspect it gets busy on the weekends and RSOs must be more attentive and assertive when people are being unsafe.  At any rate, I used to pay over $500/year membership at a private club, plus volunteer time commitments. For $7/day, I'm in heaven here!"
5,"We have been to this restaurant several times,  and always make a point to come in if we're in this neighbourhood. Gulteken (the owner) is a lovely, generous man and the service staff are also really friendly,  especially as we usually are recognized when we come in now. The kunefe here is quite delicious,  the best I have been able to find in any restaurant in the GTA - I have constantly been looking for good kunefe since first eating it in Syria. Come and eat here if you're looking for delicious Turkish food (including Middle Eastern kunefe)."
5,"Gem! 

I sent my husband here to pick up a to-go order once we were done at the car dealer on 51. He said the place was cute and had a bunch of middle eastern groceries/olives/etc. I won't  review on the actual place since I wasn't actually in there, but the food! The food was inexpensive and surpassed my expectations. 

5 stars because nothing we had was less than awesome. The pita (10 pack for $2.50) was warm, soft, and chewy. The chicken schwarma was tasty, the gyro was huge and flavorful, the baba was Smokey, lemony, and creamy, and the hummus! Ugh delicious! 

Will most definitely be back for the delicious guilt free food and the bargain prices!"
5,"Meals are very delicious and servers are great. There are a lot of traditional Turkish taste to choose, so you can easily pick one from the menu that you would love even if you are not familiar with them."
5,"Do you like curry,  pho and asian naan bread? Well if you haven't tried this restaurant then you definitely need to add it to your list. 

Whenever I have a bit more time and not in a rush I like to drop by and grab a bite at this restaurant. I wouldn't say their located in a difficult place to get to but its not a quick in and out restaurant. But for that extra little wait the food is worth it. 

If you come on weekends you will often see a line up outside. Today we had satay beef Noodle, traditional viet beef Noodle soup and pork chop on rice. All of them tasted great, the noodles were cooked just about right and the portion sizes are decent. We took half of two dishes home. For around $12 a person tax and tip in you are guaranteed to be full. 

We will be back again in a couple months. Till then stay warm Toronto"
5,"Shooting, the safe way, for $7 for a day??? Sign me up.

I like the set up.  I like that it's outside, I like that it's lit at night, and I like how it's run with a strict hand.  

Prevents me from being shot, and I appreciate that.

I went on a Wednesday evening at about 6.  While waiting for everybody to get done with their set up, I was looking around at some of the other people there.  

Most people there were your standard t-shirt and jeans, and most likely boots type of guy.  Sprinkled in there were some flippy young girls being taught by their uncle or something how to shoot.

Then there was the dude in a suit.  I swear, he was wearing a fricken suit!  But it was SO big on this smallish guy... real drapey on him... and I turned to the guys I was with and said, ""is that a hit man or a wannabe hitman?""  

We couldn't decide. lol  We figured he was too obvious to be an actual hitman.
 
Otherwise, the staff were friendly and helpful.

The drive is easy, right off I-17, but at night it's fucking dark. It's like you're headed to the Wayne Mansion or something."
5,"It was my first time visiting there, and my very first time getting my colonic therapy session ! I must say I was VERY nervous,  buts Diaona, made me feel VERY comfortable! She assured me that I was doing something great for body! Her soothing voice and spirit,  allowed me relax and let my body ""do what it needed to do"" I told my close friend about the experience,  so I will be bringing him before April for a session with Diaona! I've already booked my 3 sessions with her! 
I strongly recommend coming here, and if you're lucky, you too will be able to experience it with the presence of Ms Diaona!"
5,"Stopped by Poke Point today after the gym and was so happy I did! I think I may have found my absolute favorite meal ever!! Made a bowl with brown rice, tuna, salmon, green and red onion, avocado, house sauce and some crunchy toppings and I could've eaten 10x more! So delicious and a definite must for anyone who loves sushi! Great job!!"
5,Thick slices with amazing sauce and tons of cheese. Salads are fresh and plentiful. They do lots of take out business for the locals. Worth the diversion if you're ever heading down the 401 east of Toronto!
5,The entire staff is great! The experience is worth the trip and money. I feel so energized after the procedure has been completed.
5,"For starters, the restaurant is incredibly large, so don't be afraid to bring a group. My husband and I have never once had slow or bad service. All of the staff really help each other out and are sure to make your dining experience a good one. It's nice when you're at breakfast and your coffee doesn't get cold bc they're always quick to refill it. The dress is casual. I have tried (and LOVED) the spinach eggs Benedict, the blueberry pancakes, the breakfast crepes, and the corned beef hash. I hope you enjoy this place as much as we do."
5,"Destination grocery shopping at its finest. Order a fresh cooked lunch at the counter and then browse around the store while you wait. After you eat, you can go back and gather all the produce, olives, spices, pickle jars, frozen cheese, bulk grains, party dips, and salads you can carry.  There is always something new to discover and the staff is super friendly. Pitaland will bring a smile to your face!"
5,always friendly and happy to make special orders the way you like them or they'll keep trying until they get it right at no cost to you ... Also they open at 4am when most others arent open til 5
5,"My wife and I were looking for something new on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Went on Yelp and
 this came up. It was amazing! Everything so fresh and tasty. We'll be back."
5,"Delicious!  chicken shawarma, salad with yogurt and rice. Hummus everything was good. I was surprised how tasty it was. Highly recommend to try"
5,"Dr.White is great, very clean and friendly staff. First time dog owner and I highly recommend."
5,"Great sushi! 

I've been to several sushi places around charlotte and this is the best I've come across yet. Not so much for the decorating and interior of the place, which honestly, isn't all that hot but because the food is just delicious. The group I went with shared 4 of their specialty rolls and everything about them was perfect from presentation to taste. Another thing to note is that they serve little complimentary apps before your meal so you start out with some free seafood salad as well as rice with a spicy sauce on top. These apps are very small portions but it's just one of those ""value added"" treats that a lot of places do not bother making the effort to do for the customers. We did also order some Edamame as a additional appetizers but I was a little let down on the portion size here. There must have been a uptick in the soybean market or something to cause them to have to cut back on their Edamame portions because usually places will load you up on these. But I digress. Anyways, if you are a sushi person this one is a ""must hit"" so be sure and give it a try."
5,My daughter loves Primp and Blow. The staff is very friendly and her hair is always done correctly. Thank You
5,"I went to TOPH on a late Sunday morning with a fairly large group. We had to wait about 30-40 minutes to be seated, though it was all worth it when we got our food. If you do decide to eat here, I recommend the pancakes (hence the name). I was amazed at all of the unique pancakes. I ended up sticking with the traditional buttermilk pancakes, which were fluffy, buttery, and melted in your mouth. My friend got the s'mores, however, which was adorned with mini marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and turned out to be equally delicious. The wait for the food was also a little long, however our waitress was very kind and friendly and kept checking in on us and refilling our drinks. The interior is nice, not very special, and easy on the eyes. It was a little loud, however, I loved it and can't wait to go back."
5,"Came again on a rainy day. Despite the weather, it's still a place you have to try - not just for the pool, but for the views and ambiance too. 

Had the power bowl: Açai with honey, nuts, banana, blueberries, strawberries and granola. The best combination and bowl I've had thus far. Fills you up real quick and is the cheapest dish on their breakfast menu. 

I'll probably be back for a couple more visits before the summer season ends."
5,"Walked in, walked out with an excellent sandwich in about 5 minutes. So affordable. You wonder why you ever pay double for subway. Ordered the sardine bahn mi and couldn't stop smiling. So good. So worth going. I want to eat everything there."
5,"Whether you are buying groceries or buying fresh cooked meals, this is the best Lebanese food in the Burgh. They make their pitas on site and you can see them being made. They have an olive bar that has a great selection of olives. They have fresh hummus, yogurt, babaganoush, and stuffed grape leaves. I love their gyros and the chicken shawarma.  For ""sauce"" on the shawarma they take pure garlic and whip it until it becomes a paste. It is SO good but leaves a slow burn. You can get Tahini sauce to cut the burn. 
Everything's fresh and delicious. Love!! Love!! Love!!"
5,"My son and I made the trip out Ben scary campus. we were preparing for our hunting trip last fall and we had a very good experience. It was very friendly and offered the long range shooting that we needed to prepare for his first deer hunt.  I'm very thankful for Ben Avery as my son could shoot up to 200 yards, which prepared him to bag my son's first deer"
5,"My friends and I were really impressed by the freshness and taste of Osaka's sushi.  We ordered the appetizer sashimi (big enough as a single entree), seaweed salad (a generous amount was served), the tuna trio (delicious), and the usual rainbow roll which did not disappoint either.  The service was great and very attentive, they were even nice enough to give us some free appetizers.  Def a great place for sushi, the prices were def reasonable.. going to go back soon!"
5,"By far the BEST blowout I've ever had.  Not sure how Shannon can do what she does with my hair but I LOVE her.  Way better stylists than that ""other"" blow dry place."
5,"I will definitely use this procedure for life. Tiffany, the technician, was amazing. She was kind, knowledgeable & very professional. I was extremely comfortable & she made the process clear & understandable. I will definitely be back."
5,Made my dogs feel comfortable. Thank you for being so nice. Vaccines are not over priced. Staff very caring.
5,"We rode down Brookline Boulevard today and discovered that a street food war is apparently underway; Pitaland is now selling hot food outside, 2 doors down from Las Palmas Carniceria's taco tand. I saw a vertical spit with what appeared to be shawarma (?) on it. The Boulevard is becoming all the more curious..."
5,"This place is SO good! I got the marinated tuna with spicy yuzu sauce on spring mix and a bunch of yummy fresh toppings with the house sauce on top. Bomb!! Everything is fresh and super flavorful! We also ordered Masubi and they made it fresh, best masubi I've ever had and we've tried it in Hawaii! We can't wait to go back, it will be very soon!!"
5,"Love the outdoor range, you can appreciate the beauty of the desert while shooting til' your hearts content.
Quick and easy check in, they don't take your drivers license or make you fill out paperwork. Some people might think that's risky but honestly if you're planning to harm someone in a gun range signing some papers and handing over your I.D. isn't going to stop you. 
Every fifteen minutes they give a one minute warning. After that there is a gun check and everyone is allowed out to look at or change targets. They tell you when you're allowed to shoot or not because they can't let people just walk out and change targets when other people are still shooting, everyone has to go at the same time. I don't see this as a hassle, just common sense.
Very professional, friendly, and helpful staff. Prices are more than reasonable. They have an array of snack and soda machines near the check in window in case you need an extra bottle of water or pack of starbursts. 
I would suggest putting your earplugs in before getting out of the car if loud noises bother you, the parking lot is right behind the range."
5,Best sushi! Great service! We come here all of the time and recommend it to our friends!
5,"This place was a great find! Had to wait a little as it was busy for Sunday breakfast, but once we were sat it was worth the wait! The staff was incredibly friendly and prompt. The food was delicious, and the portions were a large size. Our group got pancakes, both regular and blueberry and they were good. The omelettes were the size of the plates and extremely filling. Crab cake eggs benedict were also a hit! All and all worth the wait, and would return at any time!!"
5,One of the best breakfasts spots around. You will never leave here hungry (huge portions). Lots of great pancakes and omelettes to choose from. Good coffee and service in this large restaurant. Sometimes a small wait for tables and difficulty parking due to the popularity of the place.
5,"Been living in Toronto for 2 years now and I can honestly say this is my favorite lunch spot in town! The atmosphere is priceless and the food is simply great. I love just being there and enjoying the view. The interior is just amazing and on nice sunny days, it honestly feels like a dream. Would go back forever! Totally recommend for a cool lunch outing in town"
5,AMAZING PIZAA!!!! love this place and very reasonable price
5,First time trying turkish food in Toronto. The food was amazing!!!!! It was very very good. The staff were friendly . Loved this place
5,"Stayed across the street visiting family and was pleasantly surprised coming here. Everyone was incredibly friendly and says good morning when you walk in. Quick service, brought our food out to our table just to be nice. Seems like a fun group working here"
5,"I don't always write reviews but I thought this little business deserved one and a good one.
As soon as I left the place I thought about writing this review.

Well, it's a place that gives a very good first impression and when you leave it's still the same too.
Very welcoming place and people too, very clean, well presented, they basically sell vietnamese sandwiches and it's not that pricey too, I'm vietnamese myself and I've eaten quite a few and for the price, the banh mi are very good, they don't cheap out on the stuffing, it's prepared on the spot and you don't see any sandwiches ready for sell on the counter so you know it's always fresh. You see them prepare your sandwich like at Subways.

They mainly sell banh mi, but they also sell sushi but it's already prepared in advanced and stored in a fridge, there's also bubble tea, iced coffee, vietnamese desert and beverages, they even sell bananas for 75 cent each! Very smart place, you can see where they came from.

There's also a 30% rebate after 9 p.m on some products that need to be sold as soon as possible such as sushi, spring rolls and other stuff I can't remember that cannot be preserved for too long.

In short, this will be the perfect place for me whenever I will need a lunch to go and I don't have time to make it myself!

It's cool to see a vietnamese business thriving and doing so honestly and willingly."
5,"Best pizza in Durham bar none!  I prefer thick crust pizza loaded with lots of toppings, but unfortunately nobody does Chicago style here... Pizza Pino is more like Buffalo style, which is a New York/Chicago hybrid.  Lots of toppings, thick crust.  It's not significantly more expensive than chain pizza but blows them all away in quality. What was really telling is, ""extra"" or ""double"" cheese is not offered as an option. You won't need it....

If you're tired of GTA chain pizza where the sauce and cheese are applied with a spray gun, but are also not a fan of thin crust so-called ""gourmet"" hype with stupid toppings (I hate that CPK-style crap), try Pino's.  Driving to Ajax is a lot cheaper than travelling to New York or Chicago!"
5,"First time got delivery . Took a hour but was worth it . Pizza was great after eating 5 wings I could only eat a peice and a half I was so full . Lol I'm stuffed but it was amazing! 
I got the wh wh crust as we eat clean . To me was a bit bitter tasting so I'd get reg next time maybe.  Definatly a amazing Montreal style pizza. Wings are also big and fresh ."
5,"The cashier looks a lot like Enrique Iglesias, I almost asked if he would sing for us. No but seriously, thank you Yelpers for helping me find this great bakery and restaurant. I'm new to Lebanese food, haven't had much exposure yet, but we tried and we loved! Had the Beef Shwarma, was delicious. My only regret is not ordering the full plate, will definitely be stopping here regularly."
5,"I haven't purchased from this dealership yet, but I was very impressed with the customer service, attitude and knowledge of our salesman, Michael, during our test drive of the Mazda CX 5. First he introduced himself to our kids also, which is surprisingly rare. He offered us all water. Then he pulled the two models of interest to us in the parking spaces right outside so we didn't have to walk all over the lot. He knew all the answers to my questions. He showed me all the features on the car, but wasn't at all pushy. We drove one model with him in the car and he wasn't overly chatty, which was great. Then he let our family drive another model alone since there wasn't quite room for five. I haven't decided yet on a make and model, but if I do go with the Mazda CX 5 or the Hyundai Santa Fe, I will certainly call Michael first to try and make a deal."
5,My experience at Healing waters was peaceful and super healing. The staff was super friendly and helpful. I was worried it would be awkward but that was not at all the case. Highly recommend Healing Waters if you're in Vegas and need a colonic.. This is the place!
5,"""Vua"" is the Vietnamese word for king, and this restaurant lives up to that name. I grew up in Toronto, now live in the US East Coast, even ate banh mi in Vietnam - and Vua ranks very close to the top banh mi I've ever had (so take my review seriously because I'm not some clueless American tourist who is new to banh mi). 

Service:  very friendly and the Vietnamese staff not only speak Vietnamese, they can take your order in French and English. One day I came in right at opening time and was told by the cashier that sandwiches weren't yet available, but when she saw our disappointment she went back and called the kitchen staff to have them make us sandwiches. What sweethearts! There are a few tables inside near the door, a very small terrasse with some more tables, and a shared indoor dining space with Thai Express (but is located one floor above Thai Express, or two floors above Vua). 

General comment: the sandwiches are loaded with liver pate and housemade soy sauce which is how it's supposed to be done in Vietnam. This ain't your typical lazy banh mi shop in North America that uses bottled soy sauce and acts stingy on pate content. This means your sandwich will drip an oozy mixture of mayo and soy sauce so watch your clothing, but don't despair - only the most legit banh mi will drip in this manner. Also the bread gets toasted before all the other ingredients go in, and ends up with a crispy exterior and fluffy interior. 

#1 Dac Biet sandwich: Loaded with Vietnamese deli meats, some pate, and priced 50c less than every other sandwich. Amazing value and beautifully balanced flavor with the pickled vegetables. 
#12 Liver Pate sandwich: No deli meats here, just a massive gob of pate along with the pickled vegetables. It looks frightening to see how much pate they use, and I was so unbelievably excited when I saw them pack in this amount of flavor.

Side note, after 9pm the prepared foods (usually between $7-8) are an additional 30% off - this includes delicious plates of fried rice, steamed rice with grilled meat, and/or stir fried noodles. They just need to be reheated.
Overall, absolutely solid and authentic banh mi shop in a cute and conveniently located neighborhood, I'm sure to return next time I'm in MTL.
Last comment (I promise): $5 credit card minimum."
5,We stumbled on this restaurant when we were planning on going to Dennys. Going to the pancake house was the best decision we made that day. We've been back a few times since and we'll be back!
5,"On my 2nd Mazda started taking my previous car here after brake and oil changes done at othe ""discount"" drive by places and messed car up. Chapman always serviced car well without ""selling"" other services not needed and when recommended work was offered they were understanding of financial situation and recommended on priorities. Purchased my 2nd Mazda from them and they were phenomenal on working with my needs and financing. I find they are exceptional professionals!"
5,"I'm literally the biggest fan of pho.  If you look at all my other reviews or even go onto my IG food page, I post 80% pho restaurants.  

However, HERE at Green Lemon Grass, I always get the satay beef noodles.  I don't understand how anything can be soooo good.  It's so perfectly spicy but unspicy, there's so much noodles and beef.  I don't even care if it's a cold day or not, I can eat this in like scorching heat and still be happy.

The pho here is not bad either.  The broth doesn't seem 100% legit viet, but I have had worst and the portions here are supreme for the prices.

The curry beef brisket rice is a literal game changer.  They give you this giant ass bowl of the curry and beef separate from the rice and it's sooo creamy and delicious.

HOWEVER, do not order the chicken skewers.  They came right when I was about to pay the bill and I didn't want to ask them to take it back ... they were sooo dry and tasted a little funky.  Pass.

I haven't been back in a while and I'm kicking myself for it.  When Winter comes, I am going to be supporting this place like no other."
5,I used USAA car buying service to lead me to Chapman Mazda. Chapman Mazda's price was the best in the valley and the transaction could not have been better. Jeff Andre was my salesman and he was excellant in every way. I appreciate the no pressure attitude of the sales team. Highly recommended company!
5,"This particular Starbucks has incredibly nice, competent employees. On mornings when I wake up before my boyfriend and need some java this is where I go.

It's clean and efficent. There's always a nice aroma of coffee. I've been through the drive-thru as well and it can be a bit slow, but not nearly as slow as some others I have been to.

Also, their breakfast sandwiches, although overpriced (yes I know, it's Starbucks), are yummy yummy! I actually had one today, the bacon, egg, and gouda cheese. The gouda cheese definitely makes it real good. Mm hmm. 

Great Starbucks location. No complaints from me."
5,Great food (Adana Kebab and Beyti Kebab) and service+ a pleasant environment
5,"Their food is amazing. Definitely beat out Bamiyan Kabob with the Huge portions! Decor is very nice and leather booths very comfortable. Their spicy sauce is amazing, as well as their white sauce. The chicken and Kofta Kebabas are packed with flavour. You definitely want to try it out and we will definitely be coming back. 
Price is average $11.99 for a huge plate of chicken & kofta with rice and salad, also including their fresh bread."
5,"Stopped by last week.  Store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and I think a cafe will be put in the front.  

The pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods.  You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.  Olive oil, olives, cheeses, Hoummus Dip, Baba Ghannouj, deserts, Halva, Specialty Pita Pies.  

Good food and friendly service."
5,"I almost did not go, because Samuel had such a negative review. Hmmm . They should take that down. I was greeted with so much light and enthusiasm. I had the procedure and was coached all the way through it. My technician, Heather, really took care of me. She helped massage my stomach getting stuck things to pass. We added coffee, as to have a coffee enema like experience. This helps a lot. We also added acidophilus, charcoal, and immune boosters - echinacea and golden seal toward the end. I felt relief and know I need to
Go back. I'm
Thinking of going back today.
At the end I was given hibiscus tea with minerals, and instructions on how to eat right now, and a plan to get the additional yeast from my intestines. I'm
So happy I went."
5,"As a first timer, I have to say Healing Water was a very gentle and relaxing experience. My health has been poor the last 3.5 years so this was a much-needed visit. Now I am getting back on a healthy track and Healing Waters is to Thank for that. Highly Recommended !!!"
5,"Yummy. Variety, convenience, enterprising spirit. A rarity in downtown Montreal. Enough said. 

Apparently I need to be a little more long winded to qualify as a yelp review. Sandwiches, sushi and Vietnamese dishes are mad fresh. If it's more than 8 hrs old they give you a 30% discount! You'd be hard pressed to find that kind of enterprising spirit in Montreal.

Sandwiches are as good and cheap as on Spedina in Toronto, or Bolsa in Westminster/Garden Grove.
I've been going to their original location on St. Denis for 5 years now and finally I can go during work hours with this new downtown location. So looks like these guys will not be some fly by night deli that plagues la centreville. Bon courage mes amies!"
5,"Food: 9/10

Service: 10/10 

Atmosphere: 10/10

Went here for a birthday brunch on a Saturday and all I can say is that this place is AMAZING. My friends and I made reservations and were promptly seated at a big couch near the windows with a breathtaking view of the CN tower and the lake. The entire restaurant is well lit with huge windows and has a very classy yet casual vibe. 

The service was here was on point-our server was very patient with our order and always came to check up on us. He also was super patient when we asked him to take a few picture for us! 

They don't have an actual coffee menu but they do offer a full espresso service. I tried their iced plain latte and it was honestly one of the best lattes I've had at a brunch place ever. Now down to the food - I ordered the eggs beny with smoked trout and roasted potatoes but my friends also ordered sandwiches and burgers. We all loved our food and would definitely some back during patio season. I highly recommend this place for brunch!"
5,"Let me start by saying I have always had terrible experiences with car dealers. Chapman Mazda was different. Rob Riley was such a great guy and there was NEVER any pressure to buy! I came in thinking about getting a used vehicle. I ended up with a brand new Mazda 3 after hours of test driving several vehicles. With the rebates offered, new was the way to go and Rob helped me through the entire process. I highly recommend Chapman Mazda and Rob Riley if you're in the market for a vehicle!"
5,"Love the LMAH team from front of house to tha back! 

Victoria & Sean were super friendly with speedy check-in turnaround (a spot-on consistency at this office). 

Dr. Parker always shares amazing energy and knowledge with us and makes our lil' Nestley girl feel comfy as can be in her care. 

I especially appreciate their diligence with ""reminder"" and ""follow-up"" correspondence via email... 

Bravo LMAH, here's a 5+ a bonus star from our familia to yours! 

:) :) :)"
5,"My husband and I have been eyeing the 2017 Mazda CX-5 for months (even before it came out)! We've researched and read all the Edmunds / Car & Driver reviews and had our hearts set on it but needed to drive it in person. We also needed to find the right salesman before jumping in. Well we found the right car and the right salesman today! Thank you Bill Lohmeyer for your assistance, no-pressure, caring, knowledgeable, caring demeanor. That sealed the deal and we were able to drive off the lot with our dream car today! woooohooooo so happy! Now we just need to think of a name for our new ride (I name all of my cars, don't judge me)... YAY thanks again Bill Lohmeyer and Chapman Mazda!"
5,"This was an excellent find!!! I have been a Colon Hydro-therapist in Los Angeles for 15 years and was in Vegas for a trade show with my husband. Feeling the effects of Vegas food after a few days, I ventured into the daylight and got a colonic. I am used to a closed gravity system, but this was an open gravity system. I was pleasantly surprised how effective and comfortable it was. The establishment was clean, inviting, open, and the front desk personnel were super friendly and warm. My therapist Diaona was superb. I am a harsh critic too!  Diaona was knowledgeable, professional, friendly, and experienced. I am so pleased with my visit to Healing Waters Las Vegas! I will definitely make it a point to visit every time I am in Vegas! Thank you Diaona and Healing Waters!!!!"
5,"If you have the taste for authentic Turkish cousins then look no further. Great food, great service for all. Don't forget the deserts."
5,"So yummy!! I was initially bummed when my go to Greek place closed a couple months back until i found Greka Pita, now i am so thankful it closed!  Time after time, Greka serves amazing food!  The owners are kind and their food is delicious and consistent.  I am 100% obsessed with their Persian Tea.  Try it, they should bottle it!!  Highly recommended!"
5,Hands down best pizza I have had! Will definitely come here anytime I am in Pittsburgh! Highly recommended!!  loved it!
5,This place just opened and it's less than 5 minutes from where I live! It's so hard to find a poke place here in AZ. So I was pretty excited to find out about Poki Point. I ordered a regular tuna bowl with white rice. IT WAS SOOOOOO GOOD! Definitely not going to be my last time here.
5,Awesome. The customer service was great and tech was very helpful and explains everything really well. The place was clean and very relaxing. It was my first time and it went really smooth.
5,"I bought my wife's 2011 Mazda3 S from Chapman Mazda.  Not a lot to say other than it was about as easy as buying a car could be.  

The car had previous hail damage, but I couldn't find any evidence of this at all and I'm pretty picky.  After going over the car and driving it, I knew it was what we were looking for.  I'm a ""car guy"" and have had many.  I have to get mentally prepared for the song and dance routine that's required for buying a car.  It tends to put me in a bad mood right off the bat.  

Fortunately, none of this was needed.  I was a little baffled as the first price presented to me seemed too good.  I assumed that was before tax, tag, and title. No!  It was the out the door price (?).  I knew right then I'd be buying the car.  Not sure how dealers are reimbursed for hail damaged cars, but it must be generous! Of course I still had to see if I could save a bit more!  While the price of the new car was low, the value they put on my wife's old Mazda3 seemed a bit low, too.  They budged a bit, but not much from there.  Even with the value of the trade being a little low, I still felt like we got a great deal on the car.

The last step, the dreaded trip to the finance office, is always tough.  I feel like I have to be on guard at this step of buying a car as the guy behind the desk makes his living selling people things they don't always need.  When I walked in, I told the finance guy I don't buy warranties, etc, and please just let me write my check and be on my way.  He was friendly, and low pressure.  He mentioned there was an aftermarket alarm on the car that I could have removed or buy.  I declined.  He also took 30 seconds to mentioned the aftermarket warranty, but I think he knew where I stood on this. He printed out the papers, said, ""Sign here"" about 47 times then I was on my way.  No pressure at all to buy anything! Cool!

After this, the woman who handled the sale gave me a quick tour of the car's features.  At this point I was pretty tired and just wanted to go home, but getting instructions on setting up the Bluetooth phone was definitely helpful.

In summary, I was very happy with my experience at Champan.  Everyone I dealt with was friendly.  There was no pressure at all.  Above all, I was thrilled with the price I paid for the vehicle.  Frankly, I can put up with dealer BS for a super deal, but at Chapman there was not BS at all AND the price was great too.

PS - I bought the car in the evening.  When I got home I found there was a snag in one of the seats.  Grrr.  The next morning, I called the manager, Henry, who said he'd figure out a way to get it taken care of.  I live on the south end of Phoenix and had driven to Bell Rd. to buy this car.  I was really bummed about having to take the car up, wait on it, then drive back south.  I couldn't believe it when Henry offered to pick up the car from our home, leave a loaner, then return the car when it was fixed!  Holy cow!  I know Chapman can't do this sort of thing all the time, but I thought it was a remarkable display of customer service."
5,"The BEST damn Bahn Mi I've EVER had. Un-freaking-believable. I am smacking myself I couldn't bring home a ginormous cooler full of these Vietnamese sub-like sandwiches and freeze them: One for each day. For the rest of my life. If there's extra room, I'd bring home double the amount. For breakfast. This quite possibly is what I'd ask for for my last meal on earth. At least an extremely close second. 

Got their small Grilled Chicken Bahn Mi. Extra protein ($1 extra) and avocado ($1 extra). Excellent sandwich. Seriously! The sauce they use, well I forgot to ask the kitchen staff, but it was to die for. I'm having trouble describing it, so just go check it out yourself.

A few seats on their outside patio. Wonderful for people watching - man, do Montrealers love their outdoor spaces! Not very big on the inside, but their's more seating in the fast-casual joint right above them. 

If I could do a UYE for my Columbus peeps here, good gosh I'd do it in a heartbeat. ROAD TRIP!!"
5,"Chapman was the second place we went to.  The first, which, out of courtesy, I won't name, essentially tried to ""steal"" our trade in.  Chapman was straight forward and fair from the get-go.  Rob Riley, the rep we dealt with was excellent throughout.  Happy with both the car, and the process."
5,Authentic Lebanese food. Delish beef schwarma and falafel pitas. Every ingredient was fresh. Quite a bargain at $5 a pop!
5,"Years ago after becoming vegan I came here a few times when Tiffany was here and her parents owned HW.
Now I'm back! 
New and improved...I am a fan!

Since going oil free a few months ago I declared this a PERFECT time for a full reboot. 
And this week has been a total journey.
I can no longer ignore how AMAZING I feel and how much I have learned about nutrition and toxins. 

In my journey I have included several colonics this week. I use this tool as a reminder...my body is a temple and should only ingest actual food items. Not labeled ""food"" products, nor processed ""frankenfoods"".

This tool is an investment in my journey and I take this process very seriously.

I can say halfway into my weeklong journey I am thanking myself and learning a ton.

I am a new fangirl of Tommy, she is an amazing person and complimented me on my goals and whole food living.
She is beautiful inside and out and her intelligent yet sweet funny personality meshed 1000% with me.

Not only the actual process of the hydrotherapy is on point...Tommy was able to guide me to making sure I take at least a 10 strain proabotic daily (which my expensive one at home was only 8!) and to also suggest adding some other tools from Herbally Grounded that I was not familiar with.

A++++++++ I can't wait for my next session. Tommy only works on Tuesdays, so if you want to become a fan girl like me, book with her on a Tuesday.

Oh! Yelp has (at this moment) a $50 for 75 (one session) deal and I think also a $10 off a session check in deal.

Hit me up if you want to completely reboot your life. Clear out a week of your life. Be aware this is a life commitment not ""a flush and back up with McDeath"" type of program. Maybe I should write a blog?  lol"
5,"The decor is casual but interesting.  Definitely not for formal dining, but if you are into grabbing a quick tasty bite lunch or dinner, this is one of the best ones in the area.

The one dish that stands out most here is the curry lamb rice. This is the best place you can get s.e. Asian style curry lamb in gta. The pho were generally above average, and there are better places.  The food generally is quite good.

Roti dishes, rice, sweet vermicellis, are quite delicious.  If I have one peeve its that other than their curry lamb, the other curry dishes were their weakest offering here.   

But theres is more than enough variety to make this worth a visit for casual lunch or dining."
5,"Great place for your Mediterranean needs. Best gyros ever.  Everything is fresh. The employees are wonderful and will go out of the way to help you. 
Anything that I have ever got there has been delicious."
5,"So good! For a cheap eat, come here! You can get a bahn Mi 6 inch or footlong for a great price. Not into a sandwich? There's a boatload of other options: sushi, salads, etc. There's an outside patio and indoor seating, so take your pick. This spot is popular with students, hipsters, business peeps, families, and tourist. Get here before it becomes an artisan cheese shop."
5,"My first experience was great. Totally nervous, but the woman helping me was very informative. I highly recommend."
5,Amazing Amazing Amazing tasting pizzas!! they do not skimp on any of the toppings. they create mouthwatering masterpieces. I have tried many of their pizzas and they always tasted great. best place to get pizza in Durham region and GTA.
5,"Yay! Giant slices of pizza that I will say are BETTER than Pizza Sola (and Pizza Sola was a good pizza). Awesome collection of artisan sodas, clean and aesthetically pleasing decor, excellent service.  


Definitely a better addition to the South Side than Scientology."
5,Staff was friendly.  My dog stayed here for the first time due to our normal place being booked up.  Prices were reasonable and I would use them again in the future.
5,"The building itself seems to be renovated from an old house, awesome atmosphere. The staff was friendly and our waiter was great! Food was outstanding, we got the blueberry pancakes and an apple cinnamon waffle. Both were light and fluffy, nothing was too sweet. Both dishes featured real fruit; the pancakes came with extra blueberry sauce and the waffle with warm apple syrup. Portions are generous without being overbearing, at least for the short stack. The best part though, real maple syrup!"
5,I miss my little gyro place in the West loops of Chicago. But now I don't have to! This is the best gyro I've had since moving to Arizona. And the gentleman (owner I'm guessing) said good bye to use on our way. I can't that kind hospitality at most restaurants where they charge far more.
5,"Great gyros and produce. The boulevard has definitely changed in the past couple years, but Pitaland has stayed the same. The gyro's are always fresh and they have a vast assortment of produce. If you're in the area definitely stop here, as Brookline is on the rise!"
5,"Way to go Brookline! This area is turning into a pretty good lunch destination, with some great ethnic food being represented. I have shopped at Pitaland for olives and sundries in the past, but today was the first time I had lunch at the café. Not only is this a great retail store to buy Middle Eastern items you might not be able to find elsewhere, the prepared food is delicious. 

The menu features lots of Middle Eastern staples, such as falafel, hummus,  babghanouj and the other items that make up traditional mezze. A lamb burger and sandwiches made with their pita bread are also offered, as well as salads and platters. I had the falafel platter, which was wonderful. Their falafel is the best I've had anywhere, and I eat a lot of this stuff. The accompaniments on the plate were fresh and pickled vegetables with a side of tahini and their pita bread. All great. My husband offered to share his fries with me, as they give you a huge portion, and my hand kept sneaking over to his basket for more. These are perfectly fried shoe strings with a sprinkle of something like paprika...I'm not sure, but it was really nice. When I checked out with my olives and groceries, the guy behind the counter gave me a yummy fig on the house. He also sang as he rang up my order, and thanked me for coming in. The guy who took our order at the café also came over to ask us how everything was while we were eating. This would be de rigueur at a full service place, but was notable at a place with counter service. Really nice people and excellent food. I may have to give breakfast a try soon."
5,"Humongous slices and they're at a relatively cheap cost, but they taste excellent. The crust is just right, the ingredients are quality, and they have the perfect balance between sauce and cheese. Would definitely eat here again."
5,"This is a fantastic range located in northern Phoenix.  The price to shoot is extremely affordable ($7!) and the location is very large and welcoming.  The main public range features 67 tables and a 100yd maximum distance and allows FMJ and steel cased ammo so bring all the Wolf you can shoot!!  The method of target attachment are essentially wooden frames with cardboard and masking tape for attachment, all of which is provided.  You will have to purchase your own targets and if you happen to forget they are available at the main check in for purchase.  
     To ensure you have a great range day PLEASE review the rules of the range, watch the 7 minute safety video they have on Youtube and understand the basic rules of firearm safety.  The rules are not there to hamper your fun but to protect your life, so please respect them and don't be a dummy."
5,This place has the best Greek Salad with Chicken. Seriously. Check them out! I'm usually there three times a month for lunch!
5,"Wow! I haven't been into the store since the remodel. It is beautiful. The pitas are world class, all of the store made food is excellent
The hummus, the desserts all of it is outstanding!
Now! They have a small walk up cafe serving all sorts of mid-east food. They even have breakfast.
If you haven't been there in a while, go back, you won't be disappointed."
5,"Absolutely love this place. They have lunch, breakfast, dinner, groceries, deserts. I don't know where to begin. 

They are always super friendly. Their Lebanese breakfast dish, Foul (f?l) is to die for, my mouth was watering as they were simmering the chickpeas and fava beans in garlic and lemon. 

For lunch, I've had their falafel - amazing. They have a garlic sauce called Toom that I literally put on everything, it's strong and spicy. 

Their baklava and desert items are fresh and delicious. They also have an olive bar, and you can watch the fresh pita being made through a giant window to the kitchen areas.  

They have a lot of Middle Eastern grocery items that you can't find any where else in the area. And as I said, they are so friendly and welcoming, they make me want to come back again and again."
5,"I took my first lesson in shooting skeet here with Gary. 
First you watch a safety video, buy your ammo and then head out on the golf cart. 
Tip: try to schedule an early morning session to avoid the brunt of the heat. 

Gary was an excellent instructor with solid and sensible advice. He made it fun and not scary. I recommend his services highly."
5,I tried this because of yelp reviews and boy am I glad I did.  I'm a pizza fiend; this place loads up so much topping and so much cheese..I can't imagine what would happen if u ordered extra cheese.  Wings are fantastic...I'm going to have to adjust my rating for other pizza places because while good..it's not Pizza Pino.  I drive from bowmanville on Sundays and am never disappointed.
5,Love this location! Everyone is so friendly! Drive thru is pretty fast for a Starbucks. Lol as long as you're not behind the person ordering for the whole office  then you're good. Thanks!
5,"My friends and I were very impressed with this sandwich shop. This is the best viet sub we've experienced better than any here in Toronto. Sandwiches were well made, fast, and didn't cost too much.

Even though it was basement level the place was professional and well designed. They offer diverse set of drinks and snacks. This place is so professional and well organized that it makes you think it's a chain. Kudos to the owners for creating such a good experience."
5,This is a must! To get all the old junk out of your body is liberating. I had the pleasure of meeting Diaona who makes an uncomfortable situation very comfortable. She us knowledgable and easy going. They have a store of herbs and tonics to help prevent what we come to these places for. 5 stars service
5,"I came here, yesterday, for my very first colonic and had a great experience! The women there are so welcoming, warm, personable, and knowledgeable. They made the experience more comfortable, and I'm so glad I came here instead of a center closer to my home. Shout outs to Annie, the Tech there, who is absolutely fabulous! Also, shout outs to the beautiful woman at the front desk who is absolutely fabulous as well!!!"
5,"Great experience here. Felt great afterwards and fine during. For as awkward as this experience could be, it really wasn't bad at all. Staff is knowledgeable and you have everything you need to feel comfortable. Great jump start to a diet by getting rid of all the crap and starting fresh only putting good food/drink in afterwards."
5,Don't come to Pizza Pino unless you're famished. Not only is the food delicious but the servings are more than most people can eat in one sitting. It is a bit cozy inside but that adds to the restaurant's unique atmosphere.
5,"Wow, you guys. Wow. 

Does anyone remember the days of Pizza Sola and how huge their slices were but also how sort of lacking in awesomeness of flavor they were? And also the creepiness factor of them always having pizza sitting out for who knows how long and they'd just warm it up in the oven for you? 

Well, this place has none of that nastiness! It's right in the swing of things on the Southside and was surprisingly chill for being 9ish on a Saturday night. My friend raved about this place for the past week, but I was skeptical due to other slice based places in the area that were big in quantity but lacking in quality. 

The slices, as you can see in my photos, are in fact huge. Two plates worth huge. The best part? THE FLAVOR! THE FREAKING THIN BUT CHEWY IN A GOOD WAY CRUST! THE FACT THAT EVERY GINORMOUS PIE IS MADE TO OTHER AND IT DOESN'T SIT UNDER A HOT LAMP WAITING TO BE SNEEZED ON. 

My slice was still bubbling and steaming when it came out of the oven. Do you think I waited for it to come down to acceptable temperatures before tasting it? Pffffft, you must not be familiar with my posts then. This pizza was delish in every possible way, and is appropriately priced at $4 for plain and $5 for a one topping slice seeing as to how you're easily getting three normal slices in one. 

It also happened to be the Southside art crawl, so there were a few bands playing and free beer offered. I had Rivertowne Grateful White and it was great! The not so great was the first band that played...the music was entirely too loud for the small space of the restaurant, and you had to yell at the person next to you to hear them at a whisper like level. Seriously dudes, next time you let a band play there tell them to turn the flipping amp down. The second band was lovely and had a smoother chill wave jazz vibe which I liked, mainly because of the 100% acceptable noise level they were giving off. 

I'll be back to see if this night was just an exceptional fluke or if this is really one of the best slices I've had."
5,I absolutely love this place. I have an autoimmune skin condition the affects my hands and feet and the oxygen and ionic foot detox have been a blessing. I also like the colonics and get them regularly. Everything is affordable but I usually buy a package since it try to come weekly. Highly recommend it.
5,"I never imagined that I'd be sitting here writing a review about colon therapy but I am in total agreement with the others' reviews. Abbi was my therapist and was very knowledgable and offered a lot of suggestions for supplements to help with keeping my already healthy regiment. I was understandably nervous but she was very comforting and explained the process thoroughly. Feeling healthier and lighter to say the least!!  take advantage of the coupon deal, relax, and you'll see how much better you feel!!"
5,Descubrí Pitaland casualmente y recomiendo encarecidamente visitarlo y probar sus productos. Todo en la tienda está muy bien organizado y limpio. Tiene buenos precios y su comida es riquísima. Los dulces son un auténtico placer. El personal muy amable y te hacen muy cómoda la visita.
5,"Attended a friend's birthday here. There were some complications about being seated near the window so we could get a view of the city. 

However, the staff was very accommodating and nice enough to move us to the area we initially requested.
This is the perfect place to take anyone on a date or to catch up with your best pals. It is absolutely beautiful, situated on the 44th floor of the BISHA hotel.

I can already tell this place will become a hit in the summertime for its rooftop views. The patio was not open at this time. The food is reasonably priced. I had the Panela bowl which contains: cheese, corn, quinoa, chickpea, and cherry tomatoes (brunch menu). The drinks, however, are costly. We ordered mimosas for 18 dollars a glass.
The décor is warm and inviting. It is most beautiful on a sunny day - with its exposure to sunlight through the tall windows that surround the entire place.

I will definitely be coming again for a girls day out!"
5,"Giving Benny's a ""5"" in the pizza category (though would give it a 3.8 in the overall restaurant category).  Easily my favorite pizza here in the city and dare I say I'm not sure I have had a better slice anywhere else in my travels around the globe.  Glad to have this small chain represented here in Pittsburgh with a spot on the South Side."
5,"What an absolute gem to find in Brookline. Had a bit of time to grab lunch in Brookline today. This particular neighborhood is one I don't get to much, so since business brought me here I figured I'd come early and grab breakfast/lunch. Not many choices for breakfast along Brookline Blvd. made PitaLand the easy choice. Once I walked through the door I was shocked to see a stocked market, bakery, and industrial pita machine in the back! PitaLand has classic Mediterranean dishes including Falafel, gyro, shawarma, and lamb. It's so rare that I see shawarma, I had to order the chicken version. Well seasoned, just crispy enough, cool pickles, lettuce, onion, and dressing. Perfect amount of food, done well. I had to hold back ordering another. $8.56 with a soda is one heck of a deal for quality food like this. I will be back."
5,God father roll is so good ! Sushi is super fresh and it's my favorite place for Japanese food
5,"The pad thai at Green Lemon Grass was so dank that I'd cut off my right hand to have another taste. Do not listen to the review in which the restaurant was described as being ""ghetto""."
5,Ordered the Greka House Salad with gyro meat. AMAZING! So delicious. If you love Greek food and you love salads definitely give it a try.
5,"We live in NJ and every time we visit our daughter we always have to stop at pita land! Fresh pita, feta, etc.  We take as much home as we can!"
5,Great pizza .. Fluffy not oily. Very friendly service. Had the large 3 topping pizza and 1lbs wings fed 3 people. Very delicious :D
5,"Review of 4-Hour CCW Class by Ken Crane:

Ken Crane was an excellent instructor, with current field experience as a police officer. He simplified the confusing language of the law, and provided real world scenarios to connect the rules and the reality. The 4 hour CCW class is worth the extra time, as it provides some experience on the range. As a bonus, he was quite entertaining in his presentation."
5,Soooo good and cheap! There are many sub options to choose from so you won't get fed up. They also sell sushi and all the little Asian snacks. Can't go wrong with Viet iced coffee either.
5,"Stopped by on a Friday night, and was pretty happy with the meal. Waitress was nice, and gave us the heads up that the spicy seafood soup was large enough to share. We ordered the seafood pancake special for an appetizer, and I ordered the standard bi bim bap. My husband got a beef and seafood dish with vegetables in a brown sauce. Everything was great, but I was a little disappointed in a few things: no juice or tea, my egg was overcooked, and there were only 2 banchan dishes. Despite these small things, eating at this restaurant was a very pleasant experience."
5,"Really enjoyed the surf and turf bowl, which was excellent! I'll be back soon. After you finish your meal, go next door to Bahama Bucks, then at the other end of the strip mall is EOS, where you can work out!"
5,"Roti roti roti
I am a sucker for roti, delicious gluten yummy.
Curry lamb and roti, I order it every time 
Huge portions good prices
Awesome!"
5,"We decided to take a ride back to our old neighborhood. Pitaland was a stop we had to make, it's been so long since we've had delicious freshly made pitas. We also tried the homemade Baklava.... Wow!!!!! It's worth the 30 minute drive alone. Best I've ever had!"
5,Cute little restaurant. Owner was very nice and friendly. The BBQ meat looked a little sketchy when raw but tasted pretty good when cooked. Pork belly was so good! Jigae soup and bibimbap were both pretty good.
5,Great restaurant with many options. Just more expensive that those Poke Bowl place in Tempe
5,"If you go here pick Troy as your salesman, he was awesome!!! He got me an outstanding deal on my 2016 Mazda 3 Touring with no hassle. Very honest cool guy."
5,I've been to Osaki at least four times and I've always had wonderful food and great service!
5,This place is AMAZING!! Pizza is FANTASTIC and huge slices! Staff was very friendly and chatted with us the whole time we were there! A must if on East Carson Street!!!
5,"Best pitas at the best prices, hands down. We keep a bunch in the freezer at all times; pull a few out and make pita pizzas. We've used them with dozens of different topping combinations. Friendly, helpful staff. Homemade, fresh prepared foods. Pitaland is always a great, healthy choice. We love it!"
5,"Highly recommend! Just had my first colonic at Healing Waters and it was a great experience thanks to Ms. D. She was so calming, friendly and informative. The entire staff was great! Would definitely go back."
5,omg seriously best customer service everrr! i absolutely adore the employees here! they are fast friendly and make the best coffee!
5,"All you can eat, great food, great atmosphere and great service. I highly recommend this to any sushi goer in Mississauga. Excellent options with a wide variety of options, a decent drink menu and knowledgable staff. The restaurant can get quite busy and is on the smaller scale so I recommend booking ahead of time. Overall the price is fair for what you get. This restaurant makes for an excellent dinner out with the family or a great date night. Added benefit is there is plenty to do around the area such as the movies."
5,"one of the best Pizza places I know of. Thick crust. Tons of cheese. Large portions, keep your order small."
5,"Simply excellent.  Amazing food.  Amazing people.  Lamb burger is beyond words.  That grilled halloumi  makes you wonder what you did to deserve it.  I have never had anything bad here...  prepared food, service, or food from the grocery."
5,The service was amazing and the food was even better. I had the bip bam bap. Delish and Dan had the #40 seafood noodle soup. Would highly recommend. Place is clean and wonderful. Barley tea is also a nice touch!
5,"Michael Knox and the folks at Chapman were fantastic. I had been researching a CX5 and spoken with a couple other dealers in the valley, and they seemed to be playing 'the game'. Michael was direct, honest, friendly, and listened to what I was looking for. It was fast and efficient, and I feel that I was treated with respect and got a great deal. I couldn't be happier!"
5,I adore this place.  Everything here is good including the service.  I've eaten there and have used their catering service.  Both were fabulous.
5,I love this place. Diaona is the best!! The staff is very kind and helpful. They ensure you feel comfortable and promote a healthy lifestyle. It's truly worth every dime!
5,"Never a bad time here, it's cheap and fun. The R.O.s are a little strict but that's to be expected with all the new people to shooting."
5,"Best pizza in Pittsburgh hands down. True NY style. Huge slices, thin and crispy crust. So excited this place is finally open!!"
5,"I love, love this place. Now, it is a little on the expensive side, but it is well worth it. The last time I was there, I had the almond french toast. Absolutely amazing!!!

If you are hungry, get an omelet. They come in four egg or six egg. It's a breakfast fit for a King.  Yes, five stars for a breakfast place is odd, but it's always that good.  Even the coffee is fantastic."
5,I had the pleasure of trying out Primp & Blow last Saturday and was extremely pleased.  The entire experience was exceptional from the minute I walked in the establishment.  The girl doing my hair was professional and friendly.  I highly recommend Primp & Blow!
5,"Primp & Blow is awesome! This past weekend was my second time coming to the Hayden Rd. location. To start off, the have such talented artists. The first time I went was in August 2012 for a blow out, and this weekend, I got an up-do for a wedding. My experience was phenomenal both time. During my most recent visit, Jacqueline did my up-do and she was AMAZING! In addition, other salon employees were so nice and extremely helpful. I am so impressed by the customer service and Primp & Blow and had a phenomenal experience. I recommend this place to anyone in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!"
5,"I came here as this was the First (and best!) Stop in the Pittsburgh Food Tour that I had booked. Y'all it's a Mecca (pun intended) and if you are a Pittsburgh local and a foodie, you absolutely owe it to yourself to come and check this magical store in person.

I think what surprised me most about the space was how efficient it was and also it was full of unexpected surprises. Behind that unassuming facade is an actual Pita bakery, a butchers, an industrial kitchen space and a grocery store. I was privileged to be given a look behind the scenes, thanks to the tour otherwise I reckon most folks walking in would only see the store + butchers and a glimpse of the fresh in-house Pita making, behind the glass windows.

There was tons of Middle Eastern grocery stuff, mostly focused on Lebanese brands as that where the owner is originally from but there was so much other grocery stuff on the shelves that I didn't recognize. 

Also, the sheer variety of olives was amazing - There was one from Greek that actually tasted sweet!! We sampled lovely freshly made hummus and feta which tasted gorgeous- the only thing they didn't have was camel-milk chocolate, but who knows that might be coming soon.

Absolutely recommend coming here - it's a feast for the senses!!

Yelp Review 40/2017"
5,"Kandahar Kabab is my favourite spot for afghan cuisine in Toronto. They offer quite a variety of kababs  but my favourite is the Sardari Kabab which comes with a chicken breast and kofta kabab. Almost all of the dishes are served on a bed of rice and salad along with two kinds of sauces ( one of which is a lot spicier than the other).

The kababs are always juicy and tender and the portions are huge, the naan bread that comes on the side is a bonus as well. I always leave this place with a serious case of itis haha just because of how full I am after. I have been to this place numerous times and have never left disappointed I would highly recommend this to anyone I know."
5,Great cheap hangover food. You already know the slices are huge and around $5. But they are so good too. I had the chicken bacon ranch and it was really flavorful. Friendly service. Great stop on Carson.
5,Dioana is absolutely amazing! She has years of practice in this field and knows her stuff. All around the staff is amazing. Very kind and sweet. I really appreciated their service and am happy to have found a place here in Vegas. I have only been to one location for years in Los Angeles and was skeptical of going anywhere else. But I'm glad I gave it a try. Will definitely be back.
5,This is a brand new poke place and I came for the soft opening.  The food was fresh and delicious with more options than I am used to. Everyone was really friendly and I devoured my bowl as fast as I could. Definitely coming back!
5,Totally unexpected little fun place. Keep an open mind and take this place for that it is...an quick in and out affordable eating option with a hint of Asian exotic taste.  Absolutely love the price of the bah mi and fun appetizers and snack options! For few mins I felt like I was in another country. Gotta love it!
5,My wife ate here yesterday...she had the Original Gyro...said that it was an awesome lunch...and a nice place to eat outdoors!
5,"I haven't tried a whole lot of Poke places, but the ingredients here are fresh and the flavors are good."
5,Primp and Blow in North Scottsdale is my favorite Blow Dry Bar and I will have to say that I live in Downtown Phoenix and I drive the 30+ minutes to get a quality Blow Out for a great price! This place is all about quality and customer service and it shows!
5,"My husband found a dog in bad shape late Saturday night, so I needed a vet that was open on Sundays. I found Lone Mountain Animal Hospital through a Yelp search, and they fit me in to their tight Sunday schedule. The entire office worked hard to make my nervous and timid new friend feel safe and at home. Dr. Beckes was gentle and so sweet. Nice clean office, fair pricing and good staff. Thank you!"
5,"My second time being here and I have to say I was beyond impressed with the customer service. From the moment I step in the door they greeted me. Not to mention they guy working there was so patient, friendly and most of all very helpful with the menu. He made the whole experience go so smooth. Ones he brought out our food he ask if we needed any ketchup etc. Which I could easily get up and get it myself. Very nice of him to go that extra step.The food was delicious and no complaints what's so ever. I have to say there was other customers in there as well and he made sure everyone was getting the exact experience. A family of 4 was dining in and he notice forks where needed. As one of the kids where getting up he offer to get them.Overall I have to stay I am beyond impressed with the awesome way they run the restaurant not to mention it was very clean."
5,This place is awesome! Huge slices with great taste. We always have to stop in for a slice when in the South Side.
5,"I didn't have high hopes for the Original Pancake House but I was pleasantly surprised.  The bacon pancakes were spectacular and I loved the thick, crisp slices of bacon.  Be prepared to wait on weekends, however."
5,This place was awesome and has a very cool concept. The food was fresh and delicious. I got a large bowl over fresh greens. The spicy crab is a great choice with the eel sauce mixed in at the end. I can't wait to go back!
5,"This is my regular Starbucks.  These folks are friendly, they always get my order right, and they are fast.  
Even when the drive-thru is 6 or 7 cars deep it only takes about 10 minutes.  
Keep up the good work, ya'll."
5,"Tucked away in a little strip mall, this popular restaurant even has a nice outdoor patio.  The service is outstanding, especially to those that are new to the sushi experience. Highly recommend the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll."
5,Every shooting sport you can find here in the biggest outdoor range I've ever seen. Seemingly larger than the Clark County Shooting Complex here in Vegas. Major companies sponsor tourneys there...Berger Bullets had a hi powered long range shoot while I was there for my nephews college shotgun shoot. I'd go back next time I'm in Phoenix.
5,"The people were really nice and helpful. I loved my food, everything tasted fresh and delicious and the portions are so big! Couldn't even finish it all, I was so full! 

Would definitely recommend this poki place!"
5,I love this place! It's located in a shopping center with horrendous parking but always worth venturing in for falafels. The staff is nice and it's always clean.
5,"I went for a hydro colonic and Marlow is the sweetest! And so smart! I used to frequent Healing Waters years ago (back in 2006/2007) and the upgrades to the facility were nice. Professional staff, knowledgable, and got me to buy a few products which I LOVE and are pretty life changing. I bought the PB-8 probiotics and seriously will not need to visit HW for a few more months. I felt a huge difference after my visit in December, and will be back! Highly recommend, I wish there was an LA location!"
5,Greka Pita was terrific. Very friendly owners. Super Clean. Food was delicious.
5,"Delicious charcoal bbq, amazing atmosphere and their turkish coffee is absolutely amazing."
5,This is a first rate facility and the staff is as well. I'm a member in a similar range in CA. This range is safe for families and has all the amenities required for a professional tacktical marksmen. Thank you for the great experience!
5,The Starbucks here in the morning goes by super quick. Very friendly and fast. Love it when the workers work well together. A+++ :))
5,"I HATE HATE HATE the car buying process, but this was the smoothest experience I've ever had. Michael and Dwayne were AWESOME. Quick, to the point, so educated, everything. No high pressure sales, no dog and pony show. I loved how smooth the operation went - by the time we knew we wanted the CX-5, to out the door keys in hand, it was an hour in a half. Where is that a thing?! Love this place and will definitely be back for my next mazda, whenever that is!"
5,"In town for the weekend, and chose Pino Pizza because of the reviews on yelp. 
Very good and cheesy."
5,I would say it is my best sushi place in the area. It is family friendly environment and people are so nice and welcome! Sushi was fresh and tasty and I eat there at least once a week!
5,"This is the second time I have tried the food here and both times the food has been absolutely delicious. The falafel, salads ,hummus, baba ghanoosh and the chicken shawarma sandwiches were spot on. Love this place,  I will definitely be back."
5,So yummy! We are completely addicted. So glad they move in so close to the house; no need to cook anymore!
5,"I love this place! Went here for the soft opening with my boyfriend and friends and the staff was very friendly and warm! I am a vegan so at first I was worried about how many options I might have but there was so much to choose from! Many sauces add ons and even tofu so I was very excited. I would definitely come back here again. Very affordable, clean aesthetic and top quality. Go and experience this wonderful establishment"
5,"If you want to taste real Turkish food, you should visit Pasha. And I loved the new logo of the restaurant:)"
5,Friendly welcoming staff! Sushi and hibachi was yummy and reasonably priced. Great place for families.
5,"I use to live in Brookline and this place is awesome. They have great pitas as the name suggests and have several other offerings that are pretty good as well. They also have good Hummes which had become a staple in our house. 

They have a pretty good selection of Mediterranean/italian type groceries and they sell Hookahs and Shisha which is cool. 

If you like good pita's and hummes this is the place for you."
5,Best In town. If you're looking for some quality traditional Korean food this is the place. Always fresh and a very clean place. I think they have a parking lot too but I've never been to it.
5,"Yummy !

Everything I ordered at this is extraordinarily delicious.

Large portions, which makes the at first relatively high prices, completely fair ! (You can easily share any dish between two people)

Staff are very nice and attentive !

I recommend that you get the cold appetizers chef's mix ! It's a dish of a sample of all their cold appetizers, and they are all delicious. Beyond delicious.

They have a turkish pizza (forgot what it's called), i also recommend you try that (you can get it as an appetizer and share it with 3-4 people)

Try their traditional Aryana ! It's like Persian dough! 

And finish your meal off with a turkish coffee and a baklava !

Go with family, your date, friends, anyone!  And Enjoyyyy!"
5,"What an amazing place! There decor is so stunning, the service and presentation is top notch. The food is absolutely delicious. We tried some starters, Mantis and the meat platter as well as their signature dessert with Turkish coffee which were all amazing!! Can't wait to come back again. :)"
5,"Love this pizza, had it on a Pittsburgh Bits n Bites Food tour.  Gonna head into town to get a whole pizza today!  Yum yum, it's a crust I can and want to eat ALL of and it's cheese blend is fantastically delicioso!"
5,"Delicious pizza, especially if you like thick crust. All of the pizzas are awesome, even just plain cheese or peperoni. Definitely give it a try if you are in the area!"
5,"I have been coming to Primp And Blow for over two years on a weekly basis. I have never had a bad experience, I would recommend Primp And Blow to my friends and family."
5,"I've been here twice this week and can tell you that both times I really enjoyed what I ordered.  They make their own pitas and you can see it on a conveyor belt, they have fresh groceries and other things that are snacky.  You will see this yourself if you chose to visit this place.  If I'm in the area again, I will definitely come back."
5,"TOTALLY Awesome...L O V E Healing Waters and there staff...Sooo Very helpful and Knowledgeable!!! =)

I have had 10 colonics with them so far...my first ones ever. I feel so much better, and lighter, with more clarity of mind...and a Wonderful experience of knowing I have done something Amazing for my body...to help it function at a much Higher rate, giving me a healthier and longer live...=)

Have started a liver cleanse...and getting the last couple herbs I need for a kidney cleanse too.

Healing Waters has a very clean and peaceful environment too...=)

5,Amazing food! One of the best Turkish restaurants I've been to. Our server was nice and the staff was very friendly. I had the lentil soup for starter and manti for my main course and for desserts I had kunefe with chai to end the night. Everything I ordered was delicious! I truly recommend this place if you're looking to have a taste of an authentic Turkish meal.
5,"Always great pizza, generous toppings and cooked well! The staff and delivery driver seem to always be in a good mood. If you like panzerotti's try the Monster :)"
5,"This is my favorite poki stop around the east valley!     It's on my way home from work and it calls my name often.   It never disappoints!   Heck I'm craving it now just typing this....

Portions are good.   Not skimpy like another chain poki place that shall remain nameless.    

Fish protein is always fresh and yummy!    Love the selection of toppings to add.    


Be back soon!    Yum!"
5,"I eat here multiple times a month.   The food is fantastic and very moderately priced.  People who come here and give it less than 4 or 5 stars, don't know good food when they see it.  I have eaten this type of food from Iraq and Kuwait, to Nebraska to AZ and I go out of my way to stop by and eat here over other places closer.  

DELISH."
5,First time doing a review and just went to this place with my aunt. It was my first time at a Korean restaurant like this since I live in NJ and there aren't many Korean restaurants near me and it was a really good experience and I would definitely come back. I really enjoyed their  and our  waiter was nice and kept checking on us (then again it wasn't that busy) to see if everything was okay and filled our waters. Overall I enjoyed this place and would recommend it to others.
5,"This is hands-down the biggest and best shooting range in AZ if not the United States. 1600 acres of fun for $7 all day long. Their range goes up to 1000 yard ranges, if you're into steel and distance this is your place."
5,"Very very awesome place! I was very happy to see how much my family enjoyed what I've done in the service! A little out the way from me and my parents home, but this is our weekend get together spot! Staff is awesome and even tho the weekend can get crazy, it flows well for being a busy place."
5,"A welcoming experience. The man at the counter greeted my boyfriend and I with a smile. We ordered the gyro special. $6.99 for a gyro, fries and a drink (I had the greek salad.) Everything came exactly how we ordered. I asked for no feta on my plate and the man was considerate to ask if I had any other related food allergies. We ordered to go. When our food came he double checked to make sure there was no feta on my dish. Super sweet of him. The gyro had a clean taste to it.The fries were crispy and a decent size, not those thin classic size we often see. My salad was a good portion, better than most greek salads I've tried. The place was inviting. My boyfriend was thrilled to watch the Suns game on the flat screen that hung from the wall along with the beautiful photos of Greece. We'll defiantly be back."
5,Went for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the outstanding service and lively ambiance. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had and the avocado toast is a must try. My water nor coffee cup ever reached half empty. I highly recommend
5,This is the best all-you-can-eat in Mississauga!  I return here every time when I want to eat all I want.  It's fresh and service is great.  The down side is this place is too small and always packed.  Reserved a table if you have a large party.
5,"So, I recently purchased a new 9mm (Springfield XDM) and felt like getting out to fire some rounds through it.  My brother in law was in town and we decided to head on out here this afternoon to check it out.

We arrived, parked in the lot and then went into the little check in office. We paid our entrance ($7.00 per adult, valid all day!) fee and got some earplugs ($.50 cents).  We told them that it was our first time here, so we were handed a pair of wireless headphones, and proceeded outside to watch a 7 minute safety video.  It gave a brief description of the facility (It's the largest publicly funded shooting facility in the USA!), what to expect, and the rules and layout of the land.  After the video was over, we took our receipt to the range masters station and we were assigned a lane (Lanes 1 & 2, all the way down to the left against the cinder block wall). 

We proceeded down to our lanes, and just as we arrived, they were having a cease fire period.  Every 15 minutes, they have a cease fire.  You unload your weapons, place them on the cement tables, and then step back behind the yellow line.  Once everyone is done with that, someone comes around and checks your weapon to make sure its unloaded.  Once all weapons are deemed ""safe and clear"", you can then go out onto the range and set your targets, check your shots etc.  While this period is happening, you are not allowed to touch anything on the table.  The only thing you can touch/be around during this time (near the cement benches where your weapons are) is the squeegee to clean up your shell casings.  The safety aspect of this range is incredible! 

Their frames are really simple, yet really well thought out.  They are basically billboard style frames with a cardboard back, with two 2x4s for legs.  Out on the range, every 5 yards or so, they have holes in the ground where you put your frame.  You then proceed to tape (Free masking tape provided at each frame station) your targets to the frame.  Once everyone is done taping up their targets and off the range, they then announce when it is time to shoot.  

As far as the shooting........This was only the second time I had shot my guns (I also have a .38 Ruger revolver), and I still need lots of practice.  The 9mm Springfield is really fun to shoot, and it has a 19 round magazine, so you can fire away for a decent period of time without having to reload!

We both had a really great time shooting here today!  They really take safety seriously (that is a damn good thing, IMO!) while not being overbearing and watching you like a hawk.  It makes for a very comfortable shooting experience for both rookies like myself, as well as seasoned gun enthusiasts. I am coming back next week  and will continue to come here over and over whenever I want to fire off some rounds!"
5,"Been here a couple times already and I always get the same things! Can't go wrong with the curry beef brisket roti, laksa noodles or the house special noodles."
5,"What a great place to shoot.  If you make a mistake they will let you know and they should.   If the range officer gets on you just take it.  I think they can be to easy and would kick people out for doing less.  

Great place to come and shoot.  Follow the rules.  Pay attention.  You will have a great time.  Have a hot dog too at Larry's Buns in the Sun.  

I have been coming here for 35 YEARS.  No staff has ever been out of line with me or rude in anyway."
5,"Yummy! I love the baklava, gyro and chicken shawarma. My boyfriend likes their pepperoni roll but I haven't tried it myself."
5,"The food (Gyro Combo Meal) is absolutely fantastic! Next time I visit I will get their Korean BBQ plate. Customer service. Made a positive difference to my experience as well. Original called with a special request, and it was met with a generous kindness and a welcoming smile.

Thank you for walking out to my vehicle and making it possible for me to enjoy your food and service.

I'll be back soon."
5,"Tiffany is Eliza are amazing!!! Super nice, very knowledgeable and professional. Both of them made me feel so comfortable! Would definitely recommend them and this place for colonics!"
5,"Excellent service whenever I have to stop in. Don't need an appointment, but it's best to call ahead. Jennifer is really great and will take good care of you! Waiting room desperately needs a remodel and lags behind Volvo & Saab where I used to go. Come on Chapman, pop for an update!"
5,"I am choosing 5 stars because Yelp designates it ""As good as it gets.""  I have yet to have an actual good experience with a car dealership - so this one was ""As good as it gets.""  I haven't used their service department, but the purchasing process was 10x less abusive than any of the VanTuyl dealerships.  They didn't throw a bunch of extra stuff on in the finance process, and things went much more quickly - at least half the time it took us to get through Showcase Honda the last time we bought a car.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from going to Chapman."
5,"This is the second time I've purchased a car from Chapman Mazda. Bill Lohrmeyer, like all the salesmen I've met there, is consistently courteous and thoughtful regarding what the buyer needs. They take care of their customers here in a manner that all car dealerships could learn from. My two young children came with me today and we were in and out without any unreasonable waiting. From the moment I set foot in Chapman Mazda, I haven't considered going elsewhere. Also, I love these cars. Quality and efficiency all day."
5,"One word for this restaurant - CHEESE! And Lots of it! It's a bit pricy for pizza - many other places in the area (eg. chain stores) will have better deals, but not better taste than Pizza Pino!"
5,"I heard about the great work at Healing Waters for several years before my wife's wonderful experience there convinced me to give colonics a try. She said, ""Even someone as fastidious as you would feel taken care of."" She was right. Everyone and everything seemed geared for my comfort (and modesty). I knew after that first visit that I would be doing colonics for the rest of my life (hopefully, at Healing Waters). I felt so much better, lighter and cleaner, and was amazed (and shocked) at the gunk that I no longer was carrying around inside. I'm so thankful for Healing Waters, for the friendly and helpful staff, and for the access to this process that contributes so much to my long-term well-being, as well as my immediate health and vitality. I with that I had started colonics at Healing Waters when I first heard about it, but better late than never!"
5,"I gave this place 5 stars because it has what I care about:
-amazing food (SO DELICIOUS)
-very reasonable pricing
-fast service

No, the place is not fancy
No, i wouldn't suggest coming here on a first date
No, it's not glamorous
No, they don't offer a 4 page menu

BUT, the food is really delicious and the prices are quite cheap

The pad thai here is some of the best I've ever had; the perfect amount of sauce and it is VERY tasty
We also always get the fried beef with lemon grass; ""Fried"" to them means stir fried not deep fried
This is some of the best beef I've ever had, any where
Very tasty, juicy and great
For under $8, you get a plate of beef and steamed rice and a small side of pickled veggies ... (I think a McDonald's big mac meal costs more than that)
I also really like the beef satay soup; a great mix of noodles, beef, thai herbs and peanuts; nice broth too

My family and I always enjoy it here
And usually have leftovers for the next day
And it usually ends up costs $10-$15 a person

You can't go wrong
(it's in a mall - Richlane Plaza I think it's called)"
5,Absolutely best pizza on the south side hands down!!! Service was fast and the guy making my slices was extra Intentive. I destroyed both slices which was full of flavor and that crust.....the best I ever ate
5,"This place is awesome!  The only downside is that next time I am going to have to remember to not eat for 3 days prior to arrival as the servings are HUGE!  The staff was very friendly, the place is clean and nicely decorated, and the prices are very reasonable considering how much food you get.

They had a special the day we were there of deep fried bananna nut bread; and I now truly believe that anything can be deep fried and made into a delicious eating event.  Lots of tables and space and even the wait when crowded was no more than 30 minutes.

We are looking forward to going back."
5,"Best banh mi ever
The bread is incredible
Cheap and large sandwich"
5,Fist time here. Very nice owner. I had the beef and chicken shawarma platter with rice and salad. $9.99. Very good price. I will be back to the restaurant again.
5,"I am a newbie to shooting and had a blast - literally and figuratively - at Ben Avery. Over the course of 3 days, I shot sporting clays 2x and handguns on the main range 3x. All the personnel and volunteers were very friendly and helpful. Lots of fun!"
5,"Healing Waters colon hydrotherapy is a gem. The staff is very friendly. The facility is spectacularly clean and sanitized. I had a colonic done and I found it very affordable and worth my time, money and energy. It's a loving and healing environment and I truly recommend their packages if your looking to do some serious internal healing. I am grateful that their business is in exsistence."
5,Great view and very cool vibe. Had dinner with another couple and everything was awsome. We shared everything and the food and service were outstanding. The outdoor area is awsome and pool is awsome......great job Charles!
5,"The food and drink were really good and well-priced. For food, we tried the chorizo meatballs, the charred green beans and a short rib skewer. All the food was really good. I could have eaten the green beans all day, they were super addictive. The short rib skewer was super tender and the meat was delicious. We shared a pitcher of a tequila cocktail that was really tasty. The service was excellent.

The view can't be beat...the 44th floor patio is gorgeous and cozy - I love that blankets are available to keep you warm, and there are heaters as well. The variety of seating on the patio is great - beds, chairs and loveseats. Get there just before sunset and you will have the most amazing views.

This spot is perfect for a date, but also great to grab some food and drinks with friends."
5,I've been here twice so far.  I've gotten the regular Gyro and the spicy Gyro.  Both were great and ready really quickly!  The prices are spot-on (unlike another nearby Greek restaurant that charged $8 for hummus!).
5,"Pancakes make me happy. They also make me fat, but that's a problem for another day. 

This place has some damn good pancakes. I had the Georgia pecan pancakes, with a side of turkey sausage. The pancakes were amazing, and I'm pretty sure they make their own syrup. The sausage was almost scrapple-like, with the right amount of spice. 

The short stack is enormous--three big pancakes--I have no idea what the full order would be.

Tip for the out of towner on finding this place--It's up the hill tucked in behind the Denny's (hard to see behind the mounds of snow that were present when I visited)."
5,You cant find better pizza in the southside. The best part is that you only need one slice!
5,This is a great range to come to and shoot off a few rounds.James smith was the instructor and he was great. I highly recommend this place for ccw as well as some good old fashioned fun.
5,"This pre-Christmas breakfast was perfect. Spinach omelette was cooked perfectly sausage gravy crapes were so delicious with hashbrowns. The basic egg and sausage links were cooked to perfection. The waffle was absolutely divine. Crisp on the outside and nice and tender inside. Top with Lingonberries it was Scrumptious. It was our first time there and the atmosphere was so warm and cozy and it was so clean which is very important to me. Very nice get together with family with no clean up after LOL. The only negative appeared to be the basics of serving water, silverware, cream as we had to ask for everything"
5,Food is amazing.. mouth watering even thinking about it. Best afghan food in scarborough.. will definitely recommend it to my friends.
5,"Visited today and had a fabulous experience!!  Had called a few days ago because I was having trouble booking online but manager went out of her way to help & even remembered me today when I had my service!!  Stylist Gabby was so friendly, gave a fantastic shampoo and really listened to what I wanted for my style. My hair was perfect when I left and at end of day, it still looks brand new!  They only use high-end products which I appreciate. I booked two more appointments, that's how much I liked this place!  Everyone friendly, especially manager and receptionists. Salon is super clean. You can't go wrong here! We live in the neighborhood and this is definitely my go-to blowout salon."
5,"Starbucks at 7am is pretty much heaven for every teacher.  This particular Starbucks gets a huge share of the teacher's working in the North Las Vegas area.  I know on several occasions I have run into other teachers from my school and a couple of the neighboring schools.  They handle the morning rush beautifully.  All the workers are nice and work super efficiently.  Also for those cold mornings, they have a drive through, so you don't have to leave your heated car.  It is funny that I ended up here as often as I do considering I don't really drink coffee.  

When I need a pick me up in the morning before class and I'm not still working on lesson plans, I sometimes swing by on my way to work to pick up either a soy hot chocolate or their Awake black tea.  It always hits the spot without getting me jittery (coffee is a bit too much caffeine to me).  It also doesn't hurt that they have sandwiches and boxed lunches for those days I forget/don't have time to make lunch for myself in the morning.  Yea, those are on the expensive side, but they are infinitely better than school lunches.


On top of handling the morning rush like pros, they are also life savers.  One morning I purchased 20 gift cards.  I know that sounds excessive, but some were prizes for students during a huge review game and others were just some extras I like to keep on me for emergency gifts.  Well, in the all of the commotion of morning, after I purchased the gift cards, I walked out and left them on the counter.  The wonderful people working there knew I'd be back so they put it in the safe and when I called 30 minutes later they said not to worry and that I could pick them up any time.  Needless, to say I rushed back and picked them up with just enjoy time before I needed to start teaching.  

Life as a teacher is always a surprise, some good and some bad.  This Starbucks seems to always help put a little good in my day."
5,Amazing place!! This gorgeous little Mediterranean grocery has a bakery and a cafe inside. You can find pretty much anything from all over the Mediterranean and Middle East. I highly recommend this place! The service is outstanding.
5,"Pizza Pino has the best Pizza I've found in Durham Region.  You can tell when you bite into it that it's fresh and hand made.  The crust is delicious and the toppings are generous.  The pizza is quite filling so keep that in mind when ordering as you may normally order an extra large from a chain place, you may only need a large from Pizza Pino.  I ordered the wings recently and they were quite good.  Big, Juicy and Saucy.  I was surprised at the quality of the wings as usually from pizza places they aren't very good.   

Pizza Pino's does take longer to deliver/pickup than chain restaurants but it's well worth it.  Try their walk-in special, it's quite reasonable considering what you get."
5,"Absolutely Amazing!!!!!! Always great service. Fast hot food on my arrival. My husband and I eat here at least once a week since we just moved to the area. The Gyros are amazing!!!! They remind me of my favorite gyro stand in NYC!!! Must try!! You cannot beat the price eaither. I get a regular gyro my husband gets a jumbo gyro meal and it's under $20. And enough food for us, even with a little one growing in my belly!!"
5,"Never disappointed with service, food or variety.  This is the current go-to place for breakfast!"
5,Fresh and delicious.   It's like unwrapping a sushi roll.   All the flavors belong together.  The restaurant is super simple and clean. To go orders seemed popular. Excellent for a quick lunch
5,"La grande pancarte qui vante les sandwichs à moins de 3$ me tentais à chaque fois que je passais devant. Je m'y suis finalement arrêtée! Dès mon entrée j'ai été vraiment surprise de la variété des options et de la présence de sushis. Je ne m'y attendais pas du tout. J'ai pris un bahn mi de base au poulet grillé avec un jus de mangue qui fait rêver à des îles exotiques! Pour le prix et la qualité de la bouffe, je dois dire WOW. Pour ce qui est d'un ""fast-food"" bon, pas cher et différent, le concept  de Vua est rafraîchissant! J'y serai de retour bientôt pour tester le reste de leur menu c'est certain!"
5,"I only go for the all you can eat sushi. AYCE sushi, tends to say ""it's going to be cheap, but you'll get your fill at least"" Prince is by far the best AYCE place. The rice is proper - it has never been warm for me (the worst part of AYCE). The fish is great tasting. And the cooked food is great. They're the only place I know that lets you have medium rare beef - which is excellent. Their beef tataki is excellent as well. 

Prince is just a step up for all AYCE. It's probably better than most non-AYCE sushi places. 

You know, some people will say that ""Chinese run AYCE sushi places that are poor quality"" but Prince shows that is only a stereotype with no substance. In fact, the ambience, decor of Prince is top notch and it has a nice place. The servers, they use to be kind of mean (yet extremely efficient) but they have cooled down for the past 3 years. 

Over all, for the best AYCE experience in the GTA, I think prince is up there."
5,"What a delightful surprise! 
We received an invite to Anatolian's Turkish and after reading the only two previous reviews, I have to admit that I was. . . uncertain. 

So I was relieved to find myself in a very comfy and family-friendly atmosphere.  The servers are very polite and the chef obviously cares about his patrons.

We tried several of the dips/spreads (humus, babaganush, etc.)  and they were all very tasty - made even better with the fresh bread. The biggest hit was the eggplant with tomato sauce. It was so fresh and savoury. 

I also loved the spicy meatballs, kofte. So crispy on the outside while moist and tender inside. And the flavour  was almost indescribable.  I really enjoyed the blend of spices.

The spinach and feta pide was huge! and thank goodness it was also very good. I love pide!

Dessert was Kadayif, a sweet shredded wheat dish that I could eat every day for the rest of my life. And the baklava deserved a moment of silence. It was amazing.

All in all - the real deal. I'd go back again and again....
and for dessert - yet again."
5,"Super amazing nice people.  Very cost effective for low income families.  Honest, very fast service able to take my dog in 2 hours before my appointment.   The vet was so informative and clear with me. Didn't try and up sell me nothing extra. Didn't try to put my dog on pills.  Just a great app around experience.   Will be taking Bravo back for anything he needs.   Patient for life!!  Thanks to the vet and front desk staff who showed me and Bravo Love!!"
5,"Great experience, nice staff, and I felt very comfortable and relaxed.  Everything was really clean too.  I came to get a colonic to prepare for a liver/gallbladder cleanse.  I have done a colema in the past and do the master cleanse about 3x per year and it wasn't bad at all.  Colon health is so important for overall health.  Will definitely be back!"
5,I live in Las Vegas but my best friend lives in Scottsdale and has highly recommended this place for blow outs. I've been here 3 times now and every time such a different experience but one thing I will say is this last time Adrianna was very interested in what I wanted and was very friendly and talkative. I definitely will be back in the future. Thank you
5,"I drove 30 minutes away because my car had the engine light on. Blake Beaman was the Assistant Service Manager. He was nice, approachable and above all very professional. He explained to me what was going on with my car and kept me updated while I continue to wait in the lounge. Overall, I had a good experience with this dealer. I definitely recommend."
5,Healing waters is amazing!  I have been here a few times in the last couple of years and I can't say enough about them.  My first time I was a little frightened and unsure of the process but everyone was very professional and totally put me at ease.  Everything is very clean and sanitary and all in all it has been a great experience every time.  Thanks Healing Waters!
5,"I love this poke restaurant!!! So many options, great bowls, and always awesome service. Best choice for a healthy, fresh, quick meal ."
5,"I have been going to this range when it was Black Canyon shooting range.  Things have changed over time as most things do.  

First of all the RSO are there for a reason.  They are there to make sure people are safe.  Plus that is a full time thing when they have shooter there.  They do not bug you unless you are not being safe.  They are courteous and respectful also.  I have never had one issue with a RSO there going back to 1990.  I am there a few times a week, so have a lot of exposure to the RSO.  I do private instruction and it is good to have other watching new shooters also.  

They used to have blocks on the tables years ago, but a block fell of the table.  Supposedly injured someone and they sued and now no more blocks.  

The range was never busy on the weekends and the never assigned tables or wait numbers.  Now they do because there are so many people that want to shoot.  The have to do this or it would be chaos on the range with people arguing over tables. 

I love this place and never had any issues with any of the RSO.  To all the people saying the RSO were on power trips there was a older man years ago.  When you were standing between the yellow and red line during the cease fire he you say you.  In the green shirt and blue jeans get away from the table.  You follow the rules and you will not be bothered by any means.  To bad the RSO can not kick some people out.  

This is the place if you are looking to shoot and have a good time.  If you want to break rules and not be safe.  Then not like it when a RSO tells you something go somewhere else."
5,First time as they just opened today. The food was great. Friendly staff. Clean restaurant. I will definitely be back.
5,"Extremely friendly staff, the food is great, and you get a lot of food for very little. I eat there once every coupe of weeks. Highly recommended."
5,"We had a large group so had the price fixe which was over $100 pp. 

Vibe/music - What's unique about this place is it doesn't feel like you're in Toronto. Has a west coast/LA kind of vibe. For some, the volume of the music might be too much but I enjoyed the supper club type atmosphere.

The goods - The food was excellent - fresh thoughtful and well prepared. The first course was quite light (salad and civiche) but the main course has many dishes and sides and all were excellent. The steak was the star - well seasoned, juicy and perfect cook. Branzino and the veg skewers with mushroom and shallots were also delicious. Lamb was also excellent. Perfect cook and simple but elegant. Desserts were very good - good amount of variety. 

Service - Our server was attentive and prompt. 

View - If you go at a time where you can catch the sunset on the west side of the restaurant, it makes for a very memorable evening."
5,"My husband works close by and brought me home a California roll, a salmon roll and a spicy salmon handroll (his pic doesn't do it justice).  I wasn't at all surprised that it was so tasty and such high-quality as it's part of the delicious Spoon & Fork chain.  The fish was so fresh, the rice was prepared just right and the handroll was overstuffed with salmon.  He said a lot of his colleagues go there for lunch and just love it.  Apparently the service was friendly and the prices were decent.  We definitely plan to go there for a sit-down dinner and continue to order from their take-out menu - try it as you won't be disappointed!"
5,"No matter your favorite topping or flavor - you can get it on a WAFFLE, PANCAKE or FRENCH TOAST!

My favorites are the original waffle and the pecan pancakes.

I am a tough customer .. so I am specific about my eggs and bacon (crisp please!!!).  I am usually very happy with all of my food.

The toast is the only thing that is not usually hot --- but that is ok.

It's very large and can handle large parties and KIDS!"
5,"Wonderful service, knowledgeable staff. They were able to accommodate me for an earlier appointment time. Every question that I asked they answered. They even provide warm towels as well as tea to settle your stomach afterwards. Bottoms should definitely visit this place and experience it for themselves. They provide amazing service and are worth a visit."
5,Hands down the best breakfast I've had in years. There is a big commitment to quality here. I'll probably be dreaming about the bacon later. Nice thick cut and delicious. I highly recommend you try them out.
5,"Super clean restrooms and great, helpful staff. The location is kind of hard to get into just because it's on a very busy corner. But it is really worth it since it is so clean and the staff has it together."
5,"This is the place I always have cravings for.  My favourite is their House Special Fried Rice followed by their Curry Duo with your choice of rice or roti.  Although the inside does not look appealing but the taste, the portion of the food and the price kept me coming back for more.  During the winter I like to have their pho.  It is good for two."
5,"Yeah this place is awesome! I love going here to shoot sporting clays with my family!

Always have friendly staff that help us get started and I love the course setup and rangers who come around and chat with us while we are shooting.

Highly recommend checking this place out!"
5,"Friends had been raving about this place so much in the last few weeks that I had to try it just to shut them up, and i'm so glad I did! First of all, the slices are HUGE, two paper plates per slice. Benny's has the right amount of toppings, the perfect crust (not too doughy, not too hard) and just the right amount of sweetness in their sauce. Best Pizza in Pittsburgh."
5,"Probably the 2nd best Korean place I've been to in Shittsburgh, behind nak won garden. Very solid and tasty, classic Korean dishes. Their beef is tender and juicy. They give generous portions, though pricy. Korean friends like this place too, so it gets 5 stars."
5,"My best friend who is a nutritionist and a homeopathic advocate has been trying to get me for years to get a colonic and I have refused. Finally, I gave in when I saw the Groupon for Healing Waters.  I was really scared and nervous of the whole process but Annie, was suupppper helpful, knowledgeable and most importantly patient.  As a first timer I was skeptical but she made my experience such a great one!! I've shared the experience with a lot of my close friends and I can't wait to get another treatment."
5,Toronto'da ya?ay?pta buraya gelmeyen Türk var m? bilmiyorum ama Türkiye'yi yemeklerle birlikte gezmek isteyen kesinlikle gelmeli. Te?ekkürler Pasha orijinal lezzetleri tatt?rd???n için...
5,"Truly fresh and delicious a wounderful  healthy lunch The only thing I wish they had was a rice  in seaweed roll that they have at other poki places.
To give you an understanding of what type of places it is well if you like sushi you'll love this place it's kind of like a subway you go down the line and tell them what you want in your rice or salad bowl let it be raw salmon,spicy tuna , octopus etc. Nice clean establishment."
5,WOW... Perfect simple & delicious I went for the Big bowl salmon & tuna & all the add-on u want
5,"My boyfriend took me for our Anniversary to Kost and boy let me tell you they made me feel like a Queen! Not only did they take our coats for us and take them to coat check, they brought us two glasses of champagne on them! It was excellent Champagne. They also gave us an intimate and romantic table that had the BEST view of the CN Tower. 

The decor and atmosphere made it seem like we were somewhere down South like Miami. 

We ordered the cheese to start which was the BEST cheese I have EVER tried. They make it in house and serve it with truffle, agave and grapes. We also got the calamari and for the price and portion it was PERFECT. So fresh and so tasty! For our main, we got the Baja fish tacos which was to die for! Served on a a full fish, I felt like it came straight out of the ocean. 

This is a MUST try if you haven't yet!"
5,"OK you guys, this place is a little out of the way but totally worth it.  The service is great, and the food is to die for.  I mean their sweet carrots alone are worth the trip, and if you're a sushi fan it's a definite must (try the Spider Rolls, scary name but worth the risk).  I recommend the Teriyaki Chicken myself, but everything on the menu is great.  Happy eating my friends!"
5,Absolutely phenomenal I love Pitaland I always have when I was a kid on the way home from school id buy a bag of small pitas for .99 cents and walks down The BLVD eating fresh plain pita. As I got older I started to indulge more into Lebanese and similar kinds of food. Pitaland's hummus is great along with the tabouli and olives and anything else you buy there. The best thing to ever happen to me is the installation of the cafe they added the food is to die for that you can't get just anywhere! Gyros and the Chicken Shawarma are my favorites if you have been to Pitaland you know how great it is and if you haven't been to Pitaland well your cheating yourself and missing out on a huge part of life. Pitaland is excellent all around from products to staff to cleanliness I can't say a bad thing about Pitaland it's a neighborhood staple and hope I never see it leave. So I hope if you haven't gone yet you go now because you will not be disappointed!
5,"I've been a member here for 4 years & LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT! You'll go from ""drab to fab"" in 45 min or less! The girls are all very sweet and welcoming! You'll feel like you're at a spa. Go on and get pampered! If you're not getting your hair blow out regularly you're missing out & these gals make sure your hair lasts for days!!!"
5,"Pitaland is unbelievable. The cafe serves a great Turkish coffee, and the beef shawarma can't be beat. The grocery store has a good selection of produce, dry and frozen goods, and prepared foods (hummus, taboulleh, kibbee, baba ghanoush, etc.) You won't go home hungry!"
5,"Came from EOS fitness next door & saw their 'Grand Opening' banner, naturally I was curious & decided to try this place out. Walked in & was immediately greeted by friendly staff. Ordered regular bowl--half mixed greens & half brown rice with shrimp & scallops as my protein. Took advantage of unlimited toppings & pretty much added most things on lol. Went with their house sauce to top everything off, but be warned that it's a tad bit spicy, not too bad but if you're sensitive to spicy food like me, then you'll definitely notice. Would recommend this place."
5,"My life has changed since stopping in Benny Fierro's randomly on a Saturday night. Benny Fierro's is a chain offering up the ""Virginia Slice,"" which really just means ""ginormous."" One slice of pizza here literally sits on two paper plates. However, it's not just a huge slice; the crispy, paper-thin crust, topped with slightly sweet sauce is just amazing. My favorite part is definitely the crust, which is kind of difficult to describe. It has a very nice balance of crispiness and softness that you've just got to try for yourself to understand what I mean. 

A plain slice will set you back $4 and a pepperoni or one of their specials will be $5, making it an awesome place for a quick and cheap meal. Benny Fierro's is also open late, which is totally perfect during or after a night out in South Side. 

I don't venture down to South Side much anymore, but Benny Fierro's has definitely given me a reason to!"
5,Pino's is the only place my family of 10 can agree on for take out. They get the orders right and everything is hot and fresh. The pile on the toppings and cheese to the point where it seems it is 3 times as much as any other pizza place. You get great value for your money here!
5,"Great pizza. Tons of cheese and fresh toppings. The crust is excellent. They have reasonable liquor prices. The pizza is very filling, after 3 slices you're stuffed."
5,"I can't really say much other than my all-time favourite place to grab some awesome curry... I could eat the chicken curry every bloody day if possible!

Nice, quaint, clean little place in the plaza on the hill by Leslie/16th avenue, everything seems to be freshly made as well. I'd pay just to sit here and smell the air"
5,Was not disappointed. Got a bowl with tuna and octopus. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Will go back.
5,This is the best Afghani restaurant.  The chicken kebab and the kofta are amazing.  The rice and the garlic white sauce and red hot sauce they give you is so delicious.  Everything you ordered from this place is fantastic.  You won't be disappointed at this restaurant.  The location isn't the best but the food makes up for it.
5,Very delicious food with good portions. Their chicken and beef kabobs are worth going back for. There are no waiters though which is a bit odd. Still very good food at a fair price.
5,We have been with Lone Mountain Animal hospital for 7 years. We love the staff!! They have never tried to recommend unnecessary treatments for our dogs just to make money as many other veterinarians often do. Their prices are very affordable and their care is outstanding! We are very satisfied patients!!
5,"Korea Garden is by far the most authentic Korean food in Pittsburgh. Let me explain: First, there are two rooms upstairs which you would never know are there, one for big groups and the other for Kareoke. Second, if you don't speak Korean... well... you might not be able to ask questions during lunch if one of the younger waiters isn't there yet. Third, the food is amazing, as it seems to be a mom and pop affair since I've never been there without seeing one of them. Fourth, like all Korean in the Burgh it isn't cheap, but I have only finished my meal once (full disclosure: I eat super slow and get full... I'm probably saddest about this predicament of mine when I stop by KoGa T.T). Although I have an alcoholics prediliction to Sapporo it can be hard for me to justify the steep price of the beer, and unless you know your Korean or Soju, expect to not have any idea what their wine list contains. Lastly, I come here alone whenever I need to avoid running into people I know and get some great food, and with a few exceptions I'm the only white guy there! Expect more Chinese guests than Koreans, I think this has to do with the immense popularity of Korean food and soap dramas in the PRC, but probably just as much with the large section of the menu entitled ""Korean Style Chinese Food"". Regardless of authenticity I wouldn't recommend this place to everyone but if they have some cash and an itch for more types of dolsot than any other Korean place in the city, then you must drag them here at least once!"
5,This place is fantastic!  I was a little nervous walking in but was quickly put at ease and will definitely return.  Tiffany is awesome!
5,"I stopped in to pick up some pitas which were insanely inexpensive and decided to pick up a few other items while I was there. I bought a small chicken schwarma sandwich  for my wife and a falalfel sandwich for myself. Both sandwiches were delicious and more than exceeded my expectations. The folks behind the counter making the food are very friendly and the fast.

I picked up pistachio baklava which was delicious as well as a container of olives. The pitas they make are amazing. I will definitely be returning and will be a regular customer."
5,"I came here with a bunch of my girlfriends celebrating a birthday. The food was great. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share including: smashed avocado, fried calamari, baja fish tacos (group favourite), green chorizo meatballs (my personal favourite), tuna ceviche and charcoal roasted guajillo shrimp. All of these were super tasty and great for sharing in terms of portions. 

To top it all off - you get an amazing view on the city and the rooftop pool. 

I highly recommend this restaurant. Perfect for girls night (or even date night)!

In the picture, you see the tuna ceviche, calamari and Baja fish tacos."
5,"UPDATE from 2014, 2 MORE cars Purchased from them!
 
Michael Knox was great to work with and this was the second car we purchased from him in less than 6 months! He mentioned a NEW model coming out while we were purchasing my wifes car earlier this year. As soon as I started seeing inventory in the US I called him and had just started getting inventory a this dealership. 
I went in for a test drive and impressed. So I started the process even though I had NOT intended to buy a car just yet. When I finally decided on a Trim Level, it was not on the website in inventory. But Michael found one that was not yet listed on line.  After a little back and forth, with me knowing is was a brand new model and not a lot of negotiation room left, we came to an agreement and I purchased a new car! Over all a good experience, which is saying a lot when you consider some of the tactics that Other dealership use."
5,Amazing experience! And the staff is wonderful! I highly recommend this place and these treatments.
5,"I went to Primp and Blow to get my make-up and hair done for my birthday...they were awesome!  They listened to exactly what I wanted and also gave me some great advice.  Love the rain cosmetics line!
Defiantly will be back!"
5,Trap range absolutely remarkable. I love the 3trails and the fact that you switch them up. Been coming here for many years best in the valley. Handgun \rifle range is great felt safe the whole time rangers very respectful.
5,My daughter's artist at Primp and Blow made her look picture-perfect for her senior portraits. She gave her exactly the look I wanted and the pop she needed for photographs. I would highly recommend Primp and Blow to give you look you want.
5,"Super friendly, happy staff. This really sets the tone for what a Starbucks experience should be like. I am primarily comparing this visit to that of the Bonanza/Eastern location. The Craig/Losee location is busy but the staff try to personalize almost every visit. Keep it up!"
5,"I have been using this vet clinic for about 19 years, Dr. White is the primary vet. They all ROCK!!! they listen and I appreciate them a lot!!"
5,This is one of my favorite lunch spots! The sushi is very good and half price during lunch hours. Shawn is our favorite waiter but all the wait staff us very efficient. It's easy to get in and out in under an hour if you're on the clock. Osaka has been here at this location for many years which is a testament to its good food. There is outdoor seating as well which makes dining especially nice in mild weather.
5,"Great food and service. Best Kunefe ever and Turkish chai after a long time:-).  Worth every penny. Will definitely come back. Awesome decor unlike some other cheap places. I have to say the owner has great taste....still trying to decode the poetry on the wall though...
""Bir ?ehir ol. Mesela ?stanbul gibi. De ki: Bo?az?m kuruyana kadar sevece?im seni""

Well... thanks to our server Damla for translating it for us:-)"
5,They are a very awesome veterinary clinic. We could not afford the high cost of a hospital stay. So helped us with instructions to do ourselves. Saved our puppy from Parvo a few years back. And now our cat is sick and they are caring for him.
5,"Excellent service and great food. We had special for 2 comes with lots of protein, and lastly Turkish coffee and desert. Lovely server"
5,"While Toronto may have a ton of halal options, this is as up scale there is going to be with not only fancy decor, but amazing service and very flavorful food with decent prices. I came here with a group of 18 people. Calling ahead and making reservations was very easy, the owner of the restaurant is very hospitable and the staffers were very sweet and attentive for my large crowd. We started off with ordering a few of the dip samplers, and the owner threw in a few for free on the house. We then ordered one of their specialty beef dishes, along with a few mixed plates of grilled meets. The presentation, meat quality and sides were very tasty and well worth the wait (which wasn't too long). We ended the meal with a birthday cake for my mom. They graciously kept the cake at the back of the kitchen and came out with it when we were ready for the surprise. I highly recommended this restaurant for your next celebration, or if you're in the mood for all around excellent halal experience."
5,"I came here a few weeks ago for a wedding. I was with a big group of ladies, including the bride, to get prepared for her big day. The staff was so helpful and welcoming throughout our visit, and made everyone look their best! Some of the women also got their makeup done and looked flawless. 

I had a specific idea of what I wanted my hair to look like and my hairdresser nailed it! It stayed perfect for the entire wedding, as well as the next day when I wore it that way to work :)

I highly recommend all of the lovely staff at Primp and Blow, and I am so glad I got the chance to go there!"
5,"The most flavorful thick crust pizza in the Toronto area by far!!!!

I usually like thin crust authentic pizzas. Lombardi's in New York is my all time favorite but this place has reshaped my thoughts on thick crust. Each slice is heavily topped and has the perfect amount of flavor and although the amount of toppings are ridiculous, the crust holds up great. I can't stress enough how tasty these things are. Amazing!

If ever in the Ajax area you MUST pick up a pizza here. Take it home and re-heat it, its still amazing even 2 days after. A must try!"
5,"I love this place. I have been coming to this place for 3 yrs. Staffs always so nice n sweet, I highly suggested if anyone ever needs colonic therapy. You outa go here! I took my male friends w me, and they all love it. Men need this done more often due to their high protein diet. I can tell you we feel great afterward, I personally feel like i lost 5 lbs every time I do this."
5,"This place has the most tender veal filet mignon I've ever had. Their chicken and beef kofta is extremely flavourful and moist. Also, this place has the best naan I've had. I could eat it forever. The lineups and organization of the place make no sense to me and it can take a ridiculously long time to get your food during peak hours but the wait is totally worth it for the meat!"
5,"Only good things! I don't know how would you discover this place unless you live in this area but I was near by and hungry and I'm so glad I came here. We had the Pasha's Sautéed (lamb and fries) and the Turkish style meat balls as well as the 6 dips and pistachio style baklava, coffee and tea. Everything was excellent but the Pasha's Sautéed was extra special, just delicious!"
5,Have been going here for several months. I've had several different stylists - all good. Hair looks great for days. Ambience is nice and great customer service.
5,"Pitaland is the best run business in Brookline (with las palmas a close second).  The café is well staffed and the food is delicious.  I love the breakfast flatbreads and falafel for lunch.  In a slew of mismanaged bars with little to no fresh food offerings on the Boulevard, Pitaland is a savior for us locals.  Support them with your business!"
5,"I tried this on a whim on my way home from an interview. My interview didn't go well and I wasn't in the mood for adventure but cooking at home seemed worse so I stopped in. WOW, I was totally surprised and really happy I came. Food was a bit on the skimpy side but tasted spectacular. I've eaten Hawaiian food of many types and many sub cultures of it as well. The Poki at this place rocked. I had the regular size with 1/2 rice 1/2 salad and scallops. Tried their house dressing and added a few other favorites and WOW did it all taste great. I was wishing I had gotten a Large instead of Regular size. I'll definitely be back to this place. Nice find for close to Chandler Heights area."
5,"An excellent place to have excellent turkish food.
Great costumer service. The food tastes very similar to the food I had in Turkey."
5,"Great shooting facility. Friendly on entry and you can tell these guys have a passion for the sport, they were eager to get me and my first-timer friend out to the sporting clays course. 

Paid $35 for 50 clays, ammunition and gun. I could handle 150 clays on the course before I would get bored. Plenty of cool rapport pairs and layouts. Bernie, one of the staff, was really helpful in giving us tips on how to deal with the rabbit station. I look forward to coming back here while in the area."
5,This was my first time shooting at this range. I went there on a Saturday around 8:00 am and had to wait about 5 minutes to get on range since it was full. For my first time being there I really enjoyed my experience. They do have a cease fire every 15 minutes like others mentioned and I didn't really mind that at all. At that point they give you a chance to go down range and look at your target/change your target distance as well. I had no problems with the range masters as others have mentioned they were actually pretty nice. I recommend this place and this will be my to go shooting range from now on.
5,Ashley Lynn was my stylist for the first visit to P&B - She listened to what I expected and set about her work to give me exactly what I asked for. I felt great leaving and will be back - Regularly!! Thank You!! Dr. Martin
5,"I'm not a fan of thick crust pizza...but I make an exception when it comes to Pizza Pino. 
The best pizza ever! Tons of cheese and toppings. I'm just drooling thinking about the ""Pino's Special"" right now!!!!"
5,"By far one of the safest placed to shoot in AZ. Very helpful staff, one of the best things about this range is the safety officers. You do not have to put up with loud, unsafe, idiots out there. Range officers keep everything under control and safe. If you have any problem with your gun they can help you, new to shooting just let them know and they will be there for you."
5,"I was so thankful the staff made me feel comfortable immediately. They were amazing, and gave me great advice as well as explaining the whole process. When you first walk in you will notice it feels more like a home than it does an office. I had a great experience and will be returning as a customer and recommending friends."
5,Delicious deep dish pizza! We order a small (or Medium if extra hungry) Pino's Special for two of us and ask for it to be well-cooked.
5,"You can't get a better shooting range than this place. Beautiful desert hills, spacious shooting areas, and a cheap range fee. The employees are always incredibly nice and willing to help you. One even helped to fix the tripod on our rifle so that we didn't have to leave early for the day. I can't recommend this place enough :)"
5,"Love this place!!! Especially after a drunk night on the town this is a go to spot. Pizza slice big enough for two people, reasonable prices, room to sit and eat, chilled atmosphere, cool employees, public restrooms, etc. I love this place"
5,"Gabi did an awesome job with my blowdry. She washed my hair 2 times, which I love! My hair has stayed for more than 24 hours! I can't be more pleased!"
5,"This place has delicious thick curry with huge chunks of beef brisket, unlike other restaurants that serve you water down curry and tiny morsel of beef. The roti is huge and is definitely enough to fill you up. Crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. The ice coffee is nice and strong and the ice didn't water down the flavour. Will be coming back again when I'm craving Malaysian curry."
5,"I've tried all Anatolian cousins in GTA and I can say that your business is the best in the area. Prices are bit higher than average but It definitely worths if I compare service quality. Delicious foods, beautiful interior decoration, good humored personal. And waiters were talking English even if they have Turkish background, this is quite professional. I recommend this restaurant."
5,"I went last week for my first colonic ever at Healing Waters. I have considered this therapy for several years but was a little intimidated and nervous. My therapist Tiffany, was incredible. She thoroughly explained everything before we got started. I had a little discomfort in the beginning, but she helped by massaging my abdomen until it was comfortable again. She gave me very helpful information and tips on diet and supplements to help keep things normal. I have felt so much better over the last week, and am returning tomorrow for my second cleanse. I would  definitely recommend Healing Waters to anyone who is considering colon cleansing!"
5,"If you are ever in Brookline this is the place to go.  

Good place to grab a sandwich and fries.  Everything is very fresh!  

Spinach pies are to die for.  The pepperoni rolls are amazing and the price is rite.  

The staff is pleasant and helpful."
5,"Chapman Mazda always provides exceptional customer service. They have always gone above and beyond to make sure that I am 100% satisfied with their service. Thank you Josh, Pete and Ivan for all you do!"
5,The biggest slices of pizza in Pittsburgh! Great little shop you can eat in or take out.
5,"This is my favourite sushi restaurant in the GTA. This is where I tried sushi for the first time and I've loved it ever since. I don't get out to this restaurant as often as I would like but if I'm in the area, it's on the list of places to go for sure. I especially like the Philadelphia roll, the spicy California roll, the dynamite roll and the sushi pizza. Their beef tataki is amazing. I also really enjoy their green tea ice cream to finish off my meal."
5,"Seriously so good! My boyfriend and I drove out here from Peoria, and it was so worth it! The fish and produce are so fresh and yummy. I got three proteins in my bowl, salmon, ahi, and yellowtail, along with a ton of sides! They have gluten free soy sauce, which is a huge plus, and the spicy mayo is delicious. The owners are incredibly friendly and the management and staff were really helpful. We got back on our side of town and were already craving it again!"
5,"Me and my family had first gone to another restaurant but we went a little too close to closing time. The staff there was extremely rude and gave us a lot of attitude. Much to our benefit, we ended up coming to this place instead. The restaurant was very busy and as soon as we went to order, the man at the counter informed us that they had run out of bread but in return, they would give us free drinks with each of our meals. I ordered a pistachio milkshake thinking that would also be free but actually the soft drinks were free. However, they still gave us a $3.00 discount on the milkshake! Which was very tasty by the way. The food was very flavourful and delicious. I especially loved the yogurt sauce that came with our plates. The decor in the restaurant was also beautiful. Furthermore, after such a bad experience being yelled at at another restaurant for going in too close to closing time, it was refreshing to see all the (young) staff here were so friendly and polite. It's definitely a place I recommend and a place that I would go again. Wonderful customer service."
5,We've been going here since it opened. We get take out as well as sitting down. Best Japanese food for the price in my opinion. We love this place.
5,"The Adventure starts as soon as you walk through the doors. Walk past the faux fireplace to the bar, and as you wait to be seated, the heady smell of incense and the melodic Turkish music will entertain you. You will be greeted by the lovely hostess who will seat you in one of their lavish booths and offer you some Turkish tea to chase the chills away, then comes the complimentary olives and bread to stave off your hunger pangs.

MY 2 FRIENDS AND I ORDERED:
- Lentil soup needed a squeeze of lemon and hot sauce.
- Walnut salad is a good side salad, very fresh and light.
- Chicken skewer - 2 skewers of chicken breast meat, served with salads and a side of your choice: tender, juicy and delicious.
- Lamb skewer - 2 skewers of lamb meat, served with salads and a side of your choice: tender, juicy and delicious.

The hostess served as our waitress as well: excellent service. 

As you leave, grab a few cloves to freshen you breath and splash on some eau de cologne (samples available at the front) to elevate your mood even more. Such a beautiful place to relax and get away from the daily grind."
5,"This place is AMAZING!!!  The meats are so tender, the veggies fresh, and the dolmas and falafel were incredible...a must try!!!!!"
5,Smashing... Amazing pizza that fills the belly!! HUUUUUUGE slices!! Love the guy behind the counter he's great. Much love to Benny's!
5,"Simple pizza, nothing too fancy. But the slices are HUGE! A friend recommended that we get a slice to share, but that sounded weird to me so we got our own slices, and MY WORD, was I wrong. One slice is equivalent to 3 normal slices. They make whole pizzas that's can't fit through the door. A slice of cheese pizza is only $4 & is VERY filling. I'm sure I'll be back at some point if I'm in Southside."
5,"Poke in Gilbert!! Love the options they have here. Fresh fish, and fresh ingredients. 

I got the regular bowl (2 proteins: salmon & octopus) with a half and half base (white rice & mixed greens). For sauces I went house sauce and got almost all the sides available cause why not! Food looked as good as it tastes. 

I'd definitely recommend you check this place out! I'll be back for sure!"
5,"Great Sushi! Freshly made! It was delivered super fast and is also perfectly affordable. I recommend the specials menu, it offers almost 40 choices all half price from $1.9 to $4 per roll.  Sushi rolls plus the yummy sauce made a super fresh tasting and blessed lunch for me.  I will come back again"
5,Love this place great energy and people always very accommodating and private definitely am a returning customer
5,"One of the best gyros, and all things Mediterranean, Lebanese,etc. Love their pickled salads, fatoush and the like."
5,"I have taken my dog and cat here. I feel the prices are reasonable.  In the past (years ago) I got my dog a rabies shot, to me it was super affordable and I was in the lobby with Penn's (from Penn and Teller) family.  Celebrities trust their pets to come here.  Today, I put my cat of 18 years to sleep.  Everyone was compassionate. I can't say it was a great experience because of the circumstances, I lost my best little buddy, but it was the BEST experience I could hope for.  It was quick and painless for my elderly feline.  They gave him a sedative and I feel good about how he was treated.  Dr. Parker performed the euthanasia and went over all the details and procedure and even hugged me afterward. No one likes to pay to bring in a beloved pet only to leave without one but I think the price was fair.  This was the first pet I ever had to make that decision for and in the future because of how excellently I was treated and my cat was treated I will only use this vet."
5,"Everything tasted so good and the customer service was fantastic.  So far my favorite item is the chicken shawarma.  Dessert is my favorite, so a must have is baklava.  It was so good I got seconds."
5,"Hands down best poki place around! It's super convenient, quick and it's a decent amount of food for the price. Always fresh, always friendly. Thanks everybody"
5,"Un petit take-out tout près de la sortie Saint-Denis de Berri-Uqam ! C'est vietnamien, c'est rapide et c'est trop bon, vraiment ! Leurs petits sushis à l'unité me font tripper et je raffole du sandwich poulet Shish-taouk avec extra avocat :) C'est vraiment pas cher, les employés sont vraiment sympas et c'est rapide !"
5,"Amazing view and even better food! Service was great as well! The calamari was incredible, the roast chicken even more mouth watering! Can't go wrong with a place like this no matter the occasion."
5,Came here for lunch yesterday and it was absolutely delicious. The prices were reasonable and the tuna and salmon were very fresh. Their house sauce was excellent and the portion size was just right - left very satisfied. Bonus points for the friendly staff! Will definitely be coming back if I'm in the area again.
5,When I first went to this hospital it was so that my aunts dog could get her rabies vaccine and they treated her so wonderful that when I got my girl I took her here to get checked up. My girl was so terrified but they where so gentle with her that I was so happy. I now only go to this Animal Hospital for my babies. Love the staff and the doctors. Great service all around.
5,"We have a chicken that had a very bad infection in her foot.  We had taken her to another vet in town, but it was obvious that they didn't know how to treat a chicken.  I googled poultry vets and this clinic came up.  Can't tell you how happy we are with the level of care.  Every person here genuinely cares about your pet.   Regardless of breed. Unfortunately our chicken had to have a toe amputated.  They have called everyday to check on her since we brought her home.  They will be our poultry vet for as long as we have our hens."
5,"Went to Kost last night and it was a great time!

Our servers name was Ethan. He was young, friendly, bubbly and very knowledgeable with the menu. 

Menu wasn't big so I was able to go through it quickly. 

We started off with the sea bream ceviche. The seabream ceviche was unique and served raw. I enjoyed it but for those who don't like raw fish, don't order!

The lamb and spaghetti was also really good. 
I ended up getting old fashioned and they can make it the in house style or regular. I was told that the in house version is sweeter. 

Overall, great experience. Will be back!"
5,I went to Primp & Blow today after making an appointment online.  It was a simple and very easy process!  The location is slightly hidden but it is right by the Good Egg and Starbucks.  I was greeted by the manager there (forgot her name! oops)  She was so sweet.  I was immediately offered some water or a soda.  She was the only one in at the time because it was such a slow morning so she did my hair and makeup.  The scalp massage that she gave me was so relaxing and I loved the way that she did my hair.  The salon is so cute.  I love the colors and all of the decorations.   I also got some fun feather extensions put in.  The eye make up that she put on me was pretty.  I am not used to putting any make up on so it was at first overwhelming seeing myself with some but she made it so I felt comfortable with the overlook by asking me to let her know if it is too much or too little.   I thought this was a great experience and I will definitely be back the next time I want to get pampered :)
5,"First I would like to give a big thank you to all the staff for saving the life of my fur baby. About a month ago I took my dogs out in the morning and my neighbor behind me had two large dogs that jumped my wall and attacked him. We instantly took him to Lone Mountain Animal Hospital and they were right on top of everything, he ended up losing a leg and 3 surgeries but now he is doing great and adapting very well. I couldn't thank you all enough for everything you did so quickly to save him"
5,"Great experience. Had a check engine light on which I suspected was a fuel injector from prior experience. Called in the afternoon and spoke with Sally. Asked for a loaner car for next day when I dropped off my CX7. Sally said no problem and had it ready for me next day. When I arrived, I asked for a promotional oil change in addition to whatever they found with the check engine light. Sally said no problem. The check engine light was not a fuel injector, but an equally serious necessary repair. Sally also advised me of some other recommended repairs, but did not pressure me. I also asked about a noise I thought might be related to the check engine problem (which turned out to be a faulty EGR valve) and Sally found a loose piece of my rear fender beneath the car. That was fixed for free. All in all, great experience!"
5,"I love healing waters! I've been going for years. They have such knowledgeable attendants. They offer activated charcoal, a paricleanse (parisite cleanse), and amazing greens as an add to your colonic even!!  I've been to many but never a place w such insight and add ons! All at no charge!!! They ask u which ud like and explain anything you need. I always make sure to tip of course after. But even wo any of the extras, after your first colonic you feel amazing!!! They offer aroma therapy as well during your colic which helps if u ever get an upset tummy during. All of the attendants are amazing but CARMEN has been my favorite. Always happy, sweet and attentive w a warm spirit. You'll feel so much better after coming here.  Make sure you ask for Carmen and you won't be disappointed at all!"
5,"We came here on our anniversary looking for American style sushi rolls and we were not disappointed. After a year of nigiri in Japan, a girl just needs some kind of ludicrous fried and eel sauce laden roll, you know? :)

We ordered a spider roll, a tempura shrimp roll topped with eel and avocado, a fried roll wrapped in another roll, and a spicy tuna roll, and I tried to get a salmon skin roll but they were out. They were huge! The fried components were nice and crunchy, and there was a nice mound of undyed pickled ginger on our dish, which is always a plus.

The green tea they serve was the nice toasty tasting kind with the rice.

While we were waiting they brought out two free apps for us, a heart shaped rice patty topped with something (I didn't catch what he said, but it was good), and a flaming plate (!) with a scallop shell filled with cheesy crab and seafood. Amazing, and they didn't even know it was our anniversary, although my SO accused me of telling them when he got back from washing his hands and the dishes were on the table."
5,"Sushi is really amazing here, lots of people don't know what to order so they don't give it a second chance. I always get specific rolls and am never disappointed! Caterpillar is my favorite, and multiple of the fried sushi, service is always nice, polite and quick."
5,This is the place to go for Gyros.  The meat is nicely seasoned and the Pita has just the right taste and texture.  I've had the taboulah salad and hummus and they are both excellent as well!
5,I had an amazing experience at Chapman Mazda. Bill was very attentive and did everything he could to make my girlfriend and I happy customers. Thank you for the business Bill!
5,Cheap. Fast. Delicious. The banh mi was awesome. Carrots and radishes were pickled ever so tart. The bread was toasted to perfection. They also had sushi and other goodies if sandwiches aren't your thing. My only complaint is that the tapioca pudding (che) wasn't of the consistency that it's suppose to be. It was very thick and kind of fell apart. It's suppose to be smooth and creamy but the fault in dessert won't keep me from coming back for their awesome sandwiches.
5,I called in to see if they could offer me anything for my current car and ended up buying a brand new Mazda 3! Great people I've bought 3 cars from them. Also thanks to Bill for taking care of me.
5,"This is the best colonics place in town! The people working there make you feel comfortable, especially if it's your first time, which means you probably will feel a little awkward. After your first colonic, you will feel so much better, I guarantee you'll be back! You should buy a pkg. of three, it's cost effective, & they should be done close together. I did The Master Cleanse and started with a colonic, did another one on day 4, & finished with one on day 10. Liza is the only therapist I've had there. She's really nice and she can massage your abdomen, or leave you alone if you prefer. They use a probiotic during your cleanse and sometimrs some other stuff depending on what you need. They also give you a green drink or an electrolyte drink when you're finished. They've redecorated and given the place a much needed face lift. Now it's really classy. Most importantly, the place is CLEAN! Have an Ionic Foot Bath Cleanse too, after your colonic....you'll get a lot of toxins out of your system, and you will feel great afterwards!"
5,"This place has an awesome menu and does not slow down you orders as some of the other places will bring stuff slower after your first order.

The place is located in the Courtney park plaza near cineplex and demetres. 

What can I say we ordered every kind of sashimi and dragons available and food was coming to our table as if it was a fast food joint :) I loved the fast service. The fish smelled and tasted fresh. The staff was great, friendly and fast!

Make sure you do reservation as the place aint that big and does get quite packed"
5,"Best Korean food I've found in Pittsburgh. I'm a huge fan of soondubu, and everywhere else has left me disappointed. Plus, when I ask for ""extra spicy"", it has a good kick to it!

Sure, it's not the best Korean food I've ever had. But it's better than anything in Pittsburgh, and reasonably priced too!

Oh, and they apparently have 2 Karaoke rooms upstairs. Never been, but it's entertaining to hear people sing during your meal."
5,"This place is special to me. Almost like sacred ground. The range safety officers are super nice, courteous, very knowledgeable. They don't yell at you, they encourage education instead. Other ranges will provide the opposite experience. Ben Avery is making shooting great again. Plus I can't shoot indoor, I get headaches."
5,"Coming from New York, Healing Waters is exactly what I needed. I'm 26, work full time, and with the hustle and bustle of the city, I was long overdue for a detox. 

At healing waters, you can do a clonic, foot soak and/or hyperbaric chamber. I first soaked my feet in the foot bath and was amazed by all the toxins freely flowing out of my body. 

I then did the clonic... Having never done anything like this before, it was genuinely shocking. It's not exactly comfortable to stick a tube up your butt and defecate on a table, but with all that New York pizza, it's exactly what I needed! Not only did it clear the excess out of my body, it got rid of my bloating and years of stomach tension and anxiety. 

The hyperbaric chamber was unique. Once you get over the part where it feels like you're being zipped into a body bag, it's delightful. It smells like lavender and the extra dose of oxygen could only be good for you. By the end of my healing waters experience, I felt so good that I came back the next day and did it again. 

Final thought: I've always associated Vegas as a city of intoxication. Now knowing that a place like Healing Waters exists within 10 minutes of the strip completely changes that notion! If you're coming to Vegas for spring break, EDC or vacation, you MUST  treat yourself to healing waters."
5,"Prince sushi is my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant in Mississauga.  The food here is very tasty and also nicely plated unlike many other AYCE sushi places.  Although very fresh, their sashimi options aren't as impressive as other places, but still have good choices.  

My favourite items are the spider roll, green dragon roll and the beef teriyaki.  The beef teriyaki is unlike any other AYCE, which usually serve you an overcooked piece of cheap meat.  But not at Prince Sushi!  I get mine medium rare and it's mouthwatering!

The restaurant is quite small and usually packed, so I would recommend making reservations.  Definitely worth a visit!"
5,"Came here with my girlfriend this morning.  When the order arrived, they forgot my girlfriend's tea, but it was no big deal because they made it right away when I mentioned the issue."
5,"I am so happy I found this place.  Its clean and calming, everyone is so nice.  I've had 4 colonic sessions with Marlow so far, she's very professional and makes me feel comfortable.  I highly recommend Healing Waters and Marlow.  I will be a returning client indefinitely."
5,"I had no idea this place existed.  I was recently in need of some tahini and in the past I knew that there was just about one place to get it in the city.  Now, I know differently.  

This place is constantly busy, the employees are swarming about like worker bees.  They never seem to slow down for one second.  While I was browsing the shelves for what I needed I could tell the employees were watching me to see if I found what I needed.  Like a sixth sense and employee smoothly asked and pointed me in the right direction.

If it wasn't for that, the smells would keep me coming back over and over again.  It was a garlic heavy smell.  One that makes you feel warm and think about all the delicious food you have eaten in the past with the help of garlic.  

There is a small seating area if you want to eat what you have bought, and it looks as though they have outdoor seating for the warmer months."
5,They've been very helpful with our mini pig.  Dr. Parker is great with her and the staff are friendly.  Easy to make an appointment and they explain everything clearly.  Will continue to take our piggy here :)
5,"Excellent Turkish food everything is good here I specially want to thank the menager Mr.Arda
Keep up the good work guys .
Bizlere gostermis oldugunuz ozel ilgiden dolayi sizlere cok tesekkur ederiz.Yemekleriniz hakikaten
Leziz servisiniz mukemmel .Ozellikle Arda beye tesekkur ederiz"
5,Dwayne was amazing! He was very straightforward and a genuinely nice guy. The process was very quick and easy. We will definitely go back for our next car!
5,Love the philly style gyro! The owners are super friendly. We want to try other items but the gyros are so perfect we get them every time. Want to try the ramen.
5,"Best pizza I've eaten.  Thick,  generous amounts of toppings and cheese.  A tad expensive but definitely worth the price"
5,"Ordered from here for the first time after reading the reviews and I must say they hold up well. Some people complained about time service,  but I don't have a single complaint I ordered my pizza and within 1hr it was delivered. Which brings me to another service I'm happy with, I live in Whitby and very surprised they deliver this far and especially with the 1hr ordering and at my door and time frame. 

As far as the food goes. I loved the pizza and the pino sticks were not bad nothing super special. I find the pino sticks had too much garlic on the top. Now the pizza was amazing, it wasn't as thick as other pictures posted but maybe that is because I got the garlic based pizza. I had pizza once at chucky cheese and liked how it had a garlic base so when I seen these guys offered it I had to try it out. Definitely awesome and adds more flavor to the pizza while not being over powering the toppings. I just had a 2 cheese and pepporoni and I could still them both. So A+ on the pizza!!!

Now it was $30 for a medium pizza and sticks so not too bad and well worth the extra little cost. I will definitely order from them again. I like trying all these one off pizza places they always seem to be better then the big name stores. 

I'd definitely recommend this place. I give it 4.5/5 but the application will not let me so 5 it is. Just due to the pino stick."
5,"I've been coming here for years with different animals. I used to take my family's dogs here and they were always nice to them. When I moved out, I couldn't take my dogs with me. Remembering how wonderful they always were, I started taking my cat here. She has a lot of issues but they were always so helpful. She had to get some of her teeth removed and while that cost a pretty penny, their prices were very reasonable. I've never had an issue with any of the staff here and all the doctors are absolutely amazing.
Something I loved about this place is that they occasionally has cats up for adoption. We found a fun addition to our household there. His name is Hobbes. He was free to a good home, but we did have to pay like $54 for some basic stuff before we brought him home. We're so happy to have him with us. 
Btw they take Care Credit here!"
5,"Healing Waters will heal you from inside and it will reflect on your outside, clean skin after all those colonics, nice easy sessions, I recommend a package, I did the 12 colonics package, it's good to get lean as well, but you gotta be consistent.  Tiffany is excellent, she will make you feel super comfortable, I like to get my colonics with her, she is cool."
5,"We went there for my birthday dinner and the food and service was amazing. However, my girlfriend was injured by a sharp bone found in the sea bream as she completely did not expect it (the sea bream was like Sashimi so there should not be any bones). They gave us a free side dish to complement our steak, a very nice dessert (I think this is for the birthday) and took the sea bream off our bill. Very professional way to handle this matter and we can't be any happier. Only unfortunate thing was that the night was too windy so we were not able to go out and take pictures of the night view with the restaurant's pool and CN tower. Overall a great birthday and dining experience!"
5,"Just purchased a cx5 from this dealership. I would highly recommend working with Rob Riley or Nick Nicholson if you're in the market for a new vehicle. They were both very informative without being pushy or aggressive in their sales approach. They worked hard to get me a deal I was very satisfied with. After purchasing the car, they took a lot of time to go over all of the electronics to make sure I understood how to use everything in my new vehicle. Overall  I had a great experience here!"
5,I always get the strawberry pancakes because they are excellent. I love their food and it's one of the only places i actually enjoy their eggs. I will continue to come back. Customer service is good too.
5,"AMAZINGGGGGG experience!!!!! (THIS REVIEW IS LONG OVERDUE!!) I came here for my cheat meal after a competition about 2 weeks ago and ordered the large stack of buttermilk pancakes (6 in an order--very large and filling and yes I ate the entire thing) and asked for nutella and bananas on top with whipped on the side. IT WAS FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!!! I also ordered a side of their amazing thick cut bacon and an omlette. YES us bikini competitors can eat! I cannot find a picture of my meal on my phone and that makes me so sad because it was SO yummy and aesthetic looking. I posted it to my snapchat though :-) . The server/manager that took care of me was 10 out of 10 amazing. I can't remember her name but she was only a teenager and very smart and attentive. The floor manager was wonderful as well. Great coffee. AMAZING pancakes and everything was too perfect. Thank you so much. The next time i'm in Pittsburgh I will be back. DELICIOUS! Seriously, go here for breakfast if you want to be extremely satisfied and leave very happy! :-) Thank you."
5,"Simply elegant for a pancake house. The place sits atop a hill and is decorated and maintained beautifully. We love the original pancake house and it is unfortunate there isn't one closer than 2 hours from our home. While we were in Pittsburgh we were lucky enough to find this place close to where we stayed. The food, coffee and decor are great!  The freshly squeezed OJ is fantastic, from what I was able to enjoy.  My one year old Isabella decided she liked it too and frank most of it. :-) This place will not disappoint. This gem in Pittsburgh is simply great! It's a must!  Enjoy!!"
5,"Everyone who knows me will tell you I love a good spa experience.  Having My first ever colonic at Healing Waters was for sure an amazing, relaxing experience.I will definitely be returning in the near future. Everyone there was so kind and Sue did a great job of helping me to have a positive first colonic. Thanks healing waters!!"
5,Great service and good food. Found this place by using Yelp app and reviews. Ordered the combo plate hibachi and they gave us tons of food. Now we have dinner for tomorrow night! Definitely will come back.
5,"I have had nothing but good experiences at this location. It is by far the best deal in town seven dollars per day which you just can't beat. The range captains have help me countless times and have offered solid advice to critique my form and also give me suggestions of how to customize my firearms. In my opinion it is the best outdoor range in Arizona. 
Your loyal customer

Gary Van Derveer"
5,A La Turka! Delicious and plentiful! Kufete with Turkish coffee for desert is a must!
5,"I'm not really a big fan of raw seafood, but this place definitely changed my mind about it. Everything was more than enough for the portion. And it was delish! Definitely a must go!"
5,"I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or brunch! The food is wonderful and they have a large variety of pancakes to choose from (blueberry is my favorite) and they have many other great breakfast items including omelets that are HUGE & delicious. They have sandwiches and lunch items as well. The prices are fair and the food is fresh. One negative is parking, which is very limited, but I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great meal."
5,"The service is excellent and Lauren does an awesome job creating my long curls!  MK and all the ladies are so thoughtful and considerate, I am so thankful I found them!"
5,Absolutely love this place. Rooftop patio located on the 44th floor of the Bisha Hotel. This is a place to check out. I would recommend going here during the evening or early afternoon. We ordered drinks and apps (probably every app on their menu) and everything was good. More than anything check out this place for the ambiance. Definitely a go to place for summer. I'll be going  back for sure!
5,"I never been to your place but Every Tuesday after 3pm your table is set up w delicious goodies. Id like to order things the lady said call you in am on tuesday and I can get them at farmers market. I haven't had any of these since my Sitoo died. She made best stuffed grape leaves she grew in her garden& Fatoosh! I woll call next Tuesday am and hope I can get foods Sitoo made,"
5,Huge slices. Fresh. Delicious. Nicely salty and great flavors. Biggest pizza box I've ever seen.
5,Bill Lohmeyer makes the dreaded car buying experience an enjoyable search for a needed vehicle. Arrived uncertain about finding anything would like then left with a new car that I love!  Thank you Bill!
5,Amazing crispy thin crust (that I can't get enough of) topped with a great sauce and just the right amount of cheese. Love the garlic mushroom and the plain cheese. Slices are huuuuge!
5,Amazing pizza with lots of toppings and cheese! I highly recommend this place to every pizza enthusiast in the GTA.
5,"Delicious homemade food every time! The Greek House Salad is so fresh and tasty, dressing is perfection. Great Gyros too!
I come here whenever I come to this part of town to shop."
5,"The ""banh mi"" and Milk coffee are perfect together. And in the summer, they even have  Vietnamese-styled ""Banana ice-cream"". If you are Vietnamese, you'll know what I'm taking about"
5,"This is my favourite vietnamese restaurant of all time! I've been to A LOT of vietnamese restaurants across the GTA and this is the only one that has stayed consistent and there's nothing here that I've tried that I wasn't good. Everyone that I've brought here LOVE their curry roti beef brisket. They give you a large portion of roti, the beef brisket is super tender and the curry flavour/texture is PERFECT. Their special beef noodle is always good too. They give you lots of soup and the flavour is always on point. Although its fairly far for me now that I've moved, my husband and I always think its worth the drive when we're craving vietnamese food. That's how good it is!!"
5,"The largest, (yes the LARGEST) public operated shooting facility in the US.(Take that Texas! Nothing like healthy competition)  Its world class facility with 67 point main covered range, and specialty ranges, 5 field archery ranges, an International Archery Federation range, site campgrounda and a Clay Target Center (trap and skeet anyone?) Now we have moved past the awesomeness of all that, lets keep going.. 

But wait, did I say Archery. All you hunger games tweens and parents of tweens and adults who read that tweeny book, this is your mecca ! No really. It is. Check it out, or well, your kids may just drag you here. 

The RSO's are extremely helpful, and very courteous but then i followed the rules:) I've heard they do chew you out if you dont listen - for your own good. Its your life and the life of others you put on the line by being stupid. Having said that if you pay little attention which my ADD addled head can even do you would have seen that on the 7 minute presentation you saw the first time you came here. 

Still not convinced, if nothing else, by forking over 7$, to the AZ Fish and Game Dept. you help conserve the environment for tomorrow. So dont feel bad, put your eco karma to ease by simply lockin and loadin and hittin that target ! Or well, if you are like me , the desert sand in the backdrop."
5,"After getting my dolmas from Natural grocers and often times experiencing them with hard rice, I was craving them and found this location close to work. I don't know if they make them in the restaurant itself, but they still taste fresh. The yogurt sauce is thick and flavorful. Instead of servicing with lemons you get tomatoes and cucumbers and they tasted very refreshing.
I will return for the gyro!"
5,"Love love love this place and all the staff! They treat your pets like their own! My dog has been happily boarded there many times! Prices are great and medical services are affordable! We had a family emergency and had to fly out last minute during the winter holiday, even though they were busy and taking in other patients they got my dog checked and boarded quickly and put our family 1st! Forever grateful!"
5,"They have everything you need. Lots of space. Place to put all your guns, ammo, etc. Range masters are attentive and friendly. Absolutely cannot beat the price. Spent 3 hours here with family and it was fantastic.
There was a 30 min wait to get a bay, but totally worth it."
5,The food was so good. Huge portions which I need two days to finish. The rice was yum! And I'm not even a huge rice fan. Its casual dining with modern ambiance. Price was reasonable as well. Will definitely be back.
5,Toronto'da ya?ay?pta buraya gelmeyen Türk var m? bilmiyorum ama Türkiye'yi yemeklerle birlikte gezmek isteyen kesinlikle gelmeli. Te?ekkürler Pasha orijinal lezzetleri tatt?rd???n için...
5,"I hosted my birthday dinner of about 8 or 9 ladies here and booked the reso very last minute as there was a cancellation/ reservation mix up at the Broadview hotel where I initially planned it. KOST was honestly so much better (I later went to the Broadview which I loved also)(( but you can read their review at another time haha)). This is a great place to get a bunch of items to share because everything is so good!!! Their service is also impeccable and the view is stunning! Located on the rooftop of Torontos boutique hotel Bush's, KOST is a must try! Pictured are a few of my favourite items!! The tuna ceviche and pico di galo  happy eating."
5,"Well after Scottsdale Mazda location closed, I had to find a new service center. Chapman Mazda was very friendly when I drive up and took care of everything quickly. Very happy"
5,"My friend and I loved working with Bill Lohmeyer, he was knowledgeable and was an advocate for her needs.  I couldn't reccomend working with Bill and this dealership enough."
5,"Not only are the breakfast dishes the best and the restaurant the most attractive, comfortable, and spacious of its kind, but this is the place for the perfect Jewish-style reuben sandwich, as good as any delicatessen I have visited throughout the United States!  The seeded rye bread, kosher corned beef, cheese, and dressing made the dish delectable and the home fries, included for the reasonable price of $9.99, made for a perfect early lunch. Service from Corinne was cheerful, friendly, and quick.  Our three dishes were out in less than ten minutes. Bravo, Mr. Schweinsberg and staff!  You are the best!"
5,"Simply the best. And that's not just because its big novelty pizza. It is legitimately amazing. The flavor is so good; the bottom crust is soo thin and has just the perfect amount of crisp, and the outer crust is so perfectly chewy.

Phenomenal pizza. AND they serve Cheerwine and IBC by the bottle."
5,"It's all in the name. Pitaland is a dream-land come true where a pita machine truly pops out fresh & warm pitas, sandwiches are savory & affordable, and staff is friendly & efficient. Go ahead and grab a baba ganouj tub and extra bag of pitas for later. Pitaland is maybe the best land you could ever frolic."
5,"The food here is top-notch quality, yet the prices are as cheap as they come! My Pitaland list usually consists of their fresh whole wheat pitas, house-made gyro meat, canned grape leaves (I never thought I'd say that, but they're SO GOOD), canned hummus (same) and whatever looks delicious in the fresh grocery case that day (which is usually everything). The employees are the nicest around, making Pitaland a true Pittsburgh treasure! My only request is to start a Happy Hour at the Olive Bar..."
5,"We were in Canada for 4 days in May and OMG...this was the BEST BEST lamb tika kabob we ever had.  The lamb was very tender and rich in flavors, it wasn't over marinaded...it was just perfect!!  

The palow (brown rice) that came with the kabob was also delicious and very flavorful.  My brother and I are specifically going to Toronto again next month because of the place :)

Atmosphere is like a fast food place, loud and self service but the food is amazing and makes up for it.  I have been recommending this place to everyone thats going to Toronto!!"
5,"A fan of Starbucks or not, this particular location is probably the best Starbucks in town.  It is getting a 5 star review from me!  This is one of the busiest Starbucks in town.  Don't even bother going during Nascar!  In the mornings, there is easily a line out the door, but the wait is still pretty good.  The service is always fast. 

The store's manager runs a tight ship.  Everything is always clean, and staff is always friendly.  A lot of them go out of their way to remember my name.  The drinks are always perfect, and if they aren't, they have no problem remaking your drink.  

I want to give this Starbucks a 5/5 review to show my appreciation for their great service, and great coffee!"
5,"We are brand new clients to LMAH and after months of searching for a new vet, I'm thrilled to have found this gem. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The staff at this hospital is so kind, upbeat and helpful. All 3 of my dogs were due for shots and examinations so heck I booked them all for the same time. Everyone in the building helped me ""manage"" the pups so we could weigh them in one by one. Doctor Jarred was very sweet and prompt during our visit. I would absolutely recommend this hospital to any of my friends or family."
5,"Absolutely delicious. We have been waiting for a Poke restaurant in Gilbert for awhile now. Poki Point delivers. Great food, many options, and friendly service. We went for lunch for their grand opening offer. We were so impressed, we went back for dinner. Will definitely be going again very soon. Maybe even tomorrow."
5,"I love Healing Waters. They give the best colonic therapy in this town. Getting this type of therapy isn't the most pleasant of treatments. It can be uncomfortable for first time goers who don't know what to expect. 
     For anyone who needs comforting, they are great. Their facility has a spa like atmosphere to ensure the upmost relaxation. Their therapists have gentle dispositions who take very good care of every client. All the therapists are great, Marlow is my favorite though. She is caring and puts you at ease the entire visit. 
   I would definitely recommend Healing Waters to anyone thinking of getting colonic therapy. I just wouldn't trust sending a friend anywhere else."
5,"THE PIZZAS ARE THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD.. and etc!
This was my first place I came to grab a bite after I stepped off that cramped ass 8hr Greyhound bus ride from NYC to Pittsburgh, just to visit one of my girlfriends. The first thing she put in my hands was a margarita and of course a hug... and a few squeals in my ear. Lol 
It was just past 2:30 AM. People were carrying out pizza boxes the size of a twin mattress! The line was long and full of semi-sober to not-so-sober college students.
So you done know this is a GREATTTT sign. Drunk people do not like waiting! No one stands on line for shitty pizza. Esp college students. Straight facts!
Moreover, in NYC, the only place you see a line for pizza is at Grimaldi's in BK. So I knew this place had to be Littt.. yes you read that correctly. LITTTTT!!! 20 mins later we got to the counter. I ordered a Pepperoni slice and my girl and her friend ordered a regular cheese slice. I slipped away quickly to wash my hands. When I came back, a slice the size of a 3 month old human was sitting at my booth! The cheese slices were even huger than pepperonis! Let's conceptualize this. Just imagine half a Domino medium pie. Now cut it in half. Yes. That one half of the pie equals a Benny's slice. Guys, I KID YOU NOT! I didn't even know what to do with my self but dash the usual garlic powder, hot-sauce and seasonings on my slice and dig in! 
One bite in and I was entering the gooey, ooey cheesy gates of Pizza heaven! You know that moment when you bite into something so damn delicious, your eyes roll back into your head and your mouth springs water from the flavors. I was having a relationship with my Pizza in South Pittsburgh and I didn't have to go to Italy like Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love to do that! 
Ahahahaha. I kid. But yes, it was that real. 
Benny's Fierro's, you got me. I'll forever frequent this spot whenever I'm in Pittsburgh craving a good slice away from NYC."
5,"I love coming here for a quick lunch. Besides the usual middle eastern favorites (tabbouleh, hummus, etc), they have Lebanese specialities like foul, fried cauliflower, and manakeesh.  Bakery on site.  Great pita bread as well as sweets.  Also inside is a grocery store with Lebanese and other middle eastern products."
5,"Great, cheesy Pizza. The place (decor etc), is not the best. However, when it comes to the pizza it was amazing. We got the Canadian (Whole-Wheat crust), and we were pleasantly surprised by the exceptional taste and even though we got a small it was more than enough for two people. Would Highly recommend for pizza in Ajax. As good as it gets for pizza in Ajax! I'm glad we tried it."
5,"Great customer service, timely in and out.  , On site owner that knows her customers and even recognizes and assists lost dad's.  And my daughter's hair looked great after a week of only dad and the kids at home."
5,"I drive 45 minutes to use Chapman to service my Mazda, even though there's another dealership closer to me, just down the road on Camelback. After multiple encounters with horrid customer service at Camelback Mazda, I decided to try Chapman--and I was happy from the start. 

Pete Pabst, the service advisor I have worked with, is great. He made sure that my first repair would be covered by our warranty before they started working on our car, which I really appreciated. I was wary of him trying to up-sell me when he let me know what other repairs our car needed, but he put no sales-type pressure on at all. He made a list of the repairs in order of importance and gave me pricing. When I told him I wasn't too car savvy and needed to go home and talk to my husband, he didn't judge or try to take advantage. The rest of the staff seems just as friendly and helpful. When we got our tires replaced, they explained all of the different options, what they would do, how much they were. In the end, the ones that they recommended the most were actually some of the least expensive tires offered.

Honest and good service...just wish it was closer to home!"
5,Want no pressure and a salesman who thoroughly knows his products? Ask for Aaron Weiss! He is the best car salesman I've ever worked with. He listens to your needs and shows you vehicles that match. No up-selling or pressure of any kind. He's a rare breed and worth seeing! Check out the CX SUV's. Pure quality and drive like a sports car!
5,"I had my first experience with the Ionic Foot Bath yesterday at Healing Waters.  Prior to my appointment, I had done some research on the ionic foot bath and wanted to experience it for myself.  I was a little skeptical at first, but after my 1st session, I'm a believer in the benefits.

Chrissy helped me get set up and provided me with an Amazing Greens drink while I waited.  She also sat in the room with me and answered all of my questions that I had about the process.  They also have a pamphlet in the room that describes how the machine works and what the color of the water indicates.

I took pictures of the beginning, middle and end of the session.  The water started out tan then started to turn orange (joints) and black (liver), with some foam (lymphatic).  Shortly after the session, I felt calm and refreshed.  I have a tendency to have a bit of insomnia, but last night I slept like a baby.  Today, I woke up feeling refreshed and energized and didn't feel the need to run to down my morning coffee.

The price of the service was well worth the benefits received, $40 for 40 minutes.  I will be doing this once a week.  I've been raving about it to my co-workers who are going to call and make their appointment too.  I'm sold!"
5,"Really excited to have this place nearby! Their food was fresh, my husband and I both enjoyed their fish and fun bowls. Even my young kids were able to find something there that they liked too (no kids menu, but we made it work). We will be back!"
5,Jacob helped me find the car I wanted and let me test drive a few others as well. Got a good deal in the end. Do negotiate but understand that cars cost money and dealerships are businesses that have to make some sort of profit to pay for the jobs they create. Thumbs up
5,"A hidden gem in Montreal! This banh mi (Vietnamese baguette) shop is sandwiched between a strip of local food places and can be easily missed as it's located down a set of stairs. We came here to stop for a quick banh mi break and here's my rundown:

Food - 
-Saigon Banh Mi - This is available in 7 inches and 10 inches but to be honest, it's a much better deal to get it with 10 inches. This included ham, Vietnamese sausage (cha lua) and pate on top of pickled radish and daikon, marinated carrots, coriander, and various sauces. This Banh Mi was SO good and had so much flavour! All of the condiments went so well with each other and there's also so many different meats you can get. It's so great for those grab and go type of people. 

Atmosphere - 
It's located on the lower level of a building so you have to go down a set of stairs to access it. There's some places to sit down but this place is suitable for those who are wanting some quick takeout food. 

Service -
Service here was very good. The employees here give such great hospitality and are very communicative. Perhaps I am a little biased since they were Vietnamese and recognized that I was Vietnamese but I did observe the employees' interactions with other customers and overall, they seemed very welcoming!

Price -
For a 10 inch banh mi, it was just under $5 which is a great bargain for what you're getting. This is definitely food on a budget except you're still getting quality food with the banh mi.

Verdict -
Highly recommend this place for some quick eats! They have lots of drink options to quench your thirst and the service here is great and efficient. They also have some asian cooking products / snacks for you to purchase on the side too. It may be a little hard to find but once you check this place out, you will for sure be returning for the food and people."
5,Authentic Afghan food. Portion sizes are very big so order wisely. One platter can serve 2-3 normal people.
5,"I bring both of my dogs here. Staff is super friendly. Facility is clean. I love how they have an entrance for cats and a separate one for dogs. They send reminders when my dog is due for shots, a visit, etc., which I like."
5,"Best Pizza around.
Friendly atmosphere!
Their dough is made fresh everyday, so no hard flacky crust like other chain places.
Don't ask for extra cheese, they put lots of cheese and toppings!!!
Amazing food!"
5,Quaint little Japanese place. Our server Sean was amazing and went above and beyond. The sushi tasted fresh and the presentation was beautiful.
5,Great food. Very clean and beautiful interior. Great service. Tried it out during Ramadan and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and the care put into the food. Had a good vegetarian/vegan option as well.
5,"Brookline History Note: This used to be a Golden Dawn supermarket until sometime in the late 80's (I wanna say...'88?).  That's when I seem to remember it becoming Pitaland.

Again, it's yet another place I've passed a million times and never had time to visit, until this morning that is.  I needed a lunch to take to work, so here I found myself.

It's what you think; a grocery for all things Mediterranean and Arabic. I've had their patented pita bread many times over the years. I recalled getting a gyro from them some years ago but was told that they stopped selling them when I called. However, the fellow on the other end told me that they had all sorts of pies that are ready to eat. 

When I walk in, I find that the groceries are on the right, and a glass case full of prepared foods is on the left. So I head left. Not giving myself enough time to look around (I overslept), I just asked for a meat pie and a spinach pie. I planned on getting Baklava until I saw that Almond and Chocolate Roll. More on that in a bit.

The meat and spinach pies can be heated upon request. I didn't have time, so I ate them both cold upon my arrival to Arkham Asylum (my name for the place I work for). Is that ok? 

 I'm not sure if it was lamb, beef, or a combo of the two in the meat pie, but I tasted bell peppers, tomatoes (?), and onions and came away with the feeling that I had just eaten the best Hot Pocket ever, except it was cold and that it was a new variety: Meatloaf. 

That's what it tasted like; cold, tasty meatloaf wrapped in terrific, chewy, pita bread. 

The spinach pie itself is a good argument for going vegetarian. And I used to hate spinach as a kid too. Watching Popeye cartoons didn't help. I wonder how different my life would have been had I eaten one of these back then. Alternate realities...

Both pies were filling too. My stomach didn't start growling again until about 6PM. I'll give myself more time when next I darken their doormat so I can get them hot as I'm sure they're even better that way. But as is, I was more than satisfied with both of them. 

Now for that  Almond and Chocolate Roll. Rich, oily, flakier than an East End hipster and a Fox Chapel housewife combined, sweeter than wakin' up next to the love of your life, I was asking myself after wolfing it down, ""Who needs baklava?""

Yes, it would win in a duel. It didn't even need to have the chocolate drizzled on top either. 

And guess what? It all cost me just $4.75, excluding a drink I brought from home.

Get on yer magic carpets and fly over here sometime. I'm glad we have a place like this in the neighborhood. Hopefully I'll get to come here more often."
5,"Great service and excellent food, what else could you ask for?  Got here with my family in the midst of the lunch rush.  We were in a bit of a hurry, but even with a line they had us at a table in less than 5 minutes.  The menu is extensive, sandwiches, crepes (sweet and savory), pancakes of course, and so much more  It was really hard for me to choose just one item because everything sounded so delicious.  I finally decided on the cherry crepes, which were superb. The crepes were tender and delicate, the cherry sauce was wonderful and not cloying sweet.  I would definitely eat here again."
5,"We took our Mazda 3 in for warranty work and fell in love with a vehicle on the lot. Bill Lohmeyer helped make it ours. He was very helpful and thorough. He made us confident that we were getting the best deal. Thanks Bill, we couldn't have done this without you!"
5,That one shawty barista with the leprechaun hair be bomb af  she can make me coffee any day for me! Good coffe too...
5,"We came here to get a tea for my cold. They have a great white defense tea. Lynette was very helpful. We'll definitely be back next time I have a cold. 

04/03/18
Turns out they have a puppochino, which is a cup of whip cream. I was offered one when they saw my dog in the backseat on a different visit. 
I got a white chocolate frappucino myself as they had special reward points from today until 4/9. 125 gold stars if you're a rewards member (or whichever term they use for this)."
5,"OMG! 

This place is delicious! IHOP who?! The buttermilk pancakes are out of this world! The homemade syrup is as well. A short stack is three pancakes and a full stack is six pancakes. A short stack is more than enough for the average person.

They give you a huge portion of corn beef harsh. It's pretty good but, not as good as Pamela's.

Their fresh squeezed orange juice is something special as well but at $4 a glass is pretty steep. I can buy a whole bottle of Simply Orange for that!

My wife had a Reuben and a cup of Wedding Soup. The Wedding Soup was the best we have ever had but it had no noodles. Huh?

A must try place! Get there early as they close at 3 pm."
5,"This place is AMAZING. I've tried lots of the poke places in the area and this one is SO fresh, generous with the serving sizes and friendly service! I'll be back!"
5,"I found this place through their sister property of Craig Animal Hospital and found it to be equally amazing.  Since CAH was booked to house my fur son for a couple of days I was provided with this facility and was not disappointed.  

One think they do different here is they take a picture of your pet upon arrival for safety practice. Very impressed with this and every pet hospital should take up this practice.  

I love both locations and cant say anything negative about either facility, so I am just glad to have found 2 locations for my son's needs plus very attentive and knowledgeable staff plus one of the most reasonably priced!!"
5,"Discovered this place last Sunday, the day after they opened. Nice bunch of people. Bowl is set up correctly, and not just stacked. I'm happy with the volume and the flavor. Will definitely go back!"
5,"I frequent this place during my lunch break and it is excellent. The food is an awesome fusion of Mediterranean and Asian. Incredible customer service, quick wait times, and delicious food. Try the Bulgogi Bowl with fries some time, it's my favorite."
5,"After three days of limited vegetarian options in Montreal (let alone GOOD vegetarian options), I trekked in here waiting to be disappointed. Never happened. This was probably the best sandwich I've had in my life. Ingredients were super fresh, including the bread which was perfectly crispy. The sauces they used definitely also MADE the sandwich. I also tried the veg spring roll (?) by the cash register. Good, but the sauce they give you with that is way too sweet/fruity. Really above all other details, there's: I got my first sandwich here on Sunday morning. Finished it before getting on the metro. Spent 8 hours thinking about it. Came back to Berri UQAM, got two more. (One for ""dinner"" and one for when I was back home.) Service was also very nice & fast both times I went in there. I can only hope a version of VUA opens up in Brooklyn soon."
5,"While being a first timer for colon hydrotherapy, I'm familiar with holistic medicine and natural healing practices. I don't have anything to compare this experience to, but after our first visit (and 5 more since) I'm pretty sure we won't be going anywhere else. 

Upon entering we were greeted warmly by Tommy and made comfortable as all my questions and concerns were answered thoroughly and patiently. 

We then met with our therapist Annie, who explained the procedure and what to expect before, during and after. 

Let me tell you, this type of thing can be extremely awkward in the hands of inept people. Thank God the level of professionalism here is TOP NOTCH. Everything is taken in stride (with some humor thrown in) and although the awkwardness is never completely gone, it did make my first time experience super comfortable.

Annie is extremely knowledgeable in her field, not only with colonics, but also with natural healing, herbal therapy, and all things internal (and poo) related. 

Their colonic rooms are soothing with music playing, essential oils diffusing and salt lamps and crystals setting a very zen tone. 

The procedure alone was...... ummmmm....... unusual. My first colonic was the most uncomfortable since most of the cramping happened during that session. Every session thereafter became more and more bearable with intermittent cramping as waste moved through and out. I'm pretty sure the experience will be different for everyone depending on the toxicity of their body and many other factors. 

Here's the main take-away - service, environment and experience is great here. They strive for a super comfortable and professional environment while keeping it personal and friendly. This is a great place to start if you're interested in colon hydrotherapy. They also offer a myriad of services including oxygen therapy, ionic foot detox, and herbal supplements."
5,"Absolutely the best Middle-Eastern food around.  I have tried most of the menu, my fav always been fattoush with chicken however, I tried the breakfast today and OMG the Shanklish : with eggs was awesome!!! Loved it!!!! Great job to Greg and his team at the café ! Keep up the good work!!"
5,"This place is wonderful!  The vets are all great and the prices are more than reasonable, definitely recommended!"
5,"Thank you Pittsburgh for having such an awesome pizzeria, amazing flavor great size slices and fantastic price , would not eat pizza anyplace else in the burgh"
5,"Drove from Ahwatukee all the way to Bell Rd. to buy a used Mazda CX-5 from another dealer.  The other dealer told me the car was there at lunch time, but said it was sold after I made the 45 minute drive.  

Out of curiosity, if not frustration, I stopped in Chapman Mazda to see if they had any used CX-5s.  No luck with the used car, but one of the managers, Kim, suggested I might be surprised at what they could do on a new one.  Honestly figured the price would be more than I'd be willing to pay for new, but after putting numbers together we were closer than I'd imagined.  Eventually I paid just a little more than the used car I was originally going to buy!

This is our second new Mazda from Chapman and both times felt like I was dealing with friendly professionals and not the typical high pressure smoke and mirrors types employed at some other dealers.  

I'd certainly recommend Chapman Mazda.  The whole experience was about as pleasant as car buying can get."
5,"I love this place!! Whether it's getting dolled up for a night out or pampering myself after a bad breakup I'm never disappointed. The staff is friendly, polite & always listens to what I am looking for. The salon is super clean & very cute. For the caliber of service, I'd say it's a steal of a deal & always recommend my friends to go"
5,"This location was a life-saver!   After a horrific experience at another location, I called up the Hayden location and asked if they could squeeze me in to redo my hair for maternity pictures being done that afternoon.  They accommodated me with no problem at all and even had chocolate waiting for me when I arrived (I was pretty upset over the treatment I received from the Primp and Blow I was coming from).  Bri was awesome!  She was so kind and comforting.  She made sure my hair looked great and she never once made me feel like I was taking up her time even though she took me at the last minute.  The owner even came by and apologized for my experience at the other location.  She did tell me that she recently took over the shop and you could tell the atmosphere was different from the other Primp and Blow.  I found out that each location is independently owned.  I would definitely come back and recommend this Primp and Blow location to other people."
5,"My friends and I came out to the Desert Roses Program a few weeks ago and left wanting to come back for more!

The program runs the first and third Thursday of every month. Our class was FULL, so I definitely recommend planning ahead and reserving your spot. None of my friends nor I had ever used a shotgun before. A few in our group had never even shot a gun before. But by the end of the night we felt comfortable with the shotguns and had all hit several clay rounds. 

The instructors begin with a safety lesson. Vitally important, especially for us newbies! They answered our questions, handed out safety glasses and ear plugs before walking us over to the range. We were each given a box of 15 rounds and took turns targeting 5 clays at a time. The instructors were patient and extremely helpful. They were also very encouraging and gave us helpful tips that made it much easier to hit the clay target. 

Honestly, I was a little apprehensive when we started the class, but was still enthusiastic. But the confidence of the instructors, their willingness to answer everyone's questions, their thorough safety instructions, and encouraging coaching on the range made me and my friends fans of this sport! We're planning to come back so save us some seats!!!

If you're looking for something different to do with your friends, I highly recommend checking out this program. It only costs $5 and only takes a few hours of your time. It's a very memorable experience and one you'll enjoy!"
5,Love this place!! Food is great and all the employees are very kind. We come here every Saturday for sushi/hibachi steak and it never disappoints! Service is also really fast.
5,The restaurant is actually the best turkish restaurant in Toronto. I think there has such delicious food. but service is a little bit slow. Everyone should try the baklava. There doesnt have the raki .it is turkish alcohol. I hope it starts to sell raki . Location is little bit far from downtown.
5,New pita café is a welcome addition to a classic bakery and some of the best hummus in Pittsburgh. A great menu with fresh and local items served quickly efficiently and kicked up condiments and extras at every turn. This is the best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh bar none. Chef Greg keep it coming
5,Best pizza in town! The slices are huge and it taste amazing with the crispy crust and then  gooey cheese and awesome toppings.  My favorite pizza place!
5,"I recently had my first colonic at Healing Waters. I always thought it would be beneficial for my health, but felt too embarrassed and concerned about discomfort to go. As it turns out, I didn't need to be concerned at all. My certified therapist, Tiffany, was very nice and extremely professional. The atmosphere was relaxing and induced a feeling of calm. The procedure was explained at length before I began, and I was checked on often. At one point I experienced slight nausea. Tiffany provided aromatherapy in the form of peppermint oil to inhale, helping immensely. I am relieved to have some of the accumulated waste removed from my body, and plan on another two appointments (one already scheduled) to assist with an even deeper cleaning. For a colon detox in an environment that will make you feel very comfortable in all aspects of the procedure, go to Healing Waters. It is definitely the only place I will go after such top notch treatment."
5,"This place is amazing! We ate here 2x and bought extra pita and hummus to take home. Fresh ingredients - delicious Vegetarian Options and the freshest Pita I have ever had. (Right out of the oven) Falafel sandwich, French fries, fried cauliflower and the special Brussel Sprouts and pomegranates."
5,"best pizza on the south side since pizza sola closed...wish i had stopped here sooner...fantastic thin pizza, great sauce (right amount and i am so picky about too much sauce) not stingy with the cheese; and i loved putting the remainder of my slice in the brown bag  !!!"
5,"I was introduced to this place via Groupon. My situation: Hernia in my stomach. Lower back surgery that the doctors went through my stomach to replace a disc in my lower back as well as fuse another one. I take some serious pain meds all of which causes constipation. I take upwards of 30 laxatives a day just to have a ""NORMAL"" bowel movement!!!. CAN WE SAY HELP!!!!...LOL. I went to Healing Waters in great distress and hoping against hope to get some relief for my ""peculiar"" predicament. I was apprehensive and cynical when I went there. Upon entering the facility, I was welcomed and put at ease by the staff as well as fellow customers. Tiffany (God bless you!!), made me feel immediately at ease and instructed me as to what to do. The environment was very calming and ""healing"". Tiffany checked on me periodically through out the process comforting me as well as informing me as to what was going on. Although the ""treatment"" didn't totally correct my problem, it did give me relief, which quite honestly given my situation is all I could ask for. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Thanks again Tiffany for all of your help!!! You were very informative and helpful!!!"
5,"It's only my second time here but I know it will definitely not be my last! The food is delish, the customer service is great, and they've had soccer matches playing both times I've been in here! Gyros + Soccer = awesome lunch break. PLUS they offer a 10% discount to all camelback colonade workers."
5,"I love this Animal Hospital. 2 years ago I was on a verge trying to find the best Animal hospital to bring my two fur babies in. Until I came across Lone Mountain Animal Hospital. Not only were they close to me but also had really good reviews online (I'm big on reviews). Anyways, they have helped me so much and my fur babies as well. Even when I forget to follow up with they're shots and appointments they never failed to email to remind me. Which is something that I love so much. Thank you so much and I will never change to any other Animal Hospital. You guys are the best!"
5,This pizza was out of this world good!!!!  We stopped after a Cubs win over the Pirates and was a perfect end to the night . Staff was extremely friendly and some of the best pie I've ever had!  Definitely highly recommend.
5,Great restaurant. We went there for birthday celebration with the family. The food was really good and tasty. Our server was very friendly and the orders came in at the right time. The quality of the food and the quantity was amazing. The prices were reasonable. They serve great tea and Turkish coffee. No alcohol served though.
5,""" Exceeds Expectations! ""

Our family had an amazing experience with Bill Lohmeyer at Chapman Mazda. He was an exceptional salesman who was polite, personable, and willing to meet our needs in order to get us in the car we wanted. Bill's true class demonstrated his many years of experience in the industry. We truly appreciated his efforts and customer centered focus while not being the stereotypical pushy car salesman. We are very proud to be part of the Chapman family and highly recommend Bill Lohmeyer for all of your new or used car needs!!! We wouldn't have bought this car if it weren't for Bill and his exceptional team at Chapman Mazda!!"
5,On Sat.  9-8-18. I took our pooch to the Animal Foundation on Mohave for vaccinations.  As soon as I got home he had an allergic reaction so I took him to Lone Mountain Animal Hospital Soon  after arriving they saw him and gave him a Bennedryl shot.  I really appreciate the immediate attention he received.  I highly recommend them
5,"My first time ever getting a colonic and Marlow was amazing ! She's so sweet, she made me feel so comfortable. I've been back a few times and always request her."
5,"Healing Waters is a peaceful, holistic business where you can feel very comfortable having a colonic treatment.  The therapists are knowledgable and sweet.  I literally lost 5 pounds the day after my colonic because I was so constipated.  After the treatment, I felt GREAT!  I originally bought a Groupon but unlike the other reviewer, I had absolutely no problem whatsoever getting an appointment.  It was such a positive experience, I have gone back 3 more times."
5,"I stopped here to meet someone who was buying jewelry, but got stopped by a pigeon who had gotten it's feet stuck in plastic, was losing a toe, and hangning upside down from a bush......yes, I'm getting to the Starbucks.....They let me HAVE a box knife, to save it. They wouldn't take the box knife back, because they don't contaminate, very safety concious.
 The drinks they made us were delicious,and the guy knew all the different ins and outs of the subtle flavors, and advise us as to which we would like best. They were GREAT!
 Very out of my way, but if I'm ever driving by I will stop again.
 Pigeon was fine, by the way. :)"
5,"My husband Brian just bought a new car from Bill Lohmeyer, and he couldn't have been happier with the experience. He said Bill was a pleasure to work with, and that Bill is just a great person, all around. The negotiation process was easy, and the trade-in for his vehicle was the best he was offered. If you're in the market for a new Mazda, Bill's your guy!"
5,"My husband and I recently purchased a new car at Chapman.  Scott Sullivan was awesome to work with!  He is genuine, not pushy, and has a great sense of humor.  If you need a new car, go see Scott!  He took the time to listen to our needs, helped get us a great price, and never pressured us."
5,"On the first and third Thursdays of the month, Ben Avery offers lessons for women. You get to take three classes for free (skeet, trap and sport). And by free, I mean COMPLETELY FREE. They give you a box of rounds, shotgun rental, clays, ear/eye protection and awesome instructors. After your first 3 lessons, you can continue to join the class, but you have to buy your own clays and rounds.  

Fred the range master (in charge of the program) is awesome and so is LeRoy (he's in charge of the first-time visitors). And the ladies from Desert Rose that instruct the return visitors are so helpful. 

Make sure you sign up in advance for the classes though. Space is limited."
5,"I think this is one of the best 3 pizza spots in the Burgh, right up there to Fiori's and Mineo's, and it's definitely the  best pizza in the Southside. The NY-style slices are as big as 3 slices of an original pizza at a standard pizza joint. The ingredients they use are of high quality, and the sauce is just right and is seasoned to perfection. The crust is also crispy and scrumptious. I have been going here for more than a year and eat here minimum 3 times a month, and I have never had a bad slice from here. Also, if you're having a party, you only need one whole pizza. $30 for cheese and $38 for toppings, the 28"" pizza will feed a an army. Service is good and friendly, and they're open until 3 on Friday and Saturday. Hand's down must-have pizza."
5,Great food and great service.  I've had a lot of Greek food and this place is a great value.  Don't overlook this little gem!
5,"Great place for a bite to eat

We were looking for a quick and light lunch when we came across Greka Pita . If you enjoy Greek food, you should try this place.  Greka Pita is the real deal, their food is really good, the restaurant is clean and inviting, the staff is acomdating, in fact you will feel right at home when you walk in.

My lunch companion and I both ordered the gyros with fries. The gyro meat was nicely grilled, tender, seasoned perfectly, and the tzatziki sauce was absolutely delicious.  The portions at Greka Pita are large, prices are wallet friendly, and ingredients fresh. On my next visit I am going to try the pork souvlaki. 

If you're in the mood for Greek food give Greka Pita a try, you won't be disappointed."
5,We have been taking our pets here for years.  Always friendle and helpful.  Reasonably priced and always have the best interest for our pets.
5,"Absolute best me time!  Service is friendly, staff is so talented in making you look and feel your best!  I am taken such good care of everytime I am here and have never loved my hair more than I do now!  Primp and Blow hair extensions are my recommendation to anyone looking for a change to sexy, full, beautiful hair!  Unlike others I have seen, these have no damaging glue, wax or heat, they are so low maintainance and last for up to 2 years!  Highly recommended!  this place!"
5,After learning I had a special friend inside of me I decided to do my first colonic. I felt really uncomfortable the first time but the ladies that work here are so easy going that I was put at ease. The 2nd time I did it I didn't need anymore assistance and felt amazing afterward. I will be a life long customer :)
5,"I can not say enough good things about greka pita. I LOVE greek good, and this place is legit. From the owners, to the shwarma. Please give all your money to this place because I eat here like 4 times a week."
5,"This was our first visit but it won't be our last. We took in our 4 month old Chocolate Lab puppy for some followup shots, a checkup and nail clipping. The staff was very professional, accommodative and treated our puppy very well. The doctor took the time to explain things and even offered suggestions on treatments for dogs who like to wim in pools with chlorine.
Prices were reasonable and the followup was the next day so ""just as advertised""."
5,"Don't be fooled by this restaurant's shabby appearance.   I will admit, I wasn't too captivated by the interior; lighting was dim, seating looked a little cramped and the table tops looked a bit dirty.  However, the food made up for this!   

I have always loved curry but was never able to handle the spiciness.  Not only was the curry here flavourful but it was mildly spicy, something I was able to handle with ease.   I ordered the curry beef brisket roti; there were generous amounts of brisket and the brisket was juicy and tender.  Was a little on the pricier side ($13.95), but I left feeling satisfied."
5,Great place to go shooting.  I did a lot of long range shooting and it was great.  The only problem was my Valley Ordnance .50BMG.  Only 30% of the rounds would fire.  Don't get these guns.  They are crap.  Same rounds went bang in other guns.
5,"Went here for the first time today, the food was excellent! We also got hummus, pita and tabuli to go. The staff were really friendly! Highly recommend!"
5,We did the foot bath and we were shocked about the results.  One of their machine wasnt working.  So we had to wait extra hour
5,"I stopped in again this morning. 

When you ask for a hot spinach pie, they just nuke it. The guy behind the glass counter recommends a minute on the ""high"" setting and says it's perfectly acceptable to eat them cold if you wish. 

I forgot to mention their amazing homemade hummus dip which I've had a bunch of times (Mom shops there pretty often).  I've had many hummuses (is that correct usage?), and this is the best I've ever dipped a microwaved pita into."
5,"Love the Clay Target center, can't think of a place that could be better."
5,All you can eat sushi is an excellent value. The wait staff was great and the food was even better. I will definitely come back.
5,"My husband and I stopped by Greka Pita for lunch. We both ordered the gyro special ($6.99 for gyro, fries or salad, and a drink). The food was excellent. Gyro was well seasoned, all the ingredients were fresh and delicious, and the fries were excellent. The man at the counter was very polite as was the man who brought our food out to us. Overall, a great experience. We will definitely be back to try some of their other food."
5,"Did a reservation to go with 2 friends for a Sunday morning brunch.
Since the moment we got into the hotel, the amazing experience at KOST started, the eggs Benedict with smoked trout ($15) were amazing!!
Service could not have been any better...
Coffee was okay."
5,"We went on a Tuesday night, my husband and 3 yr old.  After ordering our appetizer of fried tofu, which came fast and soooo delicious, they brought us two on-the-house appetizer samples (plenty to try) of their Fajita sushi and Firefish.  Both were awesome and we'll definitely return for.  Wedidn't come for sushi and I had chicken Yaki Udon, husband had teriyaki, and daughter had shrimp plate and ate it all. I don't know why I hadn't been in before since I moved to Mint Hill 1 year ago."
5,Went there with friends Saturday night just for drinks.  Unbelievable view. Unfortunately it was too cold to sit outside. We got the table inside. Beautiful place. Very modern decor. Very clean. Waitress was very nice and friendly. The security from the moment we walked in was very professional and very friendly and they made us feel like we were VIP.  Beautiful people. Everyone looked very pretty and classy.
5,I love it here yet hate to come if that makes sense! Lovely staff that is super sweet. Their online portal makes it easy to book an appointment with usual openings within a day or so out. Our Vet is Dr. White who gives you half super model half super hero. She's patient and appears to treat her techs well. You are given your price breakdown before services which is a very nice touch! My Smokey was having itching issues and she treated him well. The staff will also call with follow up to ensure your babies are well.
5,"I was extremely nervous going to this appointment since it was my first time doing a colonic  . i was really amazed about the privacy and the comfort you don't feel awkward or embarrassed at any time .they take you  to a private room with dime lights and sounds of the ocean you get in gown just when you go to the doctors .
you lay down a very comfortable weird table that have a opening at the bottom for the water to flow, the therapist  tells you how the machine works and leave you for you to have full  privacy . The colonic is amazing, the process takes one hour you feel rejuvenated  you feel immediately lighter , the next day to my surprise i weight my self and i lost 4 pounds thanks to the colonic . if you feel like you to do something about your health this place to go am hooked !!"
5,Ma 2e maison à côté de l'école. Pour vrai les sandwichs vietnamiens sont succulents. Les sushis ne sont pas toujours méga frais mais quand il est passé 21h et qu'ils sont à 30% de rabais on aime ça!! Un service rapide et endroit sympathique
5,I just ate here for lunch and man it's delicious. The yuzu sauce is really great with the tuna and salmon. The staff is very friendly. As a sushi lover this is one place I can get my fix. The decor is a bit barebones but I think that's because it just opened.
5,"Great meals at reasonable prices. Just gets very busy on weekends, huge wait and over crowded."
5,Now I did not use the range but I took a course there and it was great. The class was informative and fun. I will be going to more classes and will be shooting here once the weather gets cooler.
5,"Great Pizza!! Especially if you like cheese. Their pizza is loaded with fresh toppings and tons of cheese!! Best Pizza I have had in a long time. Slices are huge, was full after 2 but still ate another because it was so good.  We ate in. They had a little bar in there and a TV with the Winter Olympics on. Staff was friendly. They didn't have a kids menu but were happy to bring us a smaller portion of pasta for my 2 year old and didn't charge full price. Can't wait to go back or order for delivery."
5,The jimi chimichurry was DELISHHHH!! I will definitely be returning for more! Loved the atmosphere and vibe of the bright colors and COMFORTABLE seats :)
5,"Personal, beautiful, new! Love the upstairs bar! They have remodeled and while I can't comment on the food it's a great place to hang out"
5,"Beverly nails is a wonderful nail salon!  Their customer service is stellar and I would not go anywhere else.

Tom has been doing my nails for about 6 months and his work is AWESOME !  He does beautiful nail art designs and always makes me feel welcome.

I would HIGHLY recommend this salon...and Tom..to anyone wanting perfect nails and a good experience!!"
5,"Just had an amazing facial with Jane! She's knowledgable, excited about what she does, and let's you relax or talk as much as you want. I'm a picky girl and I would pick her over the many facialists I've been to all over the world. She doesn't push product but, listens enough to you needs to suggest smart additions to your lineup. Will definitely be back! Thanks Jane! See you in 4-6 weeks. Joye"
5,I love mexican food and this is one the most authentic and best priced. The Surf burrito is killer!!!
5,"Have got a brazlian here, lip, and thredding. All services were amazing! Shree is my go to! Shes amazing!"
5,"This place is the absolute best!

If you're looking for a great nail salon in the Madison area----this is it! It's convenient to my house but I would probably drive an hour for it! 

Lotus is very clean with a beautiful decor that isn't over the top or cheesy. The massage chairs are *new* and they all work (I always encounter that problem at nail salons). I greatly appreciate the variety of manicures + pedicures that Lotus offers....all with fresh ingredients such as milk, honey, orange peel, etc. The option of a glass of wine or champagne while you're there doesn't hurt, either ;-) On the weekends they play dance music---kind of hilarious but it's a nice change of pace from typical salon music. 

They also do waxing and I highly recommend it----I love being able to cross off my brow wax while I'm getting my nails done. Multi-tasking at it's finest.

Lotus has become my regular place and I always look forward to visiting!  Be sure to check it out, I guarantee you'll become a huge fan."
5,"I'm so glad they opened one up here in AZ. Every time I go to California I would always stop by Bambu. I love the fact that this place is located in the Lee Lee plaza I can get all my shopping done conveniently and enjoy a che drink or even dessert. 

The place looks great inside modern and clean. The staff here was very helpful and more importantly the product here delivered I couldn't tell the difference from this location and any of the ones in California other than when I walk out of the door I could feel that AZ heat 

I will be returning to try some of the other dessert and drinks they have!"
5,"Stopped by here for lunch yesterday.  What a delight!!!
Every staff member was so nice.  The food was delicious. If you like calamari?  Theirs is a must. It is the best I've had.  We had fish and chips. I will definitely return. The friendly environment itself was so inviting."
5,"This place is outstanding! Unique and charming Hawaiian decor, and so many fantastic burgers and tacos to choose from. We'll definitely come back when we're in Phoenix again."
5,"Stayed for five nights. The staff at this hotel really knows what customer service is all about! 
This review may be longer than most of my reviews but I really need everyone to understand how much the staff anticipated our needs/desires.
Lets start with the front desk. I came in early the first day. I do mean early, there breakfast was still going. All I really needed was the shuttle to pick up my rental car, no problem. Told me what time to be in the lobby for the next shuttle, which was less than 20 minutes. So I just waited in the lobby. While I'm sitting there they called me to the desk and handed me my room keys! I'm like are you for real, but sure, that's great. 
I went to pick up my rental car then came back to take things up to my room. These rooms are very spacious. I was thrilled with a microwave and refrigerator as well. Ice machines available on each floor by the elevator. Just how convenient can it get.
Housekeeping is next. Wow, once again. The first morning we left a note for them to leave a couple of extra coffees. When we returned that night lets just say they made sure we had more than enough, regular and decaf. Everyday it was at least noon or later before we headed out for the day, and our room was still cleaned everyday. The last day, we stayed in the room till 2pm before we left and we returned around 6pm. To our surprise the room had not been refreshed, but we understood and didn't really need anything but coffee. Then a few minutes later housekeeping came by and all was perfect. All this without having to ask for anything.
Our last day, they where able to let us stay as long as we needed, since they still had availability that night. They just asked us to let them know when we where done.
The breakfast is pretty standard at Hampton inn. They always have some sort of egg and protein as well as waffles, cereals and pastries. I do wish that the Hampton chain would do something about the egg/protien selection.  Very limited and the eggs seem to always we way overcooked with very little flavor. This is a problem with the chain, and not this particulair hotel.   
My only complaint is about families with children. I love kids but please make them throw there candy wrappers away. Everyday the pool was littered with candy wrappers, and I know the hotel was cleaning the pool area. Sometimes we have to do our part. 
I see several comments on people making comments about the airport right next door.  Yes, if you are a light sleeper then the planes may just keep you awake, but I believe you would have to be a light sleeper.  If youve ever stayed at a hotel near LAX, then this is nothing compared to them.  
I will be back to Vegas and I will stay here again. Thank you for the opportunity for me to relax!"
5,"I would highly recommend, kim was my leasing agent and she is awesome! She was on top of her game and took care of every question and concern! Keep it up On Q, you guys rock!"
5,"Staff is SO friendly, I was checked in on once I received my food to ask how the new menu item was. I had the Tahini bowl and it is very nice! Quick service with good food, nothing but great things to say about this place. I also love to get the honey fruit bowls here as well when I have a sweet tooth. My secret is I come here before I grocery shop so I don't but everything because I'm shopping on an empty stomach! 

Super clean, fast food with quality!"
5,"Incredible Tacos and great drinks. Get the johnny Utah with BBQ and macn cheese! Sit on the patio and enjoy the music.

Truly a diamond in the rough.

I could hang out here all day. 

The staff is really laid back and really know what they are doing"
5,"We go here a lot the servers are very nice the decor is very nice and the food is consistently good. All the steaks such as the the porter house, the filet, and the ny strip are really good and the salads are really good. Also the coconut cream pie is awesome!"
5,"Writing this review for my mother as she doesn't Yelp! 

She saw Mark yesterday and left with a smile on her face as well. 

Mark was very professional and full of cheer. It was refreshing to see how he cares about his clientele as her remember everything from their previous consultation! Spot on! 

Mark transformed my mother's hair from what looked like a helmet (can you picture Sally Fields hair in Steel Magnolia's) to a very cool and stylish haircut age appropriate. My mother may be 65, but she is NOT a blue hair. She is one stylish mother with taste and class. Thanks Mark for doing yet another masterpiece!"
5,"Stayed one week while exhibiting at the SGIA convention. The room was clean and it was great having a dishwasher, washer and dryer, and a kitchen. The staff was very helpful and it was convenient having hourly transportation to and from the strip. Would definitely stay here again."
5,I'm going to keep this short. Ricardos is probably the best place to go to for fish tacos. You will not find better ingredients or portion sizes for the price that you pay. Taco tuesdays are my favorite!
5,"I normally stay at a hotel on the strip when I go to Vegas; however, this time the hotels were either sold out or extremely expensive.  We decided to stay off the strip and after seeing good reviews on this hotel I decided to give it a shot.  

Pros:
Very economical
Room was clean and comfortable
Close to strip
Free comp breakfast
Friendly staff
Free parking
Family friendly
Safe area

Cons:
none

My new favorite place to stay in Vegas."
5,"I have found my Madison nail salon!!
I went to Lotus today for a shellac manicure and also had the organic pedi.
Danny did my manicuivingre and did a detailed job, made suggestions that would help the manicure last and look great.
I had the best pedicure I've ever had from Linh. She pampered my feet and legs, and I left tingling and glowing. She took her time, not a quick get-it-and-out-of-my-chair so I can get the next person in pedi. I really needed some self-care today and I got it! Oh, and BTW my nails look great, too!
In the chairs next to me was a mother/tweenage daughter duo. The daughter wanted rainbow nails and it seemed like the whole place was interested in giving her the coolest toes ever. They were so cute - each nail a different color with stripes, polka dots and detailing on each toe. She's going to be the envy of her group!
Linh said it best, ""When you're happy, we're happy.""
I'll be back!!!"
5,"I am so happy to have found Lotus nails bar and spa. The decor is soothing, the staff is wonderfully attentive, and the business practices are incredibly clean. The staff is so knowledgeable that they help me with pain due to fibromyalgia. for that you want to get Kenny to treat your feet and your legs in the wonderfully dark wonderfully peaceful new room. Right to left as you enter the door is a lowly lit haven what's a little login, bridge lowlights, and soft music. I love the space when treating myself, but it must be reserved. this salon is well equipped to treat you on arrival but do yourself a favor: look at their services, take the ones you want, and book it."
5,"I got my eyebrows threaded and the lady was really sweet and really nice. I came in right when they were closing and she let me come in. Done very well and not for a bad price of $12! They also have other services so check them out too. I got a customer rewards card to earn a discounted service in the future. 

Parking is easy because it is located in a plaza. 
Definitely coming back!"
5,They've won me over with an honest and courteous consultation.  Awesome TINT job!  But the reason for this review is because of the customer service that I've received.  Must visit AUTO TINT EXPRESS for a consultation before getting a tint for your automobile.  Thanks again for your wonderful customer service.
5,"Almost didn't come in, but so glad I did!  Fish tacos are great!  The blackened fish inside mixed with the spicy sauce, and was fantastic. I appreciated the homemade fries. Friendly service.  Next time I'm in Tempe, I'll be back to try some more!"
5,amazing food. seafood congee crave acomplished. new locaton. center point. enplug is awsome
5,"Ordered a hibachi meal and lots of sushi! Everything tasted great - nice that we were able to get good quality sushi especially when we are used to the number of great sushi places in the San Francisco/Bay Area. Nice job - waiter was also very engaging, sorry we did not catch his name.

We are just here for a few weeks but will definitely try to make another visit."
5,"Love this place! Didn't know what to expect, we were on our way back from a hike on South Mountain looking for a good burger and beer.  This place delivered! Great vibe, food was delicious, service top-notch!  Highly recommend if you're looking for a casual, laid back beach feel with great flavors!"
5,"Honestly the BEST Hibachi place in Madison Football for sure!  I normally wait to write reviews but everything was great!  From hibachi to sushi, martini, and desserts! All was fantastic!!! I love it!!! Thanks for a wonderful experience!!!"
5,"We've gone back several times since and have had much better experiences! The food has been very consistent and delicious - whether a grain bowl or a 1/4 chicken with 2 sides. 

The service has also been much improved! Everyone has been very kind and accommodating. For example, when a friend's piece of chicken on one trip was much smaller than everyone else's, the manager (a very nice woman), cheerfully brought him up a second piece for him. 

There is also fun music bingo on Friday night and $3 drafts - great special for a Friday! We will continue to keep this place in our rotation, thanks to great food and even better people!"
5,A bit off the strip but they run shuttles every hour. The pool area was immaculate and had plenty of tables and chairs. Great BBQ area for guests to use.  Our room was clean and had everything we needed in our mini kitchen. Nice continental breakfast included. Price was beyond reasonable for all that you get!  Fitness room with sauna was great way to start the day. Had a wonderful stay.
5,"Had a breakfast burrito that was incredible.
Three other people in my party and they loved what they ordered.
Reasonably priced and excellent food.
My new favorite spot in the neighborhood w/ great customer service."
5,"I have stayed here multiple times for extended stays. Staff is always helpful, courteous, and cheerful.

Rooms are always clean and kept in good order. 

Even though the property is near the airport, you do NOT hear the airplanes taking off or landing. 

I would recommend this property if you like to stay away from the Strip.  Be aware though that there are no restaurants in close walking distance."
5,"Look, mom, I can wear my hair down now!

I am totally a ponytail, bun, top knot kinda girl. It's a rarity that I take the 10-15 minutes and actually blow dry my hair. That's why I was completely stoked for Shine Salon's Blow Dry 101. For $25, they pair you up with a wonderful, sweet and educated stylist to educate you on how to properly tame your tresses.

Lisa showed me the ins and outs of a proper blow dry and I also enjoyed a great conversation with Jeffre Scott who was on hand to show us ladies the best glow products for summer skin! After a few hours, a few glasses of wine and a lot of fun I left Shine Salon armed with a mini J-Lo glow, swingy, shiny hair and the knowledge to actually attempt the blow out myself! *flips hair* Go to Shine and get your know-how on."
5,So far a nice place to come for window tint in in Vegas with friendly staff and competitive prices for window tint.Another great service coming hear for my second time and they have a nice wating area to help with the long waits.Will let people know if they need window tint to try out tint express they can't go wrong...
5,"Very good service, food is amazing. My favorite is the turnip patties. And the salmon congee. The lobster is good here too"
5,Amazing! Loved the food.. loved the environment. Audrey is amazing! Can't wait to come back for music bingo night.
5,"Love this place! They have amazing Hibachi and sushi, and even better cocktails! All of their employees are so friendly and inviting, and we cannot wait to go back!"
5,"This place is a fantastic choice for wholesome, healthy and flavorful food, great beer and offers an awesome location! My husband loves meat and I'm a vegetarian and we're both VERY satisfied here-- and their staff is quirky and always a good time. Especially Audrey, she is a hoot and we enjoyed her excellent service! Please come check this place out!"
5,Very fast and professional service. I will not hesitate to come back here again. Lucio was very helpful and explained everything to me in a clear and concise manner.
5,"I've been to Lotus Nails several times since it opened a few years ago and every time I've had a great experience. (I even moved across town and still come back to Lotus to get my nails done!) I usually get a regular pedicure and shellac manicure and each of the staff are very professional and efficient. 

It's also a really great place for wedding parties. They allow you to bring in your own drinks and food and do a nice job of accommodating all of your needs."
5,"So I'm waiting here in a clean and very well air-conditioned waiting room for my TC for the windshield to be replaced. Some little ones throw a rock to it and couldnt wait to replace it so I picked this shop among several other glass shops I called because this was the only one that had the glass instock ready for whenever I got here and Look! They've done!  Other shops I called said that my time waiting was going to be 2 to 3 hours!!! So I choosed Auto tint express they're great. plus the guys are honest , prices are fair. Location is easy to find. Thank you guys! 100% recommended! =)"
5,Think of this as a more upscale version of panda express with a diverse variety of asian cuisine.  Went there on a groupon and had a great time.  The restaurant is very clean and the service was excellent.  Our food was delicious and the portions were large enough for left overs.  Try the kimchi rice balls as an appetizer!
5,"Awesome Chicken and awesome service. I would highly recommend if you are looking for something tasty and healthy but don't feel like cooking. Super cool atmosphere inside the building and the employees are super nice, friendly and helpful. We added this into our rotation for local restaurants to grab food from- highly recommend stopping by for the rotisserie chicken and corn casserole!"
5,Amazing food!!! Went out for a girls night. We ordered the boat. They weren't kidding! So much food. Can't wait to go back!
5,"Spent one night here last month. Every thing was perfect. 

Free shuttle from airport. Fast efficient check in. Free cookie. Nice clean room. AC worked well. Nice TV. Free breakfast. Free shuttle back to airport.

The Hampton Inn is everything you need in a hotel and nothing you don't need.

I'll be staying here every time I visit Vegas!"
5,"i went in yesterday to look at a new dishwasher.  when i went in i saw justin, one of the sales guys.  i told him i only had 5 minutes but wanted to know everything he could tell me about the 2 models i was looking at.  he respected my time, he was very very knowledgeable, he didn't try to upsell me, and he didn't pressure me.  he gave me all the info, gave me his card, he didn't ask me to give him any info, and he encouraged me to research them at home.  i called back later that day and purchased the dishwasher.  he was fantastic, highly recommend the staff at spencers.  and the prices were very competitive too, i looked 2 different places and it was the best price with delivery, etc.  the delivery guy was great too!"
5,"We came in after shopping at every other appliance store for the past week. As soon as we got there, I was reminded as to why I chose to purchase from them 11 years ago. So down to earth, affordable, realistic, and knowledgeable!  I even took a lunch break to think about the purchase before signing anything. They let me go without any pressure, and I returned an hour later to seal the deal on my new washer and dryer, and dishwasher. Don was so patient with going back and forth on each decision I was making. I'm definitely going back when I need a new fridge and oven! The delivery date is less than 24 hours, hopefully that goes smooth as well!"
5,"This is our second time getting appliances from Spencer's, this time for our Tucson (!) home.  Like last time, we had a fantastic experience putting together an appliance package (7 pieces so far, all delivered).  Kevin gave excellent advice on the many choices, and in the end the pricing was substantially below anything we could have gotten elsewhere, and far better than what was available locally in Tucson.  Would wholeheartedly recommend Spencer's and Kevin for anyone needing appliances (or a TV) anywhere in Arizona!"
5,"When arriving to Vegas the uber driver dropped us off at Tahiti Village that's on the strip.  We didn't know that Tahiti was the sister of Tahiti Village, when I arrived at Tahiti I was like oh no this is a downgrade but you can never judge a book by its covers I stayed here for 7 days and I will definitely come to stay here if I ever come back to Vegas.  The staff are extremely kind and helpful, the rooms are nice and clean; we had a suite which consisted of a fire place, kitchen, living room, washer, dryer, patio, it had everything you could ask for!  There's free breakfast every morning, coffee, hot tea, and hot chocolate available to you all day!  You have a little convenient store that has reasonable prices unlike others in hotels, you can rent DVDs if you decide to stay in one day and they will even give you fresh popcorn :) they also have computers in the lobby with printers if you need it.  Not to mention they have shuttles that will take you back and forth to and from the strip, busses pass every hour.  The strip isn't too far from here I'd say about 10mins max and if you're going to use an uber it isn't expensive at all.  I didn't notice children or families that stayed here so it was pretty quiet which is a plus for me.  Definitely come and check this place out you will not regret it and don't forget to say hi to the sweet older Hispanic lady that serves you breakfast in the mornings, she'll definitely make your day!"
5,"Got a shellac manicure here a few weeks back and my nails STILL look amazing! They lasted about 3.5 weeks before I had them redone, and could have still lasted longer! Definitely coming back."
5,"I recently moved to the East Coast and have been to Idolize 3 times.  There threading services are fast and efficient and the prices are great.  The ladies that have threaded for me are nice, quick and thorough.  I will continue to visit Idolize on a regular basis and you should too!"
5,"Phenomenal! I used to come here for the oysters when it was Todd English but popped back to listen to some live music and get a quick snack.  I am trying to eat healthier so I was so pleased with the choices. I had my oysters and added the avocado toast.  I could have eaten 6 portions!! THE. BEST.   Peter Love was singing and playing guitar. Really great experience and so easy to get to, considering it is center Strip. I am thinking of going back again for breakfast today!!"
5,"Long story short, AJ at Shine fixed what a horrible stylist butchered.  A nightmare color experience turned into the color of my dreams.  I thought I would be out hundreds of dollars to fix it, but it was only $95 for the fix, $25 for the toner, and $15 for a deep conditioning treatment.

Thanks AJ!"
5,This was my first time coming here and I'll definitely come back! Shree was great and consulted with me during the entire process. Also really great Is that on Mondays and Tuesdays eyebrow threading is 25% off. I'll definitely be back and really love the overall service and environment of the place!
5,"I love the convince and high quality service at Idolize! No appointments necessary means that I can swing by any time I'm in the area with my wild eyebrows and get a quick thread. I'm always in and out in under 30-minutes, even when there's a line. It's usually more like 15-minutes if no one else is waiting. 

They do a good job with my eyebrows which I admittedly let get out of control frequently. I don't like my eyebrows to be super thin and haven't ever had to tell them to respect the thickness. They've always followed the natural shape, just cleaning things up a bit. 

Check out their great loyalty card program, too. After every 7-visits, you get a free threading service (valued at $12). I've already racked up 3 visits and will likely hit lucky number 7 sooner rather than later."
5,"Had my 2018 Camry tinted today, great customer service.
He explained everything , my car was done in about 2 1/2 hours. Looks great!  Great price!"
5,"Very clean, very nice, very busy also. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the crew working their magic."
5,"Oh man. After my girlfriend came here and highly recommended it, my hubby and I decided to chance it. We did not sit at the hibachi; instead we did the sit-down with the regular menu. There are so many options and the portions are not small!  We ordered coconut shrimp(delightful), the spider roll (large crab!  Need I say more?), and hubby got samurai steak and I got scallops. The servers are cheerful and have amazing customer service. The only pitfall was the noise level, but it's a busy restaurant, so if you don't mind the noise, you'll enjoy it. The ambiance is refreshing."
5,"I've been to Jimmy Hula's several times and I really love the atmosphere and food. Their Hawaiian theme is all about beaches, surfing, and kickin' back - which is what I dig about Hawaii. Love the teriyaki tacos and burgers -yum! A nice casual place with great food and excellent, friendly service. The upholstered high-back seats are so comfy!"
5,This place blows away the place that has a Panda as their logo.  The food is fresh and delicious.  As an added bonus your meal is available in 3 different sizes.  The place is really clean and the service here is exceptional.  I'll be back often.
5,"I had a fantastic first experience with Sumo and having Hibachi. First, I'm allergic to fish and they took care of my plate in the kitchen. I'm usually not supposed be near fish when it's cooking, but they cooked it so quick and it was entertaining! 

I had the Sumo Punch literally felt like I was back in the Bahamas it was refreshing. 

I had the shrimp roll and crab rangoon. There wasabi was the bomb diggity!! Had me tearing up and clearing allllll the nasal passages. 

The sexy sauce was delicious and creamy!! I will definitely be back!!!"
5,Great customer service and the work was great. Second time getting any vehicle tinted and this experience was hands down the best I've ever had. Don't waste time and come here first.
5,"Loved the eyebrow threading!  I tried this place after seeing a Groupon for it and needing to find an eyebrow shaping place closer to home.  This was my first time trying threading versus traditional waxing.  I will never go back to waxing.  It was less painful, quicker, more precise and less expensive.  Sejal did an excellent job!"
5,"Just leased a house with OnQ and everything has been so fast, east, and awesome. Been working with Kim. She is very friendly, fun, and efficient. The office is in a good location, very clean, and modern. Lease signing is done electronically which is very convenient and payments can be made online! Very excited to work with OnQ"
5,"I had the great pleasure to experience an a mazing steakhouse and you should try it as well. 
Recommend it to all.

David .B"
5,I love idolize! Couldn't imagine going anywhere else for my eyebrows or to anyone else but Sejal she's the best!!
5,"My favorite place to stop for breakfast burritos on the way to work.  Lots of choices for your add-ins, and the salsas are tasty. 

Great friendly service is a bonus."
5,"I ordered a pickup for lunch. When I entered the manager and the other woman upfront greeted me by name and had everything ready with sauces, napkins, etc.  I've been to a lot of places for pickup and the majority of the time I have to wait and I'm never greeted by name.  I've tried some of the food already and everything has been good so far. I tried the avocado (haven't had Vivas) but this was excellent and had a perfect balance of seasoning.  I spent $20 (got the whole chicken) and the experience and food have better than places you spend $75 for dinner at."
5,I am visiting from out of town and had the opportunity to experience this delicious establishment. The food was so fresh and yummy. I love the concept of being able to personalize each item to each individual liking. I found the staff to be extremely friendly and accommodating as well. I love that Pittsburgh is bringing in fresh healthy foods and able to keep up with the current trends. I will definitely be back.
5,Super bomb!!!! Great addition to the Asian part of Arizona. LOL. Watch out boba tea house you've got neighbors down the plaza!
5,Food was great and Audrey is awesome!! We will definitely be back and make sure to check out music bingo on Friday!
5,"We came here tonight with my family and my 5 month old baby. I learned my lessons in the past during holidays I never think of making  reservations, we usually end up in the waiting list or struggle looking for another restaurant. Since I have a baby, I got smarter I always check the location online and make a call. It's labour holiday so I know it would be crowded as usual in almost all of the restaurants in Toronto/GTA(When you live in the city always expect busy, crowded, and small space on holidays or weekends). I called in the morning to make a reservation for 6pm dinner I told them I have a baby too. 
We got there 10 mins before 6pm we we're seated by the host right away. She's very nice, friendly, and attentive(she wears contact lense just a heads up and thank you too for her service). Even though she was extremely busy, as a lot of people we're waiting to be seated, she was very quick, after we sat, she took our order of foods as soon as we're ready. Also, thank you for the extra space for our stroller we got a very good family spot my baby was happy and extremely excited(he was screaming on the top of his lungs until my fiance put him to sleep lol). The service is awesome, I went here once before with one of my close friends she brought me here to have dinner as well last year, we had a good experience. 
Their food is good. We ordered vermicelli noodles seafood, szechuan beef spicy, fried rice with pork, eggs, sausages in it, fried squid spicy(highly recommended!), regular soup with drop egg, and chilli turnip(very crispy! Highly recommended as well, under the side orders). 

If you are a big group, I suggests to make reservations if you don't want to wait to be seated for dinner as this location is extremely busy. Otherwise, it's still good on a regular days. I would definitely come back here again and try the other food they have probably on the side orders, I struggled looking for sweet and spicy side orders which I thought was the chilli turnip but it wasn't. If you tried a sweet and spicy side order please leave me a suggestion. Thanks."
5,"I have been a client of Marilyn Miller for so many years, I can't even count.  She is a fantastic color stylist and I have never been disappointed.  It's not cheap, but I wear my hair every day, so I think it's money well spent!"
5,I've use them for both my rental property and to purchase a property and they have the best service around!  I've also referred them to a few friends who were very happy with them as well
5,"Very friendly staff, and very helpful with what would be best for my car. They are very quick and very efficient. They got my car done a lot quicker than they said it would take. I would highly recommend them to everyone who wants window tinting done right and with a lifetime warranty."
5,"Fantastic fresh food!!! We were very impressed with the friendly staff and the delicious ingredients. The ordering process is kiosk style, and was easy to use.  
The restaurant was clean and the salads we ordered were delicious!"
5,"Was looking for a new lady to do my brows since leaving Atlanta. 

FOUND HER! 


She's quick and very gentle. I normally dread getting threaded, especially if it's been a while but she's definitely careful enough not to hurt you in the process!

I'm very picky about the way my brows are shaped, and she's earned my repeated business!"
5,"I think this is a great hotel to stay for business! I've stayed here on two separate occasions. The rooms were clean and bright.  The staff is extra friendly and will do whatever they can to accommodate your needs. Marcus at reception called several area businesses for me so that I could get an appointment. The hotel exceed my expectations.

They offer a free airport shuttle and a free shuttle to the strip. 

The breakfast could be a little fresher and less canned but it is free so you really can't complain much."
5,"A pedicure with Mari was absolutely amazing! She was gentle, thorough, and kind. As a college student it was in my price range and I feel as though I got my money's worth! I was so relaxed I almost fell asleep! I'm also a picky person when it comes to pedicures and I was very satisfied!"
5,"This place is awesome!!!! Really really good food with a lot to choose from so many people can be happy and you can go back a lot and try new things. 

I had the char grilled quest fresco bowl- amazing! Really good sauces to go with it too. Fiancé had the chargrilled steak plate and is still talking about it. 

To top it all off the vibe is amazing and the service was incredible. The owners were so sweet and walking around talking to folks. 

We didn't go to the rooftop bar because it was cold but I will definitely be enjoying that this spring summer. 

Highly recommend. If you've just walked by before - like we did for months- go in!!! Support a local business and enjoy"
5,"Dined in and ordered out at least 4x now since the opening. Lots of flavor on the menu and something for everyone especially for both our kids under 3. Love the renovation of the space; fits the neighborhood and the outdoor area and bar will be a great additional spot to go once the weather gets warmer. It's not like Viva Chicken since you have more meats, sides and most importantly, booze. My favorite is the sweet corn casserole!"
5,This restaurant is very good. I enjoyed my meal very much. Thanks ribs are totally rad. Make sure you get extra rib sauce. Staff are very professional. Can't wait to come back.
5,"This place is amazing!

The atmosphere, the people, the food...all exceeded my expectations by far.  

Looking forward to visiting again."
5,"Oh wow. This place is AMAZING. I came straight here after Lala Lashes did a piss poor job threading my eyebrows, lip and chin. Bhumi here took my right away and was AGAST at how Charryse at Lala lashes literally did a terrible half-ass job but charged exorbitantly. 

I just moved from out of town and now found my go-to woman! Bhumi, you are the best!"
5,"I dined here January 10th for a birthday and it was divine. We ordered the table side ceaser salad, steak Neptune & espresso/Irish coffee. 

Where do I start? The actual restaurant is in the shape of an octagon (hence the name) and has a very romantic ambiance to it. Chandeliers, statues, stained glass, lanterns on the table, dark & cherry stained wood - it was beautiful. You have no option but to use the complimentary valet and coat check. I admit, it was a nice touch, although I'm sure if you don't want you coat checked you can refuse.

When you're seated, water, fresh garlic bread and an appy tray is placed in front of you, on the house. Pickles, olives and pickled peppers - yum. The garlic bread is served warm with fresh pieces of minced garlic spread all over. The ceaser salad (as I'm sure you've read) is unlike any other. It's made in a large wooden bowl right beside you by your server. The ceaser dressing had just enough garlic and flavour, it wasn't overpowering at all - if you've been reading any of my reviews, you know I'm all for the spicy ceaser dressing. The steak... how do I even capture it's beauty in words? The steak Neptune is a 8oz filet mignon topped with crab, asparagus and hollandaise sauce with your choice of side. It's served with three mushrooms as well. I asked for the sauce on the side and was amazed at how much REAL crab is actually placed on the steak. It must have been 5-6 legs, honestly. Along with the three crunchy asparagus spears, it was heavenly. Finally, the dessert. The espresso was good, nothing to rant and rave about but the Irish coffee is where it's at! Flames, fresh whipped cream, toasty coffee... mmm, mmm, good! 

In total, our bill came to $215, tip and tax included. The ceaser was $15/person, steak $50/each (we both got the Neptune), dessert was $15 total I believe and wine/beer was about $20-$25.

Jim & Tom helped us out that evening and made the experience great. When we asked for butter and more water, they came like 'that' *snaps finger*. It felt like they just waited for you request; they were at your beckoning call.

If you're on the fence about going, please just do it. It will be worth it and you will regret nothing. After reading some of the reviews, I was worried I'd feel rushed. That certainly was not the case.

My one and only gripe is the lack of female servers here. The only female I saw employed on a Saturday night was the lady at coat check."
5,Discovered this place online to try out some new boba places and I'm ecstatic that I got to try them today! I ordered a soursop smoothie which was delicious. I was very excited to find soursop as an option because I haven't had it since I visited Florida. The lady at the counter who's name I didn't get was very friendly and welcoming. She told what the shops specials were and was very helpful. I for sure will be coming back.
5,This is a great company!! I have gone through 3 property management companies in the past few years. I have had so many bad experiences I was beginning to loose hope on relying on a management company. I was thinking I was going to have to try to manage the 20 properties I own on my own. Thankfully I met with the owner Eric and he went over their Bussines plan and how it will work for me and my situation. It has been 6 months they have met all my expectations they are amazing.  Don't hesitate to go with this company they are great!!!!
5,Always good service and great food! I am a regular here and the staff are always so friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place.
5,"Wow! Wow! Wow! Definitely not the least expensive place in town to get a men's haircut, but you get what you pay for and they are true professionals here at shine salon! James is amazing, I've never been to a place where they take so much time and focus on perfection. One of the biggest perks I found about this salon is that there is in a hidden agenda at all. At other places I have always got a feeling that they are constantly trying to push products on you and our sales oriented. This wasn't the case there, everyone was focused on giving a great haircut and educating me on my hair rather than trying to just push products on me and get me in and out. I've learned a great deal from working with James and I plan to continue to return to shine salon. I finally found ""my guy"""
5,We were having an maintenance issue with our toilet valve. Michele at On Q Property Management was very attentive and did her best to get our bathroom up and running before the holiday. Mammoth maintenance could not fit us in before Labor Day but the day after they were here between 11-1.  I continued to communicate to Michele via email and she always answered me right back. Our bathroom is up and running and all is well. Thank you On Q for solving our problem so efficiently and quickly.
5,"I am so grateful to have Honeygrow in Pittsburgh-
They have made having a quick, HEALTHY dinner 
possible for me and my husband.  The produce is fresh, the place is very clean and the staff is AWESOME! Elena and the entire staff welcome every customer as they enter and thank them for coming as they go-  Just so friendly and professional!  The only negative is that parking can be a little tough but it is TOTALLY worth driving around a few times for a space."
5,"Fantastic place to stay if you don't want to, or can't afford to, stay on the Strip.  I was here for a week in a 1 bedroom unit on the 2nd floor facing the pool.  The unit includes a small but pleasant balcony with a table and two chairs.  The one bedroom has a pull-out couch, full kitchen, bathroom with 2 vanities, and plenty of closet space!  Perfect for 1 or 2 people.  I found the unit to be very large, clean and comfortable.    

The facility itself is GREAT and the staff THE BEST!!!!  I couldn't have been more pleased.  The pool area is very nice, surrounded by palm trees and has two pools, a large hot tub with waterfall feature, a putting green and BBQ grills for guest use.  Just off this area is a small fitness room.  The lobby is large and includes an area where you can purchase snacks and drinks.  

Breakfast is complimentary and consists of bagels, muffins, apples, oranges, juice and coffee.  Simple but a nice amenity.  The best amenity the Tahiti offers is their shuttle!  Runs once per hour back and forth to the Strip, dropping off and picking up at both the Tropicana and the Mirage.  Also, they will take you to the grocery store 3 or 4 mornings per week, a huge bonus if you don't have a car.  And you can sign up for free trips to Red Rock Canyon and Downtown Las Vegas.  Really nice. 

But what ensured this to be a 5 star review was the staff.  EVERYONE was SO kind and helpful, from the front desk staff, to the concierge, to the shuttle bus drivers.  The concierge really went out of his way to get us on the Red Rock Canyon tour after someone canceled.  

I HIGHLY recommend the Tahiti resort for the best in Off-Strip accommodations."
5,"After having a less than stellar experience at a popular local salon chain, I've been maintaining my fine--yet rather abundant--blah brown hair at home.  The reviews for Shine here on Yelp! (several of which mention Mark specifically) convinced me to make an appointment.  MARK IS MAGICAL:  with full balayage highlights, the aforementioned blah brown is now fabulously multi-dimensional with layers of amber, caramel, and honey. I'm kicking myself for not taking a selfie outside once I left yesterday afternoon so that I could share it here!  I will update...  He also shaped my hair into a textured, clavicle length wob/lob (IDK what the precise terminology would be here...); I can't stop swishing my hair because it MOVES and has that ever elusive volume that us fine haired ladies covet.  Seriously, I may give myself whiplash.  It is a testament to Mark's expert eye and hands.  He listens, adjusts, and fine-tunes until it is perfect!  I am a client for life!

To speak to the salon as a whole, it is spotlessly clean, and I love the funky and stylish decor.    I am also a sucker for old homes, so that's a plus.  Major props for featuring local artists on their walls!  Every other staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful.  Something else that stood out:  no one, Mark included, tried to upsell me to death with products.  Mark suggested specific products to me because I asked and then did not assume that I would or needed to purchase all of them.  Regardless, out of the four Mark recommended, I purchased three.  I appreciated how even the ladies at the front desk didn't commit assumicide by giving me a total that automatically included all the products and instead supported me in making a decision based on my product needs and my budget.  Very classy.  It is so refreshing not to get the hard sell!  I've had visits to salons in the past where my bliss bubble was popped by such tactics at the end of the service.  

So yeah--just call Shine and ask to book an appointment with Mark already."
5,One of the best buying experience ever. I spent 30 years training sales people. Have to say Kevin rymer is the best. Very honest and product knowledge was exceptional. Will send all my friends to Kevin. His store is on village pkway in gilbert.
5,"I love this place.  The food is inexpensive, well prepared, fresh and the portions are generous.  The location is not great, you wouldn't expect a place this good in a strip mall with a Del Taco.  I have had the fish tacos, carne asada, chorizo breakfast burrito and they are all good.  The salsa bar is loaded.  The staff is friendly and ready to help."
5,Sandi did a great job with my hair. She came up with some great ideas for me This is a very nice salon and everyone is so friendly.
5,"The food was perfect-we bought a mix of several meals to sample-fish tacos, cheese enchiladas, carne asada fries, carne asada taco, chicken taco. Generous portions, affordable prices for your wallet, and I got everything to go and they had all of my food cooked and ready to go in 10 minutes-you can't complain with that great timing. I will definitely be back."
5,"So happy to find a salad place in Pittsburgh! Their salads are delicious, as are the stir fry options. We just went on their third day open in Pittsburgh. The service was fast and helpful, and they have a great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"
5,"We popped in for breakfast burritos while running errands. Delicious chorizo & egg burrito; hubs liked his ""hash"" burrito (egg, cheese, sour cream, hash browns, bacon & sausage). The gentleman was so nice he made fresh coffee for me too. Clean, delicious little restaurant. Great find."
5,came by this place randomly and was very pleased with my dessert! a whole bunch of matcha goodness! will be back !
5,"We walked in at 6:40pm on a Saturday - everyone looked up and stared - until someone at the counter finally said, ""can I help you?"" I said we were here for a mani-pedi and asked if they had time for walk-ins. They brightly said, ""sure!"" and got a couple of chairs ready right away. 

It wasn't until later I realized they close promptly at 7pm, and I felt like a big jerk!! I was grateful they took us in, since we were looking forward to our pedis all day and went out of our way to get here. The managers ended up staying an hour past closing to make sure my mani was perfect and completely dry before walking out the door. 

Our technicians spared no effort in making sure our pedis were soothing, enjoyable, and detailed. Competition must be fierce since we were seated in upgraded massage chairs, and offered water, soda, or a glass of wine to go with our pedis. The basic pedi package for $32 comes with a leg massage and paraffin wax treatment. In my experience at other places, the wax treatment is usually extra, so I've never had the chance to experience it until now!

The ambiance is really fun and relaxing -- they had some colorful lights, a chandelier, and beautiful polished counters -- this would be a great place to take a wedding party or spa date.

Their attention to detail, warm staff, and above all their perks for the price, make this place worth the drive from campus. Other than feeling like a jerk customer for arriving close to closing, it was the best mani-pedi experience I've had in recent memory. 

P.S. They take card, but appreciate cash. Starting next year, they'll have a $1 credit card charge."
5,"I saw their sign from the store accross the street.  Good signage out front let me know exactly what I needed to know.  Came in and was greeted by clean and comfortable  waiting area with at least a 40 inch TV and two nice couches.  Coffee and bottled water included free.  Very professional quick service, was able to beat the time estimate of two hours by a few minutes, impressive especially considering I was a walk in without an appointment.  Straight forward pricing for quality tint.  Will recommend to friends!"
5,Fast service. Seated right away. Got our drinks. Ordered. Salads came right out. Food out within ten minutes of being seated. Food tasted great! Friendly server. Great experience. Definitely go back again soon!
5,Audry was delightful in my fist visit to Coaltrane's. Showed us around the place and treated us to great drinks as well. Definitely recommend to anyone new to the Midwood neighborhood as well as the residents. Service from everyone was A1!!!
5,"I actually just signed up with this company so will post an update in a several months.  I just wanted to share out a few points that made this company stand out.  The sales agent, Josh, was enthusiastic, as expected.  Every company in AZ has a positive sales agent to talk to owners.  But his availability, flexibility, and willingness not to push was helpful.  He offered every piece of information I asked for, in some cases more than once.  I found the owners story and concept refreshing and will have to see if it's realized.  As I researched, I realized the key team members in the office handle both owner and tenant complaints- so I made call to see if I would get an answer.  Michelle answered; this was a turning point.  Many companies save money by having an answering machine and email confirmations for service; no personal touch.  I asked a range of questions and she patiently answered all of them and convinced me she truly cares about me and my investment (and the future residents of my property).  I work with other mangers but Michelle was a ""steal"" when they hired her.  If the rest of the team conducts themselves as she does, I will be very satisfied and will say so in future update.  I've had some poor experiences with management and some good ones.  I am cautiously optimistic that this may be the best value management company in the Phoenix metro area.   Look for an update in spring 2015."
5,"I came with a large group to celebrate a school graduation of a friend. After a wonderful hibachi meal, I will be back soon. Herman was a great and entertaining hibachi chef who made the experience extra special. The fried rice was perfectly seasoned and had just the right amount of egg in it. I ordered filet mignon and chicken, both of which tasted excellent with the assortment of cooked vegetables. The lobster and scallops others in my party had were sensational as well. There was a wonderful variety of vegetables with the proteins, but the amount of onions was a bit high. The salad was good, but the star was the ginger dressing. I put some of the leftover dressing on my chicken, which wonderfully enhanced the flavor. The onion soup served prior to the hibachi show was just okay. The banana berry smoothie I ordered was fresh and had the ideal amount of fruit flavor. The kids with me enjoyed the large skinny glasses that the smoothies were served in, as well as the whipped cream on top. In addition, the raspberry white chocolate cheesecake was full of delicious raspberries and the chef even put sprinkles on for the occasion. I will definitely be back to try other menu items!"
5,Needed to get a tint ASAP and they gave me exactly what I needed. Very helpful! Thank you!!!
5,"I have been coming to Ricardo's Mexican food for years just got on Yelp and had to share how amazing this place is every time I come dine or take out! Consistent and amazing food, also theirs sauce is the best!!!"
5,I love going to Denny's whenever I want something inexpensive but not fast food. I normally go to this location for lunch. I've always had great service. Food is cooked just right and the staff is friendly.
5,"This place is the best. The employees are friendly and enthusiastic, the place is clean, the food is great, and the price is great. They are also gluten free friendly"
5,I have been very impressed with On Q's maintenance service. It has been so nice to have a one-stop shop for repairs of every kind. Their online estimating and payment portal is very cool and makes it easy to tackle what seemed initially to be a lot of work. They have built a team of solid contractors to handle every aspect of getting a house ready for market. Highly recommended.
5,I always go to idolize. Every time I have a great experience with great results! Monday's they offer 10% off!
5,"This is one of my new favorite restaurants to visit! We came here for lunch and were greeted by a welcoming hostess who took us to our table right away. Our friendly waitress came to our table shortly after and took our drink & appetizer orders. The restaurant is a newly remodeled place, and they did a spectacular job! Very beautiful and eclectic. The menu has something for everyone on it. I wanted to try everything lol....so many apps and different things to choose from. Our drinks and appetizers were very good. The presentation for both was beautiful. The main course for lunch was just as excellent and tasty! 

I will be returning in about a month for my birthday party with a group of about 18 people. The hostess was very helpful in taking my reservations, and even recommended a private room for us. Looking forward to sharing this gem with my friends and having a good time at the hibachi dinner!"
5,"I have heard that my review was pulled down and I would like to know why. Thanks.

Now I see that it is no longer there but it shows in my reviews. What is up? I do not work for Spencer's (never have)."
5,"Was finally able to check this place out. Parking is your standard East Liberty headache but can't fault them for that. The restaurant space itself is really nice, very clean and plenty of tables. Ordered from a kiosk, was a pretty simple process. I created my own stir fry bowl. Ordered chicken, egg noodles, plenty of veggies/garnishes and the red coconut curry sauce. Not much of a wait at all and the bowl was great, everything seemed very fresh. For $9, it was a pretty good size. They have their own unique fountain drinks, would've preferred Diet Coke over their ""Diet Mexicane Cola"" but no big deal. Will definitely be back to try something else."
5,I enjoy ILA she is the best one there! I get compliments everywhere I go because her work is so good and precise.
5,"Ive been threading for some years now and when I moved to Charlotte I needed someone to trust. Idolize was my best stop in Charlotte. Ive been going to the University location for about 2 years and Pernali has always performed magic on my eyebrows and chin as I suffer from a case of facial hair. The good thing about threading is the hairs don't grow back for a while so its a procedure that lasts, unlike waxing, shaving or any other nonsurgical technique. 

Both locations are clean and have a professional staff. The University location can get a bit crowded but its for a good cause. Monday and Tuesdays are always busy days because of the specials they run but every time you go, you can use your rewards card which comes in handy after the 7th use.  

When I went to the Dilworth location, Ila, who is also the area manager, was extremely courteous and professional and slayed my eyebrows to perfection and all I did was show her a photo. 

I would highly recommend going to either location but ask for Pernali or Ila! They are awesome! Its money well spent."
5,"If you are looking for delicious dessert drinks in the area, this is the place to be. I have not had any drink that I did not like. My favorite is any of them that has coconut, taco or red beans in it. If you are adventurous, you can also try Durian smoothies. If you don't want to try anything crazy, they also have ice coffee. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something new."
5,"We booked this hotel on accident, when booking through Hotels.com the reservation agent told us this was the location closer to the strip.When we received our confirmation we didn't realize there were several locations so close. 
We showed up and were disappointed being this wasn't the hotel we thought we booked. So, tired from the drive we didn't want to hassle and decided to stay. 
It wasn't too far from the strip and they do offer a 24 hour shuttle service which was awesome.
 We booked the Studio Suite for not much more then a regular room and were very satisfied. It was roomy, very clean, and the bed was SUPER comfortable. Our whole stay, 3 days, there was not one problem, the staff was more that helpful and friendly at that. Their breakfast in the morning was better than expected for being free. 
Juices, pastries, coffee, cereal.....we got to mingle with a few other people staying in the hotel and learn about a few new places to check out. 
My only complaint for the stay was that where our room was, the room above us with quite noisy. I told my BF that it must be a storage room or something because the amount of thumping was ridiculous and lasted throughout the night.
 It didn't bother us too much, but if I were staying there on business I would have totally called the front desk. All in all our stay was a success. We didn't mind being a bit further from the strip, we didn't have to deal with crowded parking structures or traffic or all the hoopla to get to our room. 
You should definitely consider this alternative for a very nice, clean, convenient, and reasonably priced hotel when looking into visiting Vegas."
5,"Soo good!
We came in for breakfast and got the beef brisket hash! Delicious.... Plus our waiter Carlos was so great and nice!!!
I'm a foodie so TRUUUSSSTTT ME. 

Disregard any negative reviews... Come to this place especially if your staying at MGM"
5,"I had my windows tinted here and when the job was complete there were some white patchy spots around the dot matrix (little black dots) located at the top of my rear window. Lucio explained that some imperfections were common in the dot matrix area. I left the shop, did some research and found that Lucio wasn't BSing me. Indeed imperfections are quite common in the dot matrix area. Anyhow, I wasn't completely satisfied, so I called Lucio back the next day and expressed my concern. He stated that his goal was to ensure that I was happy. He immediately scheduled me for the following day. They redid the rear and it looked great. I would highly recommend these guys if your looking for a shop that provides excellent customer service and stands behind their work.

Than you Lucio and Tint Express."
5,"Go see lucio at the front desk, super polite and professional, he'll give you upfront pricing, great work on my wife's fusion, thanks for the business!"
5,"Walked right in! She was very nice and efficient. I was in and out in just 5 minutes.

She offered lotion to soothe my skin, and did a great job at ""cleaning up my brows"". I will definitely be back!"
5,I found my new spot... I ordered the Vietnamese coffee blended. Delicious and delivered a big kick!! Service was super friendly and the place is immaculate.
5,"I had the Hawaiian burger- forget the name of it, but it was juicy and full of flavor. Lots of beef. The fries were exceptional. They had a spicy Rubin them that was wonderful. Our waitress was pleasant, fast and attractive.  I'll eat here again. Prices are right as well."
5,"I've been here 3 times now, twice for hibachi and once for regular dinner. All 3 times I was more than impressed. 

The hibachi chefs are friendly, and even if you only have a table of adults, they still put on a full show, which I can't say for every where. The prices are fairly standard, but I have to say that they give you more than most places, and the quality is high. 

The dinner menu is varied and what we ordered was delicious. Husband got the pineapple fried rice, served in an actual pineapple, and he was pleased beyond belief. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box and was pleased with the flavors. 

I've only had 2 of the sushi rolls, but I really liked both of them. I'll have to come back at a later point and focus on it."
5,"Soooo...not Todd English's place anymore which in all honesty isn't the worst thing in the world. Todd English's food was decent but all I ever really came for was nickel beer night back in the day. I'm a vegas local born and raised, and it's nice to go to a place right across they way from where I work that has awesome pub food. The menu has a lot of great options (try the beet salad and the lobster roll) as well as some friendly staff. My coworkers and I have come here quite a few times for lunch and have never been disappointed. I tell all my clients!"
5,Awesome Chè and Vietnamese coffee drinks! Fruit Addict is a must try and even better it's dairy free! Love the fresh coconut and lychee in it. Service is super friendly and very clean!
5,Haven't had a food crush like this in a long time.  Came here last night and again today.  Loved the Che #1 ordered it without added sugar and the fresh coconut juice had enough sugar for me.  Just asked them to come to Tatum and Shea area but not sure that will happen!  Happy drinking fellow Yelpers!
5,"Best customer service in town this includes purchases and any other issues that might come up with the products they sell.  My ice maker went out and called the store to ask who they would recommend.  I thought they'd just give me a name and phone number but that was not the case.   They looked up my account -- told me my extended warranty was still good and the repair would be paid for under the warranty.  Got a call back from the repair office and repair will be done this week.  You can call me a ""satisfied customer"" -- service was fast and right on point.  These folks are great and know how to keep customers."
5,"Marilyn is the best colorist! I would recommend her for brown or blonde hair. I personally have brown hair.  She can do highlights on brown hair and they actually grown in great and look natural. 

I have gone to so many colorist but none of them listen and actually do what I want with my color. She is caring, skilled and good. I am happy to have found her!!"
5,"Not only is the food AMAZING, the staff is AWESOME! I'm from Cali here for Spring Training and I would recommend coming here before hand!"
5,"Went here on Christmas because we didn't want to cook at home, and we were definitely impressed because we all ordered hibachi! I got lobster, filet mignon, and scallops cooked that way, and all $39 were worth it! In addition, there was soup, ginger salad, fried rice, vegetables, and an excellent entertainer cooking the food! He was very deft in his abilities and was funny (he made jokes about the food) and if you don't like cooking on Christmas, go here for yumminess!"
5,This is my second stay at Tahiti. They've done nothing but get better since visiting 7 years ago. My wife and I have four kids and we have been very comfortable in the ample space. There have been a couple of cold nights so we've really enjoyed the hot tub with the waterfall.
5,"Honestly wasn't expecting much. Stuffed avocado was really good, it's a meal on its own. The wings are some of the best wings/sauce I've had in Charlotte, better or comparable with most of the best wing/bbq joints. 

The steak entree/ sandwich was also very good. I was expecting a knock off of Viva chicken but it's different and tasty."
5,"I love this place as you can walk in without an appointment, it's super quick, reasonably priced, and they do a great job. There is ample parking and you can be in and out in about 15 minutes."
5,"Went here after my graduation and wow! Was it perfect. They allowed us to take up the space upstairs for my semi large party and our waiter/ bartender Aubrey was so helpful and perfect! I would recommend this place to anyone who asks! 

Sweet corn and the mashed potatoes were so delicious!"
5,I live around the corner and alway order for pick up. The food is decent ant always consistent in quality. They are fast and always have my order ready in 10 minutes.  The staff is always pleasant and the service is great. Prices are very reasonable.
5,"I went in to dine with my family today, and it was beyond amazing! My carne asada burrito was spectacular, and my whole family loved their plates too, will come back again !"
5,"Ila is wonderful. I love this location. Ila is always very gentle and I definitely recommend visiting here if you like perfection. After all, they are dealing with your face... you should expect nothing less."
5,"I've been going to Shine Salon since November, Shane is my stylist.

Previously, I was a Supercuts trim every 8 wks or so type but at 30, I had to start dying my greys. I've never died my hair or processed it, so coloring my hair was a huge step for me. Some girls get anxiety over cutting off 6 inches... I had anxiety over messing w my natural color. 

Shane was great - she sat down and talked w me during a consultation to find out my normal routine and maintenance. She decided to start out w a glaze and work up to a full color, which was perfect. Even now, every appt she makes sure things are working out and if I'm happy w the color. It's comforting to have a stylist that includes me in the decisions.

Shane nailed my natural color. Proof of the color match: I had been dying my hair for 6 months and was then a bridesmaid in a wedding, the hair stylist for the wedding remarked on my hair color and asked if it was dyed. I admitted that it was dyed to match my natural color... my best friend of 20+ years was floored that I had been dying my hair. She couldn't believe that I had been dying my hair b/c it was so similar to my natural color. In fact, NO ONE asks me if I've dyed my hair... although they always remark on my fabulous blow out....which is exactly how I want it :)

The salon itself is very hip and welcoming. The whole ""salon in a house"" feel is really warm and so much more laid back than the pretentious chain salons in the area. The prices are reasonable as well. They also have a great selection of hair products, I'm hooked on the L'Oreal Ultime conditioner mask. Oh, their in house ""Powerdose"" deep conditioner is really great add-on for my dry/coarse hair.

I would recommend this place for sure (I live 45 mins away and still make the trip) - all the employees are really professional and friendly, I always get a reminder call and they've been really helpful when I've asked to change appts."
5,"I was craving wings, so I gave their chipotle maple wings a try. They were amazing! Some of the best wings I have had in a while. I also tried their stuffed avocado. It was special. I have never had an avocado like that. It was super delicious and unique. This place is a new fav wing spot!"
5,"I'll be back! This place is the bees  bomb! 
I can't pick a favorite- it was ALL amazing  
We had the crack'd corn , fire  roasted avocado , Juan jovi  burger, wipeout , and the Johnny Utah ! 
The sides  and coleslaw were both on point too! And I'm picky about coleslaw 
You won't regret coming in to try this spot out! They've got great food, good music , and a fun atmosphere too! 
P.S. The rum Rita was a delightful treat too! 
(Sorry I was so excited to try it I didn't take any picks!)..... next time!"
5,"Wow I read a lot of reviews about this place and how  things are too salty or not enough salt and  not good enough compared to the luxurious Pei Wei.

Wow . It's Fast food and it was good. Pad Thai had unique recipe. It was a nice change from Pei Wei!"
5,I was so surprised by this place. I hate going anywhere that services cars. They are usually dirty and smelly. This place was super clean. A great waiting room with nice comfy couches and a very large TV. A very nice young man greater me and helped me pick out tint. He had such nice manners. That's always a great surprise these days. My Windows look great. I would recommend this place to everyone. Probably my best customer service experience in a very long time.
5,"I am always pleased when I come here! Everyone is great, especially Tom, and the quality of the acrylic nails is a lot better than most places!"
5,"I am very picky with my nails and i have found the best gel manicure at Lotus ('ve lived in SF and Chicago). I have had a few great techs, but I now always ask for andy. He is so meticulous and does as many coats to ensure thick shiny long lasting nails. It takes a little longer than other places with him bc he does such a great job. My nails last for 3-4 weeks so it is worth the money and time to go! I love this place for nails. I just wish it was closer to my house!"
5,"Delicious and fast! You order from a touchscreen and can customize your order however you want. For my first visit, I got the spicy garlic stir fry. Everything was fresh and the portion size was perfect. It only took about 10 minutes for our food to be ready. The staff is super friendly too! I can't wait to go back."
5,Pricey but the ingredients are unmatched. I don't mind paying more for something I'm VERY happy with. The young employees need to work on customer service skills but that's ok. The end product has no comparison. Thank you BAMBU.
5,"Great service! Called in the morning and was able to get the tinting done in the afternoon. Price was unbeatable and they honored my coupon too! Only took an hour and a bit to do the job, not that I minded waiting on their super comfy couches."
5,"I arrived at closing time. They were happy to make me an avacado smoothie. It was creamy smooth and delicious !!
Kimmie and Lee were super nice and told us about the Avacoffee and Che.   
I will be back soon !!"
5,"Ricardo's has some good food. I work from home and this is right around the corner from my house so I eat here about once a week. The enchilada sauce is not your typical enchilada sauce from the can. I don't know what it is but Ricardo's keeps me coming back! The staff is shy which doesn't bother me, and this place gets packed during lunchtime so beware!"
5,"My family really liked staying here for the three days we were in Las Vegas.  Clean, spacious room with good sound insulation.  We really enjoyed the great breakfast each morning.  Front desk folks were friendly and very helpful.  We would definitely stay here again."
5,"I thought it might be named after john Coltrane, and that it was gonna be a snooty jazz joint. But when I walked in they were playing ""Smooth"" by Santana (featuring Rob Thomas) and I was like, 'hell yeah' this is my new bar!"
5,I love this place. Any time we are anywhere nearby we make a trip here. The tacos are just the best and the people who work here are the coolest. Super fun vibe and great prices.
5,"I would like to compliment Ryon Genet and Michelle 
Tyler. 

They are always there to answer any questions that we have.

Great customer service.


Thank you, 
Dawn and Mark Packer"
5,"Amazing for Threading! 

I always get my threading done from here. I would recommend Illa for threading. 

I have very sensitive skin. I have never had such good experience for threading before. Your skin would never feel irritated after threading, it doesn't pain much too. Illa is super gentle. I have got done threading from many ladies in the past. She is the best in my experience. I have been going to her since months now. In Charlotte, she will be my go-to person for threading."
5,First time getting threaded and I absolutely love it! Don't know what I was scared of in the first place. I got both my eyebrows and upper lip done. The lip was painful but that is to be expected. The girl who did mine was very comforting and helpful. She went fast on the lip and I'm glad she did. In and out in a matter of minutes. I really appreciated the fact that she asked me what I wanted before just going at my eyebrows like most places I've been to. I am very picky about my brows and I would suggest this place to my friends!
5,Called to make an appointment and got in the same day. Job was done a just a few hours and looks perfect on my Aston Martin. They are by far the best price and best quality and will be back again.
5,The food is very good. My kids loved the noodles. We also tried yellow curry and butter chicken. Very yummy . I am glad to see some non franchise cuisine in the area.
5,Solid selection for a healthy quick meal. Their tuna salad is my go to especially when I'm trying to get some greens in my life. Order ahead for carry out as waits during peak times can sometimes be a bit.
5,"Delicious, cheap, addictive, what more could you want? It also has a nice family owned feel to it. I love their veggie burrito!"
5,"Love this place! We come here often, the food is always great, fresh and fast! Salsa is wonderful! Everything is always good here, it's like an awesome mix of a fast food place and an actual sit down Mexican restaurant."
5,"Every now in then I like to be reminded of my childhood and bring my little family here, we always come for breakfast and everytime it meets my expectations. The service is great and fast, coffee is constantly flowing. This location is great."
5,"Went here for some drinks on the patio on a Thursday night. Had great service from the bartender, Kayla. She was super personable and just the right amount of talkative. I got the stuffed avocado with chicken added. It was delicious and a great amount of food. Just what I needed for my night out on the town. Will definitely be returning!"
5,My daughter and I stopped in hoping for a little spa time together and were so happy we did. It was 11am and they took us right away. The atmosphere is fun and clean. They were very nice to my 7 year old and did a fabulous job on my pedi. I found the prices to be very competitive. A huge kudos to my tech who spend a long time on some lovely nail art only to have my daughter step on my foot and completely wreck it. She was lovely and very kind about it and fixed it perfectly.
5,"This place is awesome. I live around the corner and I've been trying to come at least once a week. Their menu is awesome, very unique items with something for everyone. The fish tacos are awesome, I love the killer with blackened fish. The bowls and burgers are great too. The management is great and cares about building the business too. Happy to have them so close to me. Thanks guys!"
5,Just getting into Honeygrow for many reasons. but a definite newfound fan of the product and service. A great nearby and healthy food option. Kudos to the Sunday evening crew for talking me through my first experience. Will definitely be a frequent customer
5,"So refreshing to get back home and walk to Coaltrane's for a quality, consistent & healthy food. Checkout Coaltrane's if you not already done so! They're a great neighborhood choice. Leave the car in the driveway and walk on up. Make Plaza Midwood the best walkable hood!"
5,"Great experience at honeygrow last night! Love the sesame ginger stir fry, the vegetables were cooked just right. Elaina always takes the time to chat a minute or two with us and ask about the food, which is much appreciated. Can't wait to go back!"
5,"Chicken was cooked to perfection. Great flavors. Large half chicken portion. Mashed potatoes were awesome with perfect amount of garlic. Great service, friendly people, great food. Will be back soon!"
5,"Clean and modern decor.   Great service, attentive and friendly staff.  Generous portion sizes and delicious good.  Chinese dishes better than the Thai fusion offerings."
5,"I was weary of going here because of other reviews, but I'm honestly not sure why people reviewed this place so badly. The lady who helped me did a fantastic job. She was polite, quick and allowed me to focus on work I was doing on my phone. She made sure she understood what I wanted and did a really great job. 

The salon was clean, there are lots of chairs available and they are fast. 

But if you're worried about it being busy, come early in the morning or make an appointment. They will take care of you well."
5,"Everything about this place screams ""Quality"". The store is beautiful. It's decorated in a way that is both classic and modern.  The staff is friendly and fast.  The menu is easy to understand.  The food is heavenly."
5,"My party of 6 visited this restaurant this evening.  Our reservation for dinner at one of the hibachi grills was for 7:00, and when we arrived at 7:00 we were immediately seated.  The parking lot was packed, and the place was busy.  Our server was attentive and accommodating.  The chef was great.  He cooked our meal, all the while putting on a fun show and making entertaining conversation.  The food was fantastic, and there was lots of it.  We were also pleasantly surprised at the prices, which were very reasonable.  In short, we all had a great time.  We will definitely be coming back to Sumo!"
5,This place always makes me feel like family. They also do an amazing job on my nails. Some of my favorite people are Mai and Danny. The decor is beautiful and I love the beverages. Every time I come here I leave feeling special. They are well priced and efficient. I highly recommend you try this place!
5,"I stayed here for 2 nights.  I was really impressed with the great customer service and overall cleanliness of the hotel and rooms. Every employee of the hotel that I encountered was very friendly. The room itself had everything I needed - big comfy bed, free Wifi, work desk, and large clean bathroom.  There is free breakfast served each morning and I was very pleased with the selection (not continental breakfast).  

The location is great especially if you need to stay close to the airport but can easily get to the Strip. Note that you can actually see the airport runway but the sound of landing planes never bothered me.  I also requested a late check out and was given one extra hour.  Overall I was very pleased with my stay.

I will definitely stay here again."
5,"Kim did it again, my prior tenant broke the lease and Kim found a tenant within two weeks !!! And the  new tenant signed a two year lease. Her customer service is outstanding, I never worry when my house is in her hands. Thank you Kim, you put my mind at ease!! You truly are the best!!!!!"
5,"I highly recommend this place if you're getting a tint. The tint prices range from $150-$600 being the best. I got the mid range one which is normally $200, but with the yelp deal I got it for $170 for 5 windows. Carlos, the guy who usually greets you upon entering was super helpful and explained each type of tint you could choose from. The higher end tint which was about $600 is a 3m tint that guaranteed no fading and a lifetime warranty. I choose the suntek mid range, which still included the warranty. 

The place gave us no hassle, and the waiting wasn't all that bad. It took about an hour and 45 mins, but I had an appointment so it was done as soon as I got there. No waiting, no hassle. As soon as I got it, there were minor imperfections but I brought it back the next week after the drying process and they were quick to fix it without any problem. 

There were hardly any bubbles in the tint, our tint looks amazing. If you ever need a good tint, this place does it real well."
5,"Great place to stay in Vegas. You can get a Hotel room anywhere in Vegas, what you are getting with this Resort is SERVICE.   Everyone at the Resort was so helpful.  Any problem or question we had was answered quickly and professionally.   We had an injury and they quickly provided us with a wheel chair and helped us rent a walker within minutes.  

We had a lost piece of luggage and the resort staff said go to you rooms and enjoy yourselves, let us deal with this and get your luggage for your.   Wow, so nice!   

Their maintenance staff provided excellent service also.  Even when it was our problem and not theirs.  

The rooms were perfect, the place was very clean, the location was great.  The Denny's beside the resort provided quick meals.  The park across the street was a nice change from the casino views."
5,"Relatively new facility with a real commitment to providing excellent customer service.  Staff is very friendly and always helpful.  The price is reasonable.  This Hampton Inn is very close to the LAS airport (and rental car facility).  The ""Las Vegas Strip"" is only about 15 minutes away.  I would certainly stay here again."
5,"Pleasantly surprised is an understatement! I was a little nervous to stray from the Red Rock, but wanted to be closer to the strip on this visit. The value on Hampton was unbelievable - I even ""splurged"" on a King Suite - and so was the entire experience!

The 2 ladies working my check-in shift (3 pm on Saturday) were awesome! Very friendly, helpful, and set a great tone for our entire visit. Check-in and -out were a breeze, and I felt like I was a VIP. :-) My BF went to the concierge at 2 am for a fork (he was able to microwave a Marie Callendar's frozen meal after midnight, and dammit if he was going to let anything get in his way) - he said the guy at the counter was amazingly friendly and nice - way to go, Hampton staff!

Room was spotless, all appliances are high-quality, bed is SUPER comfy, perfect AC (over 105 degrees this weekend!), refreshing pool area with towels, and OMG the complimentary breakfast was so good! Eggs, potatoes, ham, a waffle press, yogurt, cereal, pastries, juices, coffees...something for everyone and everything was great. They also have free coffee/tea in the lobby 24/7. 

This hotel is going above and beyond in providing high-quality service for an affordable price in a safe neighborhood. Only a 10-minute drive from the strip meant we didn't have to ditch our friends, and having a mini-kitchen in the room meant we saved some $$ from pricey Strip drinks. ;-) 

On my ""best"" list for future visits - glad we found this place when we did!"
5,"My experience at Shine was wonderful.  I called in for a haircut and made an appointment with Lisa, apparently a newcomer to Shine (but not, mind you, a newcomer to the business).  I've had a lot of bad experiences with salons and my thick, short hair so I tend to go to a salon once and never come back. Nonetheless, Lisa was super friendly and engaging.  I have very thick hair and she did an amazing job with thinning it out, and didn't get annoyed with the weight like many stylists have.  The haircut is easy to style when I'm in a time crunch but I can also put a little more effort into it and make it look more glam.  It's by far the best haircut I've had in years, and I will definitely be a returning customer."
5,"This place is amazing! Great, friendly service and fantastic food! Glad I found this when visiting the Charlotte area!"
5,The atmosphere was really relaxed and the drink I ordered was amazing. I'm definitely going back again.
5,"my name is steven i came into this place to get my tint done i was helped by a guy name lucio. 
lucio was so passionate about his job, took his job seriously, gave me a great quote, gave me some great suggestions. 
auto tint express did my tint after many quotes and im so please with the work that was done.
the work was professional with detail and care.
my car looks great the windows are so clean too. lucio and his crew are so clean they pride on cleanliness and organization.
everything that was promised was exactly what i received.

i highly recommend auto tint express for your tint needs.

thank you for your time

5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Hamptons Inn. I booked my flight and hotel through priceline and decided upon this hotel due to the 24/7 shuttle service, free breakfast, and free wifi. I'm just going to list this off because I have so much to say.

-Check in was quick & easy
-Rooms were spacious and clean. Furnished with a flat screen tv, sofa, large sink and bathroom area, closet with iron and iron board, king size bed
-I did not hear a single airplane while I was staying there, which surprised me considering how close we were to it
-Location wise is perfect. A bit off the strip and thank god away from all those nude cards, smoke, and casino smell
-Hotel itself was absolutely clean
-Staff was friendly & helpful. I even got a glimpse where they will joke and laugh with each other. A very homey feel.
-Breakfast was wonderful, consisting of: Waffles, Oatmeal, Eggs, Bacon, 5 different types of cereal, fresh fruit, coffee, tea, yogurt, three types of juices, bread, muffins, danishes, & croissant
-AC works perfectly and kept my room at 60degrees always. Since I'm from Washington the heat wasn't being very nice, haha.


The only thing and only thing I have to be disappointed about is the shuttle. I did get a good handful of free rides from it, but airport is priority for the shuttle and you need to think about traffic time and other guests that are in need of shuttle rides. Sometimes when I call they come when they say they will 10-15 minutes other times the most I have ever waited was 40 minutes. But my suggestion is that there's a bus that runs from the south end to the north end for 8 dollars a day and make sure you have back-up options. But I love the drivers and it's really a small detail for me that everything together, the whole package is there for me. 5 stars. Thank you Hamptons !"
5,"Went in not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised with the food. The Duke burger with Mac and Cheese was awesome as was the Wipeout taco, Johnny Utah and Teriyaki tacos were very good as well. Fries were a bit soft but tasted great. Service a little awkward but it was obvious she just hasn't had a lot of experience yet! It'll come. In the meantime, we live nearby and will happily frequent!"
5,"I like many others had purchased a Groupon for two dinners. I stopped in yesterday around lunch time. I was greeted by a friendly smile behind the counter at the pickup window. Since I had never been here before I told the young man I had a Groupon and he explained to me how it worked etc. There were several people standing around waiting for their food and just a few in the restaurant eating. 
I asked the young woman taking the orders what was good and she recommended the Cashew Chicken and also a Chicken /Curry dish. So I went with those two choices as well as a Black berry/ Jasmin Green Tea. My dinners were ready to go in about 5 minutes. 
Everything was delicious! Including the Blackberry tea! It was so refreshing on a hot day and went so well with the meal. I can't wait to try Wok Box again soon."
5,"We had a great experience shopping with Kevin Rymer! He showed us a great 4 piece, Frigidaire black stainless steel kitchen set with a price that can't be beat (about $2,000 total including delivery). We wouldn't hesitate to shop here and with him again again and will recommend it to all our friends and family."
5,They do an amazing job! I usually make an appointment and they are always on time. Their pedis are to die for! I have gotten a few of their specialty ones and they are totally worth it! I also get my nails done with Danny and he is very nice and does a great job.
5,Stopped in here while doing some shopping at Lee Lee's. Service and drinks were fantastic. I got a coffee made with their pressed coconut milk which was delicious. My boyfriend got a #10 (red taro) dessert drink. He could not stop raving about how good it was. The woman working the counter was super nice and fast with making our drinks. I would highly recommend giving this place try.
5,"I love this place. They do a great job on my nails, the atmosphere is hard to describe but very enjoyable, and they give me wine... Need I say more? 

They accept walk-ins and are well staffed. The staff are personable and talented. I've had my nails done by several different technicians and I'm happy to say they're all great!"
5,Had such a great experience with my purchase of a new washing machine.  Alan was awesome. He made the purchasing experience easy and fast.  Would strongly recommend Spencers to everyone in need of an appliance
5,This is a hidden secret in Pittsburgh.  Don't expect to walk through the door without being greeted before you are the whole way through the door.  Food is fantastic.  I'm a meat and potatoes guy but I really feel like the fresh produce and daily made sauces are what make Honey Grow stand out.  The menu is unique and always revolving which really invites you to step out of your comfort zone.  Managers Cynthia and Marisa always remember me by name which makes me feel special when I go in.  They keep a very clean restaurant and a very friendly staff.  If You haven't checked it out do it today!  Thanks Cynthia and Marisa for always making my lunch better than the rest!
5,"5 stars all the way for Robi! Its been a few months since the cut and its grown in so nicely, I haven't had a haircut I've loved this much in a very long time. Trusted Robi with chopping of a decent amount for a cute front angeled bob, and the results were amazing!"
5,First of all the resort has a nice entry way and we were greeted by the smiling receptionist.  Got our room key and parked in nice covered parking spot. The hallways were wide compared to other resorts we've stayed at. The rooms were specious and very clean. I know this because I wiped everything down before we settled in. And it was very clean!!!   Bed comfortable. Only downside is I wish lightening was better in the rooms.    The breakfast is what it says it is a continental breakfast.  I was fine and nice hot coffee. Definitely comin back.
5,"Clean, spacious, quite, and nice breakfast"
5,We had a 12 hour layover in Las Vegas and decided at the last minute to book a room so we had some place to be. Tiana at the front desk was so helpful in getting us into a room for early checkout and even at a discount holiday rate. One of the best customer service experiences of my life.
5,Love this hotel and the team! Whendy the GM is amazing and is super awesome! Hotel is near everything and has a great 25 hour shuttle. Fast internet and comfortable beds....
5,Amazing food. Very clear it is homemade and very flavorful. Owner was onsite and keeping things running smooth. Outstanding addition to Plaza Midwood.
5,"I noticed honeygrow had opened and it took me a while to get there. Glad I did. They make excellent food. Stir fry noodles that you choose the components and flavors you want. It's easy to order- they have a touch screen system, and the food is ready fast! 

They have a soda fountain that serves up organic soft drinks flavored with cane sugar. The Mexicola was great!!

I'm glad honeygrow is here and I hope they stay!!"
5,"Oh Yelper's - you did it again. This girl is happy!  I, too, like Katherine C. have major hair meltdowns when it comes to hair and hair not being ""did"" correctly! 

My do needed some major attention since it's not use to the weather/climate of the south. 

Got to the salon yesterday and was greeted immediately. I gentleman behind the reception desk made sure to greet both my mother and I. Mom went along for moral support as she understands I can go from zero to cry baby spoiled Latin pageant  bitch in 30 seconds when it comes to my hair. It's true, my mother had to hold me back once from strangling a hair dresser! 

So to the seat we were escorted, white wine offered, and then enter MARK -- what a cutey! Loved his energy immediately. But can this man who is just about to get intimate with my tresses find the spot... that spot of hair cut bliss. 

The consultation was very professional and key on. Mark new exactly what to do with my Angela Davis curl/frizz fro. He really worked it and looked at all levels of my hair -- there are different levels when it comes to curly hair... all those that have curly hair understands that no mans land in the back that does whatever the F it wants to. He then told me he'd discuss product recommendations and styling tips at the end of the cut. Wow - loved that he said that -- let's me know what to expect. 

Off to the wash... great wash job. Tresses squeaky clean.

Back to the chair... Mark, to me, was a little heavy handed when it came to combing, but I have a really sensitive scalp. But that wouldn't keep me from coming back. Once combed the cut began. Damn this man knows what the hell he is doing. At one point, he scared the hell out of me, he used a technique I never saw. I asked him what he was doing and he explained it perfectly. With curly hair, it needs to be cut a certain way to no look like a triangle of curls on a head. Mark really paid close attention to detail cross checking and all. Damn he's good. He also told me my hair will look great should I blow it out. 

Now the styling. I can't believe he asked me if I wanted to go curly or straight! Most hair dressers just ASSUME we want to go straight... NOT this girl... I like it messy. 

All those curly girls out there will understand this -- we are so particular to our curls and styling, almost no one knows how to style our hair -- so this is a REAL test.  

I told him I want to see how my curl will look once done - to see how his cut lays on my head. 

So off he went. We went through product and how it should be applied during this season (yes men, product needs to change with the seasons) -- Mark is so knowledgeable with product and hair type. 

Okay - finished product -- I almost cried! My locks were incredible! Beautiful! Amazing. I told Mark I purposely come in with out makeup, because I want see it plain. A frame on a empty canvas... The frame will make or break a fine piece of art. 

I ended up learning a lot about my hair, product and what to expect in this climate. I walked out with product and a freaking smile. This messy girl was satisfied. 

So how can I summarize this... Mark is a ""SHINEing"" star at this salon. I'm not sure if I will ever allow another man to run his fingers through my hair because this is Marks masterpiece!"
5,Great location with an awesome upstairs patio. Friendly staff and delicious beer on tap. Music Bingo on Friday 8:30-10:30p is the icing on the cake!
5,"We moved out of state and hired OnQ to manage our home in AZ as a rental property. They were fantastic! It was our first time renting out a home so I was a bit nervous at first. I really appreciated their experience and insights. They were very helpful and answered all my questions promptly and in a friendly manner. Rebecca was our property manager and she was so great! Our home was a higher end home, so It was important to me to have someone that respected the risk I was taking in renting out my home. She was knowledgeable, mature and very helpful. She always answered emails, phone calls, and texts promptly. I would definitely recommend OnQ..especially Rebecca."
5,"Great store, great service, great prices. Nice job Kevin Rymer!!

Not only did Kevin do an amazing job on my appliances, he was very professional and helpful to ensure customer service and satisfaction was to my expectations!

We will be back!
Thanks Kevin"
5,Great service. Loved the bento box it was so much food! Environment was lovely as well.
5,"Let's talk about what Shine is: it's a casual, quirky, friendly neighborhood salon. It's located in an old house, so each ""room"" has 3-4 chairs in it which provides a homey atmosphere, and small enough where a conversation might involve a whole room of customers/stylists which is why I keep going back. It's almost like an old-timey barber shop where people chime in on the latest gossip or story. It's a place where you can get a number of different levels of hair service from inexpensive with a junior stylist to pricey, involved triple foil lowlights/highlights with a glaze with the owner.  All the stylists are nice/funny and even though I always go to the owner Amy, I know all the other stylists, so when the owner went out on maternity leave I felt comfortable going to Tina. I'm experimental when it comes to haircolor, and if an experiment doesn't come out the way I want, they totally are willing to fix it. I would recommend the BlowDry 101 class too because I'm super lazy when it comes to hair and this has saved me from many bad hair days. It also pays to be a VIP for a free birthday month haircut and some other specials where I got a great deal on a dryer and a Chi travel pack.

Let's now talk about what Shine isn't: It is not a modern spa type atmosphere, or cold, clinical or systematized. It isn't a place where the stylists are too cool for school, nor trying to crank you out in 30 minutes (though they are busy).  It is not a place where you can get nails done for a full beauty experience (unfortunately).  It does not have a giant waiting room.

It did not bother me when they ask me if I need products (though they don't push certain ones like Aveda does unless you ask for a specific usage) because although I was  a lifetime Head & Shoulders girl, I discovered some of their products really are better than store bought brands and worth the $.  

Bottom line: it's a fun neighborhood salon."
5,"I have been with On Q for over a year. I have two properties with them. They are doing a great job so far. Of course, you have to work closely with them to get good results. My manager Carrie has been very responsive to my concerns and questions."
5,"I've never made an appointment, but I've never had to wait more than five minutes for a mani or pedi. Gel manicure is quick and they do a great job, always lasts about two weeks. Pedicure is very relaxing! I especially enjoy the citrus scrub and wax. This is my new regular place!"
5,"I have been a regular customer at Shine since the first time I walked through the doors.  The homey atmosphere and previous yelp reviews are what brought me through the door, the incredibly skilled stylists are what keep me coming back.  If you are looking for a well trained well priced personal stylist this is the place to go.  Shout out to Shane, incredible consult, she managed to decipher my cryptic requests and figure out exactly what I wanted."
5,"Charlton at Shine Salon has completely made me start my 30's feeling trendy and attractive.  He spent a lot of time consulting before he began coloring, cutting and working his magic!  
This was my 2nd visit to the salon and the customer service is the best I have had in this city.
I have spent double these prices at salons in Charlotte for just a decent job.  I felt like I was simply paying for a name.  However, Charlton went beyond my expectations and I have been receiving compliments left and right.
 I couldn't be happier and plan on remaining a faithful client!"
5,"I have had tint done on one of my cars before and it did not come out like this did. It was flawless and the front windshield was not cut crooked. I do not know about their customer service because we never encountered a problem, but I can comment on the workmanship. If you want quality this is the place."
5,"In my opinion this is one of the best steakhouses in the city. Been here multiple times for special occasions and have never been disappointed. I usually order my steaks rare or medium rare, both are cooked to perfection here.

Also recommended is the Caesar salad for two. They freshly make it right by your table and is excellent. Although it's a bit pricey at around $15 per person, it is definitely different to have it freshly made right in front of you.

Another plus is the garlic bread they offer. These are some of the best garlic breads I've had.

For special occasions I would definitely recommend The Octagon."
5,"I love this nail salon. I've been coming here for 3 years & have nothing but the best to say about the kind & accommodating owners & each professional nail technician. It is very reasonably priced, I've always had beautiful pedicures & manicures. Each technician carefully asks you what you want & makes sure that you are pleased with your service. While appointments aren't required, I always call for one- this salon is quite busy & calling ahead versus ""walking in"" ensures you won't have to wait more than 5 minutes @ most. I'm a RN so I'm very aware of hygiene & sanitary conditions. This salon is as clean & sanitary as they come! Love this place!"
5,"I can't even begin to explain how great this little spot in Central is!! The food is so good and so fresh. The inside has a loft area and a cute small outdoor patio. Even the staff was incredible and had great energy. (Shout out to Frank and Shyanne!!) 

This is such a good spot. Viva chicken who??"
5,"Wow is all I have to say. Service was prompt and courteous. Parking is a tad sketchy with construction but I got lucky. You order and pay at the counter on an iPad. Pretty detailed sample pictures to make it easy. I choose to make my own stir fry with egg noodles, chicken broccoli peppers, onions and a little heat. Delish!!! Noodles were aldente veggies were perfectly cooked as well. 
Pretty big portion for your $$. Had to try the honey bar (who wouldn't) Also a great treat. Fresh fruit chocolate chips and whip cream for a little sweetness. Yum!!! Wish they had one of these in NC."
5,"This is one of the best classic steakhouses in the GTA.  For a nice cut of meat, this is definitely the place to go.  We were a party of 4 and all of our steaks were cooked perfectly to our liking.  This place is business casual attire at the minimum so dress accordingly.  The service is top notch.  The salads were tossed right beside your table.  Great selection of wines is a must and they have it.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  It's a pricey menut but the quality is well worth it!"
5,"George was working the front the night I checked in.  He had so many people calling and asking for a shuttle from the airport.  Although it was hectic, he kept his cool and answered everyone's questions patiently and attended to everyone's needs.  He was so helpful the next day.  I needed to leave my bag in the lobby since I had to come back after check out.  He made sure it was safe and helped me carry it to the taxi.  George was the reason I give this hotel a 5 star.  It was just like any other hotel, clean rooms, good breakfast.  

What set the place apart from all of the other hotels was the customer service I received."
5,I was thirsty and just came from the gym! They were fast and friendly!!!  The place is sooo clean too....THANK YOU!
5,Our favorite place for dessert and my favorite drink here would be the coconut milk tea. The che are also good here.  They have the best coconut milk tea that I have ever had besides the one is San Jose.
5,"Looking at the menu outside almost scared us away because it is really pricey but thank God we didn't. Everything was amazing and cooked spot on and we had about 3 waiters waiting on us. I ordered the veal Oscar, which I didn't know if you could order like steak (medium rare, medium etc.) but the waiter was kind enough to explain to me that it was cooked one way, but it is usually cooked medium rare-medium. My brothers got the caesar salad and it was honestly the best caesar salad I've ever had. My brother got a recommendation from yelp to try it and I'm glad he did. Definitely will order it again next time I go. The Chicken Bon River was very tender as well so that's also a good choice. 

We ordered tiramisu for dessert and I asked if they could put a candle on top for my brother and the waiter said yes without hesitation. He even came out and started singing before we did, which was awesome. The tiramisu, although a small portion, was packed with flavour and was nice and creamy.

All in all, it was definitely an experience that would make me come back. The service is fast and friendly. The food is top notch. And the atmosphere is really amazing. Oh and as for the dress code (which on the site they say they have), my brother got in with jeans and running shoes (since it was a spur of the moment thing) so I guess they're pretty lenient."
5,"Called to get a quote for my car and also what type of tint do they offer and noticed I was able to get a a cheap deal because the sale on yelp. I was also able to get a same day appointment and also asked how long it would take since I had an appointment. It only took 2 hours to get my car tinted here and the job that they did was FLAWLESS  The thing I was happy about as well is that I have a lifetime warranty with them  So let me save you the headache and the frustration on searching for a place that is worth your money and get it done here, you won't be let down! Customer service is on point, if you wait for your car like I did, their waiting room is comfortable and has free soda and water and you can also search thru their netflix and watch something while you wait. Hope you enjoy your tint job because I am really enjoying mine  My car is sexy because of these guys"
5,"Brought my car in as a walk-in, fit me in the schedule with no problem. I initially got a quote online, spoke to Jose. The price quoted was exact, even though I had no appointment; they didn't pressure sell either. They were very thorough in explaining the various shades of tints and regulations required by law. The overall installation was right at an hour: and I am very impressed with the results. Very professional and quick."
5,Fresco bowl and chargrill plater are really good.   I liked the sweet corn casserole and garlic mashed potatoes.  Haven't been upstairs but it looks cool from outside.
5,"We have thoroughly enjoyed working with Austin, as he has helped us understand OnQ's management process. We are considering renting out our home and will absolutely use OnQ when we are ready! Thank you for the great experience thus far!"
5,"My wife and I were looking for a new washer...received courteous, prompt and knowledgeable service from Don Paul Neideffer.  We were so impressed by his honesty and full disclosure we also bought a dryer."
5,"Always fast service when needed! And I had my rental inspection last week and Connie Carey was fast, efficient and friendly! Thanks for working with my crazy schedule and being flexible!!"
5,"10 thumbs up from our crew!  I had the machaca plate and it was the perfect mixture of egg, beef and veggies. Thankfully no tomatoes!

My sons quesadilla was cheesy without being greasy.

My other son had rolled tacos.  With the exception of the poisonous guacamole ;) he ate all three.

I sacrificed and scraped guac off and ate it with my plate.

The Mrs. had the carne asada salad and liked it.

Well done, Ricardo's!

We liked the hot and mild salsa.  Not a fan of the medium.  I just like a sweeter salsa."
5,"I just moved back to the area after several years away and the old salon I went to didn't have availability, so I yelped Shine and my visiting-from-Philly sister and I made same-day appointments. The receptionist was very sweet and made sure to book our appointments together. I told her I was considering ombre color so she booked me with Waverly, a stylist with experience in the technique, but she said that the stylist could only do a cut & color consultation due to time limitations.

We got there and were offered drinks, ""What kind do you have?"" I asked...I was sold when I heard ""white&red..."" so I took my glass of red wine and waited just a few minutes before my cute as a button stylist Waverly came to get me.

I discussed the cut I wanted, which was really more of a much-needed shape up, and the ombre color. Waverly looked at the clock and said since I wasn't looking for something dramatic she had time to do the color that day. YAY! The girl was so sweet, had interesting things to talk about as she's new to the area, and spent two hours on my hair until the salon closed. Additionally, I have wavy/curly hair that has taken my entire life to embrace. Instead of doing a typical salon-style blowout(which I could never pull off on my own at home), Waverly commented on how much she loved/was jealous of my hair-type and worked wonders with a diffuser to bring out my hair's natural texture--THIS IS HUGE!! On my way out of the salon I got a bag full of goodies, a handful of Waverly's business cards, and a bottle of product to boot.

I didn't look too much at my hair that night as I went out right after but the next morning I was slightly disappointed, I wanted MORE color and I felt that I got more top layer highlights than a full ombre. I've never had the technique done before so I didn't know really how to communicate what I wanted. I himmed and hawed over whether I should call back because I liked everything that was done, but I didn't feel it was enough. So I called and left a message for the manager, who wasn't in that day, but who I got in touch with me promptly. I told her my predicament and she assured me that I should get what I want with my service, she booked an appointment for me first thing the next day.

I was nervous showing up there because I didn't want to be perceived as rude or a prima donna. I talked with Waverly and she said that because I came in initially with a more natural look and no color in my hair that she held back because she wasn't sure how dramatic I wanted to go. She was totally cool with me coming back because she assured me that she wanted me to be happy.

She did EXACTLY what I wanted and spent another TWO HOURS on my hair. She didn't skimp on the lovely scalp massage, she took her time, and fully styled my hair-ON THE HOUSE! 

My experience at Shine was really, really great. Waverly is a very sweet woman and a skilled, talented stylist in cut and color; she didn't make me feel awkward at all about coming back. The customer service was absolutely superb and Marit the salon manager really put me at ease also about making the decision to call after my first appointment. If you're on the fence about this place, I completely recommend it for the great cut, color, and customer service I received. This is a great business that is a SHINEing example of quality service!"
5,"Kim was our rep, and went above and beyond the scope of her job to help us get into our dream home. Extremely helpful and knowledgeable, super fast at replying to all of our (many) questions, and just above all an incredibly pleasant experience to work with her. Cannot thank her, or ON Q enough. We appreciate you and would recommend to anyone!!!"
5,"The best place to get nails done! Love them and have gone to them for years. Very clean, friendly, and they can ALWAYS get you in...even if you do have to wait for 10 minutes. Some places turn you away, they never have. Check in special as well when you go there on their iPad on the front counter."
5,"We are renting a home from On Q.  Ryan Haueter, our Property Manager, has been awesome!!  He response time to several requests has been almost immediate.  He is polite, accommodating and so easy to work with.  Thank you Ryan!!"
5,"So Happy that Bambu made it's way to AZ!  I've visited twice for the Halo-Halo.  It is heaven!! Jam packed with so much goodness, and just the right amount of sweetness.  I hope this becomes a permanent menu item."
5,"This was my first time and Cindy gave me a great acrylic nail set. She was very sweet and did a great job on my nails, I'll definitely have to go back!!"
5,"I honestly can never go wrong with Bambu. I was first introduced to this chain in the bay area, and I've been addicted to it since. I highly recommend the fruit addict. It's suitable for those who aren't used to open to trying new things. It cost around $5 but definitely recommend getting it! 

I also ordered the green pandan waffle. A bit chewier, like mochi, than usual. However, still amazing. It cost about $2.50 and it comes fresh and hot."
5,"The Highland Summer Salad is fantastic!! Cannot rate highly enough. Also digging the music (Animals, Psychedelic Furs) and the screen order system. Will order regularly."
5,"We were very pleased with this condo.  We had 10 in our group so we rented a one bedroom with an attached Studio and 2 other studios.  Very clean, very quiet, 2 miles from the Strip on Tropicana.  Easy to get in and out of.  There's a free shuttle to the strip."
5,On Q Property management has been quick to respond to our maintenance requests.  I appreciate the fact that I can call and actually speak with someone as opposed to sending an email.  They have been professional and friendly and made the original rental process an easy one.
5,"Omg their voodoo taco is sooooo good !!

And their habanero burger is super spicy !
5 s all day .
(Made a yelp account JUST for them)"
5,"As far as property management goes, On Q sets the standard. The staff is very professional and transparent. If you are looking for a team to help
you get the best return on your investment and to make sure your properties are rented and taken care of, give On Q a shot and you will be very pleased!"
5,Really awesome burgers with a different twist will definitely be back I had the Juan Jovi burger which had the most tender juicy pork I have ever had definitely recommend as well as the diablo burger. Staff is friendly and food came out quick!
5,"Wok Box.  Amazing.  As soon as you walk in you are happily greeted ""Welcome to Wok Box!"" by the energetic staff!  Then while I was looking at the menu deciding what to order I was greeted by the owner and his wife, they gave me a run down of the menu and I decided to go with the Sweet Mongolian.  After placing my order I watched it go through all the steps of making it, my favorite was watching the wok!  Man that guy was good!  I herd the other employees refer to him as the ""Wok Master"", I would certainly agree!  

Once I got my order, I sat down and started to look around.  That's when I realized how amazing the decor is, beautiful wood design with a very large Asian mural on the wall.

Now, lets talk about the food.  Not much to say other then it was amazing!  The beef was extremely tender and the sauce was perfect.  It could not of been better.

All in all, Pei Wei will not be seeing much of me anymore!"
5,"I have a great experience every time I go to this store. I have bought all of my appliances from here and my TV.  I had a problem with my GE dishwasher and it was resolved in three days. And they get me every time with the sonic ice machine, a definite plus. I recommend this store to everyone I know."
5,"I would recommend this salon to anyone who has felt out of place in most salons.  Very friendly staff and cute decor.  Shane was amazing.  A new stylist, but nailed exactly what I wanted and then some.  Anyone who is on a budget and can't afford an $85 dollar hair cut (that is with tip when most master stylist in town charge $70per cut)  rush to this talented lady before she starts charging the same!  It won't be long.  I was a new client before, but am happy to say that I have found my stylist.  YAY!"
5,Best pedicure since living in CA.  Great atmosphere!  Super attentive staff.  Every thing is only used once and thrown away!  Very hygienic! Best of all they serve wine to really relax!
5,Living in Las Vegas is a must to get tint in your car. An Auto tint express is the place to do so They do amazing work and quick. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Thank you for the great work!
5,I just ate here for the first time. Ordered  the teriyaki chicken burrito. It was huge and the teriyaki made it really savory. I will be back for more.
5,"I'm a huge fan of the Congee Queen franchise. I've been to the Congee Queen on Steeles and Don Mills and Markville location a million times so I used those locations as comparisons. 

I went at lunch on a weekday. The parking lot was really busy (likely because of the mall) but it wasn't busy inside. The space is large with 2 sides and beautifully decorated.

We ordered Singapore noodles, Cantonese chow mein, roasted pork and their signature Congee Wong super bowl, and found the food quality to be the same as other locations. The roasted pork skin was really crispy, the portions were big, and the dishes were flavourful.

I'll be back when I'm in the area. Price is reasonable for what you get."
5,"Spent a night before going home. Staff are friendly and shuttle driver is very good at her job. Room is clean and comfy, breakfast is hot and many choices. You could return your rental vehicle a day before to save some money and they will take you back. What happened to me was they had some problem to find me a shuttle to take me back but then they told me to hail a cab and they would pay for it. It is quite brilliant!"
5,"Great place. Staffs are helpful explaining the differences between each film. Fast service, everything was done under 90 minutes and they have a clean rest area. I would recommend this place to others."
5,"Just got my catepillars threaded by Bhumi! So happy with it! I was nervous because my usual place is too far since I've moved and tomorrow is my best friends wedding. She listened to exactly what I wanted and was quick! The salon was clean, pretty and convenient! I'll be back :-)"
5,"I highly recommend Idolize and I'm extremely happy this Dilworth location is now opened. My eyebrows always look amazing and I'm glad I've finally found a salon that consistently provides great results. This salon has a relaxing and cozy ambiance and it's much nicer than a mall kiosk. 

Thank you, Idolize!"
5,"Nathan was the First Impression at the start of vacation. What a GREAT beginning. His 5 star fresh approach when greeting us; Impecable ! Beyond !  I felt the 5 star approach is what Vegas offers. Hampton Inn, because of Nathan ! beats the strip in personality and accomadations. Well worth the dollar saved, with over the top in staff. Gotta go see him. Best in Class: in Vegas."
5,"I just left from here and had a wonderful experience! I was drawn in by the excellent reviews and they did not disappoint. I walked in at 11:15 and had to wait about 5 min, but I think I just caught a tiny ""rush"". I was pretty nervous as this was my first time getting anything professionally done to my eyebrows, but this place makes me wonder why I waited so long! It was a little painful, but it was over so quick and not long and drawn out like tweezing. I have very sensitive skin, but my face was barely red and I even ran errands afterwards without looking like I had just gotten them done. Everyone was very friendly and I will definitely be returning! 

PS- They give a 20% to CHS employees"
5,"I recently started working with Rebeccah Arnett at On Q, and have been nothing but pleased.  I was recently required by my HOA to have repairs done on my rental home.  Rebeccah handled everything from the quotes to the coordinating of the repairs.  I would highly recommend anyone looking for a property management co. to go to On Q and request Rebeccah's services."
5,"I've probably been here 10 or so times so far. I really like this branch. The staff has always been very nice. The waiters are nice, especially the sharp-looking guy with the half-silver tooth, and both of the night-time managers I've met have been friendly (a lady, and a younger guy). I go to a lot of Denny's, and I think the staff here is friendlier than most.

Food has always been good as well. I, nor my date have ever had any issues with the food."
5,"Husband loved the Spicy Thai Tamarind and I had the Beef Pho, which was terrific. Staff was nice and stopped by to see how everything was. They guarantee food will be out within seven minutes which is great for when we bring the kids."
5,"I'm a fan and MORE of this place.  I needed a new place to get my hair did, because the whole ""letting students do it"" wasn't working out.  I can't write this review without bragging on how great I looked so, please, just bear with me.

My hair was pitiful on the ends, the wrong colors and very damaged.  To fix it was going to require more processing, so I was scared.  Well, James got a hold of me and we did my cut first.  I loved it so much I almost cried.  Yes, I'm serious.  Even though we had to cut a couple of inches off, I still loved it!  A week later we did my color.  I had almost black base with large panels of bright red in it.  I loved it, but it was time for a change.  Despite the fact that we had to double process my hair to change the colors, I didn't come away feeling like I had straw for hair.  In fact, my hair hasn't felt this soft and smooth in a year. My color is still dimensional, but warmer and, dare I say it.. prettier :)

Go see Shine!!  Just go!  They listen, they're all sweet and professional, it's a great neighborhood, and they're prices aren't outrageous.  Just GO!"
5,"Lucio is amazing!  I brought my Sienna to him two weeks ago, him and his team did an amazing job!  We ended up bringing i our Explorer in and again they did perfect work.  I already told him we will bring in our MDX once it arrives in Vegas next week.  

So far my two visits I have dealt with Lucio over the phone and in person and he is nothing but professional, courteous and very knowledgeable and friendly.  I'll recommend everyone to come to Auto Tint Express as well as to deal with Lucio!  He will help you pick out tint and make some recommendations to help you find what you want.  They have competitive pricing and Lucio was the one that even told me about their $169 Yelp Promo.

They have a nice comfortable clean waiting room with free beverages while you wait for your vehicle.  I ended up getting hooked on a Netflix show while I was there ""Fast Cars"" that I was able to finish watching the second time I went in to get our Explorer done.  The wait was about 2-3 hours and this second time around I was even late for my appointment.

If you're looking for a window tint place give them a shout or even swing by and check them out you definitely won't regret it!"
5,"One of the best smoothie places I have tried. It cost slightly more because they use real fruit, not the powdered crap. Def worth a visit if you want a delicious fresh fruit smoothie."
5,"I moved to Charlotte, from the California Bay Area about a year ago. I had put of highlighting/coloring my hair because, as most women know, hair color appointments with a new stylist can be scary. I called Shine after reading the rave reviews on Yelp, so glad I did! The front desk staff Zack and Meret were so sweet and very helpful that I set an appointment with Marilyn. When I got to my appointment I was offered an array of beverages, even wine and beer! Marilyn and I had a discussion about my color expectations, she made me feel so comfortable in the decisions we made together that I couldn't wait to get started. We hit it off and talked the entire appointment. My color looks great! I found out during the appointment that all she does is color, as she mentioned I could accent my color with a great layered cut. She recommended Chelsea and I see her tomorrow!

If you are in need of a great salon, I suggest this place will make you SHINE!"
5,"That perfect haircut and stylist is like that perfect pair of jeans or big foot or the loch ness monster. Super elusive or may not even exist.

 Shine proved me wrong. 

Not only is the salon fabulous, chic and clean but they were gracious, kind and made my experience wonderful. 

Often, I find myself apologizing for my curly monster hair at salons but Shine and my stylist James worked with me to make my time there worthwhile. He even moved back an appointment in order to finish up my cut and style (so sorry!) but I appreciated not being handed off. He spent nearly two hours with me recommended products, but not in that pushy car salesman way and discussed how we can both work together for my hair success- sigh. #girlproblems. 

The best part of my visit to Shine (other than the followup phone call from James later that day to see how my hair dried and if I was happy with my look)- was the price. You can be pampered and pleasantly surprised.  Don't tell the owners but I would have paid double for that experience. I have already made an appointment to go back in eight weeks."
5,"Somehow I missed the whole ""threading"" option and have waxed the furry bits off my face for years. Until I met Ila @ Idolize! Thank you for the education. I have sensitive skin and have suffered for years from what I call ""face rips""= waxing. Complete and utter torture and the downtime was ridiculous. No more! Ila is a threading pro and she made me feel completely at ease. She did my brows, 'stache, and creepy chin hairs (inside voice) that have come with age/genetics. I love this lady! Pain free and hair free = WIN!"
5,"This review is for the Bar and bar staff. Super friendly and helpful. Got us extra pickles for free. Always attentive and fun. 

We ordered the Crispy Wings. They were hot but not too hot. Great flavor and super crispy. 

The giant pretzel was GIANT. Really great and the mustard and cheese sauce was perfect addition. 

High class, friendly pub atmosphere."
5,Friendly atmosphere and the overall experience was great! Recommend visiting for anyone who's in need of their car windows to be tinted.
5,"This is the best sushi in ALL of Toronto. Like its the best... ever! And the best part is... its all u can eat!
 wooo who!
Everything from the avacado rolls to the shrimp tempura is amazing. At most sushi places after the 1st serving the taste of the stuff gets blan and grose but everything here is just amazing, food wise.
And the price is great!"
5,"After I dropped my son off at school, I went to Walmart to drop my car off for an oil change. Shortly after turning in the keys, my friend met me there and we drove off to Dennys to eat breakfast. They have the $2, $4, $6, and $8 deals. We couldn't resist because you pay little, but get a lot for you are paying. She ordered off of the $4 menu and ordered the Everyday Value Slam which consists of two buttermilk pancakes, two eggs cooked to order and two bacon strips or two sausage links. I ordered the $8 Grand Slam Slugger which consists of two buttermilk pancakes, two eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links.  Served with your choice of hash browns, bread or grits.  Includes coffee and juice. The food was good and delicious. The waitress that served us was also on top of everything making sure that my friends water and my coffee with orange juice were constantly topped up until we said no more. Denny's is a great place to eat breakfast."
5,"My gf and I live in the neighborhood and decided to drop in after seeing a review on the stuffed avocados. And I must say,  what a great decision! This is a cool, quick service spot with healthy,  yet tasty food.  Order your food at the counter, take a number and your food will be brought to your table when done.  Full bar upstairs with a nice patio so I definetly can't wait until the weather truly breaks.  They have some really good specials during the week like 75 cents wings and $4 Wine. The rotisserie chicken, pinto, brown rice with quinoa, stuffed avocados and street corn custard was amazing.  Oh and the drinks were pretty good too. The staff was attentive and genuinely seemed interested in making sure we had a great dining experience. We'll definetly be back!"
5,"This place does stellar work! Had them do my front windows on my truck and 6 inches on the top of my windshield. They offer a variety of prices that are very competaive with other shops. What is the cherry on top is the life time warranty, so you can be confident they stand behind their work. The employees are kind and courteous, the shop is clean, comfortable waiting area with free water! I would defiantly recommend a friend, and I plan to go back!"
5,My boyfriend and I came here for a quick lunch and we honestly were blown away about how amazing the food was. He chose the sweet soy five spice with beef and I had the red coconut curry with chicken both with noodles. Now my boyfriend is an extremely picky eater.  While I consider myself the adventurous eater he is often just there for support Ha ha ha. I wasn't sure if he would like the whole Thai/Asian concept. But he finished his food before me and didn't speak a word while eating it which means he was digging it. In fact before we left he got another order to go for later. Every weekend he suggests going to this place so it must have really left its mark on him. Anyways we both agree that it's a 10/10 casual eatery with quality food and ingredients in a friendly and clean environment right in shadyside.
5,"Great Bar! Great Experience! Jeanie and Aggie were great! The best server/bartender. They knew their drinks and knew the menu well. They were able to recommend some great drinks. Oysters were the Best I've ever had, FRESH. and the Hospitali'Tea was a great drink! Very refreshing. Highly recommend you make a stop at thePub for a drink and some good food

Drinks: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Staff: 10/5"
5,"Here's an honest review: as a New Mexican, this is not the best Mexican food I've had.  Not even close.  In fact, it is perfectly average.  Just like most of the Mexican restaurants in Glendale and Phoenix.

However, I'm giving this place 5 stars because the great service and countless menu options really make it something special.  I have vegetarians in my family and they were astounded by all of the vegetarian options.  They seem to have thought of everything in terms of combinations and substitutions -- it really feels like you have a thousand options.  They have friendly and efficient workers, the food is served quickly, and it is fresh.

Definitely check this place out.  As long as you go in with honest expectations, you'll have an excellent experience."
5,Great experience all the way around. My hubby and I ordered several items so we could share. Highly recommend the fish and chips. Batter was crispy and the fish was perfectly flaky. The chips were hot and fresh and also crispy. The bangers and mash were so yummy. The flavors in the sausage were exactly how I remembered them tasting in our favorite London Pub. Ordered the sliders and honestly had to take them to go because we had entirely too much food. But they were delicious reheated for a midnight snack. That's what vacations are all about right ??!! Service was excellent but we'll definitely be back for the food.
5,"Very happy with the food (Impossible Burger- who knew it was vegan?) and the service. Our waitress was terrific and very attentive, and the table was cleared and refills offered exactly as needed. Lily was awesome, as was her helper."
5,"This has become my new favorite nail spot! The prices are good and they always do quality work. I have been there three times and it is very clean and well organized. I have never had to wait a long time even on Saturday mornings. I have acrylic nails with gel polish. They make my nails look natural, no weird bubbles or thickness. It is a bright and happy place to visit! Pretty and modern looking. I have never left disappointed. 

Heads up, they charge a $1 fee for credit cards. I usually just grab cash on my way there."
5,"Found this gem on my last night in Vegas.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and the food (standard pub fare) is fantastic.  Would definitely recommend, and will be back next visit."
5,"I love this restaurant!

Great food, amazing professional and funny staff.

The decor is cozy and stunning. The china  seems out of date however goes well with the establishment's brand.

A must go if you like ambiance, art and of course steakhouses.

The must try:

Their freshly prepared Caesar salad at your table!"
5,"Previously, I had complained about this firm. I guess they heard me. On two occasions  now, they have been quick, professional and totally focused on fixing the issue (Pool pump and AC). I think my experience demonstrates that everyone deserves a second chance. These guys have turned it around. 

Keep up the good work!"
5,Amazing!!!! Passing through Charlotte and stopped for a local dish.. and I was blown away by the stuffed avocados!!
5,"Old school and fancy dining at its best. The meat here is top notch quality. I didn't know what to expect and I was blown away by the wait staff (totally professionalism) and the food!

I ordered the prime rib ($20, lunch) and it melted in my mouth good! Too bad they raised their prices, or I'd be back!"
5,"I am giving a five star because good and plenty amount of food, and fairly good service. Typical Cantonese food.

It is a place I can go and have supper when I do not feel like cooking. It is way better than other congee restaurants."
5,Stopped by this place tonight and the food was OUTRAGEOUSLY DELICIOUS. We had a chimichurri bowl with beef and a pork sandwich. Both the food and the service were so good! We will definitely be back!!!
5,"I wanted to share my experience with On Q
The transaction went smooth as butter thanks to Tanner Lee. 

Tanner is on top of his game. He made our transaction very easy.  Tanner has gone above and beyond for us in our new home.  

I look forward to working with On Q in the months to come.  


Keep up the good work!!"
5,"The staff here at Auto Tint Express are very professionals they seem to care about the customer satisfaction. I was recommended from a friend and also the tons of reviews they have on Google. The time was faster then I expected since I have 2013 Chevy Avalanche I thought it would last 3 hours or more, but the time period only took less then 2 hours which is fantastic. The thing I like the most was there waiting room it felt very neat and comfortable. I felt relax while waiting on my vehicle. Also I can say is if you're looking for a clean facility tint shop and a great job this is the place to be. Thank you guys I appreciate it."
5,"This was my first time getting my eyebrows threaded and now I will never go back to waxing. I found the dilworth location and decided to give it a try after my friends told me how great eyebrow threading works. 

I did not have to wait long to be serviced and the facility has very chic decor and also looked and felt very clean. 

My eyebrows (aka my babies..but seriously!) were done by a kind, professional lady named Ila. She did a FLAWLESS job too! No pain, irritation, or marks left behind.  Just beautifully shaped brows. Here I am on week #2 since getting my brows done and they still look like they did when I walked out of the salon. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!

Its safe to say that as long as I am a Charlotte resident, Idolize will be my eyebrow destination!"
5,"I had brought my second vehicle which is an Audi. I was pleased with my previous experience and now I am pleased with my second experience. I had purchased 3M crystalline in the first vehicle and now I took the same film and happy with the results once again. There service is great and I recommend others to come and see it for themselves, I know for a fact if I purchase a vehicle in the future I'll keep this place in mind."
5,"This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale! I had the butter chicken naan wrap and the Vietnamese coffee. Both were delicious! Customer service was excellent as well! If this place was closer to home, I would frequent more often."
5,"Wow, i'm surprised nobody has written a review for this place yet. In my opinion, this is one the best steakhouses out there I actually rate this place a 4.5/5... I took off 0.5 cause it was so dark in this restaurant that I didn't see this bump on the floor and almost tripped which would result in some embarrassment. I played it off as nothing happened though. 

The interior is very nice. Fancy decors, stain glass windows and antique style paintings give this place that old modern feel. Wine racks near the entrance gives you an idea of the variety of fine wines offered here. The lighting was a little too dark for me but I don't mind. 

Onto the food, their menu is full of delicious food choices, seafood and of course steaks to name a few. It seems that a lot of people order their Caesar salad, probably because they prepare the Caesar salad right by your table when you order it. For me, I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops and let me just say... PERFECT! Being a chef myself, scallops is something that is hard to cook perfectly and this place got it spot on. It almost just melts in your mouth. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

As for the main meal, how can you not order their steaks? One good thing about their steaks is that they charcoal broil them giving them that nice, smokey flavour. Generally when I order my steaks, I always order it one down of the doneness I want (ie. if I wanted medium, I ask for medium-rare) only because a lot of places never cook steak to my choice. Not with this place, I ordered medium-rare and it came exactly that way! Nice and juicy, not too salty, it was just right. My friend ordered the chicken neptune (breast of chicken topped with crabmeat, asparagus tips and hollandaise sauce) and again, delicious. I tried a piece and the chicken was cooked perfectly.

Their dessert menu offer many delicious choices ranging from Creme Brulee to Chocolate Mousse Cakes. I ordered the Tiramisu and my friend ordered the chocolate cake. Tiramisu was good and the chocolate cake was a little too sweat in my opinion. 

Highly recommend for anyone who wants to dine in a fancy restaurant and have delicious food cooked properly. Best of all... it's shaped in an octagon! How cool! Prices are quite high especially for some seafood dishes ($40.95 - single lobster tail) but I think it is well worth it. Dress code is business casual so don't be going in your sport shoes or sandals as they probably won't let you in. Hope to go here again to try their lobster."
5,"Today is the first it opened 10% discount for the first week may get extended. The food is wonderful I love getting the Cashew nut chicken with Fried rice along with BBQ Combo of Pork & Duck. They have one of the best BBQ Duck. 

Service is always quick which I like & prices are very reasonable, the best is it's closer to me. 

Entrance is outside next to Pickle Barrel & No Frills"
5,"My stylist, Waverly, though is absolutely AMAZING. I went from my natural mousy brown color to now a beachy blonde color, but it looks so natural. She kills it every time and I constantly get compliments on my color ( even if I got my hair done 5 weeks prior and my roots are showing). She creates the color to match your skin tone, eyes, lifestyle, etc. 
I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Waverly. She is the color expert! Ive been to a so many hair dressers through the years and she is by far the best. 
I've recommended her to a couple of my friends and they have come back raving on how wonderful she was. 
Not to mention, I LOVE the salon itself. It's a great place when you first walk in. All the receptionist are so welcoming and friendly and there is a cool, modern vibe inside. (Not to mention you're given copious amounts of wine)"
5,"I got my pedicure done today, and I love it. The young girl did my toes perfectly. She gave me a nice massage on my legs. I recommend you guys to come here and try it."
5,"First time trying this place yesterday and I must say, I'm really impressed.  This is a healthy-ish fast food option in the East Liberty area.  I ended up getting the sweet soy five spice stir fry and a honeygrow.  The stir fry was super flavorful and was a bargain at $8.  The honeygrow with fresh fruit was definitely a great snack to finish off the meal as well."
5,"A coworker and I tried this place for lunch last week and kinda knew what to expect from the Yelp! pictures and the menu. Man, that was an understatement.

The plethora of fish taco flavorings was pretty immense. We both tried two of different kinds and were not disappointed. My blackened fish tacos in two different styles were large and fantastic. The list of different styles of toppings and sauces is large and I'll be back to try more or all of them.

They've turned the old Long John Silver's into a Gold winning lunch spot!"
5,"Looking at the various locations they have of this restaurant we lucked out because we were closest to the restaurant with the highest rating. 

We came here for breakfast and got a huge vat of congee. I don't mean to make it sound unappealing but then again congee is porridge that is shared across the family. The seafood one we ordered was fishy. The kids weren't huge fans of it. Other dishes that were a hit was the fried dough. I know.. it's just bread made in a deep fryer.. nothing too complicated but it was the perfect crunchiness to it and I loved it! I use it to dip into the congee and eat it like a makeshift spoon. 

Their rice crepes are ginormous. Note: pictures in the menu do not always match the food served. The rice crepe on the menu was teeny tiny compared to what we got. That's good right? 

Service surprisingly was very NY style (or maybe HK style). The server was terse, busy as heck and in a bit of a rush as if he was also manning the porridge in the kitchen and didn't want to overbook or overboil it. I doubt he has kitchen responsibilities but he was clearly busy running around and manning a lot of tables at once. 

It's fine. We got our food and things were Yummy! We will be back."
5,I have used On Q for over 2+ years on 2 different properties. I hired them when I had installed my own renter from Craigslist and needed to go through the eviction process. They helped us through the eviction process then found us fantastic renters that have renewed the last 2 years and on our 2nd property have renewed each year as well. I cannot recommend them highly enough!
5,"I noticed auto tint express on my way from work.  I called to make an appointment for the next day.  I came in for my  appointment the young men their we're very professional about explaining what tint I needed for my brand new truck.  They finished exactly when they promised.  Small lounge to watch tv free coffee and water.  Very clean area,  small stores around to get something to eat.  I highly recommend getting your vehicle worked on here.  Outstanding service for the money."
5,"I was so pleased coming to The Pub after it's been revamped!! Thankfully, the new staff (maybe new management or Chef?) changed up the menu and made some amazing changes! Our meals were full of flavor and came out extremely quick. I was very pleased with the service and the friendly staff. I would absolutely recommend this place!

**LOVE the new changes in this establishment!! Keep up the awesome work guys!! :)"
5,Great Breakfast must be under new management waiter Pico is the best. Manager even came to our table and ask how the food and service was. This place has diff entry changed for the better. Be sure to as for Pico.
5,Glad I came here. Fast and friendly service and they did an amazing job on my Scion! Definitely will be coming back here!
5,"Service and food was fantastic!  The bento box was MASSIVE! Easily the best deal on the menu. The spicy tuna roll was actually spicy for a change, which was refreshing. They basically overhauled and gutted the original building which was well needed. Prices are on par with what you would normally expect at a good sushi restaurant. I will definitely be coming back."
5,"I was in search for a while for a place I trusted to do a good job on my Mercedes. I call auto tint express for information about window tinting. I have scheduled an appointment on Thursday morning. Once I arrived Jose approached me with great customer service. We went over the films on display and he told me the difference between each other . Few, minutes passed by and I purchase the 3M crystalline all 40% all around and the front windshield 70%. After days passed by and experience 3M crystalline I knew for a fact I made a great decision. Auto tint express is the best window tinting shop that I've ever been too and I highly recommend this place, don't go anywhere else."
5,"Great fast casual spot.  Good food with a little Latin flair.  Very good service and what looks like it will be a nice outdoor bar / deck (once the weather warms up!). The rotisserie chicken, avocado and salads were great - and always great to combine w local craft beer options.  I'll definitely be a regular!"
5,"Very nice atmosphere, experienced staff and The portions are pretty big, the Caesar salad is a must have, they make the sauce and salad right in front of you, also the lobster bisque is very good, steak is very juicy, we finished with coconut tart, overall everything was very good! Will for sure go back again!"
5,"Excellent place to stay. Extremely nice staff. Free continental breakfast. Free wifi. We also got some free show tickets for listening to their timeshare presentation which was real informative. Sounded like a real good deal. We are staying in a one bedroom unit. Has a full kitchen with everything you will need including plates, cups, silverware, large fridge with icemaker, etc. Has a nice dining table for four between the living room and kitchen. Everything is clean and smells good. Bathroom is huge with a jacuzzi tub. There is plenty of closet space. Love having the washer and dryer in the unit. There is also a nice balcony with a good view of mountains. We eat breakfast there while enjoying the view. To sum it up, we are really enjoying our stay here at Tahiti Resort. We highly recommend it."
5,"Honey Grove is one of the best healthy eateries on the east end of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. The food is fresh They don't freeze anything and what I appreciate is the pride themselves on freshness.  The sesame garlic stir-fry is to die for the wheat noodles and bean sprouts  and broccoli scallion mixture is mouthwatering.  I am add chili flakes for just a bite of spice. The ""make it grain"" salad is spine chilling the combination of beets and sweet carrots, wheat berries and quinoa atop the arugula bed brings a new kinda freshness to the pallet that words just can't explain.The food is so colorful even if you're not into vegetables it's ediblely attractive and the sauce blends will leave you smiling after every bite.  I find myself drinking the lemonade it's rejuvenating to say the least.  The pressed juices compliment the ""Highland Salad"" another fresh salad named after a local park.  I definitely recommend Honeygrow.. below is the ""Make it Grain"" salad# TerriBerriez"
5,"Amazing food! We had a big group with lots of picky kids, and it was fast and everyone enjoyed their meal. Don't be afraid of the Johnny Utah, it's killer!!! A little taste of everything. Highly recommend it!"
5,Michelle Tyler went completely above and beyond today to assist me in the situation I had and I'm super grateful and I couldn't be more happy to recommend this company to both tenants and homeowners alike
5,Loved my experience here!! I've never been this happy with my color before. Absolutely worth the price.
5,We came to this restaurant during spring break and we were so happy with it!! I had the voodoo and wipeout tacos and they were both delicious!!! The wipeout was my favorite. They have fresh delicious ingredients and amazing sauces! Do yourself a favor and come eat dinner here!!!!
5,"Auto tint express offers an excellent product, prices and fast, friendly service. I would highly recommended for all of your window tinting needs."
5,"Walked in thinking it was going to just be fast food but i was pleasantly surprised. Mine and my girlfriends food was amazing, service was great and friendly and there is also a tv to watch some sports. Wonderful place, will eat again no doubt."
5,"I got a Skin Brightening Facial today with Jane and it was absolutely amazing! I had a Groupon for the facial, but cannot wait to come back again. Jane made me feel completely relaxed the whole time and explained the whole process for the facial. My skin looks amazing and I am already excited to book another appointment with her. Definitely recommend!"
5,"I love how they do my hair here. I am really ocd about my appearance and am rarely happy with the way stylist do my hair.  The color was perfect, highlights are always perfect when I come.  Up to date with all the trendy styles. I had some blue and purple streaks added last time and he pulled the exact color I showed him a picture of...Flawless.... I get compliments daily."
5,Seems like this company has a lot of mixed reviews needless to say that relocating from California it was really difficult to find a rental in such a short period of time and Kim was able to help me with that and I still sincerely appreciate it. So far haven't run into any thing too dramatic of problems so I don't have anything negative to say besides  the positive. Kim was able to secure us this property and get us moved in on the date that we requested.
5,Love the way my tint job turned out! Lucio was amazing and so patient with me as I decided which shade I wanted on my car! Love the fact that they precut the tint and don't cut directly on your car window. Incredibly professional job and I'm so glad I choose Auto Tint Express! Another plus was the great deal they offer here on Yelp for checking in!
5,"The Octagon is actually shaped like an octagon on the interior! Although, extremely dark (making it difficult to take decent pictures), the ambiance is classy/romantic furnished with vintage pieces. You'd never guess that this place once burned down and was rebuilt - the old school atmosphere is certainly still there!

The service is excellent. There were at least three different wait staff serving our table, and all were very friendly. They made great recommendations from their extensive wine list - by the glass, half bottle or full bottle. 

What was ordered:
1. Caesar Salad (for 2) - Freshly made at your table in a large wooden bowl. The trainee that made the salad for the first time apparently added too much olive oil (which I did not notice at all) and the manager who walked by apologized profusely and made a fresh one for us himself. The way he whipped up that salad, I'm surprised at how they keep their suits so clean! 

2. Bacon-Wrapped Scallops - Oh my god, this was delicious! I will be ordering this every time I come back. The scallops are cooked to perfection, with the center melting in your mouth. The bacon isn't overly-salty, and complemented the enormous scallops perfectly. 

3. Filet Mignon 8oz - I ordered my steak medium-rare, and out it came medium-rare. PERFECTO!  I was pretty full at this point, but I couldn't help myself and finished this extremely tender and juicy entree. 

4. Prime Rib - The boyfriend ordered this and his thoughts: ""Very tender, but maybe too fatty."" He asked for it to be served as rare as possible, and honestly, the rarest prime ribs come is medium-rare. For the regular cut, the size of the prime rib was very generous. I wonder how large the Octagon cut is..

5. Coconut Cream Pie - The BEST dessert I've tasted at a steakhouse. Seriously, this is a must-order. They don't always have this available, so call ahead and reserve your pie! The crust on the bottom is perfect - not too hard, and not too flaky - and every bite you'll taste coconut!

6. New York Cheesecake - This was pretty meh (especially after the coconut cream pie). For cheesecake enthusiasts, this may not be creamy enough for you. 

The surprising part is the bill: 
The bill came out to be around $190, including two glasses of wine we ordered! I don't know, but I was expecting somewhere around $300 based on how much we ordered.. 

Octagon, I will be back! You've got yourself a new regular!"
5,The food is great! The prices are good and you get your food really fast one weird thing is that you don't get your napkins until they bring your food to you which is odd but this is a cool little spot that is good for breakfast lunch and dinner
5,"Today ordered satay beef rice, black bean with rice noodle, seafood with tofu soup, snow pea leaves with garlic and chile turnip patties for take out.  At 4:30pm tables are filled but still seating available. We came here mostly because I had to drop by maternity store and wanted to maximize our time in this area since its abit out if the way for us. Hence order Chinese from a place that we typically wouldn't go to (live in Etobicoke).  Congee Queen has never disappointed us in the past and I am happy to say it didn't disappoint this time either, even with take-out."
5,"My family and daycare kids enjoyed a wonderful stay here. Hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and complimentary breakfast was on point! Faith, María, and Barbara were awesome staff. The hotel is located off strip but it only takes 10 to 15 minutes to reach major hotels on the strip. Close to everything I needed Walmart, Sams club gas, Cici's Pizza, and more. Parking is Free. Swimming pool needs more shade, however, is open almost 24 hours."
5,If this is the future of fast food-I'm 100% in. A healthy and quick option that is always tasty. It's a bonus that the staff are always friendly.
5,"We loved everything we tried here.. the gaucho sandwich, rotisserie chicken, stuffed avocado, and corn casserole. Great rooftop patio and additional upstairs seating. Good tunes. Have to put this chicken over RoCo and Viva, because I loved the charred skin. 

Great service, too. We were given a complementary milk for my son, and when my toddler kicked his shoe off the balcony (where we couldn't see it) they gladly hopped off to see if it had fallen underneath the deck."
5,This place is the best I got the best advice for the Tint. Customer service is great & the guy at the desk is very helpful
5,By far the nicest service I have ever received from a hotel. The shuttle service may not have been the fastest but gee gosh willickers Batman! They sure were friendly! The rooms were nice and spacious with wifi and cable. The complimentary breakfast is also a bit nicer than the ones you normally get but still not amazing. Very clean rooms and and a pool. Will stay again! =D
5,I saw Waverly for the first time today after previously going to a different hairdresser at Shine. Waverly is AWESOME! She took the time to listen to what I wanted and made suggestions to make my hair look its best. This is the first time I have ever walked out of a salon happy about my haircut. She is also a rockstar colorist and turned my full highlights into a great subtle ombre. HIGHLY recommend Waverly!
5,"Everyone is so nice. I've been going for over a year. I've always had amazing service. Thank you to Kenny, Yen, Tony and all the girls !!"
5,"Totally reasonable in price (cheaper than anyone else I called), fast service (same day appt), nice waiting area (cozy couches and complimentary drinks), and most importantly - quality tint! It is nerve-wracking deciding where to go, but don't hesitate here. They didn't try to upsell me anything unnecessary and they were thorough in their inspection before and after. It looks good!! Thank you Auto Tint Express."
5,"We had reservations for 11:30am on a Sunday for the Hibachi. Celebrating a birthday. We were seated right on time. Our party was ready. The service was hands down the best ever. Everyone was so attentive to me and my family. They came around with refills for the children when their cups were low. Was really impressed by the service and quality of the food. The hibachi cook was OUTSTANDING!! He really knew how to take customer service to another level. The children were entertained. 

I ordered the fancy roll as well and had the volcano drink with my wife, but I think I drank most of it. Everything was delicious. Overall, we were there for about an hour and a half. The food was delicious and the entertainment was very good. I recommend visiting Sumo."
5,Adding on to previous review... Mark gave my hair a much needed make over and a painless brow wax!  No complains here!
5,"I love this place, the service is always amazing thanks to Kimmie the cashier, she's very nice and fast and she always make my drink which is fresh and good every time I order it."
5,"Me and my daughters had a wonderful time there few weeks ago. Great atmosphere, very pleasant service all around, attentive cashier/server named Ruby. Delicious food with affordable and reasonable prices. Even though the place is about chicken-chicken-chicken, the menu in whole seems very health conscious and with many options for vegetarians such as myself.We loved it and definitely coming back!!!"
5,"Wow, I had a wonderful time at Shine's Blow Dry 101 class on Friday!   (Thanks Nicole for planning another awesome event!)

When I arrived, I was offered wine, Vitaminwater cocktails, cheese, crackers, and fruit.   After group introductions,  we were shampooed and paired with different stylists based on our challenges.  I worked with Christina, who was awesome!  She was very patient and was able to really show me how to properly straighten and blow-dry my thick tresses while minimizing the frizzies. 

I have always been challenged in terms of styling my own hair... manual dexterity has never been my strong suit.  But to make matters worse, none of my stylists have ever taken the time out to really show me the proper methods for drying and styling my hair.  But, I learned some fool-proof techniques for everyday styling that will make a real difference! 

I learned that I was using the wrong brushes for my hair's length & thickness, and I was thrilled to purchase the proper tools.  I also was able to try a couple of new products that worked well for me and also was able to add those to my arsenal as well. 

Everyone at the Salon was awesome and made me feel really welcome and special - kudos to the entire team!

I also enjoyed my lip makeover from Jeffre Scott & look forward to checking out his shop as well!"
5,I've been here twice over the last few months.  For lunch I had the sashimi salad and some salmon sashimi.   My meal was kind of pricey because of what I ordered but it was really good.  For dinner I had the salmon bento box and shared a roll with my friend.  So.much.food!    It was really good quality and both times service was great.  We are going to go again soon and try the hibachi.   Nice additional option for sushi/Japanese food on the east side.
5,Their roasted pork totally hit the spot. The super bowl house special congee was HUGE! enough to feed 10 people.
5,"We were looking for a yummy bite to eat and were lucky enough to stop here. GrEAT surfer type decor,  Very friendly staff and the food was really good. A great experience!"
5,From cali just had great service and an awesome burger definitely coming back when Im in town again
5,"This was our first visit and it won't be our last. Monday night. Alex was an attentive waiter.
I had the Tuna platter - 3 types of tuna (2 of each type)  & 5 huge spicy tuna rolls.
We (2 of us) shared two dinners: beef roll (tons of onions) & orange chicken (soooo good), and the pineapple fried rice (very tropical tasting). Plenty extra to take home.
Topped it off with the creme brulee. Yum!

Note: you can get the Hibachi food at a dining table without the ""show""."
5,"Full credit because they make specific provision for the wheat-sensitive, vegan, and vegetarian clientele. It's a real challenge to find tasty Asian offerings for a vegan celiac, but we found a couple of pretty tasty alternatives. They use a separate wok, non-wheat soy sauce, and rice noodles for those particular needs. Yay!"
5,My new GE washer that died after 6 days was not something Spencer's could resolve. I did contact GE thru Spencer's and they had me a BRAND NEW washer in a week.
5,"Hampton Inn really does not get enough credit.  After staying here for more than 8 days I can see what it is part of the Hilton family.  First I arrived into Vegas about 12 pm no need for  taxi, just called the hotel and within 15 minutes they had a gentleman pick me up.  When i arrive at the hotel it definitely looked upscale which surprised me because I thought those type of things were only reserved for hotels on the strip.  The staff was nothing less than awesome and take pride in doing their job and it shows.  Everyone was so knowledgeable and quick to attend to my needs I kept asking are you the manager?  Andrew is great I asked him advice on the casinos and he gave me some tips on that as places to eat.  Vickie was also very patient  with me as I forgot my room key in my room several times.  Both of them always greet you when you enter the place and ask you how was your day and if there is anything they can do for you? The entire staff was great, these are just the two I interacted with the most.  They made the Hampton feel like home away from home for  me...plus the cookies are delicious!"
5,"Every time I've had to deal with these guys (over the phone or in the office), they've been professional, personable, and friendly. It's refreshing to find a modern, helpful, and caring property management company in the valley. The reps/agents move things quickly and efficiently, I don't think I can think of a simple problem I've ever had with On-Q. 

It sounds like some tenants on here have had isolated experiences that I haven't had so I wanted to get on here and add something positive!"
5,Food was terrific. There were issues with the grills and so it took a long time to actually get food but the food was great so I can't fairly take away a star.
5,"We went to Vegas to visit family and celebrate my uncle's bday. This is one of the hotels with a very reasonable rate. And the best part of it is that breakfast is included!! One morning, we had paper thin bacon... it was perfect!! I usually don't eat bacon but I do here ONLY. It was not salty and not fatty at all. And then there's my favorite waffles. He usually makes it for me. So this is the first time for me to make it. (I can eat this the entire day if I can)The staff are very friendly and nice. The location is good since it is close to the strip and all the places that we want to go to. The only thing that I didn't like is that it is next to the airport LITERALLY. Sooooo....expect to hear every plane take off and land. After the first night, you just get used to it. They do give you 1 free pair of ear plugs. Lol. We never had a problem finding parking even if we get back to the hotel late. They do have big parking lot anyway. I might be back here again soon if we are in the area."
5,"Great first time here! I made my own bowl with rice noodles, tofu, and veggies as well as a green juice. They were delicious!"
5,"Good service and good boba, I like the number 13,
Green bean, it's pretty good."
5,Perfect local food! Flank steak platter and farm veggie sammich were pure deliciousness! People are super nice and helpful. Great upstairs eating area and rooftop bar! Support local!!
5,"Tried it for the first time yesterday! They were busy and were very friendly with everyone. I would have taken a picture of my food, but I ate it too fast. Great food and service!"
5,Oh and get the char grilled platter with flat iron steak- bomb! Also there's a manager by the name of Audrey I think. She is the Bee's knees :-)
5,I love this little spot. Quick and fresh and a super friendly staff. Wish they would do coupons or loyalty card or something. Seems a bit pricy for what it is but it's delicious.
5,"Everyone here has always been just lovely. When I come into town or when I am living here (like now). This is the only place I would ever go to get my brow threaded. I have been to almost all of there locations and service is exceptional all around. Hell my hubby and I have been going for so long they already know us. Either for a walk in (cause I haven't looked at my face in a bit) or to make an appointment.

This business started out small, but it has grown and is proof that they are doing something right! :)

If you have never tried threading, but prefer to get waxed instead they have that too. From top to bottom all of it can be taken off. Smooth as a baby's booty. That I deal with from the neck down *wink*

Threading is precise
Service is always top notch 
AND they make me feel like I have eyes again. lol!"
5,"I worked with on Q when my wife and I were looking for a house. They were courteous and professional, and worked hard to make the process as easy and painless as possible. We worked specifically with Eric. He is just about the hardest worker I've encountered in any industry. He always exceeded my expectations, and made sure to go above and beyond to get us the best house and price possible."
5,They are amazing team they know what there doing not like other tint company.. I recommend this business to any one who wants tinting windows..come to this company....
5,"I was very impressed with the tint done here, it took them about 3 hours to get done and it turned out great. The tint is very high quality for a very reasonable price. Will definitely be recommending this place to others"
5,"I visited Idolize for the first time yesterday for a facial. I was a bit hesitant on having a spa treatment at a place in a strip mall. I couldn't have been more wrong! My facial with Jane was the best I've ever had. She was professional, friendly and gives an awesome facial. She gave helpful information but wasn't pushy or focused on selling products like I've experienced with last facials. The facial room is welcoming with calming music and a heated bed. I also added on an enhancement, neck and shoulder massage, which was such a terrific add on. Already looking forward to visiting again soon."
5,"I needed a wine fridge STAT since my wine collection was arriving the next day. I called the store and talked to one of the sales staff and set a time to come in at look at their stock.  I found a floor model that had a minor defect and the sales man knocked $20 off the price.  Why did I give this location a five star rating?  Read on friends.  This was a Sunday afternoon.  Because of my work schedule and their delivery schedule I wouldn't be able to get the fridge delivered until the following weekend.  When you have seven cases of wine showing up on Monday, you don't want to wait until the next Saturday!  So what was their solution?  The sales man put the fridge in the back of his car and delivered it to my house that evening - free of charge and on his own time!!!  THAT is customer service and that is why Spencer's has earned a customer for life.  I do wish I could remember the sales mans name though... Thank you Spencer's sales guy!!!"
5,"I had a mani/pedi with Zoe and she was amazing.  Friendly, polite, and professional.  She pays a lot of attention to detail.  Best mani/pedi I've ever had - relaxing massage and perfect cuticle trim.  Just called to schedule another appointment with Zoe.  She's the best!"
5,"My 13 year old fridge completely gave out and my dishwasher is about to do the same.   I needed a very short term financing option due to the unexpected expense.  I went into Spencer's where I was greeted , and I gave them the ""just looking.""   They said ""great; just let us know if you have any questions.""   They kept their distance until I glanced over, and was quickly introduced to salesman John Zamora.  He was knowledgeable, kind, patient with my 1000 questions, showed me several options and made the sale.   Low pressure, which is the only way I'll buy.  I was in and out of there in 1 hour.  As I'm writing this, my appliances are being installed, only 14 hours after walking through the door the night before. Extremely pleased with the buying experience, service and staff at San Tan Spencer's.   I'll update after the install and if any follow up service is needed, I'll let you all know how that goes!  I should note I've purchased previous appliances, a water softener and water heater from Spencer's and they've never let me down.  UPDATE:  Installers were great.   Excellent experience at Spencer's."
5,Truck completed in 1 1/2 hours and looks great. Got a quote a month before and the guy still remembered me coming in. Great service.
5,Our bartender April was great.  Fantastic brunch and great location near Aria and The Shops @ Crystals
5,"The last time my wife and I were at this Denny's location the experience was sub-par at best.  The food was blah the service was blah and the price of everything was really high for what you got.  That was about 2-3 years ago and we have not been back.  

Today, my wife and I decided to use a coupon we got from one of those school coupon books and I can say that we were not real thrilled to go.  However, we decided to try things again.  Man, were we surprised!!!!  There was a complete 180 degree turnaround from before!!!  The service was fantastic and the food was delicious!!  Norma was our server and she did a fantastic job!  She brought us our coffees right away and gave us a chance to look at our menus.  From there she always made sure we were happy and kept our drinks filled!  The prices also appear to have changed and have become more reasonable.  I have to say that we will definitely be back.  I applaud the changes that have been made and I highly recommend locals to check this place out again!!  You will not be sorry!!!!!!!!"
5,"This is my first yelp review ever, and this place is deserving of it. I work and live right down the road, so this place has become a staple.  They have this huge 16 inch burrito  (no joke) super reasonably priced and to mirror the review before me, the food is outstandingly fresh.  Recommend for good authentic burritos!"
5,I immediately wanted to explore this restaurant when I knew that it was open! The restaurant is stations and beautiful. The appetizers were amazing! I especially loved the grilled squid. The sushi sampler also looks like a good deal. Our entree orders were also tasty. There were a lot of seafood going on the rolls. And you get really full if you try to finish the whole dish.
5,"For the second time, I went to Idolize Dilworth for a facial with Jane and can't wait to go again!  I've been diligent about checking Groupon regularly and every time one pops up for this place, I immediately purchase!

Jane is a phenomenal aesthetician and I prefer to go to her over other day spas - and I've tried a number of them here in Charlotte.  The facials are extremely relaxing and I come out with a great glow on my skin.  I HIGHLY recommend getting the add on scalp massage - wow is it amazing!

Overall, definitely give this place and Jane a go!"
5,"Been to the pub several times and it is solid pub food. The service is always quick and so is the food service. Food is at your table honestly probably within 10 minutes of ordering. I've tried the pub burger, the Ruben, the breakfast sandwich, and the French dip. I really have no complaints about any of them. The thing they all have in common is that they're all relatively simple and classic but very, very good! Too many places nowadays have too many different flavors packed into their dishes. A burger doesn't need a zillion things on it to be good, it just needs good ingredients, and I feel like that's what the pub has. Also the fries are seriously good! They're crunchy without being hard and still soft in the middle. Great place for a couple beers and some good food!"
5,"We just signed up with On Q to manage a rental property that we have in Mesa and they have been GREAT.  We had a previous prop management company that was poor and as a result, our property sat vacant for 3 1/2 months.  Until of course, we found On Q.  Within a few weeks, repairs were done and our place was rented!!! The communication is excellent and their entire system of constant updates (including pictures) via their web portal is the best.. very efficient.   

Great property management company for out of town owners.  Overall a great business model."
5,"great place for families, not crowded, quite, clean and nice.
WiFi is very bad so if you got HotSpot make sure you bring it with you. And if your cell is with ATT avoid West wing or at least get top floor, otherwise forget about LTE or 4G, my iPhone 5s barely gets one signal bar and phone calls all go to voicemail.."
5,"The food...plain and simple...it's great. Get the whole chicken, mashed potatoes, street corn casserole, and half stuffed avocado and enjoy the food coma. The sauces they have rival other places, especially the chimichuri sauce. Get extra. You'll need it. Good beer selection and cool upstairs patio area."
5,"I have been so happy with On Q. Property management. They always keep me updated on my property . Each month I get a statement and my money is deposited the same time each month. They are great!
I know how good they are because before them I had a management company who would never give me my rental income. Every month I had to call them to see when I would get my money. Twice my renters moved out and they never let me know. I had no idea who was in my house. I was shocked when I switched to On Q and had the lease transferred. Instead of 1 guy, they had a family of 8 living there. 
The best thing I ever did was switch to On Q!"
5,"Over the past two years, we've replaced five kitchen appliances at Spencer's, and each time they beat prices at Home Depot and Lowe's. Our most recent buy was a GE double oven. A few days after it was installed, we noticed a small nick in the display. We contacted our salesperson, Shane Vineyard, and he arranged for GE to send us a replacement display and have it installed. 
 
If you're looking to buy an appliance or TV, I'd highly recommend this store."
5,"Made reservations for a special night here. The food was delicious and the service was more than quality from the moment we stepped into the restaurant to leaving. I must say, the overall experience was lovely. I would certainly recommend The Octagon restaurant to anyone looking to eat out in a friendly yet classy and beautiful setting."
5,"Make an appointment with Waverly!! She is a perfectionist beyond measure. In a world where there is a salon on every corner, the need for someone that goes above and beyond is a must. She is that!! In a salon with a homely store front, but will exceed your expectation in style and decor. Up to date music, great atmosphere, and warm friendly smiles make it a comfortable choice. Try out Shine!! You will fall in love."
5,"Tanner Lee was fabulous. Quick to give answers, and a load of useful information."
5,"I love love love this place!!! I have been coming here since they opened. Yes, they may be more expensive than other places, but I have tried those ""other"" places and I have been  disappointed by them!! If I ever have a problem with something it's always fixed quickly! My mom and sisters all come here and they love it just as much. I will never go to another place again! 

I also love that they get to know you by name & always make you feel welcomed. Or when you've been away for awhile they are excited to see you again.  I am truly happy with this nail shop and I will continue to come here!"
5,"Went to the blow dry 101 here and had a phenomenal time! I really think this may have been my favorite elite event to date!

The Shine staff are the coolest ever- and just so friendly and approachable. Mark gave me that ""cosmo-esque"" look I was looking for and all through the night I received so many compliments! He gave me the confidence and tools to try the look myself.I look forward to making an appointment with him shortly - as I believe I found my new stylist (and his prices are super reasonable!) 

Drinks were fannnntastic ! They had some Vitamin water cocktails (mmm), yummy wine, cheese, crackers, and fruit. They were not skimpy  and more than once did someone offer me a re-fill.

The make-up experience with Jeffree Scott was helpful as well - He uses all natural make-up to give you a polished look while being eco-friendly. He offers make-up bag makeovers too! I tried out some of the awesome products in the swag bag (yea, the swag bag was swoon worthy) and I really enjoyed them so I'd love to meet with Jeffree again as long as I am prepared to part with my  super-old favorite Clinique eye shadow (they discontinued that color ): ( ...as Jeffree said old make-up is akin to sleeping in an airport bathroom..yikes).  

Thanks Nicole, Shine Salon, Jeffree, and Vitamin Water for one of the best Friday nights I have had in a long time!"
5,Kevin Rymer is the BEST! You're Crazy if you shop anywhere else ( including Home Depot & Lowe's). They'll beat anyone's prices!! Call Kevin at the San Tan Store!
5,"We travelled over 1 hours after hearing about Bambu from California opened up in Arizona. After that horrid trip with no A/C in a 120° F weather we finally make it to this place. As we step into the shop the cold A/C blowing against the face.... ahhh it felt like satisfaction. This place was crowded, but, everything went by smoothly and fast. The staffs were friendly and speeds things up to get everyone drinks ASAP. We ordered the che #1 Bambu Special (coconut, pandan jelly, longan, basil seeds, coconut juice topped with ice on top) and #15 Thousand Eyes (basil seeds with grass jelly). Overall, they were delicious and quenches our thirst. Would I ever travels over a hour just to go here again? Of course. :)"
5,"Best taco in town hands down. No kidding. Jimmy Hula's has so many varieties (fish, pork, steak, chicken, veggie...) and so many ways they cook each option. Grilled, blackened, BBQ, fried... They put a Hawaiian spin on many. The place has a real island feel to it. Cold beer, Indoor/outdoor feel. The guy with the dreadlocks is such a happy fellow. I'm so glad I found this place."
5,The service was great. Everyone was so sweet. I came on a bit of a hectic day and I had made my reservation just that morning since they had an opening. James custom mixes my color and gave me a gorgeous cut. I've received nothing but compliments. Plus an all over color (Two mixes) and then a hair cut (drastic transformation) was only $100. I've normally paid $120 at other places. I will be seeing him again for sure!!!
5,"Fish bowled into VEGAS from AZ! WhatDa.. google map Automotive Tint and THIS SPOT CAME UP. no appointment, no call ahead, & Josè help a lot explaining everything, and tint was done in couple hrs! AWESOME service. Tint looks dope on da car now."
5,"My favorite place to go in Charlotte for threading! 

Nitu is my favorite girl, she works Saturday's and Sundays! She does a wonderful job, takes her time, and will make your jaw drop when you see the results. 

I'll be back time and time again!"
5,What a pleasure working with such a quality group of people! They are professional through and through. So rare to find these days! They always get the job done with old school attention to details.
5,"Just wanted to say thank you to Spencer's Appliances at San Tan in specific to Dwayne Dixon who was very compassionate and understanding to my family. He gave us exceptional customer service and went above and beyond to help us out in getting our appliance needs taking care of, along with somethings he really didn't have to do but did for us. I will definitely recommend to my family and friends if they need appliance's Spencer's is the place to go. Oh and just ask for Dwayne he is fantastic."
5,LOVE THIS SPOT. I'm not from Charlotte but have my bachelorette party this weekend and am here on business. It's always risky finding a new salon to get my eyebrows done at when I'm on the road so I make sure to read a lot of reviews and I'm so glad I found this spot! It's cheaper than what I'm used to paying but the attention to detail and service is definitely right on par which I'm very happy with!! So excited to take photos this weekend with my eyebrows looking so fly!
5,"I am having the dairy free/ gluten free ""Fruit Addict"" dessert and it's tasty! It's not over the top sweet and you get a medley of fruit/tapioca/jelly in coconut milk."
5,We went with a group for lunch. For many it was the first time at a hibachi. All enjoyed. We were happy with the price and amount of food we received. Plan to go again soon.
5,Luxurious Chinese food restaurant!!!!! Nice decoration and good service! Waiters are hospitable and friendly and kind! It's really worthy to go ! And now it has discount of about 10% off!
5,"I moved to Phoenix from Southern California and am used to delicious Mexican food. Since living here, there are only two authentic Mexican food spots that taste delicious and this is one of them. Carne Assad burrito and the shrimp plate ( I think it's called diablo shrimp) are the best."
5,Went for lunch with the family. And our server Jeanie was wonderful. Definitely will come back and request to be seated in her section.
5,"I have high standards of authentic Mexican food. This place hands down the best in valley.  Burritos well put together, not greasy and great after a long day at Wet n wild. The location is next to freeway but this is definitely the pace to go if you want a giant burrito. There is tequila and imported beer with plenty of seating.  10 of 10"
5,"This is the best place I know of in Pittsburgh for a quick + healthy lunch. If you're looking for a bowl of flavorful vegetables, they have you covered. 

The staff is also consistently very friendly."
5,Just had my first facial at idolize! It was a great experience!  Jane is great and the whole hour was sooooo relaxing.  I got the blackhead removal service and it was extremely helpful!  She made recommendations for at home treatments.  Will go back to see her ASAP!
5,"I have no idea why there are any bad reviews?  One review speaks of 'an old lady and daughter' and there is not that at Beverly Nails, so maybe some of the bad reviews are about another Beverly Nails.  This one is at the Signal Butte and Southern intersection.  I went over the holidays.  The staff is very funny, social, talkative and speak good English.  There are three men and any and all of them are amazing!  Jackie is boisterous and funny! They are very fast and efficient.  As for the spa part, they do wax and tint brows and lashes and Jackie is even certified for microblading which she does on Sundays by appointment.  The pedicures are sanitary.  They place a bag in the tub prior to the water and after , disinfect .  I have been back every two weeks since Christmas.  There may be other great salons but I found beverly nails, liked it and found no reason to look elsewhere."
5,Amy and her crew made my PURPLE hair come alive for National Epilepsy Awareness month (November)!  Thank you for making this special month BIG!  Awesome creativity and super nice people.
5,"I was a little worried about staying here, I booked it through Expedia and it was at a affordable price..so I'm like why not..I loved this place...checking in was fast and easy..got a room on the second floor..got a small suite..it included one bed and a small kitchen..( bed was very comfortable)..it was clean..NO NOISE!! Which was a big plus...a little far from the strip...the pool was nice...and Walgreens was just steps away...will definitely come back here.."
5,We took my wife and her sisters here for a birthday party and had a great experience. Friendly skilled staff and a lot of fun for all of us. We will be coming back!
5,"Best brows done ever!!!!

Kimi is the best eye-brow Artist. She will give you the perfect most natural look no matter what. 
She nicely re-shaped my eyebrows since the first time.  I came to Idolize in desperation, because the woman who had done my eyebrows a year and a half ago in another place previously had completely ruined them. I had to wait a long time for my eyebrows to grow and get back to a point where I could feel comfortable again to trust someone else. Kimi is amazing, sweet, and professional she really knows what she is doing. I'm so happy I met her."
5,"I have been using OnQ now for over 4 years to manage a rental property that I have which is 180 miles from where I live. They have always been very responsive and done a good job. But in the past year, Ryon Genet took over the position of the person that I work with directly. He is very very quick at answering any emails I send or answering any questions I may have. He has made suggestions and has overall provided even a greater level of service. 

I am happy to recommended OnQ for your property management needs in general, and Ryon Genet specifically because he will get the job done for you!"
5,Love my color and cut by Cam Daniel!!! After moving from CT I had the worst time finding someone who could understand what I wanted I spent hundreds of dollars to get exactly what I didn't want until I found Cam!!! I am used to the best of the best and so glad I found him!!! I have gotten so many compliments on my hair lately and so glad I finally found the best stylist and colorist !!!! Highly recommend Cam but always hope as busy as he gets he will always find time for me! Thank you Cam!!!!!
5,"Blow Dry 101 blew me away! I was paired up with Mark who patiently took me from completely hair-tarded to someone who might actually have a clue.  His infinite patience, knowledge and skill was wonderful.  I learned that I really only need to have a few tools and products to have  quick and easy great hair day every day...my problem was I had all the wrong ones and was fighting my hair every day to no avail.  I heart Mark and Shine Salon!!!!!!!"
5,"My wife and I stoped here for the Lobster Rolls and a cocktail, very nice, the service was good, the Lobster Rolls were excellent and the cocktails were just ok, over all a good experience and we'll be back."
5,"This place is great.  I came in with 4 other people to get pedicures.  They have a ton of massage chairs and we were able to all have our pedicures at the same time.  They brought us wine and when they heard it was one of our birthdays, they even parlayed a birthday song.  

We visited on 3/20 and I waited to write the review to make sure the pedicure lasted and it is still going strong.

I would recommend this place based on the pleasant staff and quality work."
5,I've been struggling for years trying to find a place to get my eyebrows threaded without leaving me with two straight lines as brows. I am beyond happy that I finally found it! I've tried many salons but always end up disappointed. I like to keep my brows thick and arched. I went  to Idolize after a month of growing and the lady did some magic!! I absolutely love them. I never had my brows looking this good. I will definitely keep coming here! :)
5,I love this place! I used to go all the time in California and now there's one here so I'm pretty hooked. Get the Bambu combo!!
5,"Had a great last experience at Beverly Nails. I believe the man who did my nails was named Steven. He did the dip powder/S&S and did a phenomenal job and was incredibly nice. He showed me some of his work which was pretty impressive and I'm going back again to see him and I'm hoping he can hook me up with some of what he showed me for pictures. Ask to see them, they're impressive! As always, wish they'd be more open to tipping on a card because I just hate having to get cash prior but understand fees stink. Otherwise, 5/5."
5,"Wow, really tasty! I got a build your own stir-fry with chicken, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, fried shallots and sesame seeds and the red curry sauce. Absolutely delicious and only slightly, pleasantly spicy."
5,"My wife and I purchased several items from this Spencer's location about 6 months ago. 
Everything has been fine until last week. 
Our 70"" TV just stopped working out of the blue.
I promptly called Spencer's and they put me in touch with the warranty repair company. 
A week later the parts came in. They showed up today to replace the parts and another component failed. They told me they would have to order more parts and that it would be another week. Not their fault, but I wasn't happy at the thought of going another week without our TV. 
I called Spencer's today and talked to the manager and told him my situation. I asked to have a brand new TV since I didn't want to go without for another week. He said he would call me back after checking his options.
As promised he called me back. He called the manufacturer representative and got a special exception to get us a new TV. 
I am happy to report that I got my new TV installed today!!
That is the definition of customer service!  They went above and beyond to make a customer happy!
I would highly recommend these guys at this location!!! Thanks again Spencer's."
5,"I want to comment on our server named Joe who works at this locarion. Joe was very upbeat,  polite and attentative;  a please to meet.   if I ever come back to this Denny's again, I hope Joe won't be there and has moved on to bigger and better things; he deserves more."
5,Everyone ILA is now managing this location! Which is great because it's closer to where I live  They do such a wonderful job with eyebrow threading! I'm sure they are great with everything else they do but I'm only sure about the eyebrow threading from experience. I've been coming to ILA at idolize for a few years now and I've never been disappointed!
5,Had to take my 2016 Kia Rio5 into Auto Tint Express to have my window tint installed. They did a fantastic job.
5,I booked an appointment with Jason for haircut based on his good reviews. I'm so glad I did! I needed to cut layers and side swept bangs. Jason did an excellent job and his assistant did an amazing blow dry! I had an event to attend to yesterday and I can't tell you how many compliments I received for my hair! Thank you Jason and Courtney for giving me the look I wanted! I will be back soon ;)
5,"Along with a few other yelpers, I attended the blow dry 101...   SOOO great.  The staff at Shine was friendly, approachable, and incredibly talented.  They took the time to listen to what I wanted from my hair, taught me how to do it, and made sure that I could recreate it back home.  I will be seeing Mark from now on as my new stylist.   Thanks Shine!"
5,Delicious shrimp tacos!! Their burritos are huge and inexpensive and most importantly delicious. Blanca helped me with my order and gave me recommendations of what to try. Definitely coming back.
5,"I love this place and come here for lunch as often as I am in the neighborhood.  I'm a salad-plus-protein guy, and you can have one on the menu or create your own (my preference). The ingredients are always fresh and very tasty, and they get it to you fast. And the people here are wonderful: friendly (""welcome to Honeygrow!"" every time); they get your order right, and they are really conscientious about great customer service.  Today it was Keisha who was so friendly and nice; on other days, it's others.  I'll be back, many times."
5,"Love the upstairs patio! Bartender up there was very friendly and making sure every table had was they wanted. First time, so didn't know if they brought your food to you if you're upstairs (they do!) plus you can order up there with the bartender and they'll call it down. Food was amazing and great drink specials!"
5,best place in town for milk tea at a reasonable price!! their oolong tea is amazinggg.
5,Fast professional work. Friendly staff. Reasonable price. No pressure. Showed us the completed work. Would do business with again.
5,I LOVE the staff here! They remember me every time I come in and know exactly what eyebrow shaping I want. Ila and the rest of the staff take their time and chat with you. Can't say enough positive things. The establishment is very clean and comfortable.
5,"First time here today, and wow do they have phenomenal food!! I got a country style breakfast burrito with pico and sour cream added. Wow. The eggs and potatoes are so fresh, I am so glad I just found this place so randomly! Definitely will make this a necessary stop weekly."
5,Wow!! This was even better than I thought. I got the Thai salad and it was exactly what I needed with all the freshness. Also Santos was phenomenal as friendly.
5,"We have been on the road for a week, staying at a different hotel each night. 
It was such a pleasure to arrive at this Hampton Inn, it is new, fresh, clean with quality finishes and lovely rooms. 
When we arrived we realized that we had mistakenly made our reservation for the previous night. The women at the front desk were very understanding, and gave us a room comp for the night. No hassles about being a no show, or having to pay a cancellation penalty. They were instantly on our side. A breath of fresh air from the other front desks we have dealt with this trip.
Also they have great breakfast with real scrambled eggs and turkey sausage, fresh ripe fruit and waffles. 
Even though it's an airport hotel, there are good restaurants (Table 4) a ten minute drive away."
5,"I am staying here for an extended period of time.  Every morning they have excellent breakfast with muffins, assortment of bread, fruit, eggs etc.  The staff at hotel are extremely friendly and helpful.  I am staying in a king studio which is very nice.  Price is very very good.  For those who want las vegas ""experience"" the strip is like 15 minutes away.  I would def stay here again."
5,Actually had to update my review seeing as my pedicure paint job lasted with shine and no chip longer than I have ever experienced. The lady who helped me was very friendly and engaging. I will be back.
5,"Hair. I have had meltdowns in salons with a horrible dye job or cut. Hair matters. I hate sounding like a superficial person- but really- I love my hair. I don't just trust any person with scissors. 

I have gone to the typical Charlotte salons- Modern and Carmen, Carmen. I have been to a few others. I always left either with a full blown panic attack or absolutely bored with my haircut. 

And then I went to Shine. Mark is my stylist and he understands my hair. He has not tried to cut it short (seriously- every stylist seems to want to chop it all off), he works with my curls and he understands that I also love my hair straightened. 

It is comfortable. Not pretentious. A lot of fun (which getting my haircut is normally a painful experience- not a fun one)

The only negative? Shine is known. It is used to be a little secret. I make appointments MONTHS in advance to see Mark. He is always booked. Awesome for him- a little sad for me."
5,On Q have amazing people on board. My agent for my rental property is Ryon Genet. This guy is awesome and so patient. I have had over 100 questions and he is always quick to reply. I've had my days where I was rude and Ryon did not deserve it. He still treated me with kindness and respect. He met all my needs and took care of any issues I had.  Ryon thank you for your service and kindness. And most of all thank you for being patient with me. Thank you for all you do!
5,"My favorite place to get delicious and healthy food worth the money. Honeygrow has the freshest salads and also a variety of options for stirfry. Honeygrow is my go to lunch break restaurant. The staff makes this a five-star place to eat. One time, during my takeout order, the members forgot cheese crisps on one of my favorite salads, the walnut street noodle. I called them just to make them aware in case they had new staff members making the meals for takeout orders. The managers and staff were nothing but friendly and helpful, and offered for me to come back for them (while giving a little extra as well). This place won't disappoint, try their food today!"
5,Normally to re-tint my '90 Honda civic hatchback would cost over $250. This guys are affordable and the quality of film they use are used by top dealers. My car took more than 4 hrs to do and they did an excellent job with lifetime warranty.
5,"I had been fighting for appointments at the Benefit Brow Bar for years before finding IDOLIZE. Honestly, the threading made me wary as I thought it would be less precise. I was very wrong. 

You don't need an appointment for threading. I've always walked in, even during busy times after work, and I've never waited more than 5 minutes. Why? Because it's SO fast! It takes a few minutes and always looks impeccable. It definitely took the hassle out of keeping up with my eye brows.

If you're worried about Dilworth parking which is sometimes a headache, they're in the shopping center with the Harris Teeter so there's always plenty of parking right in front."
5,"I've been seeing Rosie for my waxing needs for longer than I can remember, but a year ago, she started me on the PCA facial peels. The results have been fantastic for me - brighter, smoother skin, and a regimen I use regularly at home. Seeing Rosie every month for this treatment is a treat for me, but also worth the investment!

In addition to the great, visible results, the best part of the experience is the time with Rosie, who is sweet, funny, and always makes me feel comfortable and welcome."
5,"Great place, great food.  Friendly service and very attentive. Busy in the evenings. Been here several times. We have brought our out of town friends and they loved it. Recommend this place highly."
5,"James is an amazing stylist! I was with my prior stylist for about 15 years and I just wasn't happy with my hair or her advice on how to fix it, so I finally found another stylist closer to work in uptown Charlotte. My new stylist did a better job, but I still didn't love my hair. I searched Angie's list, yelp, etc for reviews and finally found Shine Salon and, most importantly, James.  

James was the first stylist who truly and carefully listened to what I liked and didn't like a out my hair and asked thoughtful questions about what would/wouldn't scare me before he put his brilliant and creative mind to work on my hair. After returning to the office after my first visit with James, my colleagues mouths dropped open and they said WOW your hair looks fantastic. I hate writing a review like this for selfish reasons - I want to keep James all to myself... I've since made an appt for my daughter-n-law to see him in a few weeks - I can't wait to see his creative transformation on her hair."
5,"Absolutely love this place! My favorites desserts  are #3, #6 and #10! Oh and I can't forget about the best Vietnamese coffee they have!! It's clear to say I'll be a regular here!"
5,Go to Waverly! I have seen her 3 or 4 times now and every time she does an outstanding job. I had an ombre gone wrong incident before seeing her and she totally turned it around. We're phasing my hair back to my original blonde that I want and I love it. Her attention to detail and listening to exactly the cut and color I want are spot on. My go-to stylist in Charlotte!
5,"Love my tinted windshield from Auto Tint Express.  Amazing team and great customer service.  This is a late review, but I got the window tinted and it keeps the car cool and helps with the bright Las Vegas sunlight. 

Jose was fast and knows his stuff.  Great quality product, solid work and again the service was great!

Highly recommend it Auto Tint Express."
5,"Had a great stay here. Everyone was super accommodating, we had an early morning airport call and they made special breakfast bags for us since it was before the time for breakfast. Would recommend this for anyone and will definitely stay here again!"
5,"I am really impressed with their available selection. never thought I would see a well designed che ba mau cup, can't beat the location"
5,Always amazing food for a great price.  The chicken dinner with greens beans and corn is the best I've had.  Beats out all other highly rated chicken I've tried in the area.
5,"IDOLIZE was recommended to me by a neighbor since I just moved to the area, and I was looking for a good place to get my eyebrows threaded.  I'm pretty particular about my eyebrows (some may say a little obsessive even,) I usually get them threaded every two weeks and I'm also very picky about their shape. Well, I've been at IDOLIZE  twice already and I'm very satisfied. I also tried out their waxing services - I was pleased. 

- Friendly and professional staff.
- Clean place.
- Fair Prices.
- Monthly Waxing Specials.
 
Four and Half Yelps"
5,Oh my my! I went in and had the best cut and color of my life. I got something totally different but in a good way. The stylist showed me how to maintain the look at home it was really a great experience. I also love the setting how there are just a few chairs in each room everyone is chatty and friendly. When I was done the stylist next to me came over and said how great it looked really made my day! I will be back you guys are awesome :)
5,The staff at this hotel was amazing from the van drivers to the housekeeping dept. I was always greeted with a smile and the breakfast was great as well. Kudos to all that made this stay great for my birthday.
5,"Delicious! Had the number 12 taro che drink and i enjoyed it. A little on the thicker side and was not expecting that, but I do like the fact that you can choose two topping add-one for free. The owner was also super chill and friendly."
5,"I have some curly & big hair and this Southern weather does not make anything easier when it comes to a style or cut.  I stumbled upon Shine after attending Yelp's Blow Dry 101. 

Attempting to be more of a grown up, I figured I should refrain from getting my hair cut at Super Cuts ( not trying to hate on Super Cuts).

I love my hair and usually end up crying after I get a hair cut because it seems like nothing ever goes well. 

Shine was completely different. Even though I do not get my hair cut every six weeks, I didn't feel judged for my clearly horrible split ends! My stylist actually listened to what I wanted in a cut and added his own trendy twist. 
With curly hair, it's hard to get a cut that I love wearing either curly or straight, but this new do I can rock which ever way I choose. 

Beyond the great cut, I love the feel of the Salon-small, trendy and very clean! The huge chalkboard wall in the wash room, it adds lots of color and style! 

I left with a new style and smile- couldn't have been happier!"
5,I have light/thin eyebrows so waxing does an ok job. I've never had threading before and I wanted to give it a try. I saw this location coming out of the grocery store one day. I checked it out and I was impressed with everything. I was in and out in no time. I have been to Ila twice now. I finally have a nice arch and I don't have to fill them in everyday if I don't want to. I'll be back real soon for a facial too!
5,"We absolutely love the drinks at BAMBU. They use real fruit in their drinks. They're generous with their toppings, and boba is cooked well. My daughter and i love coming here for our boba fix."
5,"Went here for my sisters birthday. Ben was our Hibachi Chef, he was funny and great! Our server was also very pleasant and made sure our drinks were always full. The food was amazing! Brought my daughter who isn't even one yet and they were very baby friendly and accommodating. Everyone we encountered was extremely nice and ginuwine. We will definitely come back again."
5,"Ok, so all I have to say is I NEVER even hear the airport!  I come to Las Vegas at least twice a year and always stay at this hotel.  My last trip was on the first on the second weekend in December and I loved it.  The staff is very friendly and check-in and out was a breeze!  I love that it is so reasonably priced yet still close to the strip and they even have a shuttle service!  No brainer there!  One thing I hate is rooms that smell old and musty or when you check-in after a long day of travel and something doesn't work.  I have never encountered any of that here...ever.  The Manager, Pamela, even greeted me and asked me to enjoy my stay.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas for business or pleasure."
5,Great place to watch football and hang at the bar. Good selection of beers on tap. Friendly bartenders and located next to the Aria hotel and Crystals shopping center. They also have a daily happy hour from 3pm-6pm where the offer $6 food and drink specials.
5,Salad was filling. Staff was very friendly. Ingredients were fresh. My modified order was accurate. Would come back.
5,I recently purchased a new house in Gilbert. I needed a new refrigerator because the house did not come with one. I did some shopping at the big box stores and online. A coworker suggested Spencer's. I went to the San Tan Village location where I met Kevin Rymer. I told Kevin what I was looking for. Kevin quickly gave a quote on the model I wanted and I was very happy with the price. I ordered the fridge and had it delivered on a Saturday. The Spencer's delivery guys did a great job of unpacking the refrigerator and hooking up the ice maker. They cleaned up the packing materials before they left and took them with them. I was so happy with the experience I ordered a washer and dryer from Kevin a couple weeks later. Kevin gave me great pricing and the delivery/set up went great.
5,"Love, love, love this salon. Danny and Mya have created a salon that feels like a friend's living room. The services are excellent and of the highest quality. By far the best nail salon I have ever gone to. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!"
5,"Amazing and fantastic service by the installations crew - I could not have found anything better.

We are new to the area.  The prior owner stated SPENCERS had worked on his inhouse needs.  I called SPENCERS home installation team, and was greeted with knowledgable and courteous service.  

The Challenge:
Hang (including hide wires in wall) 2 televisions - 1 was very large
Hook up all components (DVDVBlueRay, Surround Soundm Wii)
Connect all in-home speakers to my iPhone, so I can play any music throughout the house.

I am an educated person, but put me around TV/stereo components and I look like a deer in the headlights.

THANK YOU to Jake Airey of the installation team for his excellent communication, knowledge, customer service (did not make me feel like a deer in the headlights) and ability.

When part of my components were ""out of date"", he gave me options.  All of the prices he gave me were lower than what I could have bought them for (yes I checked - even beat the popular 2 day delivery service).  His honesty and credibility (knowledge) came to light when he advised me I did not need a piece of equipment originally thought; he was able to complete the task without it.

Communicated about service time and was always on-time.

Jake and the Spencer Instalation team is my only go to - HIGHLY RECOMMEND - He/They exceeded my expectations.  They were not happy unless I was happy; those are not just words but a motto they lived by.

THANK YOU !!!!"
5,Man I love this place. Especially Music Bingo Friday! Get there early for a  good seat on the rooftop patio.
5,"Awesome service, great prices!! Thank you for the great customer service. Highly recommend!!! Aloha!"
5,Great tasting natural goodness.  They use real fruits / ingredients rather than chemical powders that many of these types of places use.
5,"Food was very fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the fish and shrimp tacos and the zucchini fries are awesome. Also, you can't beat the price. Highly recommend this place, we will be back."
5,"My sisters & I visited Idolize for the first time a couple of weeks ago. ILA did an amazing job on all three of us!! 

We have been threading for over 13 years & recently relocated to Charlotte. Idolize was heaven sent. Prices are reasonable and ambiance is outstanding! 

Highly recommended!"
5,The burgers are awesome! Best burger I've had in awhile definitely not a regular drive through! Super amazing food!! Definitely a must stop place!
5,"Very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. I didn't know anything about tints or types before coming in. I was told about a few options based on the grade of tint I wanted. I would recommend to a friend any day!"
5,"Amazing, we loved it. Fast service and omg the queso is so good! Can't go wrong with the Johnny Utah with pickles, pulled pork, and mac and cheese in a taco. That's right a taco! Great laid back spot to eat and have a few drinks."
5,"Hey guys, this auto tint shop is one the best shops I been to here in Vegas. I recommend this to anyone who wants to tint there car. They were fast, friendly, and they only use film that's legit and won't fade. Lastly, when there done you'll see how clean they put on their film."
5,"Love this salon! Reasonable prices, great stylists, incredibly cool decor.  I get my brows waxed, hair cut, and hair colored regularly her and love it."
5,This place had the best staff ever. I go here all the time and I cant stress enough how much fun I have here. Customers seem to know the managers and the servers by name. Its more like a family than it is a restaurant. Way to go!
5,This was the perfect place for us to stay. We were there for 5 nights. It was quiet & relaxing. The room was spacious & comfortable. Loved having a full kitchen & washer & dryer. Will definitely stay here again!
5,"I have gone to two Congee Queens so far. This one and the one near it, on Lawrence.

I want to give both 5 stars...Very low price for huge servings and fresh ingredients. They do not skimp on the ingredients either. Most importantly, they have mastered the art of making everything taste good, at least to an average Canadian.

Because this location opened up around August, the decor here is even better. They have some fancy looking lighting and decorated ceilings.

If you like Congee Queen, I would say this location lives up to the expectation."
5,"Absolutely the best haircut and style that I have ever had by Mark.  From the time you enter the salon until you leave, you are greeted by friendly staff and a warm atmosphere.  This is as good as it gets!"
5,"New car a new tint job. I love this guys job. 5 time returning costumer, I been following them for years now and they always do a great job."
5,"Staff was kind and very service oriented. The menu selection was wonderful. They had delicious, healthy options. The ordering process was very simple to use and you can modify any of the menu items to suit your diet/tastes. The decor/design was simple and pleasing.  Also, was filled up from my healthy meal! Had enough to save for later honestly. 
Mega thumbs up for this spot!"
5,"The ceaser salad is a must try as they prepare it at the table. Literally from scratch starting with the salad dressing. We had everything added in the sauce and it was delicious.

The steak was done to perfection. Nice and juicy. :) We ordered a Filet Mignon and a Peppercorn steak. Loved the peppercorn sauce. I ordered medium rare for the mignon and it came out medium rare. :)

Dessert was pretty good. Tried the coconut cream pie, but the white chocolate shavings made the tart a bit too sweet for me. The Warm moist chocolate cake, was actually a lava cake with a waffle bowl next to it filled with French vanilla ice cream? :)

The wait staff were old school and attentive. Really good service for sure. Prompt, fast, not a lot of little talk. Very professional."
5,"Love!!  Everyone in my office loves this place - we order from honeygrow at least once a week.  First time I got the sesame garlic stir fry - not spicy, but delicious - lots of fresh veg and meat.  I got the spicy garlic next and it is spicy (maybe a Thai 5 or 6) - but the pineapple cools it off and it is yummy.  Just be careful if you aren't into spicy.  Best thing on the menu is the honey bar - it is a full meal by itself!  Packed with fresh fruit - make sure to get the whipped cream!!!!"
5,"Great, no non-sense property management team. They have always done an awesome job for me managing my rentals and making my life a little easier! I highly recommend them."
5,"Excellent food and service. NO TV; No WIFI;  and thank God. 

One negative in my books. No dress code enforced. Unkept people in old dirty jeans does not enhance the experience. 

Been there a dozen times and will go back."
5,"A friend and I had lunch here and it was surprisingly great.  We had a nice quiet booth and good service.  I had the 3 roll lunch special and wasn't disappointed.  My friend had the seaweed salad and ""fancy rainbow roll"" that was beautiful and delicious.   Now I want to go back and have that myself. The restaurant is decorated very nicely and up to date.  Super lovely bathrooms - a nice surprise.  It's a little tricky to find, although just off East Washington Ave near East Towne, but well worth the effort."
5,"Excellent Mexican food with authentic taste and ""man size"" portions.  Been going here for a couple of years and had many things on the menu and never disappointed.  Great customer service and a family atmosphere and can always watch sports on TV."
5,"Bambu is awesome.
I've never had a bad drink on the menu and the team in there is super cool.
My favorite drink is the #9, the red bean special and the Bambu favorite.
They take care of my sweet tooth and if I wanted to stay and hangout, I could.
Some friends and I have bambu dates instead of traditional coffee dates."
5,"I've been meaning to leave this review!!!  I recently moved to Charlotte from NY.  Prior to moving, I had been working with my hairdresser to heal my hair.  After some bad experiences, (we've all had a bad haircut in our time, am I right?!) I'm so hesitant to try someone new.  Immediately, when I sat in Courtney's chair, I knew I was in good hands! 

I wanted to be able to keep growing my hair out (a three year process after having a pixie/Mohawk) so I wanted highlights that would let me go longer between visits.  The weather had just changed, so I also wanted a cooler tone, because I had lost my summer color.  Her consultation was thorough, she repeated back to me everything, and I truly felt so much better.

The highlights, tone, cut, and blowout, were all great!!!  Start to finish, she listened and worked her magic, and I'm so happy with the results!  I felt the need to do a review because she was so professional and thorough which, frankly, is hard to come by anymore!  Thank you again, Courtney!"
5,"I've been coming here for almost 2 years and will never have another place do my nails! I go to Lindsay every time, she is amazing with my nails and is so careful! We've become good friends and I would suggest to EVERYONE to come here :)"
5,they have changed and updated there menu to include yummy holiday items and fluffy new pancakes. kimmie was amazing and tended to all of our needs. i came in starving and have left quite satisfied.
5,Kevin is the BEST! He provided excellent customer service when my husband and I purchased kitchen appliances and a washer and dryer.  He wasn't pushy and gave the space and time needed to make a decision about our purchase. Kevin is professional and knowledgeable.
5,"This hotel is lovely and the staff is so friendly! Stayed here recently, but lived here Mon-Fri a couple of years ago, so have a lot of experience with this hotel and I'm never disappointed. It's a clean hotel. There have never been any issues with the cleanliness. They have standard rooms and suites, with comfy beds and very comfortable duvets. This location is close to the airport, shopping, and The Strip. I didn't have a car on this trip, and they have a couple of pretty good restaurants close by.
They have 24-hour coffee available in the lobby, as well as coffee makers and coffee in the rooms. They have a pretty nice little breakfast with quite a few options. Also, they usually have a bowl of fruit out during the day and freshly baked cookies in the afternoon and evening."
5,"Yummmmyyyy delicious food! Yummiest stir fry ever. Even my 5 and 8 yrs old absolutely enjoyed the salads and stir fry. It could be custom made, so kids selected their sauces and no spices :)
We will go again and again"
5,Good company so far no issues.  Every time I call or email i get a response and everything is fixed and taken care of.  Daniel Maldonado did the inspection friendly professional young man he was ontime and quickly finished.
5,"I'm a faithful Idolizer. I refuse to let anyone else touch my brows. I've never had a bad experience and would recommend them to anyone! The shop is always clean and inviting. A couple of years ago, I regularly saw Julie to wax my legs and she was like my friend in my head! Today I saw Bhumi and she had my brows on point! I was in and out within 10 mins. Even if there's a wait, they are quick and get you in and out. I would encourage anyone considering threading to try it. It's not painless but it's just about as painful as waxing your brows but way more sanitary and you don't tub the risk of getting burned."
5,"MacNCheese with BBQ Pork tacos, Teriyaki Chicken tacos and many more.  To top it off delicious sauces and seasoned fries. You've got my Boss sauce infused heart JH's . I'll be seeing you when taco tuesday comes a callin!"
5,"I always have a good experience here.  Maybe because I'm a good tipper:)  These ladies work hard and long hours and they are open practically allllll the time. They have a different culture which takes a little getting used to, but they have very good prices, and my nails never lift or break and my toenail polish always lasts until my next pedicare. I've been coming here for over two years."
5,"Finally, a decent Cantonese restaurant in this neighbourhood. Just like other congee queen, fast, great price, delicious. Especially want to compliment the BBQ pork section, great roast!"
5,"The best Chinese food I have ever had in my life. The honey garlic wings had actual honey and garlic shavings, not some fake honey garlic sauce. The general Tao chicken was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The rice noodles with satay sauce had the yumiest grill flavour. Excellent service and good price. Would definitely go back there again."
5,"So... I usually go to the Whitehall commons location on my side of town but I found out my favorite threader, Devki, works at the east blvd location on the weekends. Well, I'm very particular about who works on my brows so I drove all the way to east blvd to see Devki. She's that good! She's talented, but also friendly and accommodating. 
The east blvd location is very beautiful and spacious!"
5,"Shree is amazing!!!!!!! She does my eyebrows exactly how I ask (I am picky!). She is so talented, and is easily the most gentle threader I have experienced.  I have  been to the benefit brow bar and many other expensive and A-rated brow studios in Charlotte, and this is by far the best I have experienced, for more than half the price of the others. If you see the incredibly sweet Shree, you will not be disappointed. She is the best! Idolize is quick and great for walk-in appointments.  Ive been going here for over 2 years and will not go anywhere else!!!"
5,"Cold beer, hot wings, lots of TVs, friendly service and bartenders! Had trouble finding a good place to watch games on Sunday, glad I found this place! Highly recommended!"
5,"I recently visited this Idolize location for the first time. I noticed the reviews about Ila specifically and then called in advance to make sure she was working on 8/22. I visited the Whitehall location on this same day hours earlier and they were slammed (as usual) with only 1 person working. I can confirm that the person working does good work; however, I think that the quality of her work declines when she is overwhelmed with numerous customers. This is what prompted me to visit the East Blvd location. I walked in around 6:00pm on 8/22 and Ila was there with another employee. There was no wait so Ila took me to her chair right away. I told her to keep my brows as thick as possible because they are sparse to begin with. Ila was quite welcoming and asked one question about an awkward area on my right brow then immediately got to work. When Ila handed over the mirror, my brows looked amazing and thick! Now don't get me wrong, there are past instances when I've had amazing brows in Charlotte and Atlanta (my former home) but not at the rate of $12! I've always paid at least $25 and up at other brow bars and that does not include the tip. Ila exceeded my expectations, so I tipped her and then left in a matter of about 10 minutes. I will continue to visit Ila for my brows."
5,"Went to Shine yesterday for highlights on my seriously dark roots, and Charlton did such a great job!!  I had been looking through the Yelp reviews and everyone seemed to rave about Shine, plus its 10 minutes from my apt, so it seemed like a win/win!!  Charlton really took the time to talk to me and figure out what I wanted, how I wear my hair, what color would look best now and he promised he'd make my hair look gorgeous, he did!!

I got full highlights, glaze, blow out and they charge a bit more for extra dye since I have crazy thick hair, and it was sooo reasonable.  I already made a follow-up in 2 weeks to get a cut and I trust Charlton will do a great job with that as well.  Oh also, he gave me all sorts of coupons to use for a future visit, very cool.  Everyone I encountered in the salon was super friendly, really glad I gave this place a try!"
5,"Great Bird with awesome sauces.  Best macaroni and cheese on the planet.  They make it to order!
Friendliest peps work here, as well"
5,"We come to Denny's almost every week and they are always consistent. Maribel is one of the best waitresses and she always remembers what we drink and eat, even if we haven't been here for a while. 
The rest of the staff is friendly also."
5,"I only do reviews when a place really impressed me and Coaltrane's meets that criteria.  Very flavorful and diverse menu, a few good beer choices, and a little rooftop bar with a great skyline view of CLT.  Food is real quick for those late work nights when I just want a beer and a bite without cooking.  The chicken bowls are my go to but Gaucho sando is on point as well."
5,"You wanna relaxxx after hard work. So you wanna love a place of feeling from stress and tension. Come to the Tahiti. You got bathtub jacuzzi's you have an outstanding hit jacuzzi and Sandy beachy pools you got an outdoor grill man -Winterman- you have what you want let your mind free from troubles and problems you need those tensions relaxing and gone relax at this beautiful Resort a place to be to stay for the greatest best of your enjoyment a place you can release all your stress and let it go freely love it like it don't hate it.

A great and beautiful timeshare to be at enjoy your life because this place makes you last for ever!!!!!"
5,"Absolutely wonderful place to stay! I was in Las Vegas for my high school reunion, and had found Tahiti on Expedia. Our room was a king and it is by far the nicest hotel room I've ever seen! The bathroom was spacious and having the kitchenette was great! The room was clean and spacious. 

The staff were amazing! They made us feel welcome and went all out to guarantee that we took advantage of our trip. They treat you like an old friend and are very helpful for whatever need you might have. The pool and barbeque area are great! The pools were a trip, with the sandy beach in the shallow ends. 

The Tahiti is a nice base if you want to relax. You're close enough to the Strip and if you want to gamble, the Orleans is just two blocks away. Tahiti is definitely for the traveler looking for a relaxing home base to explore Las Vegas from. You can go out and do whatever and know that you are returning to a nice quiet place to decompress and relax from the crazy of the city. This will be where I'm staying in all of my future trips!"
5,"The aesthetician's that thread my brows always do an amazing job. I've been going here for about 8 months and since then, I'm always receiving compliments on my brows. To achieve my desired fullness, I always request to ""just clean them up, keeping them full as possible"". That way you don't have to worry about them threading too much
Inside is very clean and nicely suited for the services they provide. While I have not tried their other services, I can vouch for their skills when it comes to threading brows!"
5,"I have tried almost everything on their menu, from their dessert drinks, to smoothies, teas, coffee and even the waffles. Everytime I've come in, I've been greeted by warm and welcoming smiles. Everything on the menu is beautifully and deliciously crafted, you can't go wrong with whatever you order! If you need help the staff will willingly assist you in making a decision."
5,"Oh dear, thanks Karen W. for getting me obsessed with this place! I live very close....too close for my own good.

They have an all-too-convenience reward points program that also reminds you too often of their existence through text reminders. If I didn't like them so much, I would probably be annoyed actually lol. For every $1 you spend, you earn a point. 10pts = free upgrade to large drink and 40pts = free drink.

I'd never had a che before so it's been a very fun new treat to explore! I have so far ordered the Fruit Addict (added red beans), Taro Lover (for the hubby) and Bambu Favorite. Not a fan of the Taro Lover. The very very large portion of taro paste in the drink made it unenjoyable. 

I just enjoyed their halo-halo (a limited time special apparently) today and it was delicious and refreshing! Nice twist to the filipino dessert and feels healthier/less sweet. Thank you Karen W. for letting me know about this new addition to the menu!

I will be visiting Bambu far too often for my own good! lol"
5,"Front end night staff are very friendly.  I called from the airport for shuttle directions and he called the driver for me and was there within 20 minutes.  Then every night, they remembered my name and asked about my day and went out of their way to get me anything i mentioned i might want during my stay.  
Breakfast is fantastic.  Board games in the lobby are great for families.  Planes were fairly constant but didn't stop me from falling asleep."
5,"Very pricey place, but shows for it- incredible service and great food. Always come here with the family for big occasions. The bread is to die for. 
Recommendations: 
Apps:
escargot, shrimp, caesar salad (portions are for at least two and they make it right in front of your table- try not to add/subtract anything because you'll be surprised at how good it is the way they make it)

Mains:
filet mignon and salmon

Dessert:
molten lava cake"
5,Love the pad Thai and the red curry is quite good too. Try them with chicken you won't regret it.
5,I really enjoy this place. The food is great each time and service is always on point. Hosts could use some customer service training but honestly I'll keep going back because the servers are great and the food has never disappointed me
5,Auto Tint Express is very knowledgeable and professional.  They got the job completed within the time they quoted me.  Plus I was able to watch Netflix movies of my choice while I waited.  I highly recommend them.
5,"Yum! Came here and grabbed a few dishes- stuffed avocado, which is larger and more plentiful than some other rotisserie places in CLT, soup, and of course the chicken. They've got a pretty laid back vibe but have definitely jazzed the place up from the old breakfast spot it used to be (RIP Country Kitchen). Prices are fair and it's never too crowded. Definitely will be back!"
5,it has been awesome working with OnQ. I have had the opportunity to talk to about 4-5 people inside the company and you can tell that they all care about doing the best job possible for the client. My experience has been superb so far. Would recommend them to anyone wanting to rent their home as an option to selling or doing it on their own. They make the process so easy and are honest. Thanks Eric!
5,Excellent steaks cooked just right and the Caesar salad made at your table best in thornhill .. Must have the shrimp cocktail just awesome and the ambiance is amazing love the ties and old fashioned style !
5,"Great accommodations, wonderful breakfast, easy to get to. Most importantly, staff here is excellent. Especially Adriana, the supervisor = extremely nice.  Faith at the front desk has been nothing but delightful. If we needed anything, it was done. I forgot some of my toiletries. They came through. We got here a little bit early before 3 p.m. check in, they said no problem whatsoever. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Vegas..."
5,This place is great. I'm from the northwest valley and there are not a lot of places like this on my side of town. Extremely laid back and casual. The variety of fish tacos and turf tacos  really has something for everyone. I will definitely be coming back!!
5,"We have purchased numerous appliances from this location, most recently a built-in double oven this week.  The experience was excellent, from sales through installation. We got a quality Kitchen Aid product at an excellent price and have absolutely no complaints."
5,This was my first time getting my eyebrows threaded and I am so glad I chose this place! I walked in around lunch time and immediately sat in the chair to get started with no wait at all. My brows have never looked so good! The ladies are very friendly and the salon is super clean. I will definitely return and highly recommend it!
5,"A Charlotte gem. Shine is an eclectic salon with a modern flair.  The old craftsman house turned salon is charming, clean and welcoming. Smiling, helpful faces await you, immediately greet you and get you comfortable with your choice of beverage. Displaying local art for sale and carrying excellent products, Shine has a lot to offer their clientele. When it was time for my appointment, my stylist was on time and I was immediately comfortable. 

Now, let's talk about my stylist, who I have now dubbed a hair demigod. Mark! Follow him on IG @markafterdark(no he did not solicit my review). I was sent to him on a referral from a dear friend. He. Is. Awesome. Hands down. I have never booked a follow up appointment with a stylist before. I booked 2 . Mark gave me a thorough consultation. We talked about the cut first, the color next and what was the best for my hair type. I have fine hair that is recovering from medication induced damage and loss. It must be babied.  He took his time and you can tell he truly loves what he does in the amount of care and time he puts in listening to you. And not in that ""I'm a stylist so we have to talk"" kind of way. 

Mark gave me the best cut and color I think I have ever had. My normally frizz prone and thin looking hair is smooth, shiny and full looking. Not to mention the orgasmic smelling products make me creepily sniff my own strands. 

He talked me through each process as he was performing so I could recreate and understand what is best for my hair at home. 

A close family member is a stylist and a good one at that! So my expectations were high. He passed!"
5,"Definitely my fav in this neighborhood. Healthy and cute. I really hope they could open before 9a haha, so that I get some breakfast on a early class day."
5,"Shine was the first salon I checked out since moving from Chicago, and I can safely say it will be the only salon as well! I was told their studio is brand new and you can definitely tell; it is gorgeous! From the moment I was greeted, everyone there was welcoming and friendly. My stylist, Hustin, was A M A Z E! He took my blonde balayage from meh to gorgeous! I would even let him make me full blonde, that's how much I have fallen in love with my color. The prices are up there, but I firmly believe you get what you pay for, and my hair is worth it. Client for life!"
5,"Recently purchased GE profile kitchen appliances and Klipsch speakers from Spencer's. Worked with Kevin Rymer. He was outstanding in customer service - guiding me where I had questions, helping me get the lowest prices, choosing products with the best rebates and he even submitted the appliance rebates for me. I would highly recommend working with Kevin at Spencer's."
5,Shree is the best. She makes my eyebrows look so good. Definitely worth the 1 hour drive
5,I have been working with Kevin Rymer at the Gilbert location for many of my home appliance purchases in multiple homes. Excellent customer service. He is always available even when away from the store.
5,"We have thoroughly enjoyed working with Austin, as he has helped us understand OnQ's management process. We are considering renting out our home and will absolutely use OnQ when we are ready! Thank you for the great experience thus far!"
5,"Great pink and white powder by Justin!! I just moved to the area and it was damn near impossible to find someone who even did acrylics in Scottsdale so I was skeptical but he delivered. I got a cute set of nails for a decent price. I highly recommend Justin for powder acrylics... gonna check out a pedicure next time. 

(Excuse my cuticles. Been cracking with the crazy change of weather.)"
5,"This is a highly professional shop. Great workmanship. Highly recommend, gast and good !"
5,Amazing Taco Tuesday Deals!!! The fish taco is $1.49 and hands down the best fish taco I have ever had! And I LOVE tacos. Eat here!!!
5,"On Q has been great, and they have made it easy for us to feel at home.  Our main contact, Ryon Genet, has made everything easy and he is always responsive.  Any time we needed to schedule any repairs for the house, he and his team makes it a friendly and professional experience.  Given that Ryon has to coordinate between us, the owner (who has also been great) and the service providers, he has made coordinating repairs very easy and pleasant.  Two thumbs up on service."
5,"Wonderful staff and nails and toes always look great! They give you three different options for pedicures, so that takes care of your needs where do you need a light pedicure or a heavy slopping of a lot of garbage on your feet. The girls were honest with me I Winyan wanting nails put on and she said your nails would look better if you had just gel polish on. So I said OK give me a gel polish. And she was right it was a lot better"
5,I've been coming here to get facial threading for over a year now and I love Idolize's consistent quality of service. I especially recommend Prinali as she is very thorough and excellent at shaping my eyebrows.
5,I've been coming to this location for a while now and ILA is the reason I started going to Idolize. She always threads my eyebrows just the way I like it.  This location is nice and clean. The staff is friendly.
5,I love this Salon more than words! I have been to almosto several different stylists there and NEVER had a bad experience! They go above and beyond and it's such a beautiful space and environment. I recommend anyone! Amazing! You will SHINE when you leave!
5,Ordered the sausage and potatoes with carrots and peas and an English Fog.  Both were excellent!  Great service.
5,"This place is great for beers and games. We had wings, pretzels, fried pickles, and onion rings. Bartenders were very attentive. Great happy hour beers."
5,Love this place. Haven't found better tasting Mexican food at this price point. Myself and my friends frequent this place all the time and it never disappoints. The Diablo Shrimp burrito is a must try!
5,LOVE me some Pub. Have been here on a few occasions and seriously love the grub over here. Service has also been stellar every visit :)
5,"Great steak house! I ordered a 8oz filet mignon medium rare. It was cooked to perfection and no issues cutting through the meat. 
Service is impeccable as well. Our water and wine was always refilled without disruption."
5,"Amazing! We had dinner tonight and enjoyed everything. The fire roasted avocado was delicious as well as our juicy kahuna burgers. Service was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is very laid back and fun but the full service and option to get a beer with dinner adds a nice touch. This is not your typical Hawaiian joint like Aloha, Rumbi, etc, and as long as you know that going into it, you will not be disappointed. The menu mostly consists of burgers (smash style) and tacos with a few salads and bowl options. The food is great, service is on point and the owner (we think) is always there and engaging and kind to all his guests. Can't wait to go back and try something else! I read some reviews that stated things that we did not encounter at all, with that being said, this is a new restaurant and people should take that into consideration when writing reviews. Cooks are still learning, servers are still finding their stride and hiccups may occur, this is normal and completely acceptable in any business. Support local, be happy and when trying new places, have an open mind!"
5,"As a Plaza Midwood Resident for the past couple of years, I have been wanting a chicken rotisserie within walking distance. My prayers were answered when Coaltrane's was introduced to our neighborhood. 

The place is similar to Viva Chicken, but there is more diversity (the wings are a great addition to the menu!). I also think their sauces are more unique and flavorful. 

My favorite items on the menu are the chargrilled wings and the fresco bowl. All ingredients of the items I've had from the menu are incredibly fresh. 

Definitely a Plaza Midwood favorite of mine. Please show them some love; you won't regret it!"
5,"I can't say enough good things about this place.

Our flight got pushed up by a couple of hours. We got to the hotel 4 hours earlier than our check-in time. They did not have a problem with us showing up early and let us check in anyway. The guy at the front tipped off on using Uber or the shuttle they offer (save the money, don't use a cab!).

A day later my husband broke out in hives with chest pains/swollen legs and needed help. I was not with him when it happened and he went up to the front lobby. The gentleman who was manning the front sat him down and ran checks on him while they called for an ambulance. Turns out the guy took medical school for 6 years. He was able to keep my husband calm until the help arrived.

After they took my husband to the E.R. the guy tried to give me a courtesy call to let me know what was happening. I was in a crowded location and could not answer the phone. They went above and beyond and sent me a text message with a summary of what happened and what the hospital name was (we are not local). 

I was able to use that information to take an Uber to my husband. 

They admitted him for a while and I took an Uber back to the hotel. When I arrived the staff took the time to ask me how my husband was doing and if I was alright (if you're curious it turns out my husband might have an autoimmune disease.)

The rooms themselves are nice and clean. Couldn't beat the price either. I will definitely come back."
5,I was looking to tint my 2015 Chevy Camaro and I found Auto Tint Express.  I was greeted by a staff member and he explained the difference between the quality of the films. I am very satisfied how my car turned out I am one happy customer.  I definitely recommend this Tint shop to anyone. I will be coming back whenever I get another vehicle.
5,Gave this place a try while spouse was next door picking up panda express. And OMG delicious! Best fish tacos I've had since moving to AZ.  It's right down the St from our new home and we will be repete customers  :)
5,Great explanation of my tint options. On the spot service. In and out in 2 hours. Reasonable pricing. Highly recommend this quality installation.
5,Great place for food and drinks !! Excellent customer service and atmosphere!! We will be definitely back !! We had the steak 'n' eggs and prime rib sandwich-- awesome!! And the best Peach Bellini in town !!
5,"Audio Tint Express is amazing ! Excellent customer service, knowledgeable about their products. They take the time to explain the tints & allow you time to make a decision. Clean waiting area with beverages & Netflix. My car looks absolutely fabulous! I couldn't be more pleased .. Thank you Audio Tint Express"
5,"I have been a Landlord since the mid 80s and have always managed tenant issues myself.  I have read some of the reviews and must admit being in property management can be a challenging business.  There are many opportunities for miscommunication and lots of variables.  With On Q I pay a minimal amount per month to have my Landlord headaches go away!  The individual assigned to my account is Rebeccah Arnett.  I am SO happy she is here for me.  She gets it done!  They communicate with the Tennant, raised the rent for me, got the agreements signed, inspected the house, got repair bids and scheduled the work.  I just see the deposit in my checking account.  Nice job On Q!"
5,"I recently purchased an investment property in the Phoenix area. I initially reached out to On Q for some general information. Eric Dixon answered all my questions and offered advice when I requested it on several matters, before I even became a client. I asked him directly about the bad reviews here on Yelp. He was very straightforward about the examples I asked him about and eased any concerns I had; I also viewed the company info on BBB and suggest anyone looking here do the same. My experience with Eric and his team has been wonderful, which includes contact with maintenance company Mammoth Services. My repair quotes were no higher than several I priced on my own, and some were actually lower even with labor costs. Every part of the process is made available to the owner via the online portal, and nothing is completed without prior approval. I am very pleased with the level of service and would definitely recommend On Q to friends and family in the future."
5,"This is a Great place, I love the hamburgers.... but once in a while I cheat and get the tacos made with boneless hot wings... its a hard choice.."
5,"Got seated right away , once we walked in. 

About 3 minutes for our drink order . 3 waters & 3 coffees ! Came quick. [1 STAR]

I didn't know what I wanted to eat , cause everything look so good , so I decided to order the ""All American slam."" The food came 10 minutes after , very quick. [1 STAR]

Restaurant was NEAT . [1 STAR] 

Our server was very polite & very nice ! 

The food was BOMB!!! Like always . 

Love dennys !!!"
5,"I decided to make this place my regular spot for nails after trying several other local places. I like this place the best because:
- it's a lot cleaner than other area salons
- the people are always friendly and seem to recognize their customers
- they keep expanding their options, including new colors
- there is enough going on that I can stay entertained while sitting through the hour-long process of getting a gel manicure
- the prices are competitive with other local salons

I've never had a bad service and I highly recommend this salon."
5,"Octagon is king for steaks and a full dining experience in York Region. Nothing I've had has ever been anything less than perfect. The details in the decor, the world class service, the preparation of the Cesar salad in front of your eyes and the massive porterhouse steaks keep me coming back. The only other steakhouse I'm willing to go to in the GTA for an upscale meal is Barbarians. Both old school and have a formula that works."
5,"Everyone at Auto Tint Express was super friendly, they helped me pick a good shade to go with for my girls 2014 corolla. Everything came out amazing and the waiting room is super nice. Free drinks and TV to watch with a comfortable couch. Definitely check them out for any vehicle you have!"
5,I have Vicki do my pedicures and she is great. She really gets in there and cleans up my nail issues. The owners have always been friendly and attentive. I only go about 5 times a year but they always remember me.
5,Affordable and great customer service! I will totally recommend their services to anyone that is looking for a tint.
5,I just had my 4th car tinted with Jose at Auto Tint Express.  The prices are very fair and the quality of work is top notch.  The tint is cut perfectly to fit every time.  The first car I have that he tinted is now 4 years old and the tint looks the same as the day it was installed.  They were very accommodating with my schedule as I was waiting on my new vehicle to arrive and then took it directly to them after taking delivery.  Couldn't be happier.
5,"I've been going to Shine for a few years now. James Vestal has been my stylist since day one and he's one of the best stylists I've ever had. His technique is on point and he really listens to what his clients want. He's also the first stylist who taught me how to style my hair after the cut rather than just leaving me to my own devices to make it look great in my everyday. I have never gotten so many compliments.

Shine recently moved locations and the space is spectacular. The hair washing stations allow you to put your feet up in a reclining chair and James' head rubs are what I keep coming back for!

The lobby offers free coffee, soda, or wine. And the staff is so friendly! Stephanie at the front desk is the epitome of great customer service and proves her understanding that customer relationships are not just built between the stylist and client in the chair.

While the prices are not exactly cheap, you definitely are getting what you pay for. It will be a sad day if/when I ever need to find a new place to go."
5,"We worked with Kevin and had a fantastic expierence. After comparison shopping around I am confident we got the best prices. 4 months later, our appliances (washer, dryer, fridge and dishwasher) are still working out great."
5,Service was great. I was taken care of right away by Lucio and explained different variations of tint. They took about an hour and a half on my car and the tint came out just how I envisioned! I recommend coming here and doing business for the price and service. I'll be coming back to get my windshield finished by these guys. Thank you.
5,"I was fiercely loyal to my NYC-area stylist, and even after I moved to Charlotte, I spent the first 6 months pilgrimaging back to my hair mecca (Aire in Jersey City, in case anyone is wondering), because I was afraid of taking a risk on someone new locally. I settled on Shine based on the reviews, and I haven't been disappointed. Chelsea does great cut and color, and I have only somewhat begrudgingly given up on trekking back up north every time my hair needs attention. All the stylists here do great work and they take their craft very seriously, learning new skills and techniques to keep delivering great hair to their clients. It's not cheap - expect to pay upwards of $150 if you're doing cut/color - but well worth it! They also use great styling products - my personal fave is the Kevin Murphy line. If you're concerned about price ambiguity among the various stylists, be sure to ask up front what to expect, since I did get a shock once when I came in just for a pre-bachelorette party wash/style and it ended up setting me back $140(!)."
5,First time....tried chorizo breakfast burrito.  One of the hrs that I have ever had!  Salsa bar.....the bomb! Thanks Ricardo! Alan from Huntington Beach California
5,"Been coming here for awhile now... Their EVERYTHING is good. No really, not going to sit here and say what's good on the menu because every single bit of it is the best whatever of that you've ever had. I will say however, my favorites are the Fish Taco's and the Burrito's and the Enchiladas and the... I said I wasn't going to do that and I did. The fish taco's are the best you'll get north of Cabo, they are way better than Rubio's ever thought about being and are just so tasty. The Arizona burrito is phenomenal, as is the California. The gal who is always working here at night is so incredibly nice and friendly as well, always makes us feel so welcomed and happy to come in. This is one of my favorite little Mexican Restaurants of all time, you cannot go wrong here, give it a shot and you won't regret it!"
5,"Great customer service! I got a deal for one of the best tints. My car looks good. 
I would recommend this place 100%"
5,Amazing food and excellent service! This is so far one of the best places I've ever been.
5,"I am a huge fan of all Hilton hotels and frequently stay at Hampton Inns. This is by far one of the best. 

The gentleman who checked me in tonight was genuinely pleasant and cheerful! He had my room key ready and my honors points on file. This was the fastest checkin ever. 

Moist in the center and crunchy on the edges...fresh sugar cookies were  available although it was 730 pm when I checked in. A bowl of mint chocolates were at the counter as well. 

The rooms and elevator were clean and there were earplugs on the night stand (probably because this hotel is close to the airport although I don't remember hearing the airplanes. The internet is fast. The nice little touches make big differences."
5,The place was pretty empty when we arrived but I was happy with the friendly hostess. They have a very unique beer selection. I had a longboard from Koba brewing followed by the pineapple wheat by SAN TAN. I ordered the Aloha burger with Cajun fries the fries are excellent. The burger bun is nice and  soft. The burger is nice and juicy. The pineapple mixed with the onion provides a sweet and tasty burger. I suggest giving the place a try if you are looking for a good burger in a nice little piece of Hawaii.
5,"I just recently discovered this place and I am obsessed! The wings are crispy, the sides are tasty. Try the salsa roja if you're not into spice like me."
5,"I never ate this food before but it was great and I will come back. Great expierence with habashi, sake was good, the rice and steak was great. Salad was good, soup taste good, our chef made great expierence. Manager made it a good time also. My group recommends this place"
5,"Just got my wife car window tint 
All was good and done at the same day 
The guy at the front explains everything and was very clear and honest. 
The only thing is that I could use their coupon that they have here on yelp but this time I forgot.
Overall I'm happy and recommend this business to anyone that need window tint"
5,"I'm so happy I came across this salon, I've been here twice now to see Heather.  I came in for a cut/color correction... which is probably an understatement since I had very unnatural colors in my hair and it was really dry & damaged.  I also didn't have a huge budget to try to fix it.  Heather was so patient and very knowledgeable about color which made me feel comfortable.  I've had some scary hair color experiences at other salons in Charlotte and paid WAY too much for what they did.  My hair is healthy again and I'm finally back on track to the way my hair used to look!  I'm also very impatient and was able to get in to see Heather for my first appointment quickly which I loved."
5,Really enjoyed our meal here. Tried the Banh Mi and it was super tasty. Value was amazing as well. Vietnamese iced coffee was to die for.
5,"This place a amazing... although it is not on the strip the place and people make up for that. This resort is located 5 min away from the strip. Jesse the gentlemen helping us was amazing.. Very professional and accommodating.... Made us aware of the amenities they had.. Continental breakfast from 8-10am.. which included bagels, danishes and beverages. They also had movie rentals for the kiddos, a mini put put (golf)...  sundae ice cream at noon(Sunday).  
The room it self was spacious, a washer and dryer inside, a kitchen with pots and pans to cook as well as plates and cups..  They had a pull out couch which is so much comfier than sleeping on the ground and cots for us to.. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas!"
5,Amazing food! I had the chicken & waffles and enjoyed every bite! My husband had the roast beef sandwich and it was full of flavor. Hats off the the chefs!
5,"Ask for Charlton Alicea.....aka my color king!  He's amazing. Great prices, terrific location right in the heart of Plaza Midwood!!"
5,"BREAKFAST ON POINT! Stopped by on my way to work because they were offering free breakfast sandwiches. I'm so glad I did! The sandwich was amazing! Super impressed and surprised to be honest. It was like an ""uncrustable"" style sandwich with eggs and cheese. Fluffy eggs, perfect seasoning and so cheesy! This is my new breakfast spot on my way to work - for sure! Can't wait to try the tots and rosemary sausage! 10/10 would go again. Most likely tomorrow :)"
5,"My first time in Pittsburg. This place was delicious and the staff was very friendly! I had a salad and the portion size was perfect. So sad that they do not have one in Kentucky! If I am ever here again I would definitely go back. The food was fresh. My mom got one of the little yogurts with fresh fruit and granola. Also good and simple but fresh. If you are around the area and want a good quick meal, I would recommend."
5,"Love this location! Reservations for 4 and 2 babies.   Ordered tons of food. 

Please keep in mind these dishes are meant to be shared... if you order 2 dishes for yourself good luck!! 

Food came out fast and fresh and delicious! The bubble tea we ordered were the actually bubble tea, we didn't specify the slushie version which I would of enjoyed more. The washrooms are clean and the prices are really decent! 

Definitely a go-to spot when it comes to congee and dim sum can't wait to go back soon"
5,This place is totally Amazing .. I come here 2 twice a month for my Eyebrows I love this place Because there staff is wonderful they do a Great job . That's why I'm giving them 5 star
5,"This is the 2nd family car I've had tinted here. I was able to get a same day appointment and was quoted 1 to 2 hours but they were done in 1 hour. The young man at the front was very knowledgable and patient with helping me decide what tint to select, including advising me what the legal tint level allowed is. All around excellent customer service and at a great price!"
5,"I had just purchased a house and was shopping around for a washer and dryer for the new place.  We had a budget set and were comparing everything online and with Sear's Outlet.  As soon as we walked into Spencer's we knew we were going to buy our set there! Why? Because of the manger Larry.  He was so kind, thoughtful and really gave us our space while teaching us about the products.  We felt so confident walking out and we were so grateful to have Larry on our side.  I would buy any product from Spencer's because of their customer service.  The installation was on time and fast! We were told between 9 and 11,  well at 8:45 we got a call saying they would be there at 9! I was shown how everything was hooked up and more.  I cannot say enough about how great this store is and these employees are! I will never shop around again! I know where to go for my home appliances! Cannot wait to buy a water softener from them :)"
5,Their upstairs bar is an awesome little Midwood hideaway. Delicious chicken wings and fresco bowls. Don't sleep on their sides either. Mashed potatoes with gravy and corn casserole are perfection.
5,I still love this place-great customer service and the large menu-way too many options and the prices are affordable. We come here on a regular basis. They also serve beer if you want to catch a game on tv.
5,"Took my 2018 Camry here, and got it tinted with Suntek Carbon. Car turned out really nice.  Lucio took care of me, and was really informative and answered all my questions. Their price is very fair and I would bring any other cars that I need tinted in the future."
5,"This place was great!   Sushi & drinks were fantastic!   Sushi was great quality and had very good presentation.   Rolls were a very large portion.  Hibachi was also wonderful and the chef was very entertaining.   ALL of the staff was beyond amazing.  Every one of them that walked by stopped to interact with the kids.  We were a hibachi table with 4 energetic kids, and they had the most amazing time with the servers.  I've been to many, many sushi/hibachi restaurants and this one was one of the best.   We will be repeat customers for sure.   Thank you all so much for the excellent experience, atmosphere & food!!!"
5,I'm so glad this place is here since I've moved back from Orange County I can't get che as easily as I did last year. I've been there a few times but mostly I've just gotten the bambu favorite because I love banh lot which is pandan jelly in coconut milk. Definitely a great stop any time during the summer and it's located in the lee lee's plaza where DQ used to be so not hard to find at all.
5,Went here to tint my car and can't say enough. Service was excellent and detailed. My car has been tinted for roughly 2 weeks now and everything is perfect. Would highly recommend!
5,best boba in the valley!!! The people who work here are amazing as well.  I would go here every day of I could and they always have new drinks to try! Everything is amazing and I slays struggle trying to only pick one thing when I come in.  I would recommend to anyone!!!!
5,This place is the Bee's knees. Some of the best burritos I've ever had.  Usually get a bean and cheese and rice but their carne asada is also delicious.  Extremely consistent and always friendly.  Reasonable prices and their salsa bar is great. They are my favorite Mexican food.
5,"This place is awesome to da Max!

I started noticing this place in construction next door to my acupuncture for a few months. I checked for it's progress so many times that I finally gave up. Of course....until I saw other yelpers writing review on this place. BAM! I was here lightening fast. 

The seating area is a bit small but doable for small party. Most of their drinks have coconut in it. If you aren't a fan of the coconut flavor, they also have other smoothies and drinks to choose from. At this point, they do not serve any food or snacks (which is fine by me). They have photos of their signature drinks posted on the wall. It took me a long time to decide which one to get. When my bestie,  Karen W, arrived, I decided to order drink #6. Oh boy was it good. It has plenty of coconut juice, huge chuck of coconut meat, 3 different types of jello, lychee and red Boba. I feel like I was having a party in my mouth.

After drinking the whole thing, I was pretty much full at that point. I cannot be any happier to see that Chandler, Arizona is slowly becoming like my town Rowland heights in CA. With Boba place around the corner, Glazier snow across the street and now this delicious store for drinks, I'm so happy that they are all in here. 

I will most definitely come back here again."
5,I've been going to Jose for a while now he really dose a great job and the Windows always come out perfect. I recommend anyone who is looking for window tint to come here
5,"A friend recommended I come here and I must say i was not disappointed. The owners fiancée was very nice and helpful, it being our first time. The food was very fresh and the stuffed avocado was absolutely amazing!!! I had the fresco bowl and half stuffed avocado and mom had the wings. A must try restaurant!!"
5,"I had brought my second vehicle which is an Audi. I was pleased with my previous experience and now I am pleased with my second experience. I had purchased 3M crystalline in the first vehicle and now I took the same film and happy with the results once again. There service is great and I recommend others to come and see it for themselves, I know for a fact if I purchase a vehicle in the future I'll keep this place in mind."
5,I'm glad I found this place. Great service and good price. You get what you pay for. The technician is very professional and the staff is very friendly. I really recommended this Auto Tint Express to anyone who is looking for Great Quality tint windows!!!
5,"The absolute best haircut and highlight I have ever had in my life!  James is flawless!  He is extremely kind, professional, and talented!  He takes the time to really listen to you, offer suggestions, and in the end he gives you the exact look you are going for!  I highly recommend James especially if you are nervously trying to change up your look.  No need to worry... just go to James and you will be in good hands!!!"
5,"Everything was AWESOME!!

Not sure where to start. 
First of all, pay no nervermind to the losers who posted 1 or 2 stars.
EVERY food joint on the planet will  have someone who doesn't like for one reason or another.
When its 1 or 2 or 3 bad reviews out of 40...it doesn't affect my decision at all.
Plus, if you walk into a place, ASSUMING what type of food they serve, you will probably be disappointed. Try using the technology you used to make a review on Yelp, and try looking up the menu before you go. :)
I had the Burnt Reynolds burger.
WOW, yeah delish. Piled with bacon, fried egg, cheese and potato chips!!!
The cracked corn is soooooooo good!! yes its a tropical take on Mexican Street Corn.
AND ITS AWESOME!!!
ITS ALL GOOD!!
That's all im gonna say.
GO THERE.

NOW."
5,"Loved this place, great customer service, down to letting me try the ingredients they were gonna use on different dishes to help me make my decision. Nice fresh, none greasy food, cooked well! Coming back!"
5,"Arrived late at night, after a long flight from the east coast delayrd over an hour lit was a pleasure to be picked up very quickly by the shuttle.  The room was clean, cool and large. Desk clerks were friendly.  Next morning we enjoyed an above average breakfast with eggs, sausage, cereal, pastries, waffles etc. Checked out and found our car had a dead battery.  The front desk staff went out of their way to assist us and get us on our way quickly. Even went on you tube to find out how to manually unlock the car since no electronics worked. Very thankful and would highly recommend staying here."
5,"SEJAL is incredible! 

I have been getting my eyebrows and full face threaded for years while I lived in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and now Charlotte and she is one of the best I've been to. 

I really enjoy how she always asks her customers the way they want their eyebrows done or what they are trying to achieve, not the way she thinks they should be done. If she has suggestions, she tells you what she thinks would be best before she removes any hair. Sometimes I like to grow them out for a few months and she cleans them up really well without taking too much off. 

Another thing I love about her is that she doesn't rush. A few people may walk in and have to wait while I am in the chair but I have never felt like she was rushing through my session to get to the next person. She definitely cares about your experience with her! She is so sweet and I really enjoy talking with her! 

She is now there Monday-Friday!"
5,"Brougth my BMW in today for window tinting. Explained i'm a snow bird and car needs to be legal in Washington state. They looked it up and hooked me up with correct percent tint.
They did a excellent job in under two hours and nice waiting room with tv, coffee and cold water.
They take Visa and recieved written lifetime warrenty.
Happy with this business as they did a walk around with me on my loved beamer to make sure ""no new scratches"" from work to be performed.
When you have tinting done your not to open windows for 3 days, they put green dont open windows stickers over power window switches.
Would reccomend this business"
5,"The only place I trust with my brows. Amazing services!! I always ask for Shree! She's super sweet, attentive, and shapes my brows exactly how I'd like each and every time and she's sooooo gentle handed so I never get any cuts like I usually would with others!!"
5,"Located in a huge strip mall, but this is closer to the DI side, but not quite the corner, if that's any help (directly across the Star Costume store). Parking is in front of the business. There are two rows of parking in this strip mall. 

I checked out the reviews on Yelp, of course, prior to deciding which one to use. I was pretty impressed by the company video on the company website. Also, the great reviews made a good impression as well. 

Yelp deal $169 (*You should call to see if this applies to your car, though, to make sure*), prepay with cash or card, out the door! Hubby set an appointment (this past saturday morning @ 9 am) for the new car; it would take two hours (no biggie, we had some errands and lunch), and just in time for the summer Vegas heat (noticed lately that hardly any of the newer cars come with tint, but just an observation). There was a brief inspection of the car's exterior (we bought it used, so, yes, there are some marks). 

Nice waiting area, a couple of couches, and free drinks in the mini-fridge (water, sprite, and diet soda) for customers. Near the counter are signs (about four or five of these) with varying shades for your car type. It's nice to see that there are several options for customers.

Excellent customer service here, from start to finish. Lucio was very professional (and nice). Just before two hours, we got the call that it was ready. We saw it in the parking lot. Very pleased with the work! He gave us the lifetime warranty, a nice wipe cloth, and told us there might be some bubbles, which is normal, but should come out. We didn't see any bubbles! On the door handles, there were a couple of orange ""DO NOT ROLL UP WINDOWS"" stickers to remind us (3-5 days, suggested). When I got it on the road, on a very sunny afternoon, I noticed a difference, it was excellent protection and money well spent.

I highly recommend this business, seriously, they know exactly what they are doing, and there's no pressure, or up-sells, here. Excellent work. Bravo."
5,"Perfection! First eyebrow place I went to since moving from Atlanta, absolutely wonderful job."
5,"I would give this place 500 stars if i could. It's not one of the best hotels i've stayed at, but it did have some of the best staffs I've ever met. Ok, so this review is going to be kinda long so grab some popcorn. A few girlfriends and I decided to plan our very first trip to Vegas and I'm glad this was the hotel we ended up staying at. 

First off, I would like to send a great big THANK YOU to Tia and Kameron who worked at the front desk. They were two of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting! 
Due to one of the timeshare benefits, we stayed at this hotel for free, so I really couldn't have complained if it turned out badly, however, this hotel was beautiful! 
Check-in was a breeze, and right after, we were sent over to someone (sorry i forgot your name) who gave us so many free tickets to shows and clubs and gave lots of great suggestions of things to do and places to see. 
We had a big king size bed and queen size pull out couch which was more than enough for four girls to sleep on. It even had a nice little kitchen area and I immediately felt at home when I was there. We stayed on the ground floor (easier access to the pool) and the pool was amazing!! The 1feet area of the pool had sand on the bottom floor and you could even drag a pool chair into that area to relax and get some sun. The clientele were mostly of the senior citizen age, but they were very friendly. They had 3 pools and a jacuzzi/hot tub (which I utilized at 4am), it was seriously nice!! 

Complimentary breakfast wasn't all that great (mostly just a bagel, some fruit and coffee), but since we were hardly up during the bfast hours, I didn't really mind. (There's a Denny's right next door if you're desperate). 
This hotel is off the strip, but they have a free shuttle that goes to The Orleans and New York New York 10 mins after every hour so you can always take it and walk from there. There are also shuttles that go back to the hotel, but we never used it so I can't comment on that. 
Ok, the real reason for my enthusiasm about this hotel is mainly because of Tia and Kameron and I will tell you why. While waiting for a cab to take us to the airport and then back home, these two (who totally deserve a raise btw if anyone from the company is reading this!!) were one of the funniest, most fun people we met on our whole trip. They kept us entertained as we waited for the cab, but then our day went from great to worse in 5 seconds. Right as soon as the cab pulled up, one of my friends developed a severe allergic reaction to something, hives every where, tongue swollen, so we had to call 911 in case it started to affect her breathing. They did not panic at all, which was much appreciated. Security was called over, the ambulance came and so did the fire dept and our friend was taken to the ED. My other friend and I were left to figure out what to do about our flights. We got the ""pleasure"" of flying on Spirit airline (who I will happily bitch about on their yelp page and file a complaint with the BBB). Anyway, back to the awesomeness of the front desk staff. 

I wasn't sure where to even begin, but Kameron offered to help us figure out how to change our flights that we would obviously miss.  Helped pull up our confirmation number and called customer service of the airline. He even talked to them on behalf of us when I was given the runaround. Although unsuccessful, the thought was very much appreciated. Tia started helping my other friend look up later flights that we could possibly take and due to the circumstances, offered to comp our room for the night if we ended up staying an extra night. 
I was told to go the airport ticket counter to see what they could do in person, and without hesitation, Kameron told us he would drive us there. He was already off the clock while helping us so he did just help us out of the goodness of his heart. He drove us to the airport, waited almost an hour while we sorted out our situation, even offered to drive us to the hospital, but since our friend was doing better, he just drove us back to the hotel again. Seriously who does that?? Nicest person I ever met!!!
Tia was also pretty great! Whatever we needed, she was right there to provide or help with. She assisted us right until we left for the airport for the final time. 
Anyway, that about sums it all up. You know how they say service makes all the difference, well at Tahiti, it really did!!!
Not to be confused with Tahiti Village:) 
Thanks again for making our vacation a memorable one!! Will definitely be back!!!
If you got this far, I hope you enjoyed the novel."
5,"Been going here for years, typically on Fridays or Saturdays and meet with Prinali or Devki- they're both absolutely great at threading. I let them know what I'm looking for and you can trust them to get it right, always. They're really sweet and I always have a pleasant conversation with them while they work their magic.

I also highly recommend Marija, she's my go-to for waxing needs. She is quick, thorough and oh so sweet. 

They have a rewards system as well which is a big plus."
5,"This is our first visit. But it won't be our last! Frisco bowl is fantastic. The flank steak with 2 sides was an ample serving. It would have been nearly perfect had the steak not been over cooked. I asked for rare and it was well done. Flank steak is thinly sliced so it's easy to overlook it which it makes it tough. The flavor however, was excellent."
5,"We just bought car and we decided to put window tinting. We come to Auto Tint Express and We made the right decision. Jose and Lucio have the best customer service. The place is neat  , price cant beat any places. installation  perfect don't have bubbles.And .. its life time warranty."
5,"A good friend of mine and I came to this salon today after reading some of these fabulous reviews here on yelp. Needless to say,  among arriving I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY! Not only was the salon clean and absolutely gorgeous...  The nail technicians/artists were all fabulous as well!  We were greeted,  and although it was busy and we had a bit of a wait...  We were immediately catered to by the salon staff who showed us AMAZING hospitality! We were brought several glasses of complimentary wine during our wait while we were getting our manicures done!   

The nail technicians were amazing!  Willing to paint any design you asked them to do.  The shellac manicure set is amazing and Very high quality with so many options of colors! 

I also had an eyebrow wax,  and that was amazingly done as well! Needless to say -  we are both somewhat new to the Madison area and we will without a doubt be back with this salon as our regular place! 

Thank you all so much!  I am so truly impressed!"
5,"This place was good. Not fantastic, not earth shattering but... they are getting a five star rating and I'll explain why. Their employees have the patience of a saint. Or a god... not sure but it felt like a super power. All over this damn restaurant you had oblivious idiots roaming around like brain dead zombies on their phones. Sitting, standing, shuffling... all completely checked out of life. Meanwhile the employees were killing themselves to prepare all the orders coming at them non stop from in store and pickup online orders. When completing an order, the employees were then calling out the numbers over and over and over again INCESSANTLY!!!  The zombie like customers couldn't even remove their brains from their phone for 2 seconds to acknowledge their order number and pick it up!!  It was horrifying. I watched three separate incidents where the manager had to yell the number at least 7 or 8 times before these morons realized ""oh maybe that's my food order?""  It was shocking how calm the employees stayed while repeating themselves like a broken record. I couldn't have done that... no way. And that is why I'll go to this place again...just to show that there are a few of us left still present and coherent in day to day life"
5,Nice place to stay and the best customer service.  Rami was so helpful and gracious.  Many thanks to Rami and Richard for going above and beyond to provide excellent customer service.  We will definitely be back!!
5,"My fiancée and I decided to make a last minute trip to Vegas for my birthday weekend and were most pleasantly surprised by this hotel. We paid only $40/night for this place on priceline.com as we weren't planning to do much in the hotel but sleep. However, when we arrived, we found they had given us an upgrade for staying two nights! Our room was very clean, quiet, and spacious with a nice little kitchenette, two TVs, a stereo, a whirlpool bath, and even a nice couch with a pull-out bed.

On top of all that, it is only a few blocks from the strip and has a beautiful atmosphere, three pools (one heated), and an outdoor spa. They apparently have a shuttle service, but we drove, so we didn't use this.

We visited the concierge on Saturday to get some advice. He was very friendly and helpful, but mostly recommended things that were completely out of our price range. Still, he gave us some great ideas, like how to save on shows from smartervegas.com and gave us lots of coupons and VIP passes.

The only thing that we found weird is that the TV doesn't have many channels and there is no pay-per-view option. When we got in late after a long drive on Friday, my fiancée and I just wanted to chill in the room a little bit and watch a movie to unwind before falling asleep. We called the front desk and they told us there was a RedBox at the Walgreen's next door, but we had already changed out of our clothes. They do have DVD players though, so next time we'll just have to bring something with us or stop at the RedBox before pulling up to the hotel."
5,"Quality control has gotten a lot better lately. The last few orders I picked up they've double check to make sure that all the sauces, sides, and everything that I ordered was there. The food is flat out delicious... Just a matter of getting it correctly in your order. But they've listened to their customers, stepped up their game, and you should definitely check them out for some delicious chicken and sides (and the sauces!)"
5,"My friends and I were there from 6/4 to 6/6 to celebrate my b'day.  We reserved a Master Suite which is basically a 2 bedroom.  Which in all my searching they offer the cheapest 2 bedroom near the strip, hence why I made reservations there. 

When they say they have a full kitchen, they literally mean full kitchen.  They had everything down to a strainer and a wine opener, so no need to bring your own. 

I liked that it was a bit off the strip but close enough where it wasn't an arm and a leg to pay for a taxi.  I think we paid $15 to go to the ARIA.  

We spent all Saturday at the pool and we used their gas grill to have a barbeque. I loved having a barbeque! People are still talking about how much fun they had. 

They also have jet tubs, which is awesome after walking around in high heels all night. 

The only bummer is that check-out is at 10 a.m. which is pretty darn early for Vegas.  We got a late check-out for 11 a.m.  

Overall great experience.  When we go back to Vegas we'll definitely stay here again.

Tip: If you end up staying here and take a taxi make sure you tell them that its the 'Tahiti on Tropicana Ave.' or else you may end up at the Tahiti Village like the couple we travelled with."
5,"friendly staff, delicious food!! gotta try. glad it's in the neighborhood. nothing on the menu that i do not like."
5,"We've been looking for a place to replace Ginza of Tokyo for Teppanyaki and Sumo may fill the bill. Our daughter dined here last week and told us that it was good. We found the food at the ""hibachi"" tables to be well prepared and very tasty. I thought the price for their hibachi entrees to be very reasonable. I didn't look at their sushi or regular Japanese  menu so I don't know about their pricing for those entrees. This restaurant is located on the east side of Madison near East Towne Mall. The décor is very nice and since it was built in the building that was a Old Country buffet very spacious as well. We were told that they had only been open for 3 weeks and if so they did a very good job."
5,Michelle and Ryon have been tremendously helpful with some of my maintenance  request at my current property. Truly attentive and helpful for all of my house needs. I can always call or email and both are  attentive and respond in a timely manner. I am assured that whenever there's a problem those two always find a way to help and solve the problem          I appreciate all that they do as well as On Q
5,These fish tacos are flames best kept secret in Tempe. Also have to get the key lime pie
5,"This restaurant is over the top amazing! The service and quality of the food are impeccable. Great place to celebrate a special occasion with family and friends. Order the ribeye steak medium along with the Caesar salad.....you will love it! If you have room for dessert I highly recommend the coconut cream pie. 
They are also noteworthy for their attractive interiors and sophisticated ambiance."
5,"First time trying as a walk in. Friendly , clean. Great job. I had Yen and she was terrific ! Will definitely return."
5,"Delivered ontime, great job as usual by Spencer's....A company you can certainly trust !!!"
5,"Bomb burritos, definitely will be going back the next time I want Mexican food. Being new to Arizona it's hard finding restaurants that the whole family can enjoy.  They're friendly and helpful. They have business and I will be referring my friends too"
5,"Very impressed. Great menu, great portion sizes for the price, and great ingredients. Everything from the chicken to the mushrooms, even the blue cheese, is local. Honeygrow has a self service style, where you order (customizing your meal) and pay using a screen, then they call your number when your food is ready. Friendly staff, clean, and quick for a healthy meal on the go. Would recommend this spot and would absolutely go back."
5,"SO HAPPY THEY CAME TO PGH! The food is so tasty, healthy, and service is quick. I love that you can have a savory meal and something sweet all under one roof. I love that they suggest ingredients to put together with their specialty bowls or you can create your own. I will definitely be frequenting this place more often!"
5,"I'm a big fan of boba, but this place has got so much more! At first glance, seems like a simple place, but they've really pumped in the tastiest niche flavors here! The red bean taro dessert smoothie was amazing (although rather interesting to get used to at first), especially paired with the pandan waffle.

Comfortable and clean atmosphere, good vibes, and kick-ass prices on some fantastic cuisine. Gotta check it out"
5,This place is delicious. The shrimp burrito came out perfect. try it out to see yourself coming back for more.
5,The food was delicious and incredibly fresh. The Dan Dan noodles were legitimately spicy instead of just a politically-correct chili pepper warning. The prices are fair and the space is very clean and modern. The owner was very patient and helpful assisting us with our ordering. Want to go back already and try the Kung Pao!
5,"I have been renting out my house with On Q Property Management for about 2 and a half years.   The service provided by the company was excellent.   It is very easy to contact any person in the office.   All the people work at On Q are very friendly.  My property manager Ryon is an excellent property manager.  He is always there if you have any question or if the tenants have any problem with the house.  He is an excellent liaison between the landlord and tenants.   Jerem at accounting office is also very helpful.  He is very patient to set up the account for the client and takes the time to explain any question that you have.   

I am a real estate investor and do not usually feel comfortable about out of state property management.  I changed my mind after I found On Q.   Keep up the good work, On Q!   Thank you very much Ryon and Jerem!

The only downside about On Q is the high fees for new tenant search and tenant contract renewal."
5,"Such a fun and friendly place!  Great low-key atmosphere and friendly outgoing staff.  Oh, and the food was great!  Love the fire-roasted avocado!!"
5,I left my car there when I went on a cruise to Australia. It was great cost about 7.00 a day and they drove me to the airport. Also 24 hour security so my car was safe
5,"The is a top notch first class restaurant.  The food is exquisite, the waiters are exceptional.  I was actually in awe when I walked into the venue as the outside is not much to look at but once you step in ohhhh my. I ordered the chicken Neptune it was delicious,  chicken with stuffed crabmeat  (real crabmeat )."
5,"This place is a GEM!! A friend and I ate here for lunch the other day and it was far better than I had anticipated. 

The building itself was decorated really cool and it was very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful; their service is great. As for the food, I went with the ""combo"" which has two tacos, fries, and a drink. For my tacos, I went with the Original and the Wipeout. Both were fantastic! I also got an order of Crack'd Corn which was one of the better decisions I've ever made.

I'll definitely come back here again!"
5,Great spot to pick up lunch on the go.  Good quality ingredients and large variety of ptions for creating your own stir fry and salad combos.  Check it out.
5,Yes yes yes!!! This place and the staff are absolutely amazing. Kayla the bartender was so sweet and Cheyenne one of the servers was also very sweet. The staff is informed about the dishes and the atmosphere and food is amazing. I ordered the I/4 chicken with garlic mash potatoes and stuffed avocado and it was scrumptious. Definitely would recommend all and any Charlotte natives to come to this restaurant and their music bingo( which is on Friday) and their trivia( which is on Thursday) if I could give them a 10 I would. Definitely satisfied and will be a long time customer
5,"In visiting from CA, super stoked when I found that there was a Bambu near by. Created my own drink with Coconut Milk, crystal boba, pandan jelly, rainbow jelly, strawberry jelly, and fresh coconut. It was everything I wanted except I wanted more! :) the lady at the counter was super friendly and professional. Highly recommend."
5,"This is my go to spot in Plaza Midwood right now. Amazing chicken, delicious sauces, fresh healthy ingredients, friendly staff, amazing space, cool upstairs patio with a view of Plaza - this place has it all! I get the rotisserie chicken either as half a chicken (a breast and a leg, marinated tender and perfectly herbed & spiced) or I get the chicken shredded in a bowl with quinoa and avocado or in a sandwich. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! When we have guests we always take them to Coaltrane's!"
5,This place is amazing. I'm from LA and have been on the hunt for the perfect place for years. Vincent knows all the current trends and is incredible. Five stars!!
5,"The food looks and tastes amazing, and the atmosphere is always fun and energetic. This is definitely one of my go-to spots when I'm in town."
5,"Value of not driving to Dilworth ...........................................$.99

Value of your GF being REALLY HAPPY with her hair....... PRICELESS !"
5,"Mid afternoon, slow but service was outstanding. Recommendation to go with fish tacos - outstanding. Zucchini fries - outstanding. Cold beer - outstanding. Do you think I will come back to this location. No question no doubt!  Nothing like this at home. Definitely would be a hit from where I come from. Enjoyed this."
5,"This is by far the best eyebrow place I have been to. Shree has exceptional customer service, she is always super nice and greets you with a smile and does exceptional eyebrow work. she takes her time and makes sure you are satisfied with the results. Best eyebrow place in Charlotte!"
5,My waiter was very nice food was good seems like a very busy day is that must mean something I would eat here again when in the neighborhood
5,"WOW. I'm loving all these additions to East Liberty area. First time at Honeygrow, and it definitely won't be my last!!

My experience: 11/10
The restaurant is welcoming and clean. It offers limited seating but has an open feel to it especially with the large windows. On the day we went, it was a clear day so it was nice to have the natural light and view of the cathedral across the street. It has a self-order system with 4 large screens that are easy to navigate through HG's 3 main menu options: salads, stir-fry, and honey bar. They really nailed the user experience. When picking the salad, the name overlapped pictures of each salad so you can get a better idea. Once finished, you receive a ticket # and help yourself to a seat. Didn't wait too long. Midway through lunch, an employee came to check on how we were doing. Later, another employee came by with free samples of 2 of their juices and their winter kale salad. 

Food: 10/10
My friend ordered the sweet soy five spice stir fry which she enjoyed. I ordered the Make it Grain salad. Portions are huge; flavor was fantastic and tasted fresh for only ~$8. We tried the honeybar (~$5-$7), opting for the medium honey (they have 3 types: dark, medium, light) and toppings such as bananas, blueberries, granola, and chocolate chips. It's basically a cup full of fruit and toppings with honey drizzled in between. They don't skimp on the toppings, so you're paying a decent price for what you're getting. There could have been more honey or possibly an option to choose how much you'd like it in (just a thought!)"
5,After years of disappointing hair cuts and colors I find this little gem. My stylist was Robi and she did an amazing job with my hair. The cut is perfect and I think she may have been more excited about the purple baliage than I was. I LOVE MY HAIR!  It's exactly what I wanted. The staff was friendly and inviting. No push to purchase product and the cost was worth every penny. Oh and the fact that I got to have wine while I was being pampered...love it!  I will definitely be returning and recommending this salon.
5,"Awesome family friendly restaurant. I have been enjoying their food since the day they have opened a few years ago. Other locations they have, and that are equally great are on Steeles & Don Mills, and Lawrence & Dufferin."
5,"Nice clean place with really good food! Not bland at all, and the portions are decent. The staff are also courteous and food comes fast. Yum!"
5,I come here with a colleague for lunch at least twice a week. The service is great and speedy and the food is so delicious! I always switch between the Singapore cashew and the kung Po ...you must try this place. You will not be disappointed.
5,I had breakfast at this location. Service was fast. Our waitress was a doll! And usually at this types of sit down restaurant they sit you around creepy people. Not today. Was a great experience!
5,Auto Tint Express has great customer service from the moment you walk in till the moment they had you the keys back to your car they are very friendly and make you feel like family. There waiting room is the cleanest waiting room I have every been in. The provided you with a t.v. to relax as you wait for your vicheal to be finished. I recommend to everyone that wants a great tint for your car to come here.
5,"I believe my first 5 Stars!!!!! We all know that your face greets the world right?....so why not make sure it's picture perfect. I have been getting my brows done at Idolize for years and I have been using the same lady Ilya. She used to be at the Whitehall location but she has permanently moved to the Dilworth location. She looks at the shape of your face and knows exactly how to arch your brows. She's super personable and precise. I must admit I haven't tried any other Person there(I'm a loyal customer) especially when you've done me proud, but the flow of people that comes thru the Idolize doors speaks for itself. ILYA(hope that's spelled right) but that's your go to Brow Tech. Thank me later or vote for my review"
5,Yum. Had the veggie burrito. The cute cashier also let me know that there is NO LARD in the beans! The restaurant is also very clean. Would definitely come back!
5,Great price & great work. Same day appointment. Lifetime warranty also. Definitely will be back
5,"Jaun, the manger is the best. He is one of a kind. Walked in and was welcomed and was asked about my day. Showed us to our seats and was just the best. I could have been served burnt toast ( I wasn't food was out of sight ) and still give 5 stars because of the manger. Will be back"
5,"Live not far from here so came down to try it out! It is amazing!!!! The staff was great! Ordering was a breeze and the red coconut curry was incredible!! 
And the honey bar.. 10/10!!!"
5,"Travis is amazing!   I have a head full of extensions and some crazy curl as well;but, I come out of here every week with hair that is as smooth as silk!   Plus-he can do make up too!!!  Always welcoming and never pretentious-Shine is my go to now that I live in Charlotte.  My standards are high having just moved from Chicago!   This is a full service salon on par with what any professional working woman would expect!"
5,"I've been here few times now and i must say you do get what you pay for. As the reviews suggest, they are expensive but they do deliver in every level. An out standing restaurant that has not lost it's touch in time."
5,"Great service, both customer service and tinting services.  Prices are the lowest I found with others listed on Yelp.  Recommend to anyone needing tinting services."
5,"It really is Food Nirvana!  We tried Jimmy Hula's on impulse with two adults and four children.  I had a great spicy burger.  The bun was toasted and buttery, and the fuego sauce was amazing!  Kids had chicken tender meals, and one said it was ""food heaven!""  My husband had the chicken teriyaki bowl, and he said it was very filling, but wished it had more sauce.  

The value was good and the atmosphere was fun - kind of whimsical surfer style.  The kids liked the reclining airplane style seats.  

We will be back if we're in the area!"
5,Service was amazing. Aggie was fantastic. She brightened my day and was a great bartender.  Definitely returning again!
5,"LOVE!  Great place to take visiting guests in Las Vegas!  There is a perfect mix of delicious, greasy bar food and lighter options for my girlfriends.  The Steak and Arugula Salad is amazing.  The Shrimp Cocktail is huge, and the burger is amazing!  So good!  Great service by Jeanie - ask for her!"
5,"Awesome! Everything was handled professionally and explained so that i could make an informed decision. Clean facilities and great service.
 Definitely worth the wait.
I would highly recommend  using Auto Tint Express for tinting!!  Thanks guys for all of your help."
5,"Fast friendly and courteous service, i  was trying to get my wifes car we just purchased tinted so i googled a few tint shops here in the Vegas Valley  and notice some that  had great 5 star reviews so i called and most em gave me quotes that were sky high for the kinda car my wife had and they were giving me appointments for a week later and some were like were booked can you call back tomorrow SMH so then i came across Auto TINT Express and gave em a call between 825am and 835ish and the owner Jose picked up, now keep in mind they open @ 9am and he picked up and he gave me a quote on the phone and told me that if i bring my car in as soon as he opens @ 9am he'll get on it, so when i got there a lil after 9am he came out checked my car walked me in his shop and went over what kind of tint i wanted and got my keys and said hell give me a call when it's done, i was thinking maybe 3 or 4 hours, but i thought wrong by 11am he called me and said my car was ready so now that's  FAST ,FRIENDLY, COURTEOUS on top of that SPEEDY service and QUALITY work you can rely on, so as far as TINTing goes i HIGHLY recommend Jose and his crew @ Auto TINT Express."
5,Friendly staff and very knowledgeable about the products they offer nice clean waiting area and free water bottles while you wait in the air conditioned room! Will definitely bring my other car here as well!
5,"VooDoo Taco and Aloha Burger are awesome!  Made our trip to Phoenix memorable.  It's a very casual place where you can relax and just have a good burger.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  But, the burgers and tacos are gourmet quality."
5,"Love this place! I've tried 6 drinks, love them all but fruit addict is my FAV! If I don't live so far away I would be there everyday! Lol I can't wait til they have Halo-Halo tho....*Hint Hint* Ms. Rada. 
Everyone's super friendly! Especially name, Stacey and Kayla. 
Definitely my first stop every time I head to LeeLee."
5,Very good but has fallen off lately. Seafood platter is always my favourite choice. Fish selections sometimes limited to salmon that can fairly salty. I prefer Terra.
5,"Oh my lanta!!! This place is glorious delicious scrumptious beyond amazing!!! The burgers are by far thee best burgers i have ever tasted!! So juicy so melt in your mouth so perfect. This place is a must try! If you are an ASU student they pay for the first round of beer! Can't beat that! The ambiance is she perfection.. makes one feel as if they are by a beach. The customer service is also amazing. Everyone truly cares here. It truly
Shows that they add a lot of love to their food. I will be back tomorrow for sure!!!"
5,The best Nail salon in the valley!!! Nor only are the technicians amazing & friendly but if they make a mistake they go out of there way to make it right! Price is also very fair! Lindsey and Tom are the owners and are awesome people!!! Kudos to the shop! Will never go anywhere else!
5,Amazing staff. Fun environment and amazing food. love the rooftop bar! Better then Viva and anything in plaza ! Staff was very friendly
5,"This was my first time coming to Idolize Ila the manger was my tech. She did a great job threading my eyebrows. I will definitely be a repeat customer. My arch was perfect , she follows directions to the T not to mention she was very sweet."
5,"Found this hotel on Trip Advisor on accident. 
I was looking to book a nice room for 2 nights that is near the strip and was reasoning priced. (Hotels on the strip the week I went ranged from 300-500 a night) 

I booked a 2 bedroom room and it was more than enough space for 5 people. 
There is a jetted bath tub in both bedrooms, a full kitchen and a kitchenette in the other bedroom. There is a washer and dryer in the unit. 
The pool and jacuzzi is 24 hours which was amazing and they also had gas grills available to use. The room also included dish soap and laundry detergent for use. 

We stayed upstairs on the 3rd floor (smoking room) but it didn't smell like smoke at all. The room was clean and we had no complainants. The price was good too for what was included. 

The hotel is 10 min from the strip and 5 min from rio, Gold Coast and the Orleans hotels and just walking distance to Denny's and Walgreens. There is an Albertsons, gas station and Wells Fargo bank just down the street. 

I will definitely will be booking here again."
5,ila been doing my eyebrow for years now and when I found out she moved to this location I followed her because she is the best ! Believe me I had my eyebrow messed up and she fixed them right up. So if y'all need a good eyebrow person go to ila ! For sure !
5,"Tasty Food. Limited Menu. A nice addition to the area. 

We wanted to try something new and opted for Honeygrow - and I'm glad we gave it a try. 

The restaurant itself isn't huge, but there is still ample seating. The interior is clean and welcoming and the staff was very friendly. 

I ordered the Walnut St. Noodle salad with chicken. Overall this was a light tasty choice. Great proportions for all ingredients and the dressing just the right amount (not overpowering). 

The kiddo wasn't very hungry so he opted to build his own yogurt parfait (yogurt, fruit, granola). He also got a big slice of herbed foccacia bread. The kiddo was one happy camper. The fruit was fresh and the serving seemed quite large for the price. 

My wife won with her choice: Red Coconut Curry (and I won because I stole a few bites!). This dish was really well composed: fresh ingredients, a wonderful savory sauce and it looked great. We were both extremely impressed with this dish. 

I should also point out that Honeygrow uses kiosks for ordering. The kiddo (4 years old) really enjoyed helping us to order through the touchscreens. But I did see some less tech savvy people (read: older folks) struggle with the experience (but the staff helpfully guided them through the process). If you are going to take your tech-phobic friend to Honeygrow, you may have to supply some tech support. 

Overall a great experience. I hope Honeygrow continues to expand in this market."
5,"So I'm from the islands, not many places in the valley have good island food. So I checked out Jimmy Hula's and they have a breakfast sandwich called Moco Loco, it has gravy and egg in it. Kinda close to my favorite local dish from the islands, Loco Moco (rice, hamburger patties, gravy, eggs). So I went for lunch today and asked the waiter if he could make me and a co-worker real Loco Moco plate since they had the ingredients, and boy did he DELIVER! It was AMAZING! I begged for them to get this on the menu!

I'm sending everyone I know to Jimmy Hula's to order a Loco Moco plate!

UPDATE: so apparently my review and recommendations for the Loco Moco has caused some 'issues' with the Management. So sorry! Not my intention! Anyone reading this must realize the Loco Moco is an OFF MENU item. My man Dez totally hooked a local brotha up by making this amazing dish, and I am forever grateful, but if you show up asking for the Loco Moco, don't be upset if they cannot make it. Hopefully they can get it on menu soon, as this was easily the BEST Loco Moco in the valley (even better than many island places! ), But I guess that's a corporate decision, or whateva. Anyway, MAHALO brah's!

PS - Every single person I've sent there to try the Loco Moco has LOVED it! Every one. And they're all haole! Think about it, you guys could make this HUGE! ""Best Loco Moco in the Valley!"" LOL!"
5,"Tacos are legit,  brews are cold and it's good vibes. Service is great.  Get down here and have some fun. You won't be sorry."
5,The guys are are very knowledgeable and won't pressure you into unnecessary work. My tint turned out great! I will be back for all my window tinting.
5,"I do not enjoy going to the hair salon either, but Shine has most definitely made me a believer.  I never once felt as if they were trying to sell me products or more expensive services.  They called to let me know my hairdresser was running a bit late, which was great.  I was able to get errands done in that time.  I was continuously offered a beverage, and loved the personal atmosphere of the salon.  Jill was great, and so easy to talk to.  I got the feeling that she knew exactly what she was talking about and really enjoys what she does.  I, too, learned way more about my hair during this one appointment than I have ever learned elsewhere.  I would recommend Shine to anyone needing a haircut or color done!  I will be heading back soon!"
5,"Been coming to Jose for a few years now..wouldn't take my car anywhere else for tint. Very professional, great service and good warranties."
5,Ms Ila  takes good care of chin and eyebrows most times. I come 3x a month probably. I love discount days on Mondays.
5,"Wonderful place to eat - cheap, quality, and you get quite a lot of food for the price! They have a selection to choose from, from Chinese BBQ to rice dishes, pho, and more."
5,If you want quick service and good pub food at a very reasonable price then you should definitely try this place. We've been twice this stay in Vegas because we knew we could get a good quick meal for a great price. We will definitely be back.
5,"Mmmmmm Octagon has GREAT steak!! If you want a steak house that has food on par with Ruth's Chris, Keg, Morton's, etc. but you don't want to drive downtown, Octagon is a great choice.  The decor is dark wood old-world Italian and maybe even a little gaudy for my taste, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The service is excellent and attentive, and most importantly, the steak is always done perfectly. Plus how cool is it that the building is octagon shaped?!

I was there last friday on a whim and it wasn't full so my group of six was seated immediately, but during summer I've also tried to get in without a reservation on a friday night and been turned away because there was a two hour wait.  Last time I was there, I had the filet mignon, and it was cooked perfectly, and was so tender the meat literally melted in my mouth.

For dessert, try the strawberries with Grand Marnier sauce - the sauce is delicious!!

There is a sign outside the door that states their dress code, which is something like business casual, but some of my group was wearing sneakers and t-shirts (not me!! hehe) and they still let us in without even blinking an eye, but I did feel a little underdressed."
5,i am a regular here cuz thier service is great and the food is amazing! honestly the best sushi place ive ever gone to so far!!
5,I couldn't be more impressed than I am with OnQ. Their professionalism is unmatched. I'm so Glad I found them.
5,"This place is awesome! Get your mani, pedi and FACIALS done here, too! The massages are great! The facial is fabulous! My face felt so fresh and looked so dewy afterwards! I would do the facial everyday if I could! Appointments are highly recommended since they are kind of short-staffed right now. Even so, customer service is still top-notch! My new spa place!"
5,"From the first opening, the store was already flooded with customers and visitors. A while back, I remember the employees literary refused service to customers who came in at exactly 8:00PM when they were supposed to close. My family and I were the last consumers that they took in. Sitting there and watching 30-40 people leaving without drinks, honestly I felt kinda disapproved. Some people getting out of work around 7:00PM, having dinner, changing their clothes, and finally driving all the way to this place just to see they refusing the service at 8:00PM sharp? There were still people hanging out at the place, but the gal and the guy still stayed put. Customers will be unhappy and money will be going down to the drain.  

However, I was impressed by how much improvement this place is getting. Hours of operation were altered, less sugar was put into drinks and desserts, discounts and promo were indicated. The lady boss is always sweet, as well as the front desk. Drinks may be not good sometimes, but customer service will decide 90% of the success. 

Until this moment, my family and I are quite regulars here, and we get absolute satisfaction every single times. Salut to the management team which devoted and dedicated commitment to put customers as priority. 

About the drinks, number 1, 5, 6 and 11 are always our favorites. We will see you tonight, BamBu :)"
5,"Ask for Kent Webster.  He has been my family's go-to for years.  Can always trust him to do right by you. 

We recently went in to get a new washer and dryer.  Mentally I was going in thinking it would be a long process, comparing prices, options and such and being a tiring process.  But that was not the case.  I think we were in the store maybe 15 minutes from start to finish.  Kent showed us the best value they had.  He did not try and sell us the most expensive ones in the store, but what we actually needed.  He was very knowledgeable about the different brands and features and why they were good or not good.  

We got home still surprised how easy and painless the experience was.  I'll never go anywhere else for appliances."
5,"Went here for the first time today and will absolutely be coming back. Best tacos in town, for sure. The variety and creativity of menu items makes this place stand out more than any taco/burger shop. I got the tacos with steak and shrimp. My buddy got tacos with pulled pork, barbecue sauce, mac & cheese, and other ingredients. We were both thoroughly impressed."
5,"On my first visit I was taken captive by the unique blend of real fruit smoothies unsurpassed by any where else I've ever been. I was also impressed by the smiles serving us...made me wanna open a Bambu in California, then I found out they already have many there...hallelujah!"
5,"I lived a few blocks from this place for the past year and I am so sorry this is my first time there. My mom came into town to visit and we decided to do a quick target run for some things for my apartment. When I asked her she was hungry she goes, ""I could really just go for something fresh, maybe fruit."" It was the perfect opportunity to try honeygrow. My mom absolutely loved using the screens to select her options. She opted for the honeybowl and loved choosing different fruit and even the type of honey she wanted on the bowl. She was beyond thrilled. 
I opted for the salad and it was so good. It was fresh and perfect for what I was looking for. I worked at an orchard for 10 years and tend to be picky about my fruits and vegetables and this place nailed it. Even the prices were reasonable. I may have created a bad thing by going here once because I may be back weekly. Correction, I may be back daily. No shame here."
5,"We went to see Jabbawookeez and wanted a quick dinner. My husband saw The Pub and we ducked in. It was great! Gretyl was our server. We sat at the bar and watched  the open kitchen, the food that came out looked amazing. Our burger was delicious, fries crispy and they knew we were splitting it so they cut the burger ahead and we didn't have to ask for extra plates. Our local beer was served in an ice cold frosty mug."
5,I've taken 3 if my cars here and they do a great job! I'm in and out and don't have to wait forever and a day like other shops and they have a cool little waiting area for customers. Lucio is always professional and straight forward.
5,"Sometimes it's the simple things that you remember. I've been here many times and never been disappointed but somehow this little place was forgotten in my mind. I guess it's because I don't make it around here much. Today, I was STARVING! I just happen to be in the area and remembered them. I ordered something off of their menu. A simple bean tostada but asked for shredded beef. I had just worked out and needed the extra protein. This tostada was delivered to my table and the angels where singing. Ahhhhh! It was just what I needed! You know, it wasn't JUST a tostada. He decorated it with a special cheese. It was pretty too, go figure. Well, as famished as I was, I tried not to gobble and managed to slow down to enjoy the flavors. I had a party in my mouth. Who knew... A tostada could be so yummmmy? I totally recommend this little place. Not only are they accommodating, yummy but I enjoyed a clean yet tasteful dinning experience."
5,"I'm afraid to to leave a great review and let the secret out about the cool, relaxed, rooftop bar at Coaltranes. But the food is too great not to share. 

Been twice and the food was delicious both times. Quarter chicken is delicious and the mashed potatoes are some of the best I have ever had. The corn casserole is super tasty too.

Great, friendly service. Will certainly be back!"
5,"I was referred to On Q by a friend who rented through them before... I called in, saw the house and was approved to move-in within 2 days... so far so good!  Impressed with the process and quickness compared to where I rented before"
5,Had my first experience here tonight. I was very impressed. Very clean like the other reviews say...they line the pedicure bowls and open a fresh set of sanitized tools in front of you. The massage chairs are great! And they offer you free wine. I have to drive a ways to get here...but I think it's worth it. I got the shellac mani with the milk and honey pedi and it was $80.  A little more expensive than some places...but I'm comfortable with the cleanliness and the quality is pretty good...I'll update if my shellac chips before it should!
5,"The bar service was amazing, as usual!! We had chicken wings and beers and both were fantastic!!"
5,"The portions were huge, but completely worth it. The congees tasted amazing (the addition of ginger really kicked up boring congee) and the carrot/radish cakes were fantastic!"
5,"This place is awesome! They are highly professionals with the right equipment. They have many different shades and brands to choose from, also their prices are great! They did an amazing job in my Jeep. While I was waiting we was able to watch Netflix, youtube etc. From there TV. Also they have refreshments and a nice waiting area. I highly recommend this place."
5,On Q has always been great to work with.  They return calls quickly and make sure the property and tenants are taken care of fast.  I've dealt with other property management companies in Arizona and these guys are the best.  I don't hesitate one second on recommending them if you're looking to rent your house out or looking to become a renter here in Arizona.
5,"I have been going year for months now. The service and craftsmanship is fantastic. When I first got a hair cut, my stylist called me the next week to check and make sure I was happy with my new hair cut."
5,It was a pleasure dealing with On Q. They have been prompt and professional regarding the leasing process. Rebeccah is very accessible and timely in her responses to phone calls or e-mails. That is very important to me!
5,"This was my first time to BAMBU, and my first time ever trying boba. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed! My husband, sister-in-law and I all ordered the taro smoothies with bursting boba and they were delicious! My brother-in-law order the Fruit Addict, which contains lychee, longan, red tapioca, jackfruit, palm seed, jello, pandan jelly, 
coconut & coconut milk. It looked like quite the unique treat and he seemed to really enjoy it. 

Even though they closed at 9pm on Sunday, they allowed us to stay and chat until a quarter past. There is plenty of seating inside or out. There are also board games available to play while you eat. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this establishment for a smoothie fix with or without boba!"
5,"The food is amazing, it is my favorite roasted chicken so far. The sides was delicious too."
5,"Came in on Monday September 12, 2016 at 6am , Made a to go order , on the all American Siam with sour dough ! The server/cashier NORMA was very very sweet , such a nice person. We've had her numerous times , and she give awesome customer service. 

There was no problem with our order . Always on point ! 

Thank you Norma for such awesome service."
5,Ila is great! Service is awesome. Friendly and they made my eyebrows look fantastic! I would highly recommend this place. I used to go to the location in south park mall but I now will be going here!
5,I came to honeygrow on a Sunday- and it was a steady flow of people. I didn't know what to expect because I had heard mixed things about the dc location. I ordered a bowl with rice noodles and veggies and tofu. I got the brown spicy garlic sauce on the side. It was fresh and delicious!
5,"Decided to give this place a try, to say the least we weren't let down. We both got a bowl and it was delicious. Minus my fiancé did have a bone in hers but that's not unexpected. Would recommend to anyone in the area."
5,"Amazing chicken wings!

I have literally searched for wings this good since I moved to Charlotte. Much better than the alternative up the road.

Try this place out!"
5,Had a great dinner at Jimmy Hula's with lots of interesting fish tacos to try! Yummy! They also have a range of drinks. Cool place with boat chairs at some tables. :-) This is a new restaurant just getting started with friendly staff....give them a try!
5,"I will start this off by saying that I am a total eyebrow snob. When my old esthetician moved away, I had a difficult time finding a replacement but happened to wander into Idolize, never realizing that I drive by it almost everyday. I'm so glad that I found Jane!! She makes me feel so comfortable and has given the least painful waxing I've ever experienced. She always has great advice for taking care of my brows and skin, which is a huge plus. I also appreciate that Idolize is very clean and makes me feel at ease whenever I have an appointment. 

I have referred my closest friends to her and will continue to use Jane for all my waxing needs."
5,Excellent  customer service  would defiantly recommend  to anyone wanting great car tint
5,"Still really good and consistent after coming here since I was a boy.  Peppercorn steak and Caesar salad were still awesome.  Garlic bread still garlicky enough to kill vampires.  Much pricier than it used to be, but you get what you pay for.  Highly recommended."
5,"I tried Sumo to get a new taste of Japanese food.I got the vegetable Hibachi dinner entrée. Onion soup was a nice appetizer. Mild and very brothy, with just a little bit of tofu. The main course was teriyaki vegetables. I mixed it with the fried rice. In all, it was good. The dish resembled some Chinese dishes I've had, like Sichuan Eggplant with a milder, less savory, less MSG flavor. Sort of"
5,"I would like to commend Mr. Jim Beck who took care of an ongoing issue we were having with the Spencer's Appliance's warranty company, Centurion Home Shield Service.  Centurion sent someone to diagnose or repair our washer six times during three month time period.  Because of these problems, I gave a 1 out of 5 star on Yelp.  Although I have been very unhappy with their warranty company, when Mr. Beck became aware of the situation, he immediately called our home and authorized Spencer's Appliances to replace our washer with a new washer or put the very fair amount toward a washer of my choice.  I chose one I liked for about the same price, and it is to be delivered today. 
Because the issue is now resolved, my husband and I have decided to not only get the new washer, but also order the matching dryer.  We chose to get the extended  warranty and hope that Spencer's will reassess the policies with their warranty company so others will not have a similar experience. 
Mr. Ray Ramano, a salesman at the Spencer's Appliance store location in Mesa, AZ made the transaction very easy over the phone. Dealing with a great salesperson can make a difference, as well. This is not to mean there are not excellent salespeople at other locations."
5,"James is a hair professional! Have been to him twice now for a full foil of blonde highlights and he goes above and beyond to make sure they look perfect and are the platinum/bleach blonde color I want oppose to a golden tone! Everything from his color, wash, trim and blowout is fabulous! Thank you for giving me a hair dresser I can trust in Charlotte! Keep being a perfectionist, it does not go unnoticed! :)"
5,"This place has great service.  I called them, they said there was appointment available an hour later.  I showed up, Lucio explained to me the different packages and he was hella friendly.   They honored a yelp deal for me, which was amazing!!   Waited 90 minutes, got my car back and it looked fantastic.    Would recommend this place to everyone!!!  Great deals, top notch service, best spot in Vegas."
5,"I've tried almost everything on the Ricardo's menu, and rarely am I disappointed. We love their breakfast burritos, Carne Asada fries, and the fish tacos. The daily specials are reasonably priced. This place is a neighborhood gem!"
5,I am a regular to this location!!! I have to say I love this place...fast service & the food is mouth-watering out of this world. AYCE lunch is $15 (new price increase) & dinner is $20 (new price increase). Must try the Rocking shrimp...
5,Good food! Nice service! Easy access from the 101 from work. Try it you'll like it.
5,Excellent customer service and I would recommend this place to anyone. I came in and ask my question and they took he time to explain to me on the different kinds of tint. I will come back again on my next car
5,"What a great experience 
Service was amazing 
Food was delicious 
I had the 8oz steak as well we has escargot and oysters as apps simply delicious !!!!"
5,"I visited this restaurant for the first time and was impressed by the service and quality of the food. The ambiance was very nice and the food was amazing. I like the fact that this restaurant offers a variety of foods for different eaters. Such as having more smaller portion steaks at a reasonable price for those who don't eat a lot. I had the caesar salad and new york strip steak when I was there and was quite amazed at how flavorful the steak was in comparison to other restaurants, and the fact that the caesar salad is made right at the table. Would definitely visit this restaurant again!"
5,"Absolutely amazing food and amazing service! It did take a little while to get our food, but it was well worth the wait! Didn't expect the tacos to be as big as they were and have as much meat in them as they did. The burgers were amazing as well. Everything about this place screams -yummy!  Can't wait to go back."
5,"Vey nice service and food. Complementary valet parking was great. Most of all, steak and chicken were excellent more than expected. Would definitely come back."
5,"I routinely went here to get my acrylic nails and pedicures done when I lived in that neighborhood.  Since moving to Gold Canyon a year and a half ago, I can not find anyplace closer to home that does as good a job with my nails as they do.  So now I am driving 50 miles roundtrip to go here to get my nails done.  Tom and Nina are fabulous, friendly and professional!"
5,Thank you thank you thank you. Took my car in to have the windows tinted and it was up very enjoyable experience. Very professional and a very clean job. Great price and I wouldn't hesitate to take another vehicle there for tinting in the future.
5,"Very friendly, great vibes when walked in. I love the pictures of all the different selections of items on menu. Well, that's because I am a visual person, I need to see what my food looks like. I must say, it's everything I expected it to be. I have #6 Fruit Addict- so so delicious.  It reminded me of all the good desserts in Thailand put together in one cup."
5,"First of all,  let me just say that I do not trust just anyone with my precious eyebrows, so after moving here and being new to the area, I did quite a bit of research before finally picking a place. I'm so glad I chose this location! So far, I've been here twice for an eyebrow wax and have not been disappointed. The experience is very relaxing and they take their time to ensure everything looks perfect. I have definitely found my go-to spot!"
5,"Today I visited HoneyGrow for the very first time and man was I blow away. We ordered two different stir fry options. The rice, with green beans and turkey was absolutely delicious. The turkey meat was well seasoned and the sauce was absolutely delicious. Our second was the noodles with tofu but we also added chicken and shrimp. Foremost, I do not like tofu and I know my boyfriend has not eaten it at all and we loved every bite of it. This place is a must try."
5,"Loved meeting the owner's fiancé, who was holding down the front of the house. She was so sweet. They did such a great job renovating this space. Food was awesome and reasonably priced. They have ""beer of the month"" promos so we got a draft beer for $4 and wings were on special Monday night. Pro tip: sit on the upstairs back patio! Such a cute, private outdoor space."
5,"I recently dined at The Pub with a few of my clients and we had a great experience. When we first walked in we were greeted right away. We were quickly sat at a table and since it was our first time, were shown their best sellers. I didn't go into it with high expectations, but the food and service were incredible! A perfect and chill environment to wind down or get your night started."
5,"This is my new favorite place to get healthy food.

The design is clean and minimalist, with a few goodies:
1. The ordering kiosks are awesome! Often, I get the same thing at a restaurant because I don't want to ask a bunch of questions about the menu and possible substitutions. Also, this eliminates the common restaurant sin of cooks touching money, then touching food. 

2. The message board that lets you know when your order is done has a soothing retro noise and the letter and numbers shuffle. 

The first time I went here, I was craving a salad. I didn't want the pitiful portion size at panera and I also didn't want to get carried away and make a $20 salad at whole foods. I was able to customize the salad to my liking and was shocked at how big it was. For $9, I had a meal and a snack for later. 

The second time I came here, I got the red curry tofu noodles. It was very good, but not as spicy as I would have liked. I finished the whole serving in one sitting, but was uncomfortably full afterward. I also tried the fruit cup (strawberries, bananas, and grapes with chocolate chips, clover honey, and whipped cream. The fruit cup was tasty, but for $6, I would have been better off buying the mixed berry cup at whole foods down the street. 

This is a yummy spot if you have a couple dollars and are looking for nutritionally dense foods."
5,"The MOST delicious food, and fast service! Inside is cute and updated. Parking in that area is generally not awesome but it's worth it. 
It's unfortunate that healthy food options cost what they do; you'd think it would be cheaper to eat healthier if they wanted to combat obesity ?. One meal with a few add-ins and OF COURSE a honey bowl runs you about $20. I wish it were a little cheaper, but I still love it!"
5,"Went here for my 4 year anniversary from a friend's recommendation. We loved our steaks. They were huge, and they were SO good that even when we microwaved it the next day it was STILL good. Remarkable!"
5,"I've been visiting Idolize since 2 years now. And I must say, my experience with Sejal has been great ever since.
I used to visit South Park location - so a little disappointed that it has now moved.

I read other reviews, and would definitely love to try out Facial at this place too.

One suggestion - if the staff is listening - I moved from San Francisco, Bay Area, and one of the things that I miss till date is great value package that a local threading place used to offer.  It had an unlimited services package, which was so perfect for Indian Ethnicity (esp, North Indian; who are blessed with plenty of hair :P ). So would love it even more if any such thing starts here."
5,I walked in earlier this week for a lip wax.  Julie helped me.  The wax was much gentler than any other I had experienced elsewhere.  Made appointment for an Ultra Calming facial and it was phenomenal!  Best facial I have ever had.  Julie was excellent!  The facial/massage melted my stress and tension away and my skin feels great!
5,"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!

They have a bit of an identity issue though.  When you come in, they have TV's all over.  One TV will have infomercials running.  Another will be sports.  Another will be soap operas, another will be the cooking channel, another will be Judge Judy... and while every TV is different... you hear POP/TOP 40 radio over the speakers.  There is no common look and feel/theme.

The staff, although pleasant, are not well trained.  For example, I took a friend there the other day.  Sumo's opens at 4pm.  There quite literally were 5 different guests waiting to get in.  It was really cold out and the doors were locked.  At 4:05pm, the doors were still locked and you could see employees inside standing and talking.  It was when a different employee showed up and was unable to get in too.  He made a call to ask someone to come open the doors.  They did and we entered about 4:10pm.  We were frozen!  lol

Once inside, a few went to the Hibachi grill, one couple went to the sushi bar and my friend and I waited to be seated.  The hostess and one of the other employees stood there talking to each other for another 5 minutes.  She looks up at me and I give her the ""WTF"" look... and with that, she seated us.  

But... this... is the worst of it.  and because the food is so good, we keep coming back!  

3 times we've done the Hibachi grill.  The other 4 times this month was at a table.  The reason for the table is because they wait until the grills partially fill up before sending out a chef.  So, unless you time it just right, you could be sitting at the grill for 20 plus minutes just waiting for them to come out.  So if in a hurry, the grill is not the place to go.  Although if you time it right... the GRILL IS A GREAT EXPERIENCE!

We've had 3 different chef's and all 3 were great!  Some make jokes, others were able to engage the guests and all 3 entertained well.  

When at the tables, the food comes more quickly but still... it's great food.

I often do the Steak and Chicken.  It's amazing that you get both, plus rice and fresh veggies... an entire plate of food, for under $11 (the lunch menu).  And the lunch menu is good Monday - Saturday!

One of our meals was again after 4:30pm.  So we were on the dinner menu.  I ordered the same exact meal and it was only $2 more. But, instead of just a simple side salad (OR soup which is more of a chicken broth) you get both.

Speaking of their salads... the dressing they make I believe is home made.  It's kind of a ginger vinaigrette????  Not sure but it's really quite good.  I normally do the broth/soup but lately I've switched because the dressing really grows on ya!

Anyhow, if you go after 4:30pm and do the Hibachi grill, be prepared to spend an additional $10/plate.  I was surprised that it was that much more just to sit at the grill.

Therefore... if you want to treat the family or the kids or the adult kids (I consider myself an adult kid) go for lunch.  It's hard to go wrong especially if you are not in a hurry.

The food is amazing, the staff are friendly, they are attentive and very nice.  

3 times... we were even offered a soda to go.  They came with the bill, we paid and when they gave us the receipt, 3 different times they asked if we'd like a TO GO soda.  Not something we've experienced before.  Very nice.  We declined each time but still... it was nice to be asked.

Sumo's is the old... Home Town Buffet.  It's totally remodeled and really quite nice.  Just across from Office Depot, next to Denny's on East Washington.

It's a real treat and one that is very affordable.

I really should take off a star for the comments mentioned at the very beginning of this review however... we all truly are a huge fan of this place and therefore... it gets the full 5 stars.

Thanks!"
5,"I passed by this place many times and was really unclear on what they were selling so I never went in. From the outside, it looks like a Hawaiian surf gift shop. On the side of the building is painted ""food nirvana"" in which I always thought to my self while driving; ""what the hell does that mean? Do they serve Hawaiian? Mexican? Asian?"".
Well fear not folks, went in today and was pleasantly surprised. Inside decor was of a Hawaiian gift shop, mixed with some 70's novelty burger shop seatings. They had cool car chairs that reclined which I never encountered before (except in cars). 
 It was a bit on the pricy side and it did look like they had new people on board. We had 3 people with us and it came about to $35. 
It is not Hawaiian by any means but it's more Mexican-american oriented with California surfer terminology strewn across their menus. My burger was fantastic, their fries are really not great though. It's not crispy by any means and it feels soggy but it was fresh. I'm not sure how they achieved such mediocrity in their fries. 
 I do recommend the burger though, it is served on rye bread so the bread got soggy fast; but the meat had a lot of merit to it.  Also had a bite of the California taco and that was also great. Waitress was attentive, recommended me some food to eat, which I appreciated. Will come here again to experience other foods, I'll probably try the other burgers next time."
5,Excellent service and the food was amazing! Aggie took such great care of us that we decided to go back the next day.
5,"This is the best salad in Pittsburgh. The service and ingredients are great. I made my own salad with Spinach and they have everything imaginable as an add in. The service is even better. I came with my mother-in-law and Elena couldn't have been kinder or more helpful. If you're in Pittsburgh and you want a salad, honey grow is the place."
5,"Great breakfast and service l, i ordered french toast and my wife had biscuits and gravy. Everything was as we expected."
5,"This is good canto Chinese food after a good day of exercise... After our NTSC ski day, this is the place we head to to forge on Chinese food.... Prices are cheap and the quality of bbq pork is excellent., 

Meat is lean (not fatty) , warm and amazing.., the fried tofu/vegetable dish is great too...

Free parking at centre point mall but it gets very busy on a Saturday night.. The sweet and sour pork was crispy combined with the sweet/sour sauce.., 

Overall it's an amazing place for good canto foof"
5,I had a wonderful experience.  Shree was patient and gentle with me as it was my first time having my eyebrows threaded.  I will definitely come back here for more services.
5,"James at Shine Salon is amazing! He transformed my curly moppy hair into something beautiful light and fun!! I highly recommend him. I have a lot of hair, and it's ""ethnic"" per say but it didn't scare him he was able to cut it in a style that I haven't been able to stop playing with it since! Not to mention Shine Salon in beautiful clean and the staff if super friendly! I highly recommend for my curly hair girls!"
5,"This is an update since I've been here easily 25 times since their grand opening. I found out that I actually love the #1, which consists of fresh coconut juice, longan, basil seeds, coconut pieces, pandan jelly, and I like to add in red tapioca for extra texture. It's the right amount of sweetness, it's refreshing, and I'm hooked on it. The staff is so friendly and always has a smile on their faces, which lifts my spirits after each visit. They've added so many other items on their menu and I can't wait to try more so I can see if there's a new favorite that exists!"
5,"My new favorite spot! Just had #6 Fruit Addiction. Tastes really refreshing and especially great in 100+ degree weather. 
My friend had the yogurt honeydew which has a slight tart flavor but also so yummy!
I'll for sure be back soon and can't wait to tell my friends!"
5,"Absolutely loved my skin-brightening fancy facial with Jane.  She was incredibly professional and knowledgeable, and gave me lots of great suggestions, without trying to sell me a bunch of extra products and things like I've encountered at some other spas.  The facial was thorough and very relaxing.  I will definitely be returning to see Jane.  My only comment for the spa is I wish they offered facial packages since I would love to go once a month or so, but full price the facials are a little expensive to go that often.  I also wish they would do chemical peels!"
5,"Absolutely loved it!  This will definetely be our spot when we go to Vegas from now on.  The check in time is 4pm, we arrived at about 2pm.  We asked if we could check in and he said we could, but it would be a $25 fee.  That was the only thing that I would change.  

The hubby and I were in the studio with a king bed. The room was spacious for us.  Our room had a kitchenette - mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster and sink.  It was also stocked with plates, bowls, glasses and utencils.  The bathroom had a nice whirlpool, I made use of it after a night of dancing!  

We used the complimentary shuttle, which was nice.  The driver was nice and very informative.  The shuttle brings you to NY, NY and Treasure Island.  However, if you want to go to TI, you have to wait for the shuttle at NY, NY that goes to IT.  

We liked being off the strip away from the hustle and bustle.  It is on the west side of Tropicana.  The property was quiet and well maintained.  and the staff was nice and friendly.  We went to the pool and enjoyed it.  It wasn't that crowded so it was easy to find a spot.  The pool and hot tub is open 24 hours.  If our stay was longer, we would have grilled up some steaks too!  

Walgreens and Dennys is just next door along with a gas station and In n Out down the street.  

We can't wait to stay next year!  Hopefully the rate will be in the same price range.  We paid $55 dollars and night and was by far the best bargain!"
5,Went here for the first time for a friends birthday. Everything was awesome! Food service and the show were all impeccable. The prices are fair for all the food you get and the entertainment is a bonus. I'll definitely be back here soon. Great hibachi and the spicy tuna roll was also delicious.
5,"My coworkers and I went to Sumo for our annual Christmas Party/Dinner... it was so much fun! Lorenzo was our hibachi chef and he was super funny and witty - kept us entertained! And, the food was so amazing - my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Portions were huge and we all ate our leftovers for lunch today, talking about how much fun we had. I had a delicious Sumo Sangria too. I look forward to bringing more of our friends and family back! Thanks for a great meal/experience!!"
5,"On my first visit I noticed that the facility was nice and clean and layed out well. It was like a hidden gem. I got an acrylic white tip set with gel for $35 and a pedicure with the most perfect bright sunflower design for $27. I only quickly browsed Pinterest on a whim to find a design and she ran with it and did one even better than I found! Prices are of course competitive with other nail spas but I was happy to see the technicians working very quickly on my nails while still leaving me with a great product. I was done in about an hour and fifteen minutes with both. I'm hoping now that this set lasts, we will see!"
5,"This place is the real deal!  It is my most favorite Mexican food ever!  The have a Chile Rellano burrito that is to die for.   Happy hour Mon thru Friday with all Mexican beers in a bottle just $2 bucks.   Their salsa bar is the best in the business with a variety of salsas that are all fantastic not to mention the spicy carrots and grilled onions.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the owner is there 24/7 and is one of the nicest guys!   Fish tacos are just awesome and Tuesday is taco night with specials galore!
You won't regret your visit to Ricardo's."
5,"I love the influx of new Asian cuisines and desserts coming to the Phoenix area! Bambu is a refreshing drink and dessert shop specializing in chè, or Vietnamese style dessert. Yep, it's chè, and not Che the Argentine Marxist revolutionary (He probably didn't drink too much bubble tea or pandan jelly drinks back in his day). 

The shop is small but the variety is large. They have several coconut milk and coconut juice drinks that include various fruits, jellies, and boba, as well as bubble tea and coffee drinks. I went for the #1, a dessert with coconut juice, shaved ice, longan, basil seed, shaved fresh coconut, and pandan jelly. It was a light tasting drink that is good for someone that doesn't want something super sweet and is looking for more hydrating refreshment. All the components tasted good together, although the pandan jelly's slippery texture was a little weird to me. I had a taste of the #6 which had coconut milk which was more ""dessert-like"" with rich coconut milk, fruit, and various jellies. 

On a hot day this shop will definitely be a favorite way to cool down. I'll be back!"
5,"After looking around at many places one of my friends referred me to Rob at Spencers.  I had a great experience. My main goal is to get the best price, but the service he gave me was great too! I would shop here again.  I prefer buying from a local company. I read some of the other reviews and I just don't the negativity.  This place is amazing!!"
5,"After 3 months of trying to get a brand new washer and dryer from Lowes that actually worked I finally gave up and went to Spencers. It took only 2 minutes before Don Paul asked if we needed help and only another 10 for him to explain the pros and cons of each model, choose the right one for me, pay and set up delivery for the next day. I couldn't be happier with  the efficiency and service and will never go anywhere else again for my appliances! Thank you Don Paul for letting me enjoy the rest of my weekend!"
5,"I've been staying here for over four years when I traveled on orders. Just as before, the Hampton Inn spirit is exceptional!!!!! Beyond their normal exceptional customer service, they treat we military folks like we were their own family.  One of my favorites is Ghanie. He is an outstanding representative for Hampton Inns. He is a lot of fun to talk with and he works very hard to take care of his guests.

The Inn is very close to the airport and their shuttle has the schedules (of the arrivals and departures) down pat.

The casinos are great but if you want the down home comforts, stay at this Hampton Inns and Suites."
5,I've been here three times and I love this place. My eyebrows look amazing and I always get compliments. The threading lasts long and ILA was able to get even the tiniest and most stubborn of hairs off my face for a perfect finish.
5,"Love coming to Idolize for brow threading! Highly recommend Nitu- she's always really sweet and professional. I've always gotten my brows waxed but threading lasts so much longer and gives a much more natural shape. Great team at this location, very friend staff and comfortable, clean environment!"
5,"Went on opening day,  loved this place,  definitely a plus for the east side. Their sushi lunch special is great!!!"
5,"Dropped by last Saturday and there was no wait.  I got my two front windows tinted and was out within an hour.  Looks fantastic, no complaints about service and was able to sit and watch tv while I waited.  I had a coworker see the check-in and join me to get his car done as well.  They applied the check-in discount as I paid.  They brought the truck around to the front and they informed me there was something they weren't happy with and asked me to wait another 10 minutes while they corrected it.  I was impressed instead of letting me go, they made it right before leaving."
5,"Great store, great service, great prices. Nice job Kevin Rymer!!

Will be back!

Thanks"
5,"What can I say, I always come back for more. I missed my last appointment as I was ill, so it took me a while to get back in as I am only able to get in on Saturday's and as we all know, this day always books fast. 

So I started my day with some love from Shine and the only man that is allowed to put sharp objects near my hair, Mark. 

He truly is a wonderful artist and he knows what to do with curls... my curls in particular. My curls are an evil bunch with a mind of their own frizzly kinky self - true story, as a child I would tell my mother my hair hurt just to stay home from school... didn't work, but supports that fact that they have a mind of their own. 

James was his assistant this past Saturday and he did a very professional job washing and adding the extra intervention needed to help my hair from committing hair suicide. He also gives a mean head massage.. yum.

Okay back to Mark... since my hair was about to commit suicide, he was able to save it by cutting 3 inches off and shaping it perfectly around my face. I should have asked him to take some pics, maybe I will tomorrow after I get ready for work, I've slept on it since then, although it still looks great, it just does't reflect his technique. 

Mark I still love you and thank you for the beautiful crown of curls! Intervention was a success, rehab in session!"
5,I've taken three cars here and they've all come out in excellent quality. You can really tell they take pride in their work and never have a second thought about coming here for more tint!
5,First time here on Xmas.  So thrilled to have a great sushi place that also has a great full service bar and full Chinese menu.  Fancy rainbow was outstanding. Grilled squid app so fresh. Asked them to take the spice up a notch on curry and they delivered.  Spice catered to WI but i would ask for a little higher heat factor to take advantage of full flavor!  We will be back very soon.
5,"Been going to Lotus since they first opened. I love it.  Their prices are fair and in line with other nail salons I have tried.  I have had mostly pedicures done and 1 manicure for new year's eve.  They have always done a great job on my nails. I was very pleased with the service, think that their salon is very clean and upscale. I love the decor and ""bar"" setting.  Before service, they cover the pedicure bowls with disposable wrap with is VERY nice! I had never seen that at other salons.  Mai and Danny are very nice."
5,"For special  occasions, we always dine here!  The service is impeccable!  Friendly and courteous!  The table side Cesar salad is fabulous!  We love watching them make it.  As for dinner, it's always the Prime Rib.   Always cooked medium rare to perfection.  Accompanied with garlic mashed potatoes, it doesn't get any better than this!"
5,"Yay Bambu is finally here in Arizona!!! Ok people you have to try this place out. I love this place....I'm seriously here 3-4 times a week!!! This place is awesome. If you're  looking for a light desert after lunch, dinner, or just a refreshing drink thru out the day. You have to give this place a try. I had try almost everything on the menu... Everything taste delicious!! I love their salted caramel coffee. I know that doesn't sound good but trust me it taste yummy  plus the milk teas is also pretty good too. I love black tea with milk and some grass jelly, egg pudding. All their employees is very friendly... A plus"
5,"I love love love this place! Fresh food, great prices, and excellent customer service. I have used this place as a caterer as well and they can't be beat. Their deliveries are always on time, they have excellent set ups, and again their prices are phenomenal.
Crowd favorites are chicken salad, Thai noodle salad, and orange chicken also the most amazing green beans!"
5,"So crazy how diverse the reviews are! I don't understand why people don't express to the technicians if they want something different done or don't like what they're doing wether it be a manicure or pedicure. They're Your  nails. Don't think it's fair to Not to speak up and then turn around and give an unsatisfactory review..really?

I've been here twice and it's been great both times. Got my nails done the first time- awesome job- told her exactly what I wanted and it came out great. Got a pedicure the 2nd time and got the middle package (sea salt scrub with callus remover) and it was very relaxing. I work constantly so this was a nice break from my hectic schedule. 

They're tucked away and hidden from the road so you need to do a little investigating to find them. Both times I've been a walk-in and was seated right away. Very happy with this place and location (live right down the street) :)"
5,"I'm am a Californian. And I eat great burgers in L.A. However this place has one of the best burgers I have tasted. Plus pitchers are only $5! What!!! Furthermore I met Scott the owner, and he's a down to earth funny dude. That likes to golf. Lol."
5,"Happened to be on the west side of Madison so was searching for a place nearby for a pedicure. So glad that I found Lotus! 

The decor is thoughtful and tasteful. It's a good sign when your nail salon actually cares about their personal aesthetic. The front area is a metropolitan style nail bar, which is separated from the rear pedicure area by a partial wall made up of a faux fish tank/water feature. 

My nail tech was super friendly and fun. She offered up a variety of their services, but really didn't pressure me when I opted not to do anything but a pedi. What my friend and I did opt for were the beverages they offered - bottled water, soda or wine. Friend got the white wine and said it was a tasty Riesling. Impressed!

The pedicure itself was great too! My nail tech made sure that I was comfortable and checked on water temperature and if her leg massage was too firm for my tastes. Everything was perfect though. I also was glad to see that paraffin wax is included in even the most basic pedicure. To note is that they have something like 5-7 different pedicures of different prices and features. You are sure to find one that you will like!

Last thing that impressed me is that even though my friend and I showed up 15 mins before they closed, they were welcoming and stayed after closing to accommodate us. For some reason I always end up wanting to do pedis on Sundays, so it's nice that Lotus is open until 5pm on Sundays."
5,"Great service. He took the time to explain the different options, honored the yelp discount, and explained the legal tint limits. Comfortable waiting room. Highly recommend."
5,"Wonderful flavor and great concept! Alana (sp?) asked us how our food was, and was genuinely interested in our feedback. My bowl didn't seem to have the same amount of food as the other bowls, and she quickly resolved it by getting me more without charging. Unbelievable customer service, tasty food, and we'll be back with the kids again! Thank you Alana!"
5,"I have been a regular customer of Marija for waxing for the past 8 months or so, and I will never ever shave again, or go to a different salon. Marija does an outstanding job every time I see her - she carefully alternates the type of wax depending on how my hairs are growing, and she always offers great advice for skin health. I highly recommend Marija and Idolize Dilworth for anyone looking for a reliable waxing service."
5,"We went Spencer's for a replacement for a walloven. They had the unit we wanted in stock and were able to install it the next day. The salesman was friendly and efficient, the order was completed in minutes. Paul, the installer, arrived promptly and was very competent. Things just could not have gone smoother. All this and we paid less than the sale price elsewhere."
5,"Very good service, reasonable pricing, good customer service, good turn around time..  will definitely be back for all my tinting needs"
5,"We were traveling with a 7 1/2 month old and needed a place to stay one night.  I picked this particular hotel because of the reviews and I have to say I was very happy with our stay.   

We got a King Suite and the room was a good size.  There was enough room for all of our stuff as well as a playpen.  The room was very clean, and the bed was very comfortable.  The Staff was excellent and friendly.  The breakfast had a wide selection to choose from and we were very happy with what was served.  If we are back in Las Vegas, I would chose this hotel again.  It is close to the airport, but I didn't hear the planes.  It isn't too far from the strip either."
5,Lunch today. I never go out because nothing fast food is ever good. Jimmy hulas changed my mind. Fresh flavorful absolutely delishus. Call in the order it's waiting for you. The fish taco was crunchy with lots of toppings. The tropical salad was so fresh and flavorful. Absolutely highly recommend
5,This place is terrific. Great food and service! It's new. Needs some talking up. Had the best burger!
5,Had a great experience today at Spencer's. My refrigerator died and needed a replacement immediately. Kevin was very helpful and found me a great deal on a new refrig that could be delivered tomorrow.
5,"I was iffy about coming here because of the bad reviews but I tried it and it was awesome. I just moved to the are from Dallas and have got the Nexgen dip powder for some years...and they had it! It was quiet and relaxing, Kenny did my nails and he was friendly and did a really good job! I will be going back for sure."
5,"My husband and I are moving last minute, he is in the military and we were really over whelmed and worried about leaving our home. Thankfully  we found OnQ and they have been nothing but helpful, accommodating and understanding. We will be moving over seas soon and have been treated so well we know we can trust them with our home. We are so thankful to have one less thing to worry about, and excited to continue to work with them."
5,"Finally a location in AZ!!! Having been to locations in SoCal and Vegas, I could not wait for this location to open after seeing the coming soon signs on my way to China Magic Noodle House. 

I went on opening day at around 945pm. According to Yelp, Bambu was posted as open. The location really closes at 9pm Monday to Saturday, and on Sunday at 7pm. However, we were greeted nicely and I was able to place the last order. The owner (?) at the cashier was very friendly. The price is on par with the Irvine, CA location. The quality and the taste are as good if not better than the other locations I have been to.

What is different about this location is the ability to make your own custom drink with up to 5 add ons. The names of the drinks are different than other locations but the ""preselected"" drinks are essentially the same. The location is small with only a few tables, but I usually get mine to go anyways. Bambu, welcome to Chandler!"
5,"My colleague and I went here for lunch yesterday.It was my first time,but not hers.I definitely have been missing out though!I can't remember the exact name of my sandwich but it was a sandwich with steak on ciabatta (chicken is an option too).It was so good!I loved the pesto spread they used and the veggies (mushrooms,peppers,etc) added a nice crunch to the sandwich. I ordered a salad as my side which was fresh.I am a big fan of my lettuce cut thin so I was pleased with the cutting of the lettuce.My colleague ordered some type of bowl and was pleased with her meal as well.

We went about 11:30am and it did not take long at all for our food to be served.I noticed a lot of pick up orders,so this seems to be a regular place for many individuals.

I observed parking and traffic can be congested as it is located in Plaza Midwood."
5,"HOLY PAMPERED GUEST BATMAN!!!! Seriously. If you are traveling to this city and don't feel like spending your time in a noisy, smoky, hectic casino hotel, and yet.... want to be treated like a valued customer despite not being there just to empty your bank account at their tables? Stay Here. You legit feel like some kind of VIP and it'll totally go to your head too, great feeling. And if you need anything, ask for Nate. (Hampton Inn, do what you have to to hold on to Nate, that guy has what it takes to go places in the hospitality / events industry)"
5,"I moved to Charlotte a few weeks ago and I needed an appointment fast. I saw the reviews on here were pretty well so I figured I'd give them a try. I was able to get a last minute appointment due to a cancellation. I was scheduled with Shane and I loved her! I showed her a picture of the hair style I wanted and she nailed it. Although I paid more for this hair appointment than any other in my life, I loved the outcome of my hair."
5,"Coaltrane's is a wonderful experience, the food (which delicious), the atmosphere is awesome especially the music which is on point, and the staff was super friendly and attentive. I ordered a full Rotisserie Chicken and it was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful throughout, and the skin was perfect, also came conveniently quartered so no hassle serving. Came with 3 sides which I enjoyed all of, the Garlic Mashed Potatoes were out of the world, Green Beans were fresh and cooked perfectly, and the Corn Casserole was great ""comfort"" side. All in all it was a fantastic meal, and surprisingly affordable. Definitely recommended!"
5,"We tried this place out despite what our friends said about it for their first experience. All 3 of us agreed that we loved what we ordered. We weren't going in expecting anything but first of all: we had excellent customer service from the owner, she explained how they make the coconut milk fresh everyday and that all of the ingredients are not bagged and processed (which is what you would get with normal halo halo) and I loved knowing that the ingredients were fresh and not in a jar for who knows how long? she even let us try the lotus seed as we were a little skeptical on what that would be and let us replace it for coconut jelly without an extra charge. 

I got the fruit addict. 
My girlfriend got the Awesome Trio. 
And my best friend got the Coconut Lover with coconut jelly in place of the lotus seed. 

We loved how refreshing they were and not too sweet to our tastebuds. Each one of them rated it 5 stars and we will definitely be back. :)"
5,"Jane at Idolize Dilworth is amazing!! I highly recommend her for any of your waxing needs. I was nervous about trying a new technician but she made me feel super comfortable and answered any questions I had. 

During the waxing service, Jane was friendly and able to keep my mind off any ""tough moments"" (Ladies- catch my drift?). For each step, she explained what product she is using (ie. Antiseptic, witch hazel, powder, etc) and why she is using it. 

In addition, they use high quality products and tailor the selected product to your particular skin type. I have sensitive skin, so Jane used a great quality hard wax instead of strips. I have had irritation/reactions in the past and I left Jane feeling no discomfort at all! 

Lastly, cleanliness/hygiene is super important in this business. Idolize Dilworth is a beautiful location with an attractive sitting area, clean bathroom, and sanitary service rooms. Jane wore gloves during the service and new sticks were used in the wax each time (very critical!!). Plus, you are next door to Smoothie King...who doesn't need a post-wax smoothie! 

If you are looking for great waxing services, go see Jane. I plan to check out a facial in the future!"
5,"They offer stuffed avocados that are delicious!!! Thank youuu for a great tasty healthy option. I think it's awesome you can do a half order of it, either for a good sized lunch or you just want to save room to try their other tasty options. All of the sauces are delicious,  I love flavor so I mixed them together differently for each bite and honestly offered me a fun way to eat as well. I especially love their 2 most hottest hot sauce though.  

The corn casserole was not what i expected to be which was street corn style but i appreciate their unique twist & my 10 month babyboy sure liked it. The mash potatoes are delicious!!!!!! The steak cooked & flavored so tasty & wonderfully as well. 

Been in Clt my whole life & never came to what it was before.  I don't know if I should be ashamed or that's common.  I noticed there was something here but for no reason at all I just never experienced it. I sure don't regret giving this a try though & I'm glad Coaltrane is here now. Most likely would frequent this place on the regular now. Everyone is so friendly!"
5,"Let me start by saying the Octagon can go toe-to-toe with any other steakhouse in Canada. It owns top spot in the T.O. scene and remains respectable going up against any steakhouse in New York, Vegas or Chicago. 

Decor is...oak. Lots of oak. Stained glass and leather finish it off. It is old school steakhouse. Service too is old school. The boys there know their stuff, and they are unapologetic about not being there to entertain you. They know their job and it is to deliver what counts...steak.

The Caesar salad matches the decor...old school. Table side preparation in an aged wooden bowl, Greek oil, fresh egg yolk, bacon, anchovy and enough garlic to ward off any evil spirit. Don't pass up the opportunity. 

The garlic bread is...perfect. Always perfect and the only downside is it is so good you have to be very careful not to kill your appetite ahead of the meal. Greek olives, pickled peppers and pickle spears round out the complimentary apps.

The steak. This is why you came. Savour it. 

If you have room left for desert you are a better man than I will ever be. 

Enjoy!"
5,"I am in love with this place! We tried the passion in love smoothie and you can actually taste the different kind of fruit flavors in there, it's amazing! I also got a Vietnamese coffee which I like, better than Starbucks lol no bitter after Taste, strong yet sweet. The only thing is don't stop by in a lunch break because it takes a little longer than most places, but we don't mind since it was good! Will definitely be back and will tell all my friends to try it!"
5,Amazing food! By far my favorite salsa and you get a good amount for the price you pay.
5,My kids loved it! Do I have to say any more..  My wife went Singapore cashew and I went butter chicken. Food was quick. Staff were nice. Will be back
5,I've been going to the for years.  you can't beat the quality and price. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a very professional place and a friendly staff.
5,"I love this place. I only get manicures but I'm sure pedicures are great too, my roommate is VERY happy with them. I always get long acrylic nails that last forever. I've been to other places too and never had a better quality of work done on my nails than at Lotus. Me and all my friends come here!"
5,"I got to work with Kim in looking at one of On Q's rental properties. Kim was such a huge help getting us set up to see it and answering our bazillion questions. :) So even though we ended up going with another property, we had a great experience with On Q. She was accessible, helpful and resourceful and we really appreciated that in a crazy rental market!"
5,"Absolutely love this place. It was my first time in. They open at 1030 on Sundays and  it was 1015. The lady let my son and I sit inside and wait. She was super friendly and talked to us while opening the salon. So that right there was wonderful. Second, I had gotten my nails done previously from a different salon and they did AWFUL. A man named, Tom took them off free of charge (20$ value) and fixed them with a beautiful pink and white acrylic set. He did such a BEAUTIFUL job I tipped him very well!! This is the first I have met someone who I will be requesting every time. He was super gentle with my fingers and just overall a nice man. I will be asking for him every time."
5,"What a great steakhouse! We went there on Sat evening and I had french onion soup, escargot, and petite filet mignon. Everything was delicious and the service was quick and efficient. The place was full, so I was a bit concerned that my meat will be overdone. Well, the steak was exactly medium-rare done to perfection. Unfortunately I didn't have space left for desert, their creme brulee looked delicious, so hopefully next time :)"
5,"I have been a Spencer's customer for almost 18 years. My 1st salesperson was Big Don in the Mesa location to Kevin Rhymer in the San Tan location today. I have purchased everything from RO system, water softeners to refrigerators and microwaves. I have always had excellent service. 

The prices are in line with the big box stores nearby. If the competition has a sale the matched the price. Delivery and installation are reasonably priced, although I personally think every place should deliver and install as a part of he price, so I can't drop a star here.

I like the personalized service and I also like the showroom, now that I think about it. More personalized, I guess that is purposeful, but I was comfortable with it. I also like the folder with the receipt. I lose the smaller loose ones and this help me keep them organized."
5,"I Got To Say, If You Are At This Store Ask For Nick. We Had Just Purchased A New House And Were Remodeling Our Kitchen. We Purchased The GE Package, Fridge, Stove, Dishwasher, Microwave. Nick Was Great  Took Care Of The Rebates For Us. He Kept Us Updated About The Rebate, Delivery, Etc. After Getting The Appliances, We Had A defect With The Dishwasher....Nick Replaced It With A Brand New One! Nick Did A Great Job, Will Be Back In The Future!"
5,"I had my entire brand new car tinted about a month ago. The service was great and professional. the work was outstanding. We recommend everyone to visit auto express tinting all the time. We are and will continue to be loyal customers. keep up the excellent work.
Best Regards, Romyd ""DJ IZE"" Owens"
5,"Got to come in today for a tasting preview, they are actually open for business beginning tomorrow (9/8/17).  

This is a new place with an awesome, healthy menu! The main foods are salad or stir-fry and each listing can be customized to your liking. They also offer cold- pressed juices and a ""honeybar"" which is a fresh fruit cup with various toppings. 

Ordering is done on a large touch screen and your order number is presented on a flip board hanging on the wall. I had a longer wait than expected but I'm certain this will improve with time.

So most importantly, the food was great!! I had the sweet soy five spice, which had brown rice base, green beans, ground turkey, onions and sesame seeds. Ingredients can easily be swapped. It tasted delicious and sooo fresh!

The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable on their menu.  I'm excited to come back!"
5,"This is an amazing place located in Central Avenue! They have hearty salads but they also have this amazing stuffed avocado with quinoa. Sounds weird and healthy but that me it is equally good as unhealthy stuffed avocado... Maybe even better.

Definitely check out their rooftop bar while you are there.

5,"The most clean nails salon I've ever been to and they do a great job! They have very relaxing pedicure, definitely recommend!"
5,"I have a cinematographer and I travel a lot. Typically, I stay in Hampton Inns or Hilton branded hotels.  I like Hampton because you know that you're generally going to get consistent service across-the-board.

However, this Hampton Inn is an outlier.  The customer service was incredibly great!

When we arrived, we were greeted by Lucy, the front desk manager. She made us feel like we were at home.  She cheerfully granted all of our requests and made us feel like we were the only people staying at the hotel.

Even though the hotel is right at the airport the rooms were incredibly quiet. I slept like a baby and I'm ready to meet the day's tasks.

I have already made three future reservations for this property. This hotel is now my go to place to stay when I'm in Las Vegas."
5,Thank you thank you thank you James for helping me with my troubled hair this week! I had been in a hair rut and it was looking horribly damaged and dry. I was nervous to go to a new salon and a new stylist but James worked his magic and I haven't loved my hair color like this in literally years! Thank you Shine Salon and thank you James!
5,I live in TX right now and I am transferring to AZ so i was very nervous about how I was going to find a home without being there.  Kim McGill has been extremely helpful and made the process easy.    She responds to my emails or phone calls very quick. From the time I called the 1st time to inquire about a property to after I was approved she has been on top of everything. I am extremely blessed to have her as my leasing agent. I am so excited to be moving to AZ and look forward to my new home.  If you are looking for a great rental property On Q is the company to call.
5,"Without question, the best rotisserie chicken and stuffed avocado I've ever had!!! Everything was amazing!! I do have to admit though the best part of our experience tonight was Audrey. Bubbly personality and warm smiles. Hands down best place in Plaza Midwood. Definitely coming back very soon!!"
5,"Quick, easy, no hassle, delicious! Menu has large variety, however my favorite go to is the chimichanga platter. Great weekly specials as well. Love this place!"
5,"Never dissapointed! I moved up to Madison from Chicago, October 2014. I absolutely love the staff and the salon itself is super clean, trendy and always update on color selection. They have the biggest selection of no-chip (shellac) colors I have ever seen. My no-chip manicures last for 3 weeks or more (if I were to let them go that long).

If you're looking for nail salon I highly recommend, Lotus Nail Bar and Spa!!!!!!"
5,"One of my favorite finds in Pittsburgh is this fresh mixed salad and stir fry place, where you can choose their ready mixed salads or create your own. The greens always tasted fresh and crispy, the toppings were unique and obviously seasonal. I liked that you could add in udon and tofu and all sorts of interesting toppings to vary the proteins and flavors. Also, huge points to the manager who was on duty one evening - a slender young woman who was obviously proud of her establishment, and happy to walk me through the ordering process. She seemed really invested in the success of the place. Finally, that lemon walnut dressing is causing me problems because I can't get it now that I've left Pittsburgh. I hope they thrive!

Update: Just found out they are in Brooklyn!!! Yesss!"
5,"Spencers was super easy to work with.  After my washing machine went out, I already knew the brand and model I wanted to buy.  After visiting the usual suspects, Home Depot and Lowes, I called Spencer's to see how much they were selling it for.  Low and behold, it was $50 less than their competition.  I asked about installation fees, and that was about $30 cheaper.  Best part, they could deliver tomorrow in comparison to a week out at the big box locations.  

Delivery was next day as promised and installation and removal of the old unit went smoothly.  Best part about this transaction is that I was able to do everything over the phone!  I obviously can't comment about their selection or service in-store, but I was happy with my experience on a 100% remote transaction!"
5,"The pub is an awesome spot to grab a beer. Highlight recommend Bluffing Isn't Nice by Bad Beat Brewing. Also, shout-out to Aggie! Awesome bartender!"
5,"I really liked this place! First of all the decor is super cute. One thing to note is that seating is a bit limited so if you go at a busy time, be prepared to take it to-go. 

You order at touch screens, which I really liked because I had a bit of time to think about/change my order without feeling like I was inconveniencing someone. I made my own stir-fry which was really just a customization on the spicy garlic. Wow -- it was definitely spicy, and I like heat. I would say comparable to a 7 at a thai place. 

The portion size was great and everything tasted really fresh. I also really liked the diet pop -- they don't carry pepsi/coke. It's a less common more organic brand -- it had some type of natural sweetener which was not stevia. I was unsure at first but then I ended up really liking the flavor of it. 

I didn't have room for the honeybar but I'm dying to try that next time!"
5,I have 2010 toyota camry and i needed my windows tinted and i had contact these guys and they quoted me at a resonable price. The process of the installation took up too two hours and the work came out clean and quality.  Im happy i came here and i will start brining my future cars here from now on!
5,Best breakfast burritos EVER! Honestly if I could afford it I would eat their breakfast burritos every day! My husband has gotten other items off the menu and they have all been delicious. This is my go to Mexican food restaurant! I recommend it to everyone.
5,"Great job and NO, not 1 bubble! Service was only a couple of hours and not all day like past experiences. I would go back if I ever purchased a new car."
5,Must say i am impressed...great atmosphere/concept....food was good too...definately coming back
5,"For quick Asian cuisine, I found the Wok Box to be a perfect place to go for a fix.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and well laid out.  I had the coconut curry which had a perfect amount of spice and was really good.  It had a little too much rice for my liking but I got plenty of food for my money.  My visit was towards the end of the lunch hour, so it was relatively calm, but I can see the place being a bit of a zoo during busy times, especially with the parking lot being as jammed up as it usually is.  If you can deal with that, give it a shot."
5,"Outstanding service, clean facility and professional and friendly folks make this a great place to get your vehicle's window tinting done.  I took my Chevy Colorado Z71 here today and I am completely satisfied.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,"Great atmosphere, amazing food (love the fish tacos) and the hospitality is why we've become regulars. Can't say enough great things about this pseudo island getaway (reminds me of Key West)."
5,The atmosphere and cleanlyness of this spot is great. I had the machaca breakfast burrito and the ingredients were top notch. I wish this was closer to my home.
5,"This place is awesome, friendly staff and fast. 200.00 for 170 deal outstanding  great service"
5,Wanted to get my car tinted for the upcoming summer and found this place through yelp.  Called the day before and got an immediate appointment for the next day.  The place is located in a very convenient location.  After discussing the options went with the 25 percent tint with good pricing especially after the yelp discount.  Whole thing took about two hours.  Came back after lunch and it was done.  Tint came out looking great.  Customer service was also great.
5,"The Hashbrown Burrito not only satisfied my craving for a breakfast burrito, it exceeded my expectations! Fresh, delicious & ideally proportioned. The fresh salsa bar offered 4 salsa options + hot carrots. Yum! Found this place on Yelp...it did not disappoint!"
5,"Such a cool little find! Island flavor decor. A few taps and bottled beers. Thank heavens they made a Bloody Mary for me, I don't drink all that often but kinda wanted one all day to drown out this migraine. There's a table with bright color Cadillac type seats. If that table is open grab it! There are a few different sauce combinations from little spice to fuego hot! I got the Baja sauce on crispy fish tacos with a mango salsa which was right in the middle. The waitress was super attentive. Felt right at home. Definitely stop on and check it out!"
5,"Really tasty food, good price, friendly employees  and clean establishment.  Will return."
5,"Honeygrow is a great concept that Pittsburgh needs! Ordering at the kiosks really streamlines the process and allows guests to build their meal or snack exactly the way that they want. 

I ordered from the honeybar: yogurt, dried cranberries, blueberries, granola, and gingersnaps topped with clover honey. Absolutely delicious!

The little eclectic touches also make honeygrow charming--such as the ever-changing message board and the wordsearch napkins."
5,I had a wonderful facial with Jane.   She was very knowledgable and professional.  It was a wonderful relaxing experience and I look forward to my next facial.    BTW....She even called me next day to see how my skin was doing.   What service.
5,"We went for a late supper and were pleasantly surprised by our experience.
The waiter named Joe and the manager named Kim had great attitudes and were very very friendly. They provided excellent service and had great conversation. The food quality was great and very tasty as well. With so many 24-hour dining choices in this city. We highly recommend this Denny's location on Eastern and Serene especially when Joe and Kim are working."
5,This place is much more than it's been given credit for. I highly recommend the steak sandwich. Also really loved the crab fritters. The beer list is amazing as well. Definitely will go again.
5,"Amazing homestyle and authentic Mexican food.  Reasonably priced, and a great deal of variety.  I loved the Chili verde burritos."
5,Our server Christian did such an amazing job of explaining the menu and offering recommendations. He brought us our complimentary champagne to congratulate us on our recent marriage. He also brought us a beer pairing to finish the meal off with. Overall great experience!
5,I'm very happy with the work that was done here. Brought my Audi A4. I was looking around for reasonable prices and this was one of the lowest and I noticed they had great reviews. Everyone was super helpful and they did a good job. I'm definitely coming back for any future cars and work. :)
5,I LOVE this restaurant! I've been going there for more than a year! Very fresh and filling dishes! Highly recommended!
5,"I have been waiting and waiting for the Phoenix area to get a Bambu!  I love the dessert drinks at this place.  My favorite is the #1 Bambu Special that has longan, green jelly, basil seed, coconut meat, and coconut water.  It's super refreshing and kinda has some health benefits too on top of being delicious (basil seed is very good for you).  My very picky boyfriend who doesn't typically like Vietnamese dessert even liked this drink.  Thanks so much for bringing this place to Chandler!"
5,"Some days are ice cream days, some days are vegetable days. Today was a veggie kinda day, so I stopped by honeygrow for lunch. What a great place if you're looking for a healthier meal option! The ordering process is super simple using self-serve kiosks at the front. Honeygrow has salads, stir-fries, and fruit bowls that you can customize however your little heart desires. I opted to build my own stir-fry with wheat noodles, chicken, and a boatload of veggies in a sesame garlic sauce. Note that only 3 veggie add-in options are included, and beyond that you have to pay extra (which can add up quick....although today I didn't care and went for the veggie overload!)  My food was ready in about 5 minutes, and I was a happy camper. The portion was very generous, and they didn't skimp on any of the add-ins. I loved the sesame garlic sauce...it had great flavor and it wasn't too oily, which stir-fry sauces can sometimes be. Everything tasted very fresh, and I love that they use locally sourced ingredients where they can. It is kinda pricey (especially if you add a bunch of stuff in like I did), but I was happy with the quality, so it doesn't seem too excessive. I'll definitely be back next time I need a veggie day!"
5,I stopped into The Pub to grab a drink while I waited for the rest of my group to arrive at the Aria next door. The atmosphere was great!  Look for April at the bar and ask her about the Pub Challenge. April makes the best espresso martini!
5,"Great service at the bar .Fun ,fast .We enjoyed all the games on their tvs and Half and Halfs poured percectly.A must go .Great location"
5,"I have been working with Kevin in the San Tan location for well over 7 years now in my residential rental business.   I can always count on him to deliver timely service, installations and answers for my appliance needs.  

Spencer's has something at every price point and source the hard to fit or find items that other retailers cannot.  

What sets them apart from other retailer are the home delivery, installation and haul away services. While other retailers significantly mark this up, Spencer's always comes in at less cost and with much better service.  

If I every have a question or need, I can call them and they can quickly answer my phone call or track down a recent purchase.  They have a lot of pride in what they do from sales to the install team."
5,First time going and apparently I came right on time for the holiday special ($9 brow threading)!!! There was a short wait but so worth it...my brows have a mind of their own but she shaped them into obedience  overall great experience!
5,There were 4 of us in our group. The service was great and the food came quicker than I expected. I had the fish and chips. It was really good. I also like the atmosphere at The Pub. The Pub is a regular stop for me whenever I'm in Vegas.
5,My daughter suggested I go to Shine to see Mark because she has absolutely loved him for a while. He asks and actually listens to what you want. He gave me one of the best (if not the best) cuts I have ever had. And the color turned out beautifully. Make an appointment with Mark.....you won't regret it.
5,"Been here twice now and both times I've been super satisfied! I have very thick eyebrows and every time I go to get them threaded I have to repeat myself ""keep them thick!"" otherwise I end up walking out with tiny, thin brows! The last gal I had was pregnant (forgot her name) but she was great! Nice and fast as well!"
5,Great place to watch football! You have to try the Mug!! The Bloody Mary is awesome!! Great service!!
5,"Once again hair master Mark did up my locks and baby he rocks! He knows just how to cut this girls curls... How I love this mans work, never does he upset. Thank you Mark for the lovely cut and style for my Thanksgiving Day."
5,Quick and friendly service. Popped in on a Saturday about 30 minutes before close and was able to get a quick threading done. Perfect eyebrows as always.
5,"Fast, friendly service done the same day I called for a quote. The film is high quality with a lifetime warranty, and they were fast with installation. All the film was cut by a computer, so there are no wavy lines or weird placements like other shops. 

I have used other tint shops in the past, but the price and service at Auto Tint Express cannot be beat. I will definitely be back the next time I need it."
5,"Love this place, Idolize is fantastic!!! My first Idolize experience was at the Whitehall, south Charlotte location about 2 years ago. For over 12 years I had always waxed my brows; I was a bit weary of threading, but went ahead and tried it. Ever since that day I have been sold, I will never put wax on my face again!!! It all started with Ila (E-la), she welcomed me at the door. She was pleasant, genuine, and made me feel comfortable, plus there was barely a wait time. After my brows were complete, I was amazed by my results, plus they last longer than wax! I have consistently been back to visit her. Since recently moving to the Huntersville area from south Charlotte, I specifically travel to Dilworth one Wednesday a month (that is the only day Ila is at the Dilworth location, she is at Whitehall Mondays, Tuesdays,  Thursdays, and Fridays) to visit her. I WILL NOT go any where else to get threaded in Charlotte!! IDOLIZE is he best! They are competitively priced, sanitary, and professional! If they weren't in Dilworth I would still make the trek to Whitehall!!"
5,"This place is magnificent, I was calling many stores to get a quote on my vehicle which is a 2010 Dodge Charger. Thats when I came across Auto Tint Express the guy over the phone had explain me very well. After we went over films I had to make an appointment by the way they had serve me on the phone I didnt feel preasure at all.



Once I came to there shop they made me feel very welcome which is fantactic. They give me a tour of there shop just to show me they are a great true team and they are commitment to their work. The team of Auto Tint Express even show me their computer cut laser technology machine, which I wont have to worry about anybody putting a knive on my windows. After all that I had a seat on there waiting room, very nice comfortable couches by the way. The employee over the counter was being a gentleman he was checking up on me every 25 min if I was ok or if I needed anything. At that moment I knew for a fact Auto Tint Express knows how to treat there customers.


An hour has pass by and my vehicle was finish and ready to go. My vehicle looks amazing, it looks so amazing it looks like if I have a new vehicle. I will say this was a fantastic first experience here in the shop. I highly recommend everyone who needs their vehicle tinted these guys are dedicated to there work and have wonderful customer service, you won't be disappointed thank you Auto Tint Express I'll definitely be back!!"
5,"This place hasn't been open for long, but has already become one of my favorites. My husband and I have been there 3 times so far and I've thoroughly enjoyed all three meals. Twice I've had the Sashimi Deluxe. I received rather large pieces of sashimi that were delicious. It also came with six California rolls, which were the best California rolls I think I have ever had. We were there when they had a night of free samples and  I tried their Chicago roll. Very good. My husband, who is an adamant sushi hater, even liked it! One time I was there I ordered their Scallops Teriyaki. I tried it because someone in a neighboring table had ordered it the previous time we were there and the smell was out of this world! The smell of it was so good that I had to go back to try it the following week and am very happy to report that the taste definitely lived up to the smell. All of our meals came with a small salad and soup, which were really good. I don't normally like soups, but I thoroughly enjoyed theirs. My husband's meals have been pretty good as well, although a bit on the small side. However, what it lacks in quantity for some of their menu items they make up in quality.

The only issue I have is that the service can be slow at times. However, the food has been so good that it's worth the little bit extra time we spent waiting for things. 

The only thing I dislike about this restaurant is having to leave and wait to come back again. However, I will be back, again and again...Soon! :)"
5,"Kenny did an amazing job on my gel manicure. He's from Southern California, so am I. There's no where in the world that compares to So Cal nail shops. Kenny is bringing his skills to Madison. After he started I asked him where he was from. When he told me I was like, oh ok, no wonder you're so good! Perfect nails, took his time to make sure they were done perfectly. Took my Pinterest picture and replicated it. I'll definitely make this my regular nail spot."
5,"My fiancé took me here for the first time and I loved it!!! The food is great, prices are reasonable, the staff is prompt, and the food comes out quickly! I don't live in Toronto or Canada for that matter but every time I come to visit, Congee Queen is on my list of places to eat!"
5,"I was interested in trying this place out so I was excited when we scheduled a team lunch there. 

We were there on a Wednesday for lunch and the restaurant was almost completely empty. It's fast casual, so you order at the counter, take a number, find a seat, and wait for your food to be brought out to you. Our food was ready pretty quickly.

I got the Fresco Bowl. I loved it. The chicken was really juicy and flavorful and all of the flavors in the bowl blended well together.  My only complaint is that it was pretty small and I was still hungry after finishing it. I also got over of their house made lemonades which I thought was just ok. 

Mine didn't come with a side, but my coworker thought his quinoa with vegetables was too garlicky, so he let me try it. I completely agreed. I love garlic, but I couldn't eat it because it had so much garlic in it that you couldn't taste anything else. They were really nice when my manager complained about it and let him replace it with the street corn casserole. I tried some of that and it was delicious. 

I would absolutely recommend trying this place if you haven't already! I'll definitely be back again."
5,"This was my second trip to Sumo. Loved it both times. The hibachi food is fantastic. Both times we had ""Antonio Bandares"" as our chef and he puts on a great show. Very attentive to the kids - really engaged them to have fun. Highly recommend."
5,This place is awesome! I personally love their fruit smoothies :) the thing that keeps me coming back has to be the friendliness off the staff and definitely the freshness of the drinks! 5 stars for sure!! If you get a chance give them a try.
5,"Ive been here multiple times. Service is better than Congee Wong for sure, servings are larger and prices are slightly higher. I like the ambience here, its updated with modern furnishings and ive never had to wait for seating which is a plus. Lots of waiters that serve on you, accommodating and actually thank you at the end. I find some asian restaurants forget to say thank you and just ignore you after you pay the bill. Dont try the mango pudding tho that sucks!"
5,"Alan our sales guy was so nice.  No pressure sales, the guy just treated us like family. He price matched to all online prices, Lowe's etc. Thank you so much Spencer's! We love our new fridge."
5,"This place rocks!! Beer, food and service (April was awesome!) all top notch. Probably more poppin' in the evening, but a nice place to stop by for a quick lunch. Love music Thurs, Fri and Sat?!"
5,"I highly recommend OnQ. Austin Barnes is our property manager and he does an excellent job. He is quick to respond and extremely helpful. This is the first time we have rented out a home and thus it has been a learning process for us. Austin has been great at explaining processes along the way so that we not only feel more comfortable with the process but learn for the future. He is professional and courteous and gives great thought and effort into making sure things are done in the most effective manner possible. He has gone above and beyond to help us out when a last minute situation came up and made sure everything was taken care of. 

The leasing office for OnQ is also very helpful. Cameron Brown worked with us and was very responsive and kept us updated on the process. 

We have gone into the office a few times and each time the front desk staff has been very friendly and helpful. Even on a quick drop in both Austin and Cameron took the time to talk to us and help us with the issue at hand. 

I highly recommend using OnQ."
5,"Went there today for the 1st time with my boyfriend. Glad we checked it out. Food tasted great, good service, cool decor, and awesome pricing. We definitely plan on going back! I hope the business sticks around for a long time!"
5,"Absolutely love Lotus Nail bar. I've been going here for months and getting regular acrylic/gel nails and pedicures. 

Danny is my man! He does a fabulous job on my nails and is a wonderful person. I love that I can come in and chat the whole time I'm getting my nails done and not just sit in silence. I've had Mai do my nails too - and she is just as sweet and great at nails as Danny. Dong does wonderful pedicures and is so entertaining. 

Prices are reasonable and they use great product. I've had my gel crack once and I came back in and they fixed it for free. Very nice of them. I will always be coming back!"
5,Absolutely incredible. The chicken is so flavorful and the staff is so friendly. Everything is so well run especially for it being so new. I totally recommend the stuffed avocado with chicken. It's not something you can get most places and it's heavenly. They also have incredible chorizo which is pretty hard to find. Make sure to top your dinner off with the tres leches. It's the best cake I've ever had hands down. Can't wait to see this business grow!!
5,"I'm a hard to please guy..look at my prior reviews, you'll see, and I love this place.  So much more than the typical Phoenix Mexican fare of everything bland, slathered in refried beans and cheap greasy cheese...the food here has flavor and reasonable prices.  The salsas are typical cheap bottled, mass produced tasting, and sadly no pico available at the salsa bar, but I rarely find myself wishing for it here anyways.  I keep coming back for more though :)"
5,"It is a pleasant experience at Shine salon from the moment I make the appt on the phone, to being greeted by the front staff, to hair cut and done.  Everyone is extremely friendly, professional, and smiling. I get my hair cut and styled by AJ who is talented and personable! I plan to be a regular with AJ for all of the above reasons. Thank you Shine salon!"
5,"Great place for Mexican food next to Home Depot for those double dip days. They actually carry al pastor which is pork marinated in like a pineapple sweet sauce. Large choice of different items to try! Great family style restaurant , owners are always working with a smile."
5,"I love this salon.  I have started to see Shane, she is fabulous, after a friend went to her and received a wonderful cut & color.  After paying $300 for cut & color at other Charlotte salons, it is so refreshing to get a fabulous cut & color at a lower rate with receiving a great service."
5,"Description of work:
I have a rental property in Surprise, we had just put it on the market for four months and were unsuccessful at selling it. Unfortunately, our realtor did a horrible job marketing and pricing it, but it is what it is. So we had been paying two mortgages for those four months while trying to sell it. We have had very bad experiences with our previous property management companies (most recently Renter's Warehouse...don't ever, ever, ever list your property with them!!). So we were hesitant to dive back into the rental market again, but really had no choice. We used Angie's List and found On Q with solid reviews, so we gave them a call.

ON Q Staff:
The first person that I spoke with was Eric Dixon. Eric did a good job of listening to my concerns and understanding our need to get this property rented ASAP. I told him about all of the bad experiences we had with Renter's Warehouse and he explained exactly how they provided their services. I was encouraged to find that they provide you with an actual name of someone to contact about your property once it is rented (not just a phone number that may or may not have someone working it that day). I liked what I heard and we decided to start the paperwork. Eric got out to our property very quickly to assess its rent readiness. He sent me a list of things that he thought needed attention, then gave me the names of the other people that would be contacting me about photographing it, marketing it, and picking up the keys. I liked how professional and experienced Eric was on the phone, and everything he said actually happened. I know that doesn't sound like much, but after our ordeal with Renter's Warehouse, finding a company that actually does what they say they are going to do was extremely comforting. 

After the property was photographed, I pointed out some concerns with just a couple of the photos to Michele Tyler. Instead of giving me some sort of canned speech about how they looked perfect to her to try and avoid work, Michele acknowledged my concern and sent the photographer back out to the property to re-shoot those areas. Wow, true customer service....listening to my problem and addressing it without any self-serving justifications, that was extremely nice as well. The team at On Q did such a great job marketing my home, that I literally have a quality tenant (great credit scores and income statements) in my home less than three weeks from the time I first made a phone call to them. Not only did it happen quickly, but I received the rent that I was asking for and made no major changes to the property. We could not have asked for a better experience thus far. 

Another really nice touch was that instead of having to drive out and deliver keys somewhere, Jordan Unga called us and told us that he would be in our neighborhood and would just swing by and pick them up from us, saving us a trip. Again, this company has handled us EXTREMELY well thus far. Very professional and customer driven. I am very happy with my decision to utilize On Q to manage my property and would highly recommend them to anyone else looking for property management."
5,"Came here for the first time today. I ordered the Veggie Dun Dun Box. It was so delicious!  Perfect amount of spice, not too overpowering. I would suggest to anyone to at least try it! It was made to order and came out in about 5 minutes during the lunch rush!  I will definitely be coming back!!!"
5,"Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Lotus Nails Bar & Spa. The entire staff was super friendly and go above and beyond to make sure you're comfortable & happy with your service. I went in for a way overdue pedicure and chose their Milk & Honey Organic Pedicure.......heaven!  You can't help but feel relaxed, sitting in the large massage chair, sipping a glass of wine and looking around the beautifully decorated salon.  I loved every part of my service, especially the stone massage. They also have a great selection of polishes to choose from and mine turned out perfect! My feet haven't felt, or looked, this good in a long time! I will be back!"
5,I visited Lotus before Christmas and received a gel manicure.  Best one I've ever had.  Would highly recommend.  Staff are all so friendly.
5,Best nail place I have ever been to! Super thorough and wonderful people!!! Love them!
5,"I love the look and feel of this place. They use a plastic liner over the pedi tub each time so you know it's sterile. Wine was served with my pedi!!

They have many pedi options but the basic is $32 and includes a paraffin wax, leg massage, along with the cuticle,nail, and paint job.

If you have callus that you want removed it's an extra $5.

The technician was friendly and did a great job. I will keep coming back!!"
5,"Highly recommend this place for quick, quality food with great presentation.  Not served in Togo containers lol."
5,"This is by far the best salon I have been to in Charlotte! If you are looking for a salon that offers a relaxing and fun atmosphere, Shine is the place for you! All of the staff members are very welcoming and accommodating. Sarah did a wonderful job with my cut and an even better job with my color! If you are also looking to have your makeup done as well, your coming to the right place. Travis does an excellent job at making you look natural but glamorous. I will most definitely be coming back and sharing with all of my friends and family!"
5,"HEATHER SAVED MY HAIR. I have long dark chocolate brown hair, for some reason I decided to perm it and went to an extremely over priced high end salon in South Park where my hair was ruined. I came in completely frizzy with a badly botched color job. Heather did a smoothing treatment and restored my color to a very natural looking dark brown where before when I went to adjust my color it had been died black and looked too harsh/un natural. She was absolutely awesome. I just moved to the area and have tried several highly recommended salons/stylists and found Heather's work to be by far the best. (I am extremely picky and hard to please when it comes to my hair b/c of so many bad experiences) but I couldn't stop smiling when I left and haven't stopped two weeks later! She was wonderful and did such a great job. Thank you, thank you Heather and Shine Salon! I definitely found my permanent salon and stylist in the Charlotte area. Thanks again, Courtney Johnson"
5,"I have passed Bambu many times while traveling to Lee Lee's Market next door. Out of pure curiosity, I ordered a Fruit Addict ché. It contained an abundance of sweet ingredients, many of which I have never tried before: longan, jackfruit, and pandan jelly. At first, I couldn't tell if it was a drink or a dessert eaten from a cup. The fruit are sliced in generous pieces so getting them through a straw isn't an option. Don't forget to grab a spoon when you order one of these! Overall, I absolutely loved my order. I usually feel bloated from drinking dense, creamy boba teas, but this ché didn't do that. It is so much lighter and refreshing. The bursting flavors were out of this world; every time I am reminded me of ché, I crave it. Sadly, Chandler is a long drive away and I really wish something like this existed in my hometown. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I am definitely stopping by again."
5,"I've been a client of Sandi for about 4 years. She's AMAZING. We've done blonde, red, purple, pink and a million in between and I always come out happy. I know a couple people have commented on their wait time at the salon, but honestly it doesn't bother me. I know when I'm there, she's going to get it right and make me happy with the cut and color. Sometimes timing isn't an exact science. I'd recommend her to anyone and I do! She's cut my husbands hair as well and it looked great! Love her. Recommend 100%."
5,My first visit to Lotus was AWESOME! The atmosphere and staff was very inviting. They pride themselves on their hygiene and I have to say that it is the first salon I have been too that implements such measures. I was very impressed and will return again.
5,"We love, love the Las Vegas Hampton Airport Suites. We have ALWAYS had great luck with services from the personell and even the rooms are very nice. The food in the morning is great. If you're expecting 5 star, 4 different kinds of food, go to the strip..we LOVE the shuttle, which is Always on time and such a pleasure to ride. My favorite driver is Jacquie. (she's 8 feet tall) lol.She knows me by name and makes me feel very important hahah."
5,"First of all, the second you walk in the servers all greet you and say ""welcome to honeygrow!"" They're inspired by fresh, local ingredients so it adds to the neighborly feel. I loved the walnut st noodle salad, the dressing had a light flavor (which I prefer, but for those who like heavier salad dressings maybe sub it out.) The build your own stir fry was delicious with the sweet soy sauce! We also got a honeybar, which is basically a fruit parfait without the yogurt. That one was a little pricey for what it is, but it's because of the local honey and homemade whipped cream. It was a yummy and healthy sweet treat. There's street parking outside, but I parked in the target parking lot a block away. I will definitely be back again!"
5,Good spacious rooms at a reasonable price I would come here again they had a nice pool and jacuzzi.
5,This place is awesome! We come here every time we are in Vegas. The service is unparalleled and the food and drinks are yummy! The brunch tends to be our favorite.
5,"We bought front load washer and dryer from this store, and had wonderful service.  The salesman, Kevin Rymer, was very helpful with helping us decide which model was best for us, he even gave us hints on how to use them most effectively.   We have been very pleased with our appliances, and have shopped at Spencer's for years; we'd never go anywhere else!"
5,"I am honestly very satisfied with Ricardo's. They have a fantastic selection of burros that have great chewy tortilla texture and a good selection of tacos too. Their tacos are $1.50 on Tuesdays and burros are affordable at around $7-$8 each and the portions are big! It's kind of take out style where you pay at the front and if you want to eat in you can. They have 4 salsa options and grilled veggies at the  bar in the back. I think it's a great value for what you get. The taste of the food is delicious, the tropical burrito I got was fresh and had no fishy smell and the fish taco was crispy and tender at the center. The flavor and quality of the salsa is fantastic. I really enjoyed the food here. I was charged a little more than the menu price for my food which might mean that they need to update their menus but otherwise I feel confident in recommending the food since it is tasty and well worth it. It's not really a place for fancy service or whatnot and I believe consistency would serve them well, based on some negative reviews. Either way, enjoy it for what it is."
5,I got the Dip powder manicure ... my photo says it all! Perfect job. They soaked off my old gel polish and kept my nails long with minimal damage. My nails still feel strong. The dip powder lasts longer than the gel.
5,I love that place. My fav place when summer comming. I love #6. Fruit so fresh. This place is quite. Service fast and nice.
5,"Nachos were bomb, had a shrimp and steak taco was very good! Burger was big and very well priced and most importantly beer was cold!"
5,"I contacted On Q to ask about their property management services and spoke to Matt.  He was very thorough in his explanation of all the services they provide and was understanding and sympathetic to my particular situation.  He was also very good with his immediate follow-up email and his follow-up phone calls to make sure all of my questions had been answered.  I appreciated his knowledge, efficiency and concern."
5,"This hotel is great! It is a bit loud as far as the planes landing but the cleanliness and amenities make it worth it. If I have another flight cancel, I will definitely return. Friendly staff :)."
5,"Had a microwave installed. The tech was prompt, courteous,  and efficient. He was careful with moving and replacing all of my little knickknacks!  Will use again."
5,"Cozy, quiet and uncrowded at 6 on a Saturday, we got the food pretty quickly and I couldn't be happier. 

The Red Curry stir fry was delicious and vegan friendly as well. Was filling enough to be a solid dinner and clocks in at only 430 calories.

Looking forward to stopping here more often"
5,This is a fun place to hang out with friends and enjoy a great happy hour. We always enjoy the atmosphere and the food is delicious Pub Faire. They have terrific Moscow mules and the service is always prompt and professional. I personally love the fish and chips and their signature lobster roll sandwich.
5,"Excellent restaurant but expensive. One look at the neighborhood and you'll see why. Free valet parking on busy nights but there is a lot you can use free.  Good garlic bread, olives are great.  Soups are good and affordable, but many appetizers are getting too high ... such as $36 for Caesar Salad for two.  Peppercorn stead is wonderful $59.  Chateaubriand for 2 is $109.  Friendly staff.  Open for lunch too, but not as busy as it is at night - reserve ahead."
5,"Great decor, delicious Cantonese food, good prices.  MAKE A RESERVATION!  Good parking, walkable from Finch station.

This place is BRAND SPANKING NEW and my parents kindly treated our family out to dinner here to celebrate my BRAND SPANKING NEW marriage!  What a great choice!  The food was spot on & delicious.

They were swamped and we still got our food in a prompt manner, they refilled our tea quickly, and they managed my mom's prima donna 'tude pretty well (she's a diva!).  

We ordered a dozen dishes, here are the ones I remember:
- ho fun (delicious)
- shrimp wonton noodle soup (all shrimp & noodles were cooked perfectly, A+ in my books)
- sautéed lobster (good flavor, not the easiest to eat)
- pineapple fried rice (my mom didn't like this, others were content)
- gulu chicken (didn't try, people said good things)
- fried fish (great flavor & super-crispy, non-greasy breading)
- beef w/ gai lan (the gai lan tasted amazing, others said beef was good)
- dou miao (delicious & tender)"
5,My mom and I went for a pedicure and enjoyed the relaxing chair and atmosphere. We waited out drying our toes and when my mom put her shoes on she totally smudged her big toes. They immediately swooped in a fixed them up. Great service!
5,Aggie and April really make this place special! The food is amazing but the service really shines!
5,"After our Samsung refrigerator died a slow and very painful death we knew we needed a replacement, stat.  I did some online research for models we were interested in and noticed Spencer's came up as a lower priced option to the big home improvement store down the street. The showroom has a great selection from pretty basic models up to high end appliances, and the salesman we worked with helped us pick out a new fridge (and microwave!) that we love.  The delivery and installation went well too.  The guys were super meticulous bringing the new appliances into the house, carefully removing our front door, and making sure they didn't damage anything as they wheeled them into the kitchen.  They even adjusted the French doors on the fridge to make sure they were perfectly level without me having to ask them to, which made my little heart happy. They answered any questions we had, and when they left, they took all the packaging and trash with them, and I noticed afterward they'd even carefully replaced the wreath I had hanging on my door.  Super impressed with the whole process!  We'll be shopping with Spencer's for appliances from now on!"
5,"One of the worst people to deal with.  I have sent emails for the past month concerning problems in our rental!  

Roaches that need an exterminator
Door lock that is broken 
AC that keeps running and froze up last year. 

There is no communication. I guess Our Landlord is not willing to fix anything!  


My agent is the best but his hands are tied. I totally understand."
5,"This place is awesome.   Great atmosphere, great beer selection and an awesome bartender named April."
5,"My husband and I were in about a month ago to have pedicures and a manicure for him.  A few of our friends highly recommended this nail salon for pedicures, so our expectations were extremely high.  We have been to many other nail salons, and have been really disappointed in the past!  I made our appointments about a week in advance and we were taken care of immediately by friendly staff when we arrived.   Communication was great.  They happily answered all of our questions.  We noticed immediately that everything was very sanitary, even lining the pedi bowls with plastic for each new client.  Our needs and wants were met with smiles by courteous and understanding nail techs.  We recommend Vincent and Kathy as they did a wonderful job!    They were both very careful, and gentle!  The menu of pedicure types is vast, and we look forward to trying them all.  We drove almost an hour to get there, and think it was well worth the drive.  We both had a very relaxing experience and look forward to the next time.  We highly recommend this salon.  Thank you."
5,"Yummy coconut smoothie, nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Came all the way from Albuquerque, NM and it was worth it!"
5,"I live in Vegas - but sometimes I want to enjoy a little ""Staycation"". On a spur of the moment decision, I booked a stay here for the weekend. I'm glad I made that decision!

The staff, as I walked in were friendly & easy to chat with. I did arrive early, so they let me check in early!

The room was a surprise, it's like a mini studio apartment, I could absolutely love here!

Clean, spacious an echoed relaxation.

I went out to eat then came back to enjoy the swimming pool. There were kids and families hanging out - no prob for me being from a large family myself, the weather was 90 degrees that day, who wouldn't want to spend it in the warm, but cooling, water!

What I also liked about this location is that it's central to many things I would imagine a traveller may need access to...for instance:

Main bus lines to the strip, airport is right next door for easy flight access, several diverse restaurants in the very near vicinity (e.g. Hawaiian, pizza, Mexican, deli's, Japanese, American etc...also, many of them deliver right to your room!). 

There are also nearby stores to shop at or get supplies (Walmart, 7-11, 99 cents store, Albertsons, Radio Shack, etc...)

Another amazing thing is, this hotel is directly across from Sunset Park, kids can play here, there's sandy volleyball courts, basketball courts, football & baseball fields, duck pond, you can jog, walk, ride a bike, it's a very large park spanning three of four blocks!

If you're in town for business, if you want to be near to the strip, but not stay on the strip, or if you're local and want to staycation for an affordable cost, I would keep this place in mind! :)

Last note: I booked this place on Orbitz.com - I received Orb awards booking at this hotel :)
Lastly, ATT is the wireless provider which is awesome if you use them already!"
5,"I love Idolize, but let me warn you that I can speak to a very limited experience that I've had there. I do consider myself a regular. I go at least once every 6 or so weeks to get my eyebrows threaded. They offer a $9 threading special on Mondays and Tuesday for walk-ins. This is a great deal. I don't love threading, but I like it more than paying $20 + tip to get my brows waxed. Threading is a little more painful, but it's a lot quicker than waxing.

This past Monday, I ran into Idolize on East Blvd. and was greeted by no line... SCORE. The threading specialist welcomed me and put me right in the chair instantly. She was very friendly. I enjoyed chatting with her. I asked her to keep my brows on the thicker side, and she did exactly what I asked. When it was all done, she had me verify my satisfaction with the results and then she gave me soothing witch hazel. I paid and was in and out in a total of maybe 6 minutes. It was THAT fast.

I have always had a pleasant experience at Idolize and look forward to continuing my brow threading there. I have friends who have used other services - brow tinting, waxing - and have been completely satisfied. Perhaps I will venture out and try another service they offer."
5,"Stayed in the 2 BR condo. Great experience. Sure its a little older, but very clean. Bathrooms are modern and roomy. Our rate was $218 (again, two king beds, 2 full bath, and a living area with a pullout and full kitchen) so I'm giving this 5 stars. You absolutely cant beat the value. Nice pools, but small. So dont think you can dump the kids there all day. We used it as a homebase away from the strip. 2 couples and 4 kids under 3. Had a blast. Will stay here again. The TV in the living room is not HD... its an old CRT. But hey, you're in vegas so get off your butt!"
5,Love love love this place. Easy on and out. Everyone is so nice and they make all so a great job on my eyebrows. I'm a repeat customer and absolutely love Idolize!
5,Micheladas are bawmmmmmmmm! House chips and dip and fried pickles are good too! The restaurant is nice and has a comfortable atmosphere.
5,"Quick, reliable, and very knowledgeable. Jose and lucil were awesome I recommend this play to everyone!!"
5,"Best vegan burger ever!!! I have already tried a lot of vegan burgers but nothing compares to this one, it tastes like the real one, the patty, the cheddar, everything is perfect! I am addicted!! The service here is also very good!"
5,"My first experience with OnQ Property was with Kim McGill.  She is by far one of the best agents I have ever worked with.  She was always prompt in helping me whether it was day or night and even on weekends.  Her professionalism was above and beyond and OnQ is lucky to have her.

Michelle"
5,"I had my first ever spa facial done here. Overall, it was so relaxing and even informative - I learned a lot about my skin. They first have you go into a room to relax - soft music is playing, the room is dark, and they cover you in a blanket. During the hour, they massaged a handful of oils into my skin and provided a steamer to open up my pores. From there, the esthetician examined my skin, and removed a handful of milias from my nose and cheek. She ended the hour with a arm massage while I lay there with a facial. 

My skin is still glowing 2 days after the treatment. 

I would so recommend this to anyone! Will be going back."
5,Go see Marieja (so sorry if I spelled that wrong)! She is fantastic. My mom & I both visited her for spur-of-the-moment eyebrow waxes and tints and our eyebrows have seriously never looked better. She is totally professional and really knows what she's doing. So happy I found her. I highly recommend her and I'm very picky about who does my eyebrows.
5,"I am addicted to this place. I usually go there for their lunch all you can eat - and I am never disappointed with the taste. Their Makis and rolls come with a (rare to find in all you can eat) balance between the rice and other ingredients. Its true they dont have sashimi items on the list, but for that price, I guess they cant!
Im surprised people say they dont have ice cream/desserts with the AYCE - as they do have, its just not on the menu, U have to ask for it."
5,Their food is super delicious! I live around in the neighborhood & cant get over this hidden gem. They have a very broad menu with lots of selections & all the food has been delicious. Their cracked corn is so good!!! Very enjoyable!!
5,"I contacted the business through Yelp for a quote. Jose responded back with a price that I thought was very fair, so I called & set up a same day appointment.

Lucio greeted me, had me fill out paperwork, and thoroughly explained all of my options for tint. We also conducted an inspection of the vehicle before it was taken back to have the tint installed. During the installation, he noticed a scratch on my door handle & notified me as well which I appreciated.

I waited approximately 1.5 hours (very fast work) in the nice, clean, comfortable waiting area with a TV and soda/water available. When the installation was complete, Lucio went over after care with me, let me know about the warranty & inspected the car to see if I had any questions.

I was very pleased with the quality of work & the customer service at this business. I will definitely recommend to others."
5,Great craft and draft  beer selections and pub food!  I tried the crab fritters and they were very good. Bar tender Aggie was super nice and great suggestions as well.
5,I have worked with several property management companies and even tried it myself for a bit.  OnQ is by far the best company I have ever worked with.  They are extremely proactive is solving problems and keep you involved every step of the way.  The accounting system is clear and easy to understand and the repair approval process is very efficient.  I highly recommend to other owners looking for property management.
5,"Wow!! Dwayne at Spencer's has INCREDIBLE customer service skills. We purchased a refrigerator three years ago and recently it started to leak. I called Spencer's and spoke to Dwayne. I told him the situation and asked him to check for a warranty. He apologized for the leak and said we didn't purchase a warranty but he wanted to be sure we had the LG service phone number. Toward the end of the call he asked me if I had a copy of my receipt. I said I do and will look for it. He asked for my email address and sent a copy of my receipt on the spot. I found that to be so helpful because it had dates, model, and serial number info. He apologized again in the email. There was no need but it was refreshing to be handled with care. We will absolutely purchase again from Spencer's and will ask for Dwayne. Thank you Dwayne for your kindness."
5,"This was such a cool find! We were just driving by and decided to stop by because we saw the sign that said 'food nirvana.'   We made the joke that they are sure setting high expectations.  Well, they were great! The food was fantastic.  It was extremely flavorful and their jimichurri bowl was absolutely fabulous.   The customer service was great as well.  Everyone was very welcoming, friendly, and quick with getting us our food and our drinks.  It's definitely a place you want to check out."
5,This place is amazing. It is a family owned and operated business and you can tell! This is our Sunday brunch spot. Haven't had anything I didn't like. Ricky and Blanca are two of the nicest people. We also use them to cater our family events.
5,"This place has to be my favourite all you can eat sushi place, and  they do a great job with a la carte too.

This location feels nicer than the Queen West location. It isn't so brightly lit, and is quieter- conspicuously absent are the same 10  muzak tracks playing on repeat. They also have a checklist ordering system, so fewer items are forgotten or ""forgotten"". The rolls are also slightly different than the Queen location, with some choices added, some taken away, and others formulated differently. I believe that they use a different teriyaki sauce as well.

To start, there is a huge variety of sushi, sashimi and maki, ranging from the traditional to on-the-spot creations. The Fire House Roll (tuna, tempura shrimp, spicy mayo and mango) is surprisingly delicious. The Cowboy Roll (beef and green onion) is delicious too. The fish is quite fresh, as are the grilled meats, and the seaweed salad is awesome too.

A la carte, you have more choices, and the rolls are more carefully crafted (the AYCE ones can be somewhat rice heavy, although not as much as other locations and restaurants).

Overall, Aji Sai is great food in  a great environment, and an excellent value for your money!http://www.yelp.ca/writeareview/biz/cPzIic1AqH1ApTVVaww5hw?return_url=%2Fuser_details_reviews_self%3Fuserid%3DyGuE8QzNotZCFirfweR1Fg%26rec_pagestart%3D0&review_id=g3WPH7aUTT1cUrx3vw5AuQ#"
5,"Really a step up from other nail salons. New, state of the art chairs, super clean, great ambiance, excellent service and technicians. Top notch."
5,"Our server, Christian, was outstanding. I've traveled all over the world to many fancy restraints and Christian is one of the best servers I've ever had and came with some great local recommendations. The food and ambiance was top notch as well. Great place to just grab a drink or to get a meal. You won't be disappointed."
5,"Made advance appointment for 3 at 7:00. 7:27 and I'm still sitting here without accommodations. Not happy. 

Update- I gave this another chance and since my first visit have had excellent service and excellent results.  So glad I have it another try!"
5,"Just an amazing process over here at Jimmy Hula's. The air is just a little bit smoother, and the beer is just a little bit better. I'll be parked here 8 days a week"
5,"First, I read the previous reviews for this place and I am very shocked the ladies did not have a great experience with their eyebrows. I went there a few days ago with a Groupon to get my eyebrows done and the Indian girl was very good and she gave me a great shape.  While I was there, I made an appointment for my facial, which was today.  I was recommended to this place by another Idolize lady from the Whitehall business.  I am glad she did because Jane was amazing!!! She greeted me professionally and with a nice smile.  I went back with her and she asked me about my daily facial regiment and then we proceeded with the 25 min facial. It was the best and an added foot massage was the icing on the top.  The room I was in was nice and cozy, dim lighting, soft music & you hear no noise from the front reception area. I would recommend anyone looking to get an express facial to check this place out & try Jane."
5,"First of all, I only trust the ladies at idolize with my eyebrows. If you're going to get your brows tinted ask for Marija, she's the queen of eyebrow tinting!

 I prefer this location because even if I have to wait, it usually isn't for long. The girls that thread are quick but accurate, and they always make my brows look flawless. Today I decided to take a leap of faith and try eyebrow tinting despite the fact that I am deathly afraid of being that blonde girl with the unnatural extra dark eyebrows (I'm super fair skinned and my brows are almost transparent). Marija made my brows appear like magic, without looking unnatural. It absolutely made my day!"
5,Great selection of beers and cocktails! The Mug is a must have! It is a awesome place to catch a game or just to relax.
5,"Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this amazing place! I went there on a Saturday around 5ish and right as I got in the parking lot, it was empty. They were open, and I was already skeptical about the place because of how empty it was. I proceeded to walk in and we were seated and welcomed. The restaurant has a cool look to it, plus the music they have playing was awesome. Anyways, they have a wide variety of food to choose from. We chose the Crack'd Corn as an appetizer and it was very tasty! As I had mentioned, there are so many things to choose from it was hard on what I wanted to order, so I ended up ordering a Buffalo Chicken Caesar Taco and a Burnt Reynolds Hamburger. So glad I ordered those two!Both of them have decent prices and give you a great portion! I can't wait to go back again and try the rest of their menu! I wish them much success and hope that their business grows!!!"
5,"Kids eat free 4pm to 11 Wednesday they Sunday. AARP members get 15% off! 
The staff is friendly and food is great!"
5,"UPDATE !!!

My hubby and I stopped in to this cute restaurant again before heading to the LV Knights game against Ottawa. Perfect location and great food on a Friday evening. Love the prices !!! Most places on the strip are priced WELL above the average persons pocketbook. My hubby and i ordered a dozen oysters each. The chef recommended one order from the west coast and one from the east coast. Great suggestion since my hubby and i got to sample a little from both. We headed on to the fried pickles (seriously yum !!) and the fried green beans. Another yum !! Fish and chips for entree was a very large piece of cod that was cooked to perfection. We skipped dessert because that was more than enough food for both of us. Kudos to our excellent waitress ""J"" !! She was both attentive and charismatic and I'd steal her from here if i had a restaurant !!!  

BTW ... i love to review places that are either a 5 Star or a 1 Star in my humble opinion. And you can rest assure my review is legit. 

Great experience all the way around. My hubby and I ordered several items so we could share. Highly recommend the fish and chips. Batter was crispy and the fish was perfectly flaky. The chips were hot and fresh and also crispy. The bangers and mash were so yummy. The flavors in the sausage were exactly how I remembered them tasting in our favorite London Pub. Ordered the sliders and honestly had to take them to go because we had entirely too much food. But they were delicious reheated for a midnight snack. That's what vacations are all about right ??!!"
5,Auto Tint Express was recommended to me. There are so many out there so you never know what you are going to get. Well they are great. Quality of work and customer service is excellent. They know their stuff and guarantee their work and prices are affordable. Thank you Mario and team.
5,"My daughter and I are in town for the weekend.  We had the most delicious stuffed avocados with quinoa and roasted wild rice topped with shredded chicken. The Pumking beer hit the spot for me and my daughter had raspberry lavender tea.  
We had the best dinner! We recommend Coaltrane's to anyone who wants a wonderfully, fantastic dinner. 
We will come back next time we're in town!"
5,"I love this place. To all of the complainers who had one bad experience, I would reconsider. Amazing service. They let you being wine too and they will provide the glasses!"
5,"Outstanding customer service. Our son got sick on our first flight and then our next flight out of Vegas was delayed. We changed our flight to the next day and got a room at this hotel. Very reasonable price. Shuttle is very convenient to and from airport. From the moment we walked in they were extremely accommodating. Our son had thrown up all over a lot of our belongings and they brought us soap, gloves, and a crib promptly once we arrived. After a night of our other son throwing up, they gave us towels to take on the plane and a bag of to go snacks. We were so very appreciative of their kindness and willingness to go above and beyond!"
5,"Great location. Some of the friendliest staff I've met. 

I got ""the mug."" It's a massive 24 ounce Bloody Mary with more snacks than a buffet. There's a grilled cheese, mini Rueben, bacon, and a lobster corn dog. Bomb.com 

For food I got the vegan burger. I know, I'm not a vegan since I inhaled the Mug with all its fixings, but it's a quality bite. 

Next time you're in Aria or Crystals, stop by. Its worth it."
5,My favorite Mexican breakfast food to get before work. Food always delicious! Definitely recommend getting chorizo with a flour tortilla! The beans and rice are just a great side dish to complete the meal.
5,"This place is awesome!! Great chicken, great sides, great beer specials, great staff. I've been coming here for a while now, always getting the perfectly roasted chicken with the delicious salsa roja. This is a wonderful go to that will never steer you wrong. I was, however, recently recommended the wings and they are nothing short of amazing. The maple chipotle glaze is a superb mixture of sweet and spicy, just great wings. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the lady with tattoos is especially helpful and willing to go the extra mile to ensure a positive, delicious dining experience. 10/10 would recommend, and I do."
5,We come here every time we hit Vegas! A giant thank you to The Pub bar staff for always making us feel like it's our birthday! The food is great and the service is the best. If you haven't been - stop in! It will be your home away from home.
5,"The food was delicious. We were seated in 15 minutes on Valentine's Day at breakfast. Our server, Yoyo, was attentive and polite. Denny's always delivers!!!"
5,"Wonderful spot (the patio) and OH SO EXCELLENT food!  Chicken was awesome and the sides... OH MY!  Stuffed avocado - quinoa, wild rice, and an awesome drizzle.  Quinoa and grilled veggies - AMAZING FLAVOR. Street corn casserole - don't ask questions, just order it.

The staff was extremely friendly and it was fast.

If you need quality sustenance, nothing fancy, and worth EVERY DIME... check it out and eat up y'all!!!"
