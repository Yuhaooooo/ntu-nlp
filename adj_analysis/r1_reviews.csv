1,"Absolutely the WORST pool company that I have EVER had to deal with.  The customer service is horrible.  After leaving many messages over the course of a few weeks I was only able to contact them when I called them AGAIN.  I asked to speak with the actual pool tech who initially came to my house.  The RUDE lady on the phone told me that she was more than capable to answer my questions - about a pump that SHE HAS NOT SEEN, and about a conversation I had with the tech THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR.  

I was assigned to them by my home warranty company, and I will be filing a serious complaint with them and the BBB.  I was told to take the cash out option from the warranty company for the part and then they would do the work and I could just pay them directly.  After I received the cash out and called to schedule the appointment I was told that I need to replace the entire pool pump system and that would cost an additional $400 and that there was an electrical problem and that it would cost additional money as well.  

I was then told that the salt cell that I need is no longer on the market, even though I was able to find them on Amazon.  This is the reason that I am STILL trying to discuss my options with the tech who ACTUALLY SAW MY POOL AND THE PUMP.  

If you don't want to be scammed or jacked around with USE ANOTHER POOL COMPANY."
1,"No excuse for lackluster treatment of customers! Being under new management, late night out partying??? What ever the reason customers should always be offered a slice of bread the way I understand it.  Yes there is a tacky reminder at the door re: did you use your punch card."
1,"We walked in at 10:40 and sat at a table right next to the bar. Waiters and waitresses walked past us repeatedly and we finally went up to the bar to get our drinks. At 11:02 I went back up to the bar to inquire about getting food and was told they stopped serving at 11 to which I replied to the bartender that we had been sitting at a table right across from her for 20 minutes. She called out somebody's name and I told her not to worry about it cuz I was so pissed off with her attitude she also mentioned that they are not a 2 a.m. bar, and with her attitude I could see why. The owner or manager came over a few minutes later and offered to buy us a shot for our troubles. At first we said no but then we were like screw it. I doubt I will give this place a second chance as it was obvious the waiters and waitresses did not want to serve us. They did wait on a table directly behind us and quickly got them menus and served them. Just overall crappy service."
1,"I've heard a lot of rave reviews for the Kauai Chicken, so I had to try it for myself. I decided to do a takeout. It was Tuesday around 11:43a and had only 3 people there, two one one table and a single diner. I waited about 5 minutes then my order was ready. I couldn't wait till I got home, thinking about the great chicken I was going to devour. I got home and opened the cover and had 1 quarter piece and 1 thigh. Took a bite of the thigh and almost spit it out. The inside never look fresh and it was really oily. By oily, there was a ton of cooking oil at the bottom of the plate. I took a bite of the quarter piece .. the drumstick to be exact and it tasted the same. The meat fell off the bone, but it didn't taste freshly cooked. It looked like they fried the chicken ahead of time and then refrigerated it until someone ordered it, then put it in the fryer again. The color of the chicken meat wasn't white, it was a greyish color. I know my chicken and that chicken wasn't cooked fresh. That's why my order was given to me in less than 5 minutes! The only thing I enjoyed was the mac salad .. not too much mayo and the mac not overcooked. The rice was perfect and just enough. Only problem was the main dish. I hope these guys not cutting corners since the restaurant should be busy around this time. I hope they shape up before it's too late cause I want to see them succeed because they the only one close to where I live. I normally take the long drive to Ross J's or Island Style. Looks like I make that trek if I want good food."
1,"The WORST wings I've ever eaten!!  I cancelled my main course order because the wings made me ill.  I was still charged for the wings, and the chickencrap manager didn't have the guts to come out and talk!  They did send a lettuce salad ""on the house"" after I was told the wings would be taken off the bill.  Of course, the wings were not taken off thebill, but the server was nice and I didn't want to create a scene.  I paid, but will not go back to Outback in Chandler, Az!!  Oh, by the way, I spent an hour on the Hershey Highway when I got home!  Unless I get at least an acknowlegement from the manager, I will not go back, and will continue the email campaign against this Outback in Chandler, AZ (located next to the Chandler Mall)!!  

If you go, stay away from those poop inducing wings!!"
1,"Went there early morning with few other families. Five minutes after being seated waitress came by and informed us that they cannot serve pancakes since the cabinet they keep pancake mix is locked by manager who is not on shift. We started looking at other options and asked her about few other items and answer was no to french toast and few other items. So it turns out 90% of things we wanted to order were locked by manager. As we decided to leave another waiter (who was saw standing outside texting) came by and told us not to go to ihop since they have long wait times. We called ihop and they did not have any wait time. At IHOP we were treated nicely and fresh pancakes, crepes, hash browns and eggs were served without much wait. I do not think I be coming back to Denny's since we had called ahead the night before informing we would be coming early morning. But instead of quality service we got ""things are locked by manager"" and do not go to IHOP as sales pitch. They need to work on customer service and be more professional."
1,"My wife and I looked forward to eating here for weeks. We decided to get one of our favorites tonight, bbq pork ribs. Let me say... extremely disapointed! Neither one of us would recommend this place."
1,"This is the worst Denny's ever , I mean nobody expects much from Denny's let's be honest , so I call to order no answer 20 rings , call back get put on hold then I say I'll start driving there to pick up the salmon , ok nobody comes back on phone , I walk in no line , nothing awful !!!"
1,"I love steaks...and I thought outback is known for their steaks. I cannot be more wrong. Today I had the worse steak at any restaurant I've ever been to. We came here to celebrate Father's day. I initially ordered prime ribs. Apparently 12pm is too early for serving that. So I picked Rib eye. Oh no it was too early for that too. Fine. I ordered my 3rd favorite - medium filet Mignon and pay extra to have grill asparagus. 

When the food arrived, the filet mignon was as hard as a rock and it was all burn up on the outside. As for the asparagus, it was also completely burn up to the point I couldn't even chew into it. This is the first time the food was so bad I didn't even want them to replace my meal. My appetite was completely ruin at that point. 

Take a look at the photo - it is gross. I will never eat here again. If you plan on bringing your dads here for father's day, please reconsider....

P.S. Upon reviewing other yelpers review, I should have never come here. Yelpers already complained about the food and how it always ran out of prime ribs and rivets.  I hope this place will close down soon and make room for the good one."
1,Waited hour in a half for food! Not busy in here! Waited an additional 23 minutes to get the avacado that was supposed to be on the burger. The servers are not attentive... the manager walked around with out asking to help ...
1,Unfortunately I have to leave one star. This is the worst place I have eaten at. My spoon had food on it then when they brought me a new set the fork had food on it. The bathroom was so bad that I couldn't use it so I held it till I got to a different restaurant.
1,2nd chance and FAILED again! I will never again come to this place!
1,"Giving 1 star is truly being generous.

If you want real BBQ, please try Shane's Rib Shack, Stacy's Smokehouse, Famous Daves, Bobby Qs, hell try my boyfriend's BBQ.

I'm sorry to be so blunt.  I'm thinking the people that frequent this place has never had real BBQ or there aren't that many options in North Scottsdale."

I did call next day to whisper complain but the manager was not interested in reaching out after bad experience. I guess they really don't care about customers. Would not be back or recommend it to anyone. Terrible service."
1,Really bad service. You have to remind the servers AT LEAST 3 times to get what you ordered. & I ordered a taro bubble tea and ended up getting purple ice water with old tapioca half an hour later. We have to wait so long for our rice to come that our meat gets cold. Terrible!!! Will not go here again.
1,"Korean Grill house is located on Yonge between Gerrard and Gould on the East side and is located on the upper level of the building (this is confusing, i have no idea what's on the bottom but I've always been taken upstairs).

I came here a few weeks ago with my coworker and was pretty pleased with the food and the price so I ordered some takeout to have back at the office. The Beef Bibm Bahb was just over $9.50 with tax and was ready when I went to pick it up. My coworker had this dish and shared with me the previous time so I knew it would be good.

A note here, it took forever for them to answer the phone, I was about to hang up. And the guy on the phone who took my order wasn't personable at all. Unfortunately, this is just a small part of the disappointment to come...

Get back to the office and open the container and it looks good, all the rice and kimchee and beef together topped with a fried egg and the hot sauce on the side. Went about mixing in the hot sauce and got down to eating. First thing I found was a short black hair. Since my hair is super long and light brown, its definitely not mine. Unfortunate because it was great up until that point. Did my best to cordon off that side of the dish and continue to eat since I was only a few bites in. That's one star gone right there.

Just when I thought the taste would still prevail, I crunch down on something so hard, I can't bite through it. Have to spit out the mouthful to get a look and it seems to be a piece of ceramic, eerily similar to that of the bowls they typically mix and server the bibm bahb in. 

Big, huge, massive disappointment. The food here that I've had has been quite good and for the price, you really can't beat it. But finding a hair in my food is bad enough to then be followed by finding a piece of ceramic in my food? That's a big huge fail and I'm only hoping I chewed everything well enough that I didn't swallow any ceramic and encounter any issues later on. My tooth still hurts from biting down on it.

Overall, good food, not worth the risk of who knows what being in your food. Fail to the N-th degree, I will NEVER come back here EVER again and I recommend the same to you. Avoid like the plague."
1,"Horrible service. We were seated within about 2 min,  but then took forever after that. We waited 20 min just for our server to come over and get our drinks order. I was trying to order our food while he was taking our drinks order and he put up his finger to stop me and told me he would be back. It took him 15 min to come get our food order, and then 50 min to get our food. The food was really good and he brought our to go boxes and check when we were finished with our food. He took the check but never returned with the change. We paid in cash and waited about 10 min for him to come back and he was no where to be found. We packed up my 2 year old and new born and were walking out the door and I saw our waiter at the bar eating. 

This was our first time going to an outback and will definitely go back for the food but to a different location."
1,"One star is more than these guys deserve.  After my original review I sent a message to Aaron Pools through their ""contact us"" form.  Below is the response I received from them (I removed last names):

Dear Becky,

We have no idea who you are or who you think you are judging our company who has been in business for over 35 years...you are not our customer.

Mr. A. is who we have been ""dealing"" with because HE is our customer and with whom you should perhaps show this letter to...he can contact us to dispute anything contained in this correspondence.

Mr. A. had an appointment for us to replace the grids in the filter at 2939 E. Bonanza Road, Gilbert, AZ.  HE is the one who cancelled the appointment so he could research the grid cost and find them at a lesser cost to him.  He did find grids and advised us he would drop the grids off early the week of May 7th but that he would call us to advise us when he in fact had dropped the grids off.  About the only thing you did agree with our office staff is that he did not drop them off until the afternoon of May 10 and when he called us that day he expected an appointment immediately.  We advised him we could not guarantee somebody out there as our schedule was full but we would try to get somebody there that day or Friday.  He was aware that we were booking at that time for the following week.  If he had dropped the grids off earlier in the week as he had advised us he would we would have been able to get this resolved before the weekend of May 12/13, 2012.  We realize Mr. A. is busy, as are we, but we cannot make him find the time to drop them off as he had expected.

Additionally, your pool is cloudy at worse, not green.  If these filters had been taken care of as set on OUR ORIGINAL TIME FRAME APPOINTMENT before Mr. A. cancelled to look for grids on his own, you would not be having this problem created by the grids not being authorized by Mr. Angelotti for us to handle.  It is understandable that home owners are trying to cut back on expenses but we cannot take the heat for that situation.  You really need to take this up with Mr. A.  If he has told you anything other than as we are stating above, I would challenge that statement!

What they don't know is that our landlord is one of our closest friends and everything he tells me is the truth.  I AM the customer, because I was the one who originally said I wanted Aaron Pools to be our pool service.  They were hired because of me, and they will now be fired because of me.  Their customer service skills are definitely in line with their pool servicing skills.  After our pump was finally working again, the pool cleaner guy came out and I asked him about the chlorine level because I had been testing it and it was reading very high.  He dipped his little test strip in and told me everything looked fine.  After he left I took a sample over to Leslie's and had them test it.  The chlorine was at 15ppm!  Good thing I didn't let my kids go swimming.  Stay away from these guys.  How they have managed to stay in business for over 35 years will remain a mystery."
1,"VARY BAD SERVICE(the manager) AND LITERALLY ASK ME FOR 10% TIPS. like are you serious?? Went there with family tonight. The servants were alright. I went up to the lady manager and asked for some more fish cake and the raddish, she said 'okok' without even lifting her head and continue does her own stuff (talking+laughing with the servant beside her). I literally stood there, holding the 2 side dishes, for a minute straight. She pretty much ignored me in the first place. When I went up to pay my bill, it was $60. Gave $100, she return back a $20, a $10, a $5, a toonie and some loonies. I left $3 on the plate and ready to go, she immediately stopped me and pointing at the receipt saying '60, 60 dollar, 10%, 10% tips'(kept on repeating the word 10 percent) Since when tips option become a law?? I literally told her I'm not satisfied with her service and that has nothing to do with her servants but her. The food were okay but I would not go back to this place because of this lady manager."
1,"If I could give a one-star rating I would, this was the worst Korean Grill House I've been to. First of all, we had to wait for 20 minutes for service despite our constant attempt to order. Second of all, they messed up our order of drinks, and didn't refill after we asked them. Third of all, as we were eating, we were told that the restaurant was closing in 15 mins, and our grill will be turned off at 12AM and we won't be able to cook any of our food which just arrived. Furthermore, when we wanted to finish cooking our food because there's just 5 minutes left, we were pushed to pay our bill. One more thing is, there was a waiter there doesn't speak English. I would never go back to this Korean Grill House."
1,"We have not been to this Denny's in a long time due to the horrible service and understaffed. Tonight was no different, waited over a hour and still no food. We ended up cancelling our order and going elsewhere."
1,"Very disappointing experience at Outback. We use to love going to the Outback but after our experience tonight, never again! The food was awful. Even the house salad tasted like fish. We were never asked how we wanted out meat cooked so I guess the default is very WELL done. I don't know if they changed their recipes when they changed their menus but it was a way overpriced Applebee's. Yuck."
1,"This place is not the same place as it was several years ago.  The place is dirty.  The bathrooms are gross.  The faucets barely turn on.  Ok, here is the weirdest thing - a worker sat down at our table with us to fill the ketchup bottle.  You think I am kidding, but I am not.  We could not believe it."
1,"Keep trying to unsubscribe from their mailing list, though today they sent me 7 SPAM emails.  

Stop it! 

They also have a link to review their spa's on Yelp on the e-mail - though it just goes to the Yelp homepage. 

They obviously don't care much about their customers.  

It was so long ago I was there I can't remember the service."
1,"They do not let you go if you do not pay tip. Like usual korean restaurants, you have to go up to the cash register to pay. If you have left a cash tip on the table and want to pay the bill with a card, they will start asking why you didn't add tip to the machine. And let's be real, the service isn't even that great to be deserving a lot of tip"
1,"We got to your establishment at 6:30pm 11/18/15. The waitress we had really didn't wait us. Never asked how we were doing. Never asked if we needed anything. Someone else brought out our food. I had gotten the chicken parm sliders. There was like no sauce on it. The chicken was dry. Both plates were hot but food was cold. My bf asked for no tomato. You could tell that someone had put it on and took it off because the juices and seeds was on his burger. Couldn't asked for sauce she didn't come back except when she gave us our bill. She was way friendlier to the other tables around us but not to us. Idk. Couldn't tell you her name. She didn't say. We basically sat in the back corner at a round table. I was there bout a month ago and had great food and service thought I would come back because I wanted my bf to experience it but it sucked. What sucked even more he drives an hr to see and then I actually live an hr away from your restaurant. So waste of my money, time, and gas."
1,We are here right now and will never be back. We always come here and usually enjoy everything but not tonight. The bartender would not serve my moms friend who is 30 because she thinks he is messed up. He is actually really shy and always talks different. Before we came here he had one margarita at Azteca across the street. This was really  prejudice because he is not drunk and I ordered a drink and wasn't even ID'ed and I'm only 21. We will never be coming here again. The bartender is rude and there is a reason this place has shitty reviews.
1,Do NOT ever go to the Hickory Tavern on Harris!! I'm so embarrassed for their managers. After having been pushed to order multiple beers (not that I minded this part that much) my server then told me to leave my card on the table and he would just get it (without being given my check). I decided to see what would happen so I did. He brought me back my receipt without my check. I then asks for my itemized check and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. I explained what it was to him then he brought it. Guess what!! It was lower than what he ran my card for?! Seriously!! Don't go there! They let their servers TRY to rip you off!!!
1,"This place has fucking shit service. I walked in and aged 7 years before I was seated....I missed my son's birth and my wedding. By the time I was seated, I learned 3 new languages. The individual who was serving me knew one word, yes. The one star rating is a place holder, it's should be shut down due to NO ONE WORKING HERE. Not to mention 11 people 2 grills oh baby.


overall a good experience 10/10


update:
After cooking for a few minutes, the grill turned black. We asked for it to be changed, he said to wait 10 minutes....after 30 minutes he returned and said ""we out"" and reignited the black grill. He then filled our water with another tables left over water. I am not tipping this half ass service."
1,"the waiter was the worst waiter i have ever had anywhere
and because of him the food was cold
i also ordered a bottle of water that he never brought but as he was bringing the bill said ""oh do you want me to bring you your bottle of water now"" and it was on the bill
I will never go back espically with Marcellos Pizzeria a few doors down"
1,I ordered and paid for a pound of barbeque pork and I just returned home and the container seemed very light.  I weighed the entire container on my scale and it weighed less then 11 ounces!  Unacceptable mistake on the part of the business.
1,"The kitchen closes at apparently 10:00 pm on a Saturday night. It seems to me that the kitchen is always close apparently. When you walk in it's almost a ""help yourself atmosphere"". Save yourself some time and trouble and go to the other hickory tavern on E Arbor Drive."
1,"When the owner of the franchise has the customer service skills of an angry ape, it's no suprise fellow yelpers are down on this place. Purchased food through the drive through a while back and the order was filled incorrectly. So went back to the store, and after dealing with the manager just wanted a refund. He refused to provide a refund because he said we were rude. Ended up leaving food at the counter and walking out the store. Not worth the time, maybe Dickie's corporate will take it back."
1,"*WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED*

Service:
If I could rate in the negatives I would! Trust me it was terrible! First off as soon as you walk in to Outback the hostesses don't even great you at all! I had to introduce my self and tell them I needed a table for three people. 
Then after we order our drinks my fiancé asks for some sugar for his iced tea, never got any at all. When it came down to the food I requested if they could add bacon on my burger, once it came out no bacon (also we requested a few other things and we obviously didn't get them the first time)... So I told the waiter it didn't and explained to him it wasn't here at all and that since I already took a few bite out of my food I didn't want to get the bacon anymore then. I didn't even get to finish my sentence till he stormed off and did other things. I mean really? Come on dude! My fiancé ordered the mushroom sauce steak, once it came out it was a plain steak with no sauce at all! It wasn't even the way he wanted it. The nice manager came around and apologized which was great and offered a free dessert!(didn't get dessert because I wanted to leave so fast) I did explain how rude the server was and that I didn't appreciate him to walk off while I was still talking to him. When the bill came the server charged me for the bacon which I made him correct(I know it's just a dollar but I'm not gonna pay for something I didn't get) also on the bill they didn't even give a small discount for the service at all which most places do! So this is one unhappy customer that will not be coming back to this location for sure and will not be tipping this waiter! 

Food: 
Plain in simple it sucked and was dry! My burger patty was dry I drenched it in ranch and it still barely helped! Yuck!"
1,"Arrived for lunch at 1:05 with about 30 patrons currently seated.  Our waitress was polite, but not prepared to answer my question as to what the soup option was.  And she did not offer to find out, just a reply of ""I do not know"".  After 20 mins I had to ask another waitress for help in finding our order because we could find our waitress. 

One of meals arrived with an incorrect side, which was quickly replaced.  We asked waitress to remember to not charge us for it.  She returned to tell us she did, but that substitutions were not allowed for this meal, but they would allow it this time.  Really!  She could have told us ahead of time?  And her tone was of blaming us.  

We have been here 2 times in past few weeks.  Each time during lunch  and each time order took a long time and came with errors."
1,"We go as a team to this place every Thursday night after softball usually have great service. Last night was totally a cluster. Waitress was very nice and apologetic, I watched the one bartender work as hard as possible to keep up. We had 2 drinks in 2 hours waited on food for an hour (24 Wings). I approached the manager asked if he could give the bartender some help he said "" the kitchen is behind and that is where he was needed"". I then watched him approach bar pull tickets and rudely slam them in front of bartender and say ""Do these"". We also observed him sit and talk to his parents sitting at corner of the bar for 45 minutes (which they had prompt service) and neglect the atmosphere within the place. We usually leave seeing a full restaurant but we all noticed it was slow upon our exit. Policy: care for your staff, your customers and visit your parents on your time off. Lost our teams visit every week."
1,"WARNING: This is NOT korean food. This place should be called China Grill House. Giveaways are that they give deep fried tofu, serve bubble tea, and appetizers like spring rolls or fried prawns. The bbq meats like the chinese style ""bulgogi"" wasn't bad but dont expect good quality meat. Not the most cleanest place. The server would touch raw meat then start touching the cash register and other stuff. Overall very disappointed since I was hoping to get korean food and got fooled by the name..."
1,"This Denny's is always short staffed and very disorganized. The staff is normally nice, but there is zero direction. the food is normally below average and cold by the time we actually get it."
1,Service and quality of food have declined.  This Outback used to be very good.  Now is  a waste of money.
1,"The WORST pool company in the valley.   I'll spare the long awful history and sum it up.  They are liars, deceitful and actually hateful.  They went out of their way to deny a claim to our Home Warranty to replace a filter that split.   Funny part was it spit b/c they installed the plumbing incorrectly and caused the split. They did not want to pay to clean up their mess so they lied to the Home Warranty.  We spent over 2 months fighting this.  My pool is black, and destroyed.   Aaron pools is rude, untrustworthy and basically have no clue what they are doing.  DO NOT PAY THEM $$$$ TO TOUCH YOUR POOL."
1,"Regretfully one of the worst meals I've had to date. Our experience started off on a bad note, from which it never recovered, when the waitress brought us our first round of cocktails.... Two in our party ordered Moscow Mule's, but were served watered down ginger beer/vodka blends sans copper mug,  mint, and ice. The waitress seemed annoyed and let us know that, ""if we ordered another one after this, we can have it in a copper cup"". 
My question is, if the drink sat long enough for all of the ice to melt; what would another 90 seconds to wash the mugs be? The waitress was unapologetic, but did note that we could order something else. I opted for a beer, which came out without issue (in a bottle). 
My next major problem was with my entree. I ordered shrimp and grits, a southern classic, which I have ordered more than a half dozen times at this restaurant in the past. The shrimp came out without being deveined. This is 100% unacceptable at even the most mediocre of greasy-spoon type establishments, much less at a $16 price point at Hickory Tavern. Again, the waitress seemed barely bothered by the snafu, and we did not receive an apology or explanation by management. A gentleman came out after the meal was sent back, asking for an explanation. I showed him the picture and explained the shrimp was not deveined, which seemed to baffle him. I'm not sure if he was in disbelief or was not sure what I meant by ""the shrimp was not deveined"". Either way, he did not respond to my negative experience in any way other than making a face and walking away... 

In short, please don't waste your time or hard earned money at this has-been chain that no longer emphasizes customer service or palatable food. This particular chain has gone downhill over the past year. I have never had an issue at another Hickory Tavern in the Charlotte metro area."
1,"Worst dining experience ever. We came here for my birthday and both my mother and got a cold meal, twice! When we asked to see the manager the first time he didn't show up for about 20 minutes and when he finally showed up it was obvious he didn't care. After that our waiter avoided us for the rest of the night and we didn't get anymore service at all, except when the bill was dropped off. I used to love this place but now I don't think I'll ever be back"
1,"I normally have a good experience at this Denny's the handful of times I've been there; however, I am so upset almost to tears over our breakfast experience this morning. Our server Dillon was apparently very off put by the fact that he'd be serving me and my three kids that he has mind up up from the start. I literally have never felt bullied by a server the way this person made my (perfectly respectful) children and I feel.  I was told ""no, I'm too busy for that"" when I asked him to clear a few empty glasses, as well as MANY other extremely rude comments made under his breath and while walking away. The straw that broke the camels back was when he handed me some napkins (I didn't ask for them but he found time) and said ""you're welcome to leave as soon as you're finished eating"" As a nurse, I understand that serving people can be difficult at times, but this guy needs to find a new line of work...my six year old was even shocked!! By the time I had finally had enough and asked for the manager, Jennifer and fully explained the situation to her she was mortified as well. She told me she would talk to him and ask him to come out and apologize for his rudeness. I waited for Dillons return, which never came and when Jennifer returned I asked her if he was refusing to apologize to me to which she replied that he was. She was going to be reporting his insubordination to the GM, Michael Frohling. I will be following up with him as well, since I am absolutely mortified by his behavior.  Go be a woman hater somewhere else buddy...Denny's ain't your gig! If you go to this Denny's on a Sunday morning beware of Dillon!"
1,"You've missed breakfast, you're busy all morning going from place to place, you're about to miss lunch, as a matter of fact your feeling a bit light headed, and as you're driving down Shea Blvd. you see Dickey's Barbecue Pit.  Ya think, I've gotta stop or I'm going to pass out at the wheel.  Good idea?  Let's see.

Look's ok from the outside.  Walking in I realize the place is appropriately named.  Seems a bit dirty; a table of construction workers sit in one side of the pit while a lone businessman sits on the other.  It's lunchtime right?  I go to the counter where a man and a woman employee are talking.  I wait and wait...I don't want to be rude, I know they see me, I think they understand that I'm a potential customer.  Already I'm getting this feeling that I'm interrupting something, but hey I'm starving, how bad can it be.

REAL BAD!  The meat was cold, the mac cheese was gross, and the fried okra was actually good, explains why the plate was full of it.  I ate the cold meat, and as much okra as I could without feeling stuffed, there was a good serving left on the plate.  I merely touched the mac whatever it was, I later felt sick from that mere touch and now I'm still having nightmares about it.

Without a doubt it was the worst meal I've ever had, and I've had many, many bad ones.  Definite waste of eleven bucks, I don't see me going back anytime soon."
1,"No, I won't be shopping there for a while. They refuse to talk to Consumers Union about offering meat without antibiotics. Me thinks not. I get enough antibiotics from the pharmacy. I thought TJ's was a little better than that. Oh well."
1,"Horrible. This location is the worst. We've been to the South Scottsdale location and it's fantastic. The Shea location had so many problems.  One person to work the front desk, take phone orders and drive thru orders. Condiment trays were empty. No ketchup. Tables greasy. No silverware. Dirty forks. The soft serve ice cream was liquid. The pulled pork was dry. The waffle fries were old. On a Saturday afternoon there was a total of 6 people in the entire place. I'm surprised this location is still open. I'm sure the health inspector would find alot of violations here. We won't be going back."
1,"The sad thing is I actually asked for Aaron's pools from my home warranty service, since they treated me so well a few years ago...
They were unable to accommodate my desire to be at the house, timewise so I reluctantly agreed to have them check my filter while I was at work.. The tech was supposed to call me,  and report what was found... but did not.  The first call I got was from my home warranty company denying the claim.
The claim was denied because there was supposedly algae in my filter, (well gee isn't that what a filter is supposed to do? remove algae and debris from the pool).  Our entire pool water was emptied and replaced about a month ago, the pool was crystal clear and the filter was working beautifully until the night it burst.  
The filter is probably 20 years old, and no longer manufactured, so parts are not made for it.  I spent two hours going to pool companies this afternoon trying to understand, corroborate, or invalidate their statement.  
Each company I walked into, told me that the pool filter ripped apart due to age.  That algae would NOT cause the break in my filter.   
When I called Aaron's pools they would not allow me to talk to the tech, I opened the filter up to look at it and I was told that the grey tinge to the outside of my DE was algae.  When I touched the grey, the outside flaked off and was white inside.   I was told that the fins were crushed, they are not.  
I Truly feel that Aaron pool's just did not want to take the hit on the repair from AHS.  

I have a filter that wear and tear finally got the best of, and under my warranty should have been replaced."
1,Very over priced and crappy customer service not even a smile when I walked in I had never been there before and they acted like I put them out by asking questions. This place gives small business a bad name only reason for the 1 star is Starbucks is next door. And the day old bread racks were empty
1,Worst Denny's EVER and i don't expect much from this place to begin with.  Never ever return or go here.....
1,...
1,"Haters gonna hate, but it was it is.

I called a little after lunch and talked to the manager.  I asked if they would have sound for the game 7 of the NHL.  He said, yes, no problem, as long as someone else hasn't asked for sound of another game first.  So, I tell my buddies to come along.

With that in mind, we get there early.  I ask about sound and the server said, sure, we've just got music playing, shouldn't be a problem.  She takes our first beer order and goes back to talk to the manager.  She comes back with our beers and being a polite person, and the game hadn't started yet, I didn't ask about the sound.  We wait and wait, still no sound in the game.  Our server comes by one more time and we order another round, she said she'd check on the sound.  We get our beers, and never see the server again.  Nor the manager.

I eventually just left cash on the table, no check ever came, no sound, absolutely ridiculous and just plain out rude.  The manager could have at least come by with a BS excuse and pretended we existed.  I could have just as easily watched the game at my house, but friends wanted to go out.  We won't ever be back."
1,"I have been too many Dickys around the country they have a pretty decent barbecue for a chain restaurant, except this one. They over cook things all the time, so they are dry and tasteless and try to cover it up with BBQ sauce, well guys that does not work on anyone with taste buds. This is one of the worst run restaurants I have ever come across. The owner is obnoxious, rude and makes you feel like you are doing him a favor by coming in and spending money at his restaurant. You would think the Owner after reading all of these HORRIBLE reviews would try to do something about it but obviously he is a LAZY business owner and will put himself out of business soon enough. Yes you owner you have a 2 STAR rating out of 5, that is 40% that is an F in any book. This location is dirty and always has lots flies in it. Even worse four of us went there for dinner we all got sick. The following day I called and spoke to the owner or manager and basically they said too bad so I called their corporate office and they said someone from that store or area supervisor would be contacting me and making things right. I have called back 3 times since my initial call, well that was 2/15/13 and now it is 5/11/13 and still no contact back. If the Corporate office at Dickeys cant see this store is killing their ""Brand"" they deserve to go out of business. Wish I could give -1 stars."
1,"I was led to believe I had a reservation for a corporate seminar event booked in their private room.  I called and they told me they had me down.  Then I went in the first time and they assured me it was reserved, we would do a contract as we got closer.  I found this odd, but we had booked the same event the year before and there had been no problem.  Yesterday, I called with some planning questions.  They told me they weren't holding the room and if I wanted it, I had better get in and do a contract ASAP.  So today, in went in to do a contract.  The GM, Tom Blake informed me that they had a weekly group that used the room every week on that day and I needed to find another place.  I am very frustrated as I had already sent invitations with their location on it.  But, I understand people make mistakes sometimes.  The reason it is one star, is because Tom was an unbelievable jerk.  He could not care less or deliver any sort of an apology on the matter.  This man has a nasty attitude problem and lacks the basic people skills that should be required of his job.   I have already rebooked my event at another similar restaurant close by.  But I will not soon forget my horrible experience with this GM and I will never dine at Hickory Tavern again."
1,Horrible. Over priced and not impressed. My wife and I both ordered a fillet. Both were over cooked and tasteless. Portions were very small and  just not worth the time or money. Disappointed.
1,We say for 10 mins while our server was flirting with other servers. Never got to order food. They even just watched us walk out. No one even tried to stop us. Won't be back
1,"Sometimes I use this Outback due to it's proximity to my home for curbside take away. Probably not any longer. Tonight I ordered Salmon, veggies and blue cheese chopped salad. The fish was dry and over cooked, the veggies were undercooked, the lettuce was 20% brown, the dressing was as thick as jello and there wasn't one slice of Lemon to be found. Boo this place! The one on 54th street is so much better!"
1,"My husband and I stopped here for dinner. We couldn't believe how cheap the prices were, well we ordered two rolls, one for each, chicken fried rice for my husband and spicy teriyaki noodles for me. Needless to say YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, the rolls are tasteless, the chicken fried rice should be call peas fried rice, but the worse part of it all was my teriyaki noodles never came. We asked and all we got was ""sorry, it should be coming soon"" 25 minutes after the rice come out we decided to leave. No apologies were given. All we got was ""you don't have to pay for the noodles"" which I thought it was needless to say. I mean they thought they were doing us a favor for not charging us for food we didn't get. Never going back here again. Awful."
1,"I had skipped lunch and opted for the convenience of their Turkey Spinach Swiss Cheese Wrap.  The carb, fat and salt numbers were high, but I rationalized that the spinach would somehow overide that empirical assertion.  Short story-avoid these options and make your own at home, where you can moderate the variables."
1,"I gave them one star only because I could not give ZERO stars! After visiting a few times and having had decent meals I was served the WORST meal of my life! It was so awful neither my companion nor I could eat any of it and had to leave. The manager apologized profusely and gave us gift cards, hoping that we would give them another chance in the future but for now the damage had been done and we ended up going to In-and-Out. Outback shouldn't hold their breath 'till they see us again. Just writing this review brings back the nausea!
:-("
1,Worst customer service I have ever received. This is the first review on yelp I have left that is not 5 stars. I moved into a new house a promptly had an issue with the pool. I did not have a pool company so relied on my home warranty company First American and they send Aarons Pool. It was a disaster from start to finish. They had a no-show for my first scheduled appointment after waiting over a week. The second appointment he entered my backyard without my permission and supposedly replaced a capacitor. The company REFUSED to have someone go back to my house show me the repair! After being unable to resolve my complaints with the technician I called the office. The office refused to send the tech back out to prove to me the work had been done and HUNG UP ON ME. The capacitor did NOT fix my issue IF it was replaced. The warranty company First American sent out another company who diagnosed and replaced the pool pump all under warranty. Aaron's Pool was obviously only interested in making a quick dollar from the warranty company and not gaining a potential lifelong customer.
1,"Wow, has this place gone downhill. From lower quality Beef, to smaller servings, to indifferent management and the list goes on. At one time this was one of my favorite places in North Las Vegas - Now I will spend my gaming dollars elsewhere. Steaks are Choice (at best) not prime. The other items are just not worth having at all. The manager was willing to make zero accommodations on any changes. Skip this entire Casino as it's in transition to a Low End Facility by Boyd Gaming. Be prepared to spend $ 100.00 per patron, a price totally out of line for what they delusionally think they are. The Atmosphere is also in need of a total overhaul - since the Dining Room is neither Classy or updated. Just an Oldie looking tired."
1,Nice store and just slightly overpriced products until you walk to your car and find a $25 PARKING TICKET!!!
1,"Terrible service. Walked in, sat at the bar for maybe 6 mins or more. The dirty glasses was left on the bar it has not been wiped or clean from food being left in the counter. Remind you it is a slow night and the bartender has not approached us or greeted us yet. He walked passed us at 3 times and served someone else that walked in after us. Never seen such a lazy ass bar tender who the hell wants to sit at a unclear bar. We just left. Nothing like he other Hickory Taverns."
1,"Worst Korean bbq I've ever had... Meat is not fresh, and very fatty! All meat/fish is seasoned with so much salt/soy sauce too... Side dishes are not authentic, and they only give you a little bit. Service is slow and grill area is small. Definitely not going back."
1,"This place is such a waste of money. Think Applebee's atmosphere, with food that has no flavor whatsoever. I mean none. It's like they went out of their way to make everything as bland as possible. I got the shrimp tacos.. with no flavor. My girlfriend got the chicken sandwich.. that tasted like it was made before seasoning was invented. You've been warned: over priced, under spiced, and the most forgettable meal of my life."
1,"I used to believe that, just like there was no such thing as a bad day of golf (or fishing), there was no such thing as bad barbecue. Then, I went to Dickey's in Scottsdale. 

I was chased out of my house by a posse of women/children who wanted to watch Smurfs. I wanted to watch the Lions-Saints football game. Stacey's BBQ on Shea no longer has a television. I thought I'd try Dickey's Barbecue Pit. It ticks off my g/f when I eat barbecue. SHE listens to my cardiologist. I ordered half a rack of pork ribs, barbecue beans and iced tea.

Dickey's must have pigs bred just for them. I've never seen pork ribs with so much fat on them. Most barbecue joints will brag about how their spare rib meat  falls off the bone. At Dickey's, the meat on these pork spare ribs hung on the bone like it was super-glued. There was no discernible rub on the ribs. In spite of asking for the barbecue sauce on the side, it was sweet barbecue sauce that was splashed on my ribs. The hot barbecue sauce (next to the soda machine) was tangy.

Most barbecue joints brag about their iced tea. At Dickey's, I was handed a cup and pointed toward a soda machine. Shaved ice and Nestea. No lemons. The only lemonade available was Minute Maid diet. Blecch. 

The barbecue beans? If you like your barbecue beans mushy and bland, this is the place for you. I've had better beans that were poured out of a can. 

In sum, Dickey's is to barbecue what Earl Scheib's is to automobile paint jobs. My meal was everything barbecue was not supposed to be. The best part of my meal (besides leaving) was the yellow plastic cup. No one could get me in these doors again, not for love or money. Stacey's: PLEASE get a new television."
1,"Ok....it's Dennys. My expectations aren't that high. That said, I couldn't believe what they tried to serve this morning. Called in for pick up and after having confirmed my order at least 3 times over the phone, I found that not only had they left 3 things off my order, but also that the pancake puppies were burnt beyond recognition to the point that they even burned through the styrofoam container they were put in. When I called in, I was put on hold for 10 minutes before the manager came on the line, made me re-explain the situation and then told me to come in and get another one or get my money back. No apologies or even a surprised tone...just matter of factly. When I asked if the replacement pancake puppies would be on her (the principle... not that the 1.99 was going to break me) she said she reluctantly agreed to give a coupon for next time. Mmmm... that's ok. Don't think there will be a next time. Up your standards to edible, please, Dennys."
1,This was my first time here...the food is tasteless. I ordered a Cesar salad only to send it back...Kraft has a better salad dressing. Also I was served water that had a oily film on the top. My mom asked for extra garlic for her pasta and that wasn't provided either. Will not be back...worst food I've ever had
1,The menu is all in Chinese and they make you pay for the sides. There is nothing Korean about this place. We walked out before placing an order.
1,"I am not a prolific reviewer, in fact, I rarely do so. However, the SECOND of two bad experiences really motivated me to do so due to the sheer arrogance of nonetheless - the owner! Yes - the owner!!

First Negative Experience: Went on a Sunday with my wife and two children, ordered some calamari apps, so-so, oil was heavy and evidently overdue for changing. Salmon steak for the wife, grilled, potato dumpling pasta (gnocchi) for the kids with and roasted chicken with rapini.  EXPLICITLY stated what was for the kids and the adults, ordered non spicy iterations.

Kids pasta came, was to be plain tomato sauce, was very spicy, kids clamored for their drinks, wife and I tasted, way too spicy for a ""NON"" spicy request. Now the rapini... needless to say, the kids were peeing for quite some time that afternoon! Hot as he_ _!

Lets move  to the Salmon, she was so looking forward to it, nice olive caper tomato salsa. First fork in, not bad! Second fork in toward center RAW!!!! OMG! Throw down that fork! The server was an older gentleman, very customer focused, experienced for sure,  great with kids and adult patrons alike, saw the displeasure, and in fact at first look, without a word saw exactly what the problem was. We're NOT the type to make a scene, would have been content to slink out of there to the KEG across the street, take care of the bill and go. But the server insisted he call the owner over (the shorter haired, shorter stature, Breitling wearing, non justified aire about him one). I was very empathetic (being a business owner myself) and explained the issues with the kids  pasta and veggies for the children were way too spicy for their delicate palates (ours too I might add - we're Italian and EAT SPICY), and the salmon was raw at the center - and was evident as agreed the server. No so say he! We cook it  ""medium"".  My wife and I look at each other in disbelief. Now folks, I EAT MEDIUM, wife does not but I DO, I EAT SUSHI, I am no food critic, but I know what is Medium and know what rare and blue are, this was RAW. Pasta? Well, he said he tried it in the back and it was just fine! Ugh! WHAAAAT? Fine? The kids may have gotten a ""fleck"" of pepper says he. Honestly, we felt like we were on Candid Camera, Twilight zone or something akin to that. Simply aghast at the arrogance. Oooookayyyyy! Fine he took the salmon off the bill, offered dessert for the kids, we refused out of fear of something, not sure what, but something!

Went today, a business meeting for lunch, not sure why, but in the area, what the hey, lets give it another try?

I seee him.... that frown on his face, roving the corridors, there he is, that squint, that, that , that breitling and air! Ok, ok, I stay out of your way, you stay out of mine. I order food, I am happy, I pay. Hey, I am not happy, I pay anyway (not a bad deal eh).  I have a few of my own breitlings! Don't need free food, can buy your place too if you need a hand!

I digress... ok, ok lets try this again, just give me a plain garden salad with dressing on the side and the, dare I say it, Grilled Salmon! Oh my God, I said it!

Lets unfurl the napking containing the cutlery. Awww man?! Food encrusted, baked on, last lady's food on them?! Fffff, are we playing this game again?! Did they see me coming?! I just want lunch, clean, good, I eat, I pay I leave, no events!

Ok, yournger server, scruffy beard, unkempt looking jean wearing dude, seems nice enoug, takes after the head honcho it seems, gives me a new roll! Ok, lets open pandoras ""roll"". Hooray, clean, clean I say!

Here's the salad. Mix green with frisee, pour a little dressing, a few pieces browner and oxidized than they should be, what the hey, roughage is good. Bringing this frisee up to the hatch, and SSSSTOP!! Stem is black, stem is dirty, come on, they didn't wash it?!  Check the other, same condition. Awww man?! Ok, throw that fork down. Done with Salad.

Another server comes, picks plate and says: "" Why you no finish?"" I say, a little dirty, no problem. He asks if I wanted him to say anything, I say no, no, I'm fine, no problem, need to focus on this meeting here.

Salmon comes, hey it is cooked! Actually it was just ok, not great, but if I were to measure it based upon previous experiences, ya sure, great for Grazie. Salsa needs work, arugula, well,  lets just leave the ton of dirty arugula alone. It was ok,  it gave me protein to make it home alive for a home cooked real meal. I'll take fine.

OMG! There he is. Clint ""grazie"" Eastwood comes my way. Sh --t, I told that guy I don't want to make a fuss. Leans on the table, the slat eyed look and says: ""I hear you had an issue with the salad. I said indeed I did, it was DIRTY, I would call that an issue.

Folks, I cant make this shit up! Believe me, there is no agenda, this guy tells me it was the dressing, and it was clean! I PUT THE DRESSING, 20% of what they gave! If any of the brothers read this, HOUSTON you have a PROBLEM! THIS IS NOT HIS CALLING!"
1,"I have used Wellish for 8 years. I'm not in the habit of writing reviews however, my frustration is huge. I called three times to make my yearly appointment only to be on hold for an average of 12 minutes when I had to get off the phone. Next  I went to their website, filled out the contact form twice and sent them a message. I have never heard back!!! Truly unacceptable."
1,I heard about Waverly on Yelp and decided to give it a try as it is close to my neighborhood. unfortunately I was very disappointed. The service was fine but nothing over the top as some of the recent steakhouses I have been to this month. I was most disappointed with the RibEye steak that I ordered and the scalloped potatoes. The potatoes were too dry and had no flavor or salt whatsoever. The worst was the steak I ordered medium but the cut was worse than I could have got at a local grocery. The steak also had no seasoning and was just so blah...I ordered a Cosmo and that was good. I must say on my venture to go to all the Las Vegas restaurants that this by far the worst steak I have tasted.
1,"Always intrigued by this place.   We went on a Sunday and was not too busy.  First sign that it was not gonna be good was the locking mechanism attached to front door.  The kind that one puts a key in for someone stopping by later.  R they selling?  

Host and server were fine but the food is why you go.  

Got 12 boneless BBQ wings.  I have never had trouble cutting a boneless wing in half with a fork until this place.  They were like rocks.  BBQ sauce was good wings were not.  

Partner got Bigfoot burger. His plan was he liked everything on it so it would be good.  It is a burger on French toast with egg bacon and peanut butter.    Did not like at all.  Burger meat itself was terrible no flavor. 

I got a Texas BBQ burger  BBQ sauce onions on a big burger   Burger was blah he much better.  

Both came with fries that were also tasteless and hard.  

Even h2o tasted blah.  

Atmosphere smells like what it was a bar.  Spilled beers and urine.  

Avoid unless ur drinking"
1,"I love Dennys and when I come back to the states as I am stationed overseas it is on my list. This Dennys has to be one of the worst locations ever. I went Friday with my family and there was hardly any staff and hardly any guests. The GM was at the front and didn't even acknowledge we walked in. After being seated we waited 15 minutes with the waiter passing right by our table and serving people who came after us.
After looking at each other in surprise my husband called the GM over to personally take our order. He apologized that he only had one waiter that couldn't handle the tables. ...There were only about four. Not wanting to wait even longer for the food to come out we told him we would try again another day.
We then tried Saturday and once again walked in to one server four guests in the whole place and no one at the front. This time however we just walked out.
This Dennys needs some serious retraining."
1,"Used them before and they were fine but most recent service was HORRIBLE!  We needed a home warranty service on our hot tub because it leaking badly.  Service guy came out and was rude because we hadn't filled it up so he could see leak...makes sense except it leaks quickly and we didn't know when he'd be out.  He left in a huff and came back next day...said it would be expensive and not likely to be covered on warranty.  He was again rude and took off to put report in without a word.  He gave warranty company a one line report saying it was customer negligence (not so, but too much info to go into)...and that he recommended they not cover it.  You can bet that since we are now paying not only for the warranty visit and his attitude was horrendous that now we will look for a better company to do business with when we pay in full for the repairs!"
1,"ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE!

My husband and I came on 3/25 for a early dinner. It was our first time and excited to give it a try

About 10 minutes after leaving we both became violently ill. Turns out we both had food poisoning. 

Not sure which dish is the culprit. I had the Pho Special, my husband had the Bun Bo Hue. Together we shared: grilled pork rolls, Banh Xeo, and a Thai iced tea. 

It was completely empty when we went at 4 pm. 

Will not be back."
1,"Very overpriced.. They make mistakes on your credit card. Only a few breads worth $8.00, the average price of a loaf of bread. I recommend that you save your time and money."
1,"Bad service, bad food...too bad...was hopeful. To explain: Waiter didn't care, server didn't say a word, manager wasn't pleasant, all disappeared when we asked for assistance. Food was just awful. Salad was over dressed with no flavor cream dressing, the medium well steak was pastey, tasted like bad liver...etc. Talked with the food and beverage manager...he was pleasant and listened attentively. He said he would talk with staff at the restaurant and offered us a comp upon our future visit to the restaurant. No thanks! We do like the Cannery, and Victory's coffee shop isn't bad...but Waverley's is a no go!!!"
1,Terrible company. They do not listen to their messages or call you back when you leave a message. They came to my house to replace my pool motor and it leaked worse when they left.
1,"Crappy experience again.

We (4) sat down and ordered our lunch/breakfast.  Waitress never came back drinks were empty.  We asked for silverware and napkins which no success.  Waitress refills our drinks 25-30 minutes later.  The waitress came back to tell us that our order had been passed up this entire time.  She said there are a couple of orders ahead of us but it is coming.  45 wasted minutes.  The service has been like this the last two times we have tried to eat here.  We came to this Dennys at my 12yr old sons request.  The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize.  

We decided to leave and I stopped to pay for our drinks.  I had to request to speak to the manager.  He apologized for the mix up of course and agreed to pay for the tab.  We were not going to eat there today or in the future. 

For some reason this Dennys can't get it right.

Wanted to give it no stars but t this app doesn't allow it"
1,"Since Dickey's has opened in Scottsdale, I have stopped by at least once a week to pick up a Picnic Basket to take home to dinner for my family.  Last week I stopped by and drove through the drivethru.  I ordered the usual Picnic Basket and when I pulled up to the window, the guy handed me a bill for $28.  I called him back and said that there was a mistake because the Picnic Basket was $20.  With that, he told me that they had raised their prices but hadn't changed the prices on the drivethru billboard, and that he would not honor what the price on the board said.  I asked for a manager and he said that he was neither the manager nor the owner, and he would cancel my order.  When I asked that he honor the posted price, the said ""No, I'll just cancel the order.""  Bad for business to lose a customer over a few dollars, especially when the prices on the board had not been changed.  Very disappointed!"
1,This is my second time in and honestly I'm not even sure why I came back after my last experience. The first time I ordered food from here the meat was super dry so I just smothered it in the spicy bbq sauce (which was actually good!). This time the food was not even warm/lukewarm. Not sure if it is just this location or not because I had heard the food at Dickeys was good but it seems to me that there is a lack of attention or care here. Two thumbs down for me. Might try one of the other locations in the future :/
1,"By far the Worst pho I've ever had in 4 years of living in Arizona. I got the Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and the broth had zero flavor which is disappointing because Pho is all about the broth, the chicken was cooked well but also had no flavor. I'm not sure if this place is new but they need to reconsider their career because this place and food isn't it. 

Extra note - take out containers are also pretty cheap mostly all Pho places had their broths wrapped in a plastic bag and then put it in another plastic bag with the rest of the fixings but not Pho KC. 

To sum it all up - Terrible takeout experience, flavorless broth this place deserve zero stars and for the people who gave all the 5 star reviews you should really check out any other pho place in the valley I guarantee you'll forget about this place."
1,This was probably the worst dining experience anywhere! Do not waste your money or time. We had very little expectations to begin with going to a Denny's but just wanted a decent meal with our kiddos after a long day. We walked in and no one was at the host table for at least 5 minutes. We were seated and the place was nearly empty. A guy came and took our drink order and didn't come back for 10 minutes. A lady came after 10 minutes and asked for our drink order. We told her the guy took it and she disappeared only to return a few minutes later to ask for our drink order again. We got our drinks 20 minutes later and hadn't even ordered our food yet. She finally came back to take our order. An hour later we had to flag someone down to find out where our food and waitress was. We had not even gotten a single drink refill or seen our waitress. She comes back and we ask how much longer our food will be and if we can get refills. She disappears again comes back with no refills and says to be honest it's at least another 20 minutes! We had been there going on 2 hours! We only ordered eggs and pancakes and a cheeseburger! When we told her we were going to leave without food she had the nerve to demand we pay for our drinks! My husband talked to another waitress who said not to worry about the drinks. Will never set foot back in there!
1,"The only reason I'm giving this place a one star is because of Michele, who took the time to talk to me. Apparently the owners dad seems to think he runs the place! He was a total jerk to the employees... there was only two people in line, and one lady didn't have a clue as to what she wanted yet. This jerk decided to show off for his golf buddies and go behind the counter and yell at the staff! Unfortunately, I had already placed and paid for my order or I would've walked out! This guy was a total jackass!"
1,"We went for dinner 5/31 to Chandler Blvd Outback. We had stuffed mushrooms.. cobb salad and chicken on barbie...  Bill was $40...  We had to ask for serving plates for our stuffed mushrooms. We had to ask for re-fills for our ice tea. The chicken on barbie was nothing special . It was a small serving for 12.50 price.
The cobb salad lacked any eggs or avocado. It was nothing more than a few pieces of chicken cheese a couple tomatoes and lettuce that was not fresh. The portion was extremely small for 13.00 price tag. Service and food was sub par and pricey for what you got. Will NOT return....."
1,"July 4, 2011

This was one of the worst meals I EVER ate. We found that there were just not a lot of options for restaurants open on July 4th but we called Dickey's in Scottsdale and found out they were open until 7:00 p.m. We got there at 6:20 p.m. There was a line to order and several tables were filled. When we got to the counter to place our order (we both ordered the 2 meat plate) we were told that they were out of both types of brisket and ribs. So, we both ordered the same plate (roasted turkey, virginia baked ham, green beans with bacon and mac & cheese). We got our drinks and sat down. We waited for 20 minutes and when we finally got our food I took one bite of my mac & cheese only to find out it was cold. Not hot, lukewarm but cold like it was just taken out of a refrigerator and thrown into a cup. 

The beans were hot but drenched in water. The ham was lukewarm at best. The turkey was disgusting. It tasted like processed turkey that you buy from a deli counter. It was also cold. 

To pay more than $26 for semi-fast food to have limited choices available and then have your food suck is beyond unacceptable. I will NEVER GO BACK TO DICKEY'S AGAIN and I will be sure and tell everyone I know NEVER TO GO THERE AS WELL. 

I understand the restaurant closed at 7:00 p.m. because of the holiday but they were not closed at 6:20 p.m.  The service was also horrible.

As I had 20 minutes to kill waiting for disgusting food, I watched as a patron had to go to the counter not once but twice because first there was no more ice in the soda machine but then when he got his food the employee didn't even give him utensils to eat with!! 

Also, there was another customer who had a take-out order. He got his bag and left only to return 10 minutes later because the employee forgot to put some items in his to go order. RIDICULOUS!!!

There were nothing but front line staff working in the kitchen and counter. I don't know who the heck was managing the place but I would say whoever was managing the place should be fired because I saw a lot of unhappy customers and employees who were just waiting for the clock to turn 7 p.m. so they could go home. 

My recommendation to all Scottsdale residents who enjoy a good bbq every now and then....go somewhere else. Don't go to Dickey's because you will be throwing your money away!"
1,"This has to be one of the most inefficient Dennys I have ever been to. Waited 20 minutes before having to find someone to take out drink order then another 10 minutes to get a coffee, OJ and water. Had the waitress take our ores right away then waited another 45 minutes to get it. Good didn't come out all together,still waiting for other half of our order and what did come out is cold. 

Ridiculous wait times. They know their Sunday rush times and should accommodate with additional staff. Won't ever be back to this dennys."
1,"I'm not going to say that I absolutely know what I'm talking about when it comes to BBQ.  I will simply list my credentials. Born in Utah where a mix of BBQ exists, mostly commercial type fare and some pit type of stuff I then moved to Cincinnati where a whole different breed of BBQ extists.  Tangy sweet sauce, fruity and tart, some boiled meat, some smoked.  I then moved to Florida where Southern BBQ rules, lots of smoke, multitudes of sauce choices in one sitting: Sweet, Hot, Spicy/Sweet, Mustard, smokey, a selection of heaven on one table with lots of smoke and rub to complete things.  On to North Carolina where the sauce is light and vinegar-y, more of a salad dressing than a ""sauce"" but delicious all the same, the pulled pork topped with sauce and some tangy coleslaw.  In Chicago we eat BBQ at Coopers, hearty sauce and crisp from the grill, the ribs there are intense and flavorful, different from the south and from Cincinnati but delicious all the same.  Roadside BBQ pits in FL, GA, TN and TX have been some of my favorites that I can't name.  I like to think that I have some experience in BBQ since it is a food I love like mad.

So we've covered what I know from the past.  This is what I know now: This place sucks.  Tasteless and bland and as my husband mentioned ""weird"", this ""BBQ"" was both overpriced and beyond grisly.  We both had the ribs and the brisket, both were boiled and I'm fairly certain all the flavor was tossed out with the water.  The brisket was so fatty that we didn't eat it.  The ribs were the texture of semi-melted wax chips without much meat on them.  I'm fairly certain they just mashed potatoes and added coloring and some red pepper and called it potato salad, there was no flavor to that either.  We will never go back.  I really hate giving one star to any place, but honestly, this place ranks about 0 stars.  Rank, that about describes it."
1,"I feel so sick!!! I had a pizza with mushrooms, mozzarella, and it was suppose to be pepperoni, but it was gross pepperoni that I think has now made me sick. 
I hope to feel better soon. But it's already been 2 hours since I ate and it's just getting worse. I don't know it is was the canned flavoured non-Italian sauce or the weird pepperoni?"
1,"Pool water looks like a swamp. I call the Home Warranty Company (American Home Shield), it is going to be a $100 dollar service fee. Guy comes out, says I need new filters $100 apiece $500 total. Okay no big deal, I buy the new filters and pay the service charge. 

One week later, pool looks like a swamp again. I call the Home Warranty place again, they send out the same guy from Aaron Pools, he now tells me the water is bad and we need to replace it, that will fix the problem. Okay how much is that going to cost me? $100 Service fee, $100 for the Chemicals and $100 for the pool pump to pump out the water. Okay another $300, no big deal. 

One week later, pool looks like a swamp again. I call the Home Warranty Company, it is going to cost $100 again. Same guy comes out, ""Oh hey, I see that you have a broken part on the bottom of your filter, the part is about $40 bucks. Once we get that fixed your water will run through the filter fine, and you should not have any problems. Total cost $100 dollar service fee plus $40 part. 

I asked the guy if the part was fixed the first time would the other problems have been a problem, ""He says no, because the water was not filtering out it was just coming in the filter and going back into the pool, never filtering the pool that is why your pool kept turning green."" 

They would not listen to my complaint, they only cared about collecting their $100 Service fee. You be the judge. Is that the service you want?"
1,"Stopped here for dinner to go for my sister and I. 
Ordered sweet and sour chicken it was over cooked, added fried rice which was mush.  The dumplings and teriyaki chicken we're good.  The California roll made with imitation crab and seriously tasteless.  

Decided that the best part of the meal was the Nithing Bundt cakes that i took home for desert..."
1,"Dr. Sabouri is a great dr. and person. I gave been a patient for glaucoma treatment. I am now looking for a new Dr. because Wellish management wants to charge me $15, for a copy of my medical records. I cancelled my appointment for July, manager refuses to return my phone calls. Dr. Wellish, your reputation going down for $15. That's SAD."
1,"I have been here a few times and I have no clue why I keep going because service is absolutely horrible everytime i go. When I ate there the first time it seems like the waitresses always disappear and never come back. My husband ordered a beer and he never got it. I ordered cheese on fries once they forgot the cheese and when I told them they gave me cold shredded cheese. 
 Tonight my husband and I ordered takeout 30 minutes before getting there I called in the order when my husband got there it wasn't ready and he had to wait an additional 30 minutes....then they made the order for dine in instead of take out. The waitresses disappeared on him a few times. Then the food...gross...nothing had flavor not even my poor piece of salmon...it was juicy but no flavor. My husband ordered wings and he said it just tasted like chicken. 

In all seriousness management needs to evaluate their company cause it's not just this location and whoever this lady is who comments ""sorry this happened"" on the other reviews needs to stop and reevaluate her life too."
1,"dennys was the best restaurant when I was a teenager. as you get older and have acquire a taste for real food and not a cafeteria joint.  I stopped being a fan of dennys when I was 21. it became something I rather not eat and just starve.
I don't expect a lot from dennys, unless Im drunk and need food to sober up. I just think your better off hitting up a drive thru instead."
1,Dont even bother to try. I have tried many korean places but havent seen worse service and food than this place. not recommended.
1,"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I waited nearly ten minutes with servers walking right past me and not once did anybody say hi or offer to serve me. When I noticed the staff going to the tables that came in after me, I decided it was time to leave. There was a manager in the front so I told him that I was leaving because nobody came to serve me. He offered to serve me personally and to cover the bill, which I thanked him for, but politely refused. He then stood in front of me, blocking me from the exit, and tried to usher me back to the table. I again told him that I was no longer interested in dining in his restaurant, and he continued to try make me stay. I finally had to walk through him and leave despite his ongoing protest for me to stay. I will not be back."
1,"No star, if it were an option.  Worst company.  Terrible customer service.  Delayed service, they don't honor what they say to make up for their lack of performance.  Accuse us the customer of lying.  Very bad business ethics.  Called them initially to pump/motor.  My option was new or rebuilt. Opted for the rebuilt.  First replacement was bad.  They said they will come and replace bad rebuilt replacement.  A week later, still no call, no show.  Called for a status, they said they will make up for the delay with a new one for the same price as the rebuilt.  When it came to install, they put in a reconditioned.  When questioned, they said if we want a new one, that we had to pay for the difference between the rebuilt and new.  Told no way, that they need to honor what they said.  They accused us of lying. 3 1/2 weeks later, they contact us for payment, which was already paid 3 1/2 weeks prior.  They claimed they installed a new pump, we told them if they really installed a new one, we want the warranty information, which we knew they did NOT replace with new.  Their response was, in order for us to receive warranty information, we had to pay the difference.  Absolutely the worst business ethics we've ever encountered."
1,"My experience with the Red Door Spa at 2502 East Camelback was a big disappointment!
My daughters had gone together to buy a package including a massage, a pedicure, and a manicure for Mother's Day.  
The massage person was very nice but the massage was superficial.  There was no attention to my body's needs. It was just done without thinking.
The pedicure and manicure by Raisa were the worst I have ever had! In fact, the very next day I went and had both redone in order to fix the problems she created! She was so worried about telling me about extra charges that she didn't focus on what she was doing!
The two women at the front desk were very nice as was the manager, Michelle, who called me after I filled out an emailed survey showing my unhappiness.
Michelle said that the Red Door teaches ""protocols"" and in my opinion that is their downfall!  They need to trust their employees to offer individual customer service to meet individual needs!
I was offered $56 towards my next services (if I go back it will be to a different location) and that was appreciated! However, the package cost in excess of $250."
1,"My girlfriend and I were in recently at about 0600 on 12/21, and the restaurant seemed desolate. You would assume that this means good service. The first thing I noticed was the vinyl table with a greasy film. We both decided to deal with it though. Our waitress brought out coffee and to mix cream in, I was going to use the knife in my silverware set. The knife had a thick white film on it that I was able to literally pick off with my nail. I set it aside to try the spoon, and once again, it was nasty. Dried white food crumbs were on it. I requested a new set from the waitress, and she seemed annoyed. As I drank my coffee I began to realize how disgustingly stained the inside of the mug was. The food was about what we expected, but the service and sanitary conditions were very subpar. Both me and my girlfriend are in the food service industry, and at this point it is needless to say that it was outrageously subpar. I can't imagine that I'm the only one that has had this issue, so if I don't get approached in some way to make the situation right, I'll probably be filing a complaint with the state. Tipped $3 and at this point I regret tipping at all."
1,"They came out to fix my backwash handle and the first time I tried to use it it broke off. Literally didn't even last 1 use. When I called to have them replace it they asked me to go back through my warranty company but then I have pay the full $70 fee again. $140 total for a new handle? Both of the girls who handle the ""customer service"" are rude and snarky. I also don't appreciate the snarky and passive aggressive comment on this review from whoever Mike is.  The bottom line is that a handle that is used only once every 90 days or so should last more than 90 days. They didn't even replace the 15 year old handle just the base which is half a$$ and shoddy work. I don't care what the policy of my home warranty is. They should back up their product.  It's not the HW companies fault that they don't take pride in what they do. 

In short: Worthless customer service and worthless service on my pool. Don't bother with this company, I anticipate they'll be out of business within the year anyway. Good riddance."
1,"Not much to say. Went for dinner here since Buffalo Wild Wings had a long wait and we didn't have enough time. 

Since my boyfriend had work we didn't order adult beverages just a water with lemon and Pepsi/Coke. The drinks come out, surprise no lemon. (We stated lemon with the water, so it wasn't like an un-spoken request) whatever, we decided it wasn't worth a fight and went to ordering our dinner. I had a Tavern Burger, he had a Reuben. I also ordered a side salad to eat prior to my burger coming out. Once we placed our order, we did not see our waitress ONCE until after the food came out. I had been almost empty on my beverage for awhile at that point, and luckily with the food she ran and got me a refill. My salad didn't come out prior instead it came with, and was TERRIBLE. The croutons were stale, and the salad was soggy (like it had sat out in the dressing for way to long). My burger was fine, I feel as though it was small for $10, but whatever. My fries were cold. The Reuben made my boyfriend sick but he said the flavor was good, his fries also cold. 

We never saw our server again, until she dropped off the bill. So instead of complaining we paid and left and I don't plan on returning to this location. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone, and don't see how people are raving about it."
1,"Here is my experience thus far, I would prefer not to rate with stars & just disclose the facts.

I Had LASIK performed June 30th... There were 2 procedures offered. One standard and a second which was custom approximately an additional $1300. I asked if I needed the procedure and the doctor said you only have one pair of eyes in which I agreed & paid cashiers check over $4000. 
(Recommended mono vision correction).
 Fee does not include 3 types of eye drops @ $140 , fish oil etc.).

Super blurry following the procedure in which I thought would pass & perhaps my eyes needed to adjust. 
*Follow up appointment one pair of plugs inserted  which can cause constant tearing. Still can't see.

*Next appointment second pair of plugs inserted. Still can't see. 

* 3rd apt. I still can't see. The doctor gave me a prescription for glasses and said I would need an ""enhancement "" in 4-6 mos. @ minimum. I'm heartbroken...


Recommended possible temporary treatment options.
*Buy New Glasses. Wth!?!
*I was advised to purchase a special humidifier approximately $450.
*Directed to a website to purchase additional supplements.
*Additional Eye Drops -3 kinds
* Possible dry eye procedures required- IPL 

My vision very blurry, eyes always tearing ,depth perception off , night vision really bad. not safe & I'm hoping to find a resolution to get back to life. 
I will go in for a test this week to see if dry eyes are causing part of the problem which may require additional procedures to follow ,but 75% I still need an ""enhancement."" 

I will follow up with results... My Quality of life has greatly impacted ...Devastated at this time.....

Round 2 of Surgery on left eye 11/15/2017.
Agreed on left eye only surgery to remove mono-vision.
Result another under correction ;however, it is an improvement from Mono-vision and the one eye seems to be slightly improving. I am praying for continuous improvement."
1,Alright food bad service. Waited 40 minutes for my waitress to come around so I could get my bill. I could see her. She was busy vaping behind a wall by the kitchen entrance. I finally flagged down a different waitress and got my bill. The whole time my waitress/ bartender was busy huffing flavored water vapor. No one ever checked on me the whole time. I won't be back. I hope you won't go there either. Next time I'll listen to my coworkers and go to Rocknes.
1,"They were contracted by my warranty company to repair my pool motor.
Pros- (only one) tech showed up on time Fri 9am

Cons- tech figured out the problem,  said he was going to the parts store to get a new motor, didn't hear from him  for 5 hours, so i called him at 3 to get an update on how he was doing,  he told me he had gone to another job and it took him longer than what he thought and now parts store was closed and he wouldn't be able to fix my motor until the following week? Wouldn't explain why he had gone to another job before completing mine.
I called the office and try to get an explanation,  they finally said, they could get someone to stop by Saturday morning with a new motor and do the repair work.
Tech showed up Saturday morning,  and unloads the motor , it doesn't look brand new , i asked him , is it new and and he said no, it's rebuilt??? At this point, I just wanted to have my pool fixed as it was turning green, and said fine, let's just get it going, I called the office Tuesday morning.( Memorial Day) Some how they tried to make it as it was my fault that I got  rebuilt motor, not the new one that we agreed, ""I should have said something"",  i was told. I will forward my complaint to my warranty company not to ever send Aaron pools to do warranty work to my house"
1,"Horrible service, mediocre food at best.  The place is extremely dirty and the lunch wait is too long."
1,"$32 for 12 wings and two beers. 
Food was ok. Beer was ok 
Service very marginal. 
Two bartenders and only 10 of us at the bar but had to repeatedly wait for service. 
They both did find time to spend quality time with a couple of regulars. 

I got the dry wings and they were pretty much fried and rolled in a salt/spice mixture. 

The place was pretty empty and I see why. Won't be back."
1,"So disappointed. Spent $40 for 2 meals and some tasteless sushi. 
Got sweet n sour chicken and the chicken was dried and shriveled up. Fried rice was pasty obviously over cooked and shush had no flavor. So mad I wasted so much on bad food."
1,"I could never recommend this company. Unfortunately for me I was assigned this company through my Fidelity Home warranty.  The technician has zero customer service skills, and was very unfriendly to my wife. My issue is that my pool filter was leaking and he refused to investigate the reasons why.  He immediately assumed that my filter was dirty with out even opening the filter to investigate. And you guessed it.. he wanted to charge me $90 to fix.   It gets worse from here, but I wont go into it here.  This is actually my second time dealing with this company and both times have been horrible.  Thank God my warranty company is bringing out a different company to service my problem.  BEWARE of this company."
1,"Been here before and was decent when you have a hankering for bbq.  Not memorable bbq, but I don't remember it being terrible by any means. But tonight....The husband ordered some takeout and we got some grilled chicken breast with some bbq sauces on the side and some waffle fries. The chicken was tender but so saturated or marinated in salt salt saltyyyyy we couldn't even eat more than one bite...And that was without any bbq sauce on it. The fries also were so overly coated in salt seasoning that I had to brush/shake off salt even to eat a couple. Total meal ended up in the trash. We are not goats! If I wanted a salt lick I'll get one at Petsmart okay!? Chill out on the salt ppl! Never going back here ever again. Disgusting"
1,I don't usually leave bad reviews and I'm a big fan of Korean food but I hate everything about this place! I don't get the hype about this chain of 'Korean' restaurants that are actually run by Chinese! None of the dishes are worth raving about- and whenever I went there the servers were always rude and in a hurry. Avoid.
1,"Ummmmm....yuck.  Just ""yuck"".

I mean, seriously?  I give it one star because the waitress was nice and we got good service.

We were here last week.  Wife got her birthday ""grand slam"".  OMG...I don't know what they did but it was disgusting.  The pancakes tasted heavy and fat and, well, just ""yucky"".  They should have been ""light and fluffy"", as most breakfast places will make them.  Eggs weren't a lot better.  I wouldn't be surprised if eating that shaved a year or two off her life.  It was free for her birthday, and I still think we got ripped off on that one!

I had a burger and fries.  Well...they were better than McDonald's.  Can't say they were bad.  But definitely nothing special.  You could make a better one in your own kitchen in about 10 minutes for a fraction of the cost.  If you want a decent burger try Fuddruckers or Red Robin or someplace like that.  For the price, Denny's burger was definitely not worth it.

I don't care if it's free on your birthday, it's not worth it.  Don't come here."
1,"Daniel came to our home last week.  He is employed by Aaron pools sent out by Old Republic, the warranty company that the seller paid for at the close of our house in March.
  We had two broken valves and the light was not functioning.  Daniel  was  not personable at all.  He looked at the valves and said they wouldn't be covered because they went to the water features. I could not find where it had said anywhere in my contract that water features weren't covered. He was matter of fact and very cold about the fact they weren't covered. Then he walked over to the light and leaned down and looked at the light and said it was full of water and the entire light assembly would need to be replaced.  He furthered explained this would include having to rerun the wiring to the box.  Again, without any remorse, he said it was not a covered item either.  Daniel was happy to give me an estimate for the repairs, which included a bill for $300.00 to fix the light.  I told him I was unhappy with his demeaner.  My husband pulled the light out and it was not full of water!  We purchased a 250 watt bulb at the pool store for $15.00 and fixed the light ourselves. I have never felt so ripped off by Daniels diagnosis and estimate for the repair of the pool light. Consumer beware of Aaron Pools employing techs that do business this way."
1,"I came here with my family to have some classic BBQ.  I had purchased a Google Offer and wanted to experience and savor some true Southern cuisine.  Not a chance.  I placed the order for everybody and whipped out my phone.  The cashier refused to take my coupon.  He insisted that it be printed, not scanned from the phone.  I told him that the number on the phone will link me with the coupon and we can all be happy.  He called his manager and I got the same story.  Finally, the let me talk to the owner, he gave me the same story.

Meanwhile, at noon on a Saturday the staffing consisted of one person taking drive in orders AND walk in orders.  I have absolutely no idea what the manager and owner do (except reject coupons from customers).  The line was through the door and people were leaving because of it.

I did not try the food, but looking at the other ratings, may it was an omen that we ended up having a great meal across the street at Butterfield's.  

How this place survives???? I cannot answer that one.

Avoid -"
1,"I called WVI and scheduled an appointment only to have it cancelled by the clinic because the consult tech called in sick. So the following week, I called in an attempt to reschedule the appointment only to be sent to voicemail. I left a message, but no one ever called me back. I guess WVI doesn't want my money! If this place can't even manage its appointment scheduling properly, why would I trust my eyes to them?"
1,"well figured I would give them another shot. still nothing it used to be, ordered the sirloin and was a tough grizzled peice, the brocolli came out with a funny brown hue, sent it back and the replacement was near raw. This tells me they simply don't know how to handle food, which is worse than than back quality meat, it's dangerous. I had a couple of discount cards and simple threw them away and will never go back. within 6 months they went from stellar to cellar. just avoid if you can."
1,"Visited on Friday 3/25 for supper. I was really looking forward to a good Cajun meal. Out of fish on a Friday????  Are you kididng? And, crab soup so salty, was not edible. The waitress, who was really good, did not charge for it after complaining. Rice and beans pretty good, and wait staff quite attentive. I really did expect better. Will not be going there again."
1,"Went there Sunday Nite . The tables are so close together,they never used to be so close.All the staff were squessing between our table which was very annoying . The food tasted great although we were both sick the next day . We had different meals ,so go figure .The seats are uncomfortable . If u want a romantic setting ,forget it .Not a place for an intimate dinner and very loud .An honest review"
1,"This is regarding pedicures only.  I went there for a warm creme pedicure thinking that it would be relaxing and a signature service,  NO.  Their ""warm creme"" is lotion.  That's it.  They up charge you for Fucking lotion! There was nothing warm about it.  This pedicure is a basic one, nothing special.  

The lady that did mine was helen i think.  She is incredibly rude.  She was trying to sell me one of their more expensive pedicures the whole time, and when i said no she commented that it was probably that I couldn't afford it because of my work place.  Then she proceeded to comment on my shoes and how they looked cheap even though they are $90 shoes!

The service was horrible and I was just waiting for my bad experience to be over with.  For a $55 (overpriced) pedicure I expected way more.  Never will I go to this sleazy spa ever again."
1,"For a place that charges so much, I was expecting a much better experience.  Instead, it felt rushed, I hate my hair and my nail were smudged before I got down the stairs.  It was super disappointing and ridiculously expensive for the quality of service I received."
1,Very disappointed in this Denny's. I normally like Denny's for breakfast but the quality of the breakfast was poor and very Bland. I ordered the All-American slam and a stack of pancakes. The pancakes were very good but the All-American slam was flavorless. When I walked in and nobody was at the register and several employees just passed by me and didn't say anything. Took about 3 minutes to get a seat. This place was not clean at all and my coffee cup had stains on the inside. My bill was $15.57 which is really high for a bland  meal with a dirty coffee cup. My waitress Rita what is nice and efficient but she should have noticed the coffee cup. Won't be going back there
1,"Maybe it was what we ordered - but the food was crap. 

It was our first time and we didn't know what to order. They had a $20 special with three dishes and some egg rolls. All were crap. Wouldn't give it to my dog. We had Teriyaki Beef - some crappy beef with Teriyaki poured over it. Sesame Chicken tasted like the Teriyaki (did they use the same sauce?) The chicken fried rice was a tasteless wonder. They use regular plates but plastic forks and foam glasses. Service was fine though. 

We didn't order any sushi or rolls - maybe they can do these well. But for Chinese dishes STAY AWAY. 

I give them one year and they will be closed."
1,"My visit today just confirmed why we don't frequent this restaurant. Food was decent(not worth a $35 check) but service was horrible. There were maybe 8 tables including people sitting at the bar so obviously not busy. Which was okay until our server brought out our food and never returned. We needed drink refills and extra napkins but couldn't ask our server. I ended up asking another server who was busy cleaning tables and sweeping floors.our server brought the check, came back a minute later to collect but it wasn't ready yet. She never returned. We ended up leaving cash. Normally we like to leave at least 20% for a tip and typically give more, especially when service deserves it. Very disappointing."
1,Poorest environment ever****So my boyfriend asked me to hv Korean BBQ..... The food was okay but don't expect to have a very nice environment there. And apperantly the porkbelly came blue****
1,"I lost my jewelry in their spa and I went back to look for but people don't care about it and their attitude is really bad. I am a Chinese so maybe they think I am not native and they just don't care about me, I called the police and try to reach their manager, they told me they cannot give me manager's phone number because it is privacy and their manager is on vacation, bullshit privacy they are bunch of racist! And thieves!!!! Bad bad bad service bad people racist took my Jewelry it is worth 10,000dollars"
1,"It's 9:30 on a Friday night uptown. My boyfriend and I were walking around looking for a good spot to stop and eat. The hours say until 10, so I assumed that we had time to order food. As we were being seated by the host, the waitress loudly said ""Are we still serving food?"" Hint number one that she clearly didn't want to be there. As we sat down, she looked over and rolled her eyes. Hint number 2. At this point, I decided it was time to leave and I made sure to let the host know why as we were walking out the door. It was my first time here and I was looking forward to trying the food, but sadly, she ruined it for me and I probably won't be back, horrible."
1,"The service was good and friendly, the food however was not. I orderd a cheeseburger and fries. When it came out the burger was all lumpy and didnt look like a burger at all. The meat didnt taste very good at all. The fries were the best part of the meal. Im very perticular about my burgers and this deffinatly disapointed."
1,"Our first visit...and I was starving. My wife suggested it, and I was totally in to trying something new! I ordered a sandwich only to find out that they were out of the chimichuri sauce. My wife made fun of me because this always happens to my order. I changed my order and was then told that they were again out of something! Needless to say, we left and went to Panera"
1,"My friends and I were cut off after a few beers despite having THREE designated drivers among our 7 person party.  I liked the place but I'll never go back if I can't drink as much as I'd like.  It was so bizarre.  They must have not liked the hundreds of dollars we'd already spent and must not have wanted the hundreds of dollars we'd have likely continued to spend, I guess.

I assure you, we were all adults and weren't fall down drunk or disruptive."
1,Do not go here for lunch. We just went here and it took over an hour and a half before we got our entrees. By this point we were full bc the courses were brought out so far apart. We spoke with the Manager who was very nice and understanding about our complaint. At this point I was not mad but what happened next is what put me over. I walked off without my entree which I put in a to go container bc by the time I got it I was too full to eat. It was my entire untouched entree. Before I even got in my car I realized I left it on the table. We went back to get it and they had already thrown it away. This all occurred during the lunch hour--they were not busy at all. I don't understand why they couldn't have set my container aside for a few minutes to make sure I didn't return for it. I'm beyond mad.
1,"I absolutely love this store. The employees are ALWAYS friendly and so helpful. Not to mention, Trader Joes has some of thee best groceries anyone could buy. Everything is always fresh and neatly organized. I love the fresh flowers at the entrance when you walk in. Everything about Trader Joes on the INSIDE is amazing.

However, very few people I know like to pay for parking while they are grocery shopping. If you park in the upstairs ramp even for ten minutes and run in to grab something quick without paying the meter, you will end up with a $25 parking ticket. SO RIDICULOUS. There is current construction within the Monroe Street area and it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack when it comes to parking. I understand that its a Trader Joes thing to not appeal to customers as some giant corporation or whatever, so they make their store parking lots micro sized, making any and all persons who try and find a spot have a panic attack all because they want to get some soy milk and bananas. There are two major issues here: The lots are WAY too small and the parking is too limited, AND they make you pay to park. I can imagine this is probably because of people parking there for extended periods of time that are not customers, but good god, people make it two hour parking so people have a chance to park freely and if they overstay their parking time, THEN ticket them. This whole situation just makes my blood boil. So, if you want great food and excellent service please support Trader Joes, but don't expect that you'll be free of paying for parking, getting a ticket, or having a small fit while trying to find a place to park."
1,"This was my second time at this location. The first time I was not overly impressed, but we decided to give it another chance. 

Last night myself and two others went in for dinner. We asked for a beer menu (last time there was a laminated list) we were handed a hand written list, much shorter than the list last time. This is a sports bar and should definitely have a better beer list than a hand written list. Then it came time to order our food; I ordered boneless WINGS, one other a burger and the other a salad. When the food came, the burger was wrong and it had shredded cheese instead of sliced cheese (starting to get a cutting costs unnecessarily feeling). My BONELESS WINGS were in fact chicken TENDERS. There is a difference here. The meat tastes different in these two cuts of chicken. The food runners were very rude about my dissatisfaction. Simply said, ""that's how they come"". Well, the menu shouldn't say BONELESS WINGS then. I tried the tenders, but it just wasn't good so I sent it back and got a burger. The server was rude about me sending it back and a manager never came to check on our table. A table sent food back and a manager just didn't care. 

Also, the live music was horrible and entirely too loud. We had to yell at each other to talk. The hosts didn't want to actually sit us, pushed us to the bar seating which is first come first serve. When we came back and said it was full they also seemed annoyed they actually had to do some work. Overall, it's been a long time since I was this disappointed in an experience at a restaurant. 

My friends and I will definitely not be returning to this location and will certainly drive another 3 minutes down the road to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for a sports bar and real boneless wings in the future."
1,"Worst medical experience ever. Unbelievable waiting times, seven visits for fourteen hours of my time, one hour of Dr. and his staff, total. Upsell started immediately. All about the money he can extract from you and your insurance, as well as referring as many other Drs. as possible."
1,"Horrible customer service.  AARON POOLS was ""assigned"" to my home warranty pool issue.   I called them on a Thursday after receiving the work order # from my warranty company.   They stated that they had 48 hours to call me and schedule a visit,  and they would call me back.  I FINALLY received a call from them the following Monday, 47 business hours from when I started the claim.  They obviously don't care about customer service.  Don't give them your business!"
1,"This Review is strictly represented to the Spa location in Litchfield Park at the Wigwam Resort.
When I was done spending $170.00 later in services at the salon I was told the spa was open free with service. Never was I shown the facility or walked through the Spa, my daughter was with me having mother daughter time she is 17 years old. She also had nails done at the salon. The lady at the entry to the Spa was not helpful at all. I asked for a drink and I ordered a Gin and Tonic, 45 minuets later I asked about the drink I ordered and 15 minutes later the lady arrives at the jacuzzi that we just where getting out and done with my watered down drink and ice tea for my daughter. I simply did not complain but this type of treatment by your staff immediately set the ambience for the remainder of our stay which was short lived because after she handed me my drink she proceeds to ask me my daughters age? Why? Then proceeds to tell me that they do not allow underage in the Spa! I read on the sign by the jacuzzi no children under 16. So either she was just being plain mean and cruel and very unkind to a guest with her daughter and in my opinion should not be working in an Elizabeth Arden Spa environment or they failed to tell me that when I booked our Spa services. Because if that was the case I would of drove to a Spa I would of been welcomed and appreciated in. I will say this my hairstylist apologized for that woman's behavior but what happened to hiring people who care and actually like doing what they do.
Another bad part of the Spa was the bottom of the jacuzzi tore up my feet because it needs to be resurfaced, the sauna room smelt like mildew and it was all rusted out and gross. The eucalyptus was stained in the white wash rags sitting in cold water ice was melted maybe had 2 rags left. The towels to dry after shower smelled like dirty towels. And they ran out of them. I would not recommend this Spa in Litchfield Park @ the Wigwam. It was a very unpleasant experience for myself and my little girl.
Happy Travels!"
1,"The female bartender is extremely rude.  The customer next to me waited 10 minutes to even be greeted, and them he said ""ma'am"", and she turned her back to him and put her hand up.  I haven't even tried the food, but there is no excuse for poor customer service."
1,"Imagine going to McDonalds for a Big Mac and finding out they've decided to only serve that particular sandwich (their most popular) once or twice a week.  That's what purchasing bread at Great Harvest Bread Company is like.  Well, no...that's what Great Harvest would be like if the girl behind the counter was flipping you off with a smile on her face at the same time.

In my opinion, their best item (besides their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies) is their loaf of Cheddar Garlic bread.  It's quite possibly the only reason why I still stop by this place anytime I'm in the area.  However, it's been a few years and I figured they may have replaced that item in that time.  So, I called one of their locations and was told that they still serve that particular bread on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

This past Saturday, my father was looking for breadbowls for a soup his wife had prepared and I suggested Great Harvest.  We walked in and each got our complimentary piece of bread by the rudest girl that I have ever been helped by.  I looked at their racks and noticed a lack of Cheddar Garlic bread.  At this point, my sister asked the same girl if they had any in the store to purchase.  She responded with a scoff...""I only make that bread on Thursdays.""  Trust me when I say that you informing me that this item is unavailable will hardly lead to a meltdown on my part.  What I can't handle, however, is your show of annoyance at my inquiries and complete lack of customer service.  I not only won't be back, but I'll make sure to provide any friends, business contacts or general aquaintances with an alternative business that is only too happy to treat their customers as if they're actually wanted."
1,"I placed an order on line including a baked potato with all the trimmings. When I got home I found a baked potato with... nothing! Obviously I didn't go back, but I called and spoke to the manager. She apologized and promised me I will receive a free meal identical to the one I had ordered on line. She took my name and said it will be added on a list, all I have to do is show up. A couple of weeks later I decided to give it a try, but I was wise enough to call ahead and check that my name is still on the list. I was told that there is no such list. Goes without saying that I had dinner elsewhere."
1,If you like cold over cooked food this is your place. The service is also EXTREMELY slow!
1,"Very bad. Service extremely slow. 
Forgot silverware for table to begin with, when they came, one place set dirty. 

An order of pancakes, had a leaf of  cooked lettuce between them. 

Place overall dirty."
1,Worst food ever... There was a fly in our hot pot...when we were packing our food... My bf found another insect moving in our seafood pancake...
1,"Done with hickory tavern, had a long week at work so wanted a good supper. I used their online service ordering a po boy plain, wife runs in to get it and receipt says nothing on po boy but when she gets to the car there's everything on it. The manager krista was very rude and I get to go without supper. I have always had good service at all the hickory taverns but service here sucks"
1,"Horrible service, waited till 145 pm for the pool tech to come to my home who my home warranty company called out to fix my pump that was working half way. He turned it on for 10 seconds and said sounds like the bearings are not working but the home warranty wont cover noise issues. I kept trying to tell him that it was not working how it was supposed to and it was causing the water to be cloudy, and not sucking how it was supposed to. He said its not cloudy. Well, that's because your office girl told me to dump a ton of liquid chlorine in the pool to keep it from turning green in the beginning of the week. He didn't want to work, then gave me a quote for a new pump. I called my home warranty company old Republic, and they said they would have covered the barrings and the tech does not call the shots on what is covered and what is not. He also gave me a quote to change the motor out. I have had Old Republic for years at my other house with a pool and never had an issue with coverage. Not sure how you could figure things out in 10 seconds, run from this company, kid didn't want to work or because I am female he thought he could get one over one me."
1,"If I could give a 0, I would. 


On October 11 me and my family decided to go to eat at Outback in Chandler, AZ. I am 4 months pregnant and take medication that I cannot drink with (pregnant or not) so I decided to have a non-alcohol daiquiri. I asked my husband to drink some first just to be safe. He did not taste anything. I began drinking it and after about 5 sips I began feeling something is not right with the drink and felt a buzz. I asked for management to confirm there was no alcohol in my beverage. They immediately realize they made a mistake and comped our meal and said someone from corporate would be following up the next day.

The phone call I received the next day and today was a very uncaring about my pregnancy and about the medication that I take and basically said we comped your meal that's all we're doing because you weren't injured and gave you free coupons. I told them a free meal write off does not compensate for a negligent mistake. 

Moral of the story is that I trusted a virgin daiquiri would be served to me and I made the situation very clear I was pregnant. The fact the corporation is uncaring that my 4 month old fetus consumed liquor and that my medications could've caused harm is unsettling. 

Be careful if you order your children virgin drinks. Taste the drink first."
1,"The French Quarter is the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at in my entire life. The half pound burgers aren't half a pound. The fries weren't good. The jalapeño poppers were still frozen in the middle. I guess the microwave wasn't working very well. They didn't have 2 out of the 3 soups featured on the menu. The Greek salad was very mediocre. Our server didn't serve us. He was busy hanging at the bar and watching tv. We had to get up and go to the bar to give our order and had to do the same thing with our check when we wanted the change.  I've hung out here at the bar before and it was great but whatever you do, don't eat here. They only serve food gratuitously. It's not something they really care about. Quality is horrible. Anyone who says the food is good here doesn't get out much. My expectations weren't high because it's bar food but don't waste your time or money eating here. There's too many places uptown that care about your dining experience to patronize this place for anything other than the bar. Stick to drinks French Quarter. You suck at food- you can't even do bar food well."
1,DO NOT GO HERE !! the lady that works the front sometimes has always had some.kind of attitude which we've dealt with but after this last time the attitude and the fact SHE WOULDN'T GIVE MORE THAN 4 SOY SAUCES pushed my buttons.  I wanted four more but nope couldn't be done. My 2 yr old was with me do I didn't want to create a huge scene.  The sushi has always been ok. We only come here because it's a convenient location but we will NOT BE returning. Learn son customer service and then maybe we will reconsider.  I am always very polite when asking and ordering and always saying please and thank you and to be treated like this over 4 extra soy sauce 2as ridiculous. I'd give zero stars but it won't let me.
1,"UPDATE: My warranty co. wanted them to come and give a second opinion on something. Do you know they demand that you give them availability for AN ENTIRE DAY?

I notice that the company convinced Yelp to remove part of my original review.  The first visit from Aaron pools was a young man with a bad attitude that took my pool apart, then tried to leave my property with some of my parts.  He said he needed to go to the store to buy a new part and that he ""would be back in a few hours""  Why?  I am less than a half mile from a Leslies, an Ace Hardware, and a Home Depot.  He was just buying some PVC fittings.  So, I told him I couldn't wait  another  ""few hours"" for him.  he got snotty and rude, so I told him to put my pool back together.  I had already waited for him for hours.  I would still like to know why he was leaving with my plumbing-he couldn't figure out that he needed to buy some 1.5 inch PVC and a coupler?
The women that answer the phone there are also unbelievably rude-that made me wonder if this guy was one of their sons.
So, several fruitless phone calls, one ridiculous pool technician, and I got hung up on once.
If you have a good experience with Aaron Pools, I want to know your secret."
1,"The door was locked at 8:00??? We knocked and waited for the terribly rude girl at the cash register to open the door. Horrible, horrible absolutely horrible service.  Very poor food...french fries were rock hard.  Turkey had a very rubbery texture.  The tea was spoiled.  The ice cream was so soft.  The girl at the register did not speak to us she dropped our plates on the table and when we told of the bad tea she said ""oh well we are closed anyway"".  What a shame and an embarrassment for your establishment."
1,"I had eye surgery 1 year ago with a touch-up surgery 6 months ago.  I believe the Wellish folks are good competent people, but I believe the surgery was a very expensive mistake on my part.  Before the surgery without my glasses I could see up close but not at a distance.  Now I can see at a distance and not up close.  Before the surgery, I could see at all ranges with a set of glasses on. Now I am constantly flipping readers on and off just so I can look at my phone. The monovision path was supposed to help this and it just didn't  You don't realize how convenient glasses are until you cant put on a set to see all around you.  There were a couple of things that generally bothered me the most. The first is that I know that the industry counts me as a success when I am quite disappointed and should be added to the industry 1% of problems.  The other was that the visits where with very nice and good people who kept telling me my eyes were good, and everything was great, when I could not really see well in the first couple of feet.  There is nothing worse than someone telling you that you can see well when you cant.  My suggestion is, if you can see OK at all ranges with glasses on, don't do this because the only place your vision can go from good is down, and every time you look at your phone you just get frustrated that you spent thousands to be inconvenienced more than when you started.  Just be careful, and know that the low statistics for eye problems are not representative, and there is a much higher dissatisfaction rate that the stats don't count."
1,"Do NOT use this company!  They are so dishonest.  The guy that services my pool weekly (NOT from Aaron Pools) tells me when my pool equipment isn't working properly, so I can contact my warranty company and see if the repair will be covered.  When my pool tech told me a I needed a new dome lid, I contacted Old Republic and the representative informed me she didn't think it would be covered, but told me I should contact Aaron Pools and ask them.  So I contacted the office manager at Aaron Pools and asked her if a dome lid would be covered under my warranty.  She verified that it would not be covered, so I asked how much they would charge me if I had them come do it without involving the warranty company at all.  She quoted me ""between $130 and $150.""  I had received one other quote for $152, so I said, ""That sounds great"" to avoid an additional phone call.  I also asked her about monthly pool service and then scheduled the appointment.  When the Aaron Pools tech showed up the next day, he was an hour early, so I wasn't even home.  I hurried home and was more than surprised that he showed up without the part that he was supposed to be replacing.  He blamed the mishap on ""miscommunication"" and then left and got the part and later returned to install it.  After he completed the work, he said the cost was $150, but that he didn't have an invoice on him.  A few weeks later, I got an invoice in the mail for $150.  I called a few weeks later and paid it over the phone with a credit card.  Then a month later (so now two months after the service was completed), I got a bill from Old Republic saying I owe an additional $65 for the service fee.  I informed them it was a misunderstanding and that I already paid Aaron Pools directly what I owed them.  I held on the line while they called Aaron Pools and the office manager flat out LIED to them.  She told them she sent the tech to see what was wrong, that he figured out the part he needed and then returned to install it - claiming we owed $65 for the first visit and $150 for the second visit an hour later.  So then I told Old Republic that I would call and refresh her memory of our conversation that I remembered word for word.  The Aaron Pools office manager was very rude and defensive and told me I was wrong and that I owe the additional money.  I learned that what I thought was an honest mistake was actually INTENTIONAL!  Aaron Pools sent me an invoice and waited for me to pay i and then sent Old Republic an invoice for the same thing!  I have learned my lesson... DON'T trust anyone!  Get EVERYTHING in writing.  Sadly, people with integrity are few and far between these days."
1,"I have so many friends that love this chain, but I'm not a fan. I've eaten at different locations across different states, but always end up sick. I think that I must be allergic to a seasoning that they apply to everything. I've gotten sick from salad, pasta, to steaks. Needless to say, if a friend wants to eat dinner here, it's tea or water only for me."
1,"Worst service! Took forever to get drinks, asked for pancakes out first and never came.  Missing food several occasions, food was cold.  One of the items was a skillet and it was cold.  Asked for coffe three times before I got it filled once.  Eggs were improperly cooked.  Never received an apology and were asked to pay full price.  Never coming here again !"
1,"A rip off.  They actually called me up and scolded me for not cleaning my pool.  At one point they left a paper bag at the bottom of the pool for over three weeks.  We left it there to see how long it would take them to remove it and they never did.  New technicians all the time, only one was good.  Our pool never looked so bad as while they were servicing it.  Each tech had different things they did/did not do.  They back washed once a month to start then stopped doing it altogether.  Very dissatisfied."
1,"This is NOT Korean bbq. I got the $12.99 all you can eat night owl option on Friday night and ordered only the beef. The beef was seasoned very poorly, unlike the rich flavors one would expect from proper Korean bbq. As a Korean and a frequent consumer of Korean bbq, I fear that some people who may have never tried Korean bbq before would think this is actually proper Korean bbq.  The side dishes were either too salty, too oily, or not flavorful at all. Turns out the owner, staff, and chef are all not Korean, according to the waiter that served us. This would not be an issue if the food even marginally reminded one of Korean cuisine as the restaurant's name implies, but none of the food served to us did except the rice. If you are expecting Korean cuisine at KOREAN Grill House, you're in for an unpleasant surprise. Service was sub par. I would never go here again."
1,Average food. Was okay but have had much better Hawaiian food. This one is at least better than Aloha Kitchen. If I am ever in the area I would stop in and eat but I wouldn'tgo out of my way to come here.
1,"I don't know why we even try giving this restaurant 2nd, 3rd, 4th chances. They obviously don't know steak temperatures. Just sent back both of our steaks. I like mine medium well and my husband medium rare. But what do we get, burnt well done and ice cold rare. We then asked for the manager and she stood there trying to tell us that medium rare is suppose to be cold in the center. Seriously?! She is the manager? Wow. Never going back again."
1,"Drove so far to try this place with great reviews. Sadly, my Da Surf Rider plate was pretty disappointing."
1,"I requested a consult which requires supplying personal information.  No big deal. Until you cancel your appointment and the harassment begins.  I have cancelled my appointment several times-email and telephone. They continue to blow up my email and text. Each time I received a text or email I again cancelled my appointment.  I do Not recommend giving any information to this company unless you are absolutely sure you wish to see it through. 
I have not seen or spoken to a doctor. After this ordeal I will not reschedule."
1,"So after a long, long time, I decided to give this Denny's a second chance. BAD IDEA! The is is THE WORST Denny's in Arizona, right across the highway from the worst Jimmy John's in Arizona.  The service is very bad and the food is inedible. Denny's should fire the manager of this location immediately and clean house. I love going to Denny's in Tempe and Scottsdale. Why does this location have to be so awful?"
1,I bought a bottle of wine tonight. I just opened but didnt drink it. I felt so sad when the waitress didnt let me take that bottle home :(
1,"I just visited outback steakhouse tonight with my husband and two children.  This was one of the worst experiences we have ever had in a restaurant, and we eat out fairly often as a family.  The waiter completely forgot our appetizer.  It took a good 25 minutes for my daughter to get apple juice.  When the mains finally arrived, the waiter came by and asked how our appetizer was.  We said we never got it, and he said he had no idea what was going on in the back, and asked if we wanted it then.  We said no, but noted a few problems with our mains.  The BBQ chicken, was plain without the advertised BBQ sauce.  My daughter's parmesan pasta, had no parmesan, etc.  It took another 10 minutes to get the BBQ sauce and parmesan.  My son's steak was actually cooked the way he wanted, so that was in their favor.  My kids wanted milkshakes for dessert.  It took 20 minutes before they brought them, and they brought the wrong kinds.  Ultimately it took 45 minutes and a talk to the manager to get my son a milkshake.  Again, the waiter just said he didn't know what was going on in the kitchen.  We were not the only one with problems.  A man seated behind us had a cold steak and had to have it re-done.  A lady another table waited about 30 minutes for a glass of wine. The restaurant was not busy.  There were perhaps 6 tables with diners.  We will not go back.  We felt like telling people at the door to just leave.  2 hours, for a mediocre meal, and terrible service is not something I need to go through again.  Skip this one, and go to one of the many better restaurants around here."
1,"I came here soon after this store had opened...I've noticed that over time the owners/staff have been skimping on meat and noodles in their food. To be honest I love the staff, they have always been kind and provided prompt service...but I will no longer be a customer if this place due to the cheapness I have encountered."
1,"I'll keep it simple: long wait to order our food, burnt pancakes, and food that is not worth the amount of money they want you to pay. I feel like my skillet was just a frozen packet and they just heated it up on the grill. This is probably the last time I will stop into a Denny's."
1,"First, they cooked the steak as I asked - rare. Good job but it isn't hard to toss a hunk of meat on a grill. I cannot say that it was any better than what I would have served at home. The house salad was a disgrace. It looked like it was made a week in advance, wilted, the sorriest looking salad I have ever been served. It also tasted wilted. None of it was fresh or anywhere near fresh. The dressing wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to write home about either. The whole salad was a disgrace that should not have been served. My husband was served a similar sorry looking and sorry tasting salad. The service sucked, as usual, as this place is known for. The waitress smiled but after serving the food, we never saw her again. We never go here unless we are coerced by friends and the group wants steak or, once, we were given a gift certificate."
1,We were starving and it was the only reasonably priced place open at 9:30pm in Northern Scottsdale.  The brisket was edible and the sides were mediocre.
1,"I bought lunch for my team mates and called for pick up order. They tell me 15 mins wait but ended more like a 40 min wait. As we sat down in the Conference room to eat one of the orders were missing bananas (banana cream pancake) I mean it is the main ingredient. So I called to inform them and they asked if I was returning back to pick up the bananas so then I asked if they were going to double it. The lady says she has to ask her Manager then I told her ""ya you do that since I have to return for my bananas."" They also forgot tartar sauce for fish fry, ranch, ketchup and utensils..wth? We were already hangry from the start and then we go through this hassle. Although the Manager did ask me if it was enough bananas when I came back for it."
1,"I really want to like Aaron Pools. I've been with them for a long time but enough is enough. The quality of their cleaning and maintenance is shoddy and lazy in my opinion. I watched their techs stay for no more than 5 minutes. The bottom of my pool floor had visible dirt and the water was cloudy. There has been a lot of turnover in terms of their pool boys. With rare exception, most have been less than stellar. Their front office can be difficult to deal with. I can echo the experiences others have had with the manager and owner.  I cannot recommend them."
1,Food was terrible ! Service was worse . No wonder the restaurant was empty . It took 45 minutes to get our food .. Yet there were only 3 other tables being serviced. My steak was rare and well done all at the same time ?!? If that wasn't bad enough my side order of parmesan rice was nothing more than a thinly disguised scoop of rice a roni . We still have $15 left on a gift card that I'm more than happy to give away to anyone who wants it .
1,"I grew up in Texas.  I have eaten BBQ all over the country from CA - TX- KS-SC in the past 40 years.  This is no joke. This has to be the worst restraint and dirtiest that I have ever been to.  If you like fat brisket, low quality food and no air on a hundred degree day,  then you might like this garbage.  I really hope I don't get food poison tonight. Make the drive across town to Rudy's if you really want good barbecue or Bryan's in Cave Creek!"
1,"I've been to Hickory Tavern 3 times now.  All 3 times, during lunch.

1st time @ Mallard Creek - 2 people - build your own salad.  Impressive and thoughtful menu item.  Great options.  Kudos for this.  The cucumber wasabi dressing is amazing.

2nd time @ Harris - group of 8 - burger and fries.  Meh.  Pretty standard fare bar food.  At least the beer was cold.

3rd time (16SEP2014) @ Harris went something like this - 3 people.  11:15 - get seated by greeter, total of 5 customers in the restaurant.  11:20 - people around us are getting their drink and food orders taken, some of these people came in after us, we have not been greeted by a server.  11:30 - drinks and food start hitting tables around us.  11:35 - still not greeted by a server, so we stood up and left.  As we left, I made eye contact with the bartender, I'm sure anger and disappointment was over my face.  I don't have a shred of tolerance when it comes to being ignored in a restaurant.

I make it a rule to avoid places that disappoint me like the plague, poor service being the worst offense.  There are many options in Charlotte for places to have lunch, this one is off the table for me.  If you don't want to send a server to my table, you can't have my business."
1,"I would not consider Dickeys a BBQ spot for good food. There Brisket has no flavor and is cut on a machine instead of hand slice and not smoked or even well seasoned, if you are looking for good style BBQ this is not hte place. I have been all over this town looking for good BBQ, I know of a few but you have to travel to get there. Wish there was a good BBQ here in Scottsdale."

I was a guinea pig for a new device he was testing. My presurgical vision was -10.5 in the left eye and -8.5 in the right eye. I was just told by another surgeon last week that under today's standards, LASIK is not done on anyone whose vision is worse than -7.00. He over-corrected my eyes to +3.0. So now I'm severely farsighted, among other problems. He kept telling me that he's the guy that fixes other's botched LASIK, but neglected to say who could fix the ones he botched. The most offensive part was when I started working in the court system- he went from saying I was over-corrected to my eyes over-responded -so it was my eyes' fault, not his. Run- do not walk- to anybody else. He's too interested in pushing the limits and doesn't care about the outcome. And he really worries about getting sued, which I wish I'd done."
1,Chef Bens has the worst customer service ever. I tried to place an order for delivery and they told me to use grubhub which I had already tried and grubhub said they were closed. So they transferred me to grub hub where I sat on hold for 17 minutes. Then got hung up on. Grub hub called me back and said they had problems with their website and to download the app. Chef Bens would not grab a pen and paper and take down my order and just assist a regular customer that orders from my work place all the time. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone nor will I ever order from them again.
1,"Food is great as always but my whole family told them 3 times we are here to celebrate a birthday and it got ignored. A Happy Birthday would have been nice as you only get to choose 1 place for your birthday! we even opened presents as they cleared the table and....nothing!  So go there for the food but don't do any celebrations at this locations. Go to their Toronto location, much better service!"
1,"It took ten minutes to just get a water and Coke. Patiently waiting, the manager Erin was arguing with his employees in the back. ""BAM!"" My heart skipped a beat. My friend ducked in fear. Erin had punched the wall.. I noticed how stressed out he was so I just shook it off and let it slide. But then, within minutes, the yelling started again in the kitchen and ""BAM!"" Erin punched the wall again. Erin had the audacity to come and apologize for the slow time but I'll never forget the striking sound and the pain the wall had to go through. It was a very uncomfortable experience. Very unprofessional for a manager."
1,I have been to many Denny's and this location particularly has poor customer service and long wait time for your orders. Not sure what happen to them... probably will never come back to this location.
1,"we have gone to this restaurant several times and always enjoyed it. however, we called a hamburger order in-picked it up. four days later we receive an alert from our credit card company questioning us of a large tip applied to the amount. NOPE we didn't leave a tip cause it was a pickup. we looked over our receipt. after 2 phone calls we were told this sometimes happens and we needed to give them our credit card info so they can refund us the amount. i'm sorry but the tip was more than the hamburger and all I get is oh sometimes this happens! well they have now lost us as customers and our family of 6 that we would take there. ""SOMETIMES THIS HAPPENS!""??????????? what is up with that? Beware it could happen to you!"
1,"Consistently terrible service (even for a Denny's) at this location. I hadn't been for years because I have always had such awful service here, but after a winning streak at several surrounding Denny's, I thought I'd give ""the bad Denny's"" a try again.

Bad mistake. We left before even ordering food and I won't be back again. Went across the street to Olive Garden, which really knows how to elevate mediocre food with excellent service.

If you hate food, enjoy depressing scenes of humanity and waiting endlessly for service that doesn't arrive, this is the Denny's of your dreams.

All snotty snark aside, the server was very genuinely apologetic for the bad service. I actually felt bad for her. Just not bad enough to waste sixty dollars on awful food.

Nice try, Denny's."
1,"Extremely poor customer service.  Aaron was sent by home warranty co to repair our spa.  They showed up unexpectedly without scheduling.  Woman answering phone in office was apathetic and then defensive and extremely rude (she hung up on us!).  Technician was condescending and curt, and was not interested in helping or answering questions.  When we lodged a complaint with our home warranty company, Aaron said they refused to return because things were thrown at the technician and profanities were screamed at the secretary (all absolute lies).  Unless you enjoy incompetence, lies and aggravation, avoid this place at all costs!"
1,"This place is an abomination.  I have never experienced such shitty service before my meal tonight. I went for a good friend's birthday meal,  and he is an avid Korean BBQ fan. This was by far his worst experience; the meat was fatty and flaky and fell apart by itself,  the waiters were very snobbish and rude and included the tip automatically,  and they gave us only 1 grill plate for a group of 5. It was very cramped and very frustrating. It looks like I'll have to go elsewhere for my Korean BBQ y'all fuckbois"
1,"If you don't mind waiting 2-3 hours to see the doctor for your appointment, then this is the place for you. I read on here that people had issues with wait times but thought they were an exaggeration; they weren't. Each appointment at this office I have taken my grandmother to we have to wait 2-2.5 hours and sometimes 3 hours to see the doctor. When we do see the doctor, he only spends 10 minutes with us!! That's it, 10 minutes!! Come the heck on! What is this, a professional cattle herding company?? I can find great doctors for the same procedures, spend time with their patients, understand that other people's time is just as important as their own and understand a thing or two about customer service. Please find another office to get your eye services done."
1,"Yesterday stopped on the way back from going to the casino at 10:30pm. They were closing and denied us service. It was a Saturday night at 10:30...? There is no way this place is going to stay in business long if they are not open on weekends past 11pm. Be warned , do not plan on going here late at night. All of there customers must be old people that go to bed before 8."
1,Really wish I could give 0 or negative stars.  The food was a 2.  Nothing you couldn't get anywhere and nothing special.  Bland.  We had wings and tacos.  Maybe I expect more from tacos and wings.  The service was a 3 friendly for the first part and downright rude for the ending.  My party was treated very badly when we had a simple opinion.  I travel all over the country and have eaten in every state except Alaska and I will never set foot in this place again.
1,"Horrible food. I usually love Outback, but this location is horrible. I ordered the steak and lobster. Lobster was way over cooked and my steak tasted like a cheap Walmart steak. It was hard to swallow, that's how bad it tasted. Then our waitress broke my debit card while away and didn't even mention it. I found out when she returned my card and walked away."
1,Was there tonight. Second time in a few months. absolutely awful prime rib. Very tough and no flavor. Ordered medium rare which it appeared to be. Side salad and baked potato were good. Very slow service. Previous time here was also bad. Had rib eye steak then. Will not ever be returning here. Seems like outback has really downgraded the quality of their steaks. Used to be much better.
1,"Went there Sunday Nite . The tables are so close together,they never used to be so close.All the staff were squessing between our table which was very annoying . The food tasted great although we were both sick the next day . We had different meals ,so go figure .The seats are uncomfortable . If u want a romantic setting ,forget it .Not a place for an intimate dinner and very loud .An honest review"
1,"What can I say? Worst service ever. Waited over an hr and a half for service, the guy in the front was very rude when we asked for an update , and then food took another hour, food tasted good but the overall evening left a sour taste in my mouth. Never coming back."
1,Sizzling chicken plate filled with cartilage and tiny bones ... not mentioned on the menu!
1,"They service the pool in the house we lease.  They replaced a previous, incompetent, pool company.  They originally came out to do warranty work on the pump, and they talked themselves up so much we hired them to do our weekly maintenance.  I now know it was ALL talk.  They are very inconsistent in their service.  This is the second time now that we can't even use the pool because it's all messed up!  And then they don't show up to make the repairs.  Horrible!"
1,"Food:
Soup was cold and had to be warmed up again.
Victoria's filet med well was flavorless and on the dry side . I'm not even sure if it was a filet cut because all of the filets I've eaten have been thick.  I've had sirloins thicker than what I got today. It looked nothing like the filets on their pictures. Hardly tender.
The mac and cheese was so dried out. There was literally no sauce on the bottom of the bowel. It was horrible
The cheesecake was flavorless.

My co worker found a hair in her steak. They offered to make another one but we didn't have time so they gave her a gift card for $20 to come back and took her steak off the bill, just her steak though not her whole meal. 

The waitress was spaced out. Slow on the refills. No personality. Almost standoffish."
1,"I don't normally write review. But I was extremely upset for the services of this restaurant.  I went here for lunch on Sunday, there was an older man serving us.  We have some guests over from oversea and we highly suggested them to come to this restaurant for some great Italian food.  The waiter asked us if we want hot or cold water, so we asked for few glasses of each hot and cold water.  After all, my guest changed her mind, and would like an extra cup of hot water.  I could not believe, the waiter said, ""I know it, Asian people always change their mind.  Did I just ask you how many cups of hot/cold water you want?""   I was not expecting such service in such a nice restaurant.  When we order food, I told the waiter, we will share the plate so that everyone can try different pizzas and pastas.  Out of my expectation again, he said, "" I know, Asian have to share food""   Seriously, it looked very embarrassing in front of my guests from oversea. The food was great, but just could not make up for the poor services.  The waiter was being very racism.
I will not return to this location because of the poor service we received.  I feel this restaurant does not welcome Asian people at all.   Management might want to look into better training for their staffs for larger parties or keep this guy away from them altogether."
1,"Save your money and time. Overpriced gross food. You'll need about a gallon of water after eating here. Not sure if it's too much soy sauce, salt, MSG, or what... But it is not pleasant. They have the worst miso soup I've ever tasted. Steer clear of this place."
1,"We have always loved the steaks at Outback.   So my husband planned a birthday dinner for me  with five of our friends.  What a disaster.   First we were shown to our table which wasn't set up, missing  chairs.  Waiter came took orders, served us bread, 2 loaves and three plates for seven people.  Then when the steaks were brought out, not everyone received their dinner.  And if they were lucky enough to get dinner, the meals all had missing items, vegetables etc.  My husbands prime rib looked like a hockey puck, ordered med well.  Our last friend finally received his order after the manager stopped by the table.  This was after all others  were mostly finished.  Manager did take 15 percent of our bill.  But will not go back to this Outback.  Horrible food and service."
1,Really not worth 5 star at all....I ordered the da furfer rider...the meat is super super super salty. ...I told the worker the meat is so salty...he just told me that is with soy sauce. ...I do not care what is in the meat....it just too salty to eat...I left over all the meat in dish.....I love aloha kitchen better....
1,"You guys are terrible. I requested service to fix a leak last Thursday, you guys came out on Monday, supposedly made repairs. Still leaked, came out Tuesday send made repairs, still leaked. And when I called back, they said that they could not come back into next Tuesday! Couldn't even bump me up to the top of the list. No apologies or nothing.

Spoke to the manager Mike and he was very condescending and was even cussing when I requested to be bumped to an earlier appointment since they are not able to fix my problem after coming out twice. ""You want me to tell the rest of my customers to f*ck off?"" He says. Well I am a customer and guess what you are telling me to do?

What shitty service. You best believe that my warranty will hear about this."
1,"Terrible service!  Last 2 times the waitress disappears and never returns, no drinks, food order was wrong and we had to get the manager to stop and fix it and then we have to chase them down to pay the bill."
1,"Home warranty company has sent them out multiple times to replace my booster pump. Each time they write down parts numbers, but my booster pump has not been replaced or even repaired. Job is marked in their system as complete. What a joke.

UPDATE: Aaron Pools has called twice within the past 24 hours to ask my husband to make me take down this review. Somehow the person on the phone managed to deliver even worse customer service than the rude technician who came to my house."
1,"Came in for a late breakfast around 10.30 and there's only 1 cashier/waitress in the entire restaurant.
Way to go Dennys, Great management!"
1,Took almost an hour for our food to come out (only 2 adults and 2 children so not a huge order). Waiter was ok until after we got our food then never came around after that. We had to flag down another waiter to get to go boxes and our check. We were there a total of 2 1/2 hours. Never returning to this location ever again.
1,"Absolutely the WORST customer service and LEAST professional business I've ever dealt with. Run the other way and spend your money elsewhere!!!!!!!!!

They installed a pool light at my home and it shattered less than 10 months later. When I called them to see if it was still under warranty, they advised that it was under warranty by the product manufacturer and gave me the name and number of the manufacturer to contact them. Very helpful.

I called the manufacturer and they agreed to replace the light. When the company they had contracted to install it for me came out, they said that it wasn't even the correct brand of pool light. So, I had spent weeks working with the wrong manufacturer because of information provide by AARON POOLS - THE COMPANY THAT INSTALLED IT TO BEGIN WITH. I had to pay a service trip fee to the company that came out, which was money out of my pocket due to the incorrect information provided by AARON POOLS.

I contacted Aaron Pools to let them know about the error. The two people I spoke with - one person who worked in the office and another a manager - both got immediately defensive and started questioning my story, as if they didn't believe me. The manager, Mike, told me that there is no way they would even know what brand of light they installed??? How is that even possible? Do they not keep records? Even so, if that WAS the case, someone from their office confidently advised me on what brand of light it was and how to contact that manufacturer. And she never ONCE said that she wasn't sure if it was the correct information. 

At the VERY least, I deserved an apology for getting incorrect information from an employee of the company. I have NEVER felt so disrespected or unappreciated as a customer. I have no idea how this company stays in business."
1,"Crappy customer service, food takes forever and staff is rude, messy and unprofessional. Save your money!!! Our table was Dirty and wet, we waited 30mins for food to come out and 50 additional mins for a banana split, before leaving. ""Dylan"" the waiter got pissed we decided to leave after 50mins of waiting  and stated ""We'll We're busy here, you're not the only ones!"" Apparently multitasking, paying attention to detail and providing  customer service is too large of a task.  Hmm.. he's going far in life. I will not return. Dennys you and your staff are getting classy, missing teeth, wrinkled clothes, and attitudes... hmm every drop outs dream job!!"
1,"The food here is mediocre compared to other places in the area. Since this place is open 24/7, it probably explains why the food isn't as fresh. My tabletop cooking meat came out frozen with some pieces stuck together. The green peppers looked dried out as though it's been cut and sat outside for a long time. However, it's cheap and the prices on the menu includes tax. On the other hand, their service is horrible and I chose to reflect that in the tip. I am not a difficult customer. I will gladly leave a tip if you seat me, and take my order correctly. Somehow, the waitress was able to mess that up. I paid at the register and the cashier had the audacity to come up to me before I left to ask.. ""Tip?"" 

This place is recommended to those who want a cheap late night meal where they won't mind the servers telling them how much to tip."
1,"My wife and I came in tonight. We asked to be reseated to another booth so we could have more room for our 7 month old. The next thing we know, the ""hostess"" a 6'3"" 65 year old Yak named ""Tracy"" was mean mugging both my wife and I. 
We wrote it off like maybe she was having a bad day...however, each time this beast walked past our table she would give us a nasty death scowl as though we had intruded upon her territory and had challenged her to a dual. I hardly ever write yelp reviews however this encounter with Tracy the Outback Beast had to be accounted for. 

Note- The waiter Jeff was awesome and was very accommodating."
1,"We opted for this restaurant because other restaurants in the area were full, and there were no cars outside the restaurant.  We were seated promptly, and the waiter promptly came to our table dancing a little jig.(Odd) When I quizzically looked at him, he said that the little dance was fun for him and the customers. (Maybe for him)
Our drinks were served in dinghy looking glasses that should have been an omen of what this dining experience was going to be like.
I ordered the salmon with cheesy mashed potatoes, sweet corn, and garlic bread.  The food took forever to cook (They probably had to wake up the cook) and when it was finally served the salmon was a dried up gray piece of shoe leather.  When I complained, the waiter brought back some garlic butter as the solution.  Suffice it say that the meal was so bad that the corn was the best part.
But this dining experience got better.  When paying the bill, the cashier asked if I wanted leave a tip.  I indicated 15% out of common courtesy. When I got the receipt I noticed that the tip was $4.50 on a $21.00 bill. I confronted the cashier who shrugged and said his math must be bad, and gave me a dollar back. It was the perfect end to a way less than perfect dining experience."
1,"Honestly, I've been coming here for the past couple of weeks with my friends and it is by far the worst service I have ever received in all my life. They never bring the portions you ask for. Rude, unfriendly and act like they don't see you. Seated a table of 6 at one grill they seated other parties of 6 at 3 grills. They discriminate against certain races, very unpleasant and rude. Can't believe they're still in business.  Made a yelp account just to warn people of this place."
1,"The doctor there was great, I had the lipoflow procedure. They gave a free sample of the eye drops suppose to take twice a day for five days. The drops were gone in two days. Called the office the morning of the third day to let them know I needed to pickup a prescription and leaving the country the next morning for two weeks. Went by pharmacy at 3:30and no prescription so called again. They had no note that I was leaving the next morning and had not called in yet. Once I notified them after being on hold for 15 minutes the very nice person said they would let them know. Went back to pharmacy at 5:30and oh nice out of stock for the drops they ordered so I'm leaving without taking another three days worth.

Work can be good but only if follow up is there for service. I so done after spending 1,000 on the procedure.

C"
1,"Placed order online and when I got home did not receive the ham from lumberjack breakfast, called store and was told by female employee that I can get refunded but have to wait for manager to come in.  An hour goes by and no call, so I called up and spoke to Hector who is the manager on duty, he says he cant refund will need to wait for general manager, waited 2 more hours still no call.  Finally received call from Operator of this Denny's location named Alfredo, all he did was laugh and made a mockery of me for this situation, he says he will refund  so lets see what happens.  Worst experience ever from hostess all the way up to Operator of the store.  This store deserves no stars."
1,I would have to agree with the rest of the reviews on here. Aaron pools came out and said my  motor was covered in leaves and that is what caused the motor to heat up and shut down. There were no leaves around the pool pump and one week later the same problem occurred and they told me it would be a week before they could come back out. I understand that home warranty companies hire the cheapest and by the looks of it the worst companies they can find so I am not surprised and i will be canceling my home warranty and will not have Aaron Pools back to my house.
1,After trying to order on Yelp and being told I'm to far (5 miles) I called and was told to try the website I am not to far. So after placing $64.00 worth of food in a cart I enter my card # and nope to far. I call back and ask why they can't take my card and order. She said the bank won't allow them to take a card over the phone. I actually am a Senior Account Executive and sign up 20+ new customers a month for Merchant Accounts. If this were my business I would not lose $60 orders because of poor service from another company. Email me if you want to double your profit otherwise I'll spend my money elsewhere!
1,"it's dennys, long wait for food, lackluster service and a hair in the eggs that tasted like vinegar make this a visit that I hope we will all soon forget. It made me feel cheap and dirty, like I needed a shower after having ate a turkey burger with a stale bun. =-("
1,My husband and I ordered prime rib it was terrible. The meat was so hard to cut and no taste to it. Blackberry martini was good.
1,"Not sure what's happened to this place lately. Service has gone down the drain. I have noticed it over my last few visits; the staff seems to be busy tending to other chores and neglecting their customers. During my last visit I sat down and a waitress brought me some tea and a menu. I waited for 10 minutes for someone to come and take my order but nothing. Then a couple walks in and sit down. At this point I have been waiting with consideration and thinking... well.. they must be busy and will be coming over soon. But when I see the couple getting side dishes and being served their food I just got up and left. I think that some bussines owners should be reminded that the reason of their existence is us, the customers. Without customers there is no business, no profits, no jobs. I will be trying the many other Korean restaurants alternatives around the neighborhood for the next little while. I hope that the customer service improves in this restaurant soon."
1,"I love this company, but this location is awful. The lady at the counter was rude. I came to this store a couple weeks ago and brushed the bad service off. I thought she must be having a bad day. But I came in again with my family and she acted as if we were disturbing her. I went to the location on horizon and it was a huge difference. I will be giving that one 5 stars. They also didn't have any bread ready. I'm not sure if she's a manager but I won't be going into this location again specifically because of the service we received from her. The other girl with her was very pleasant and I feel bad that she has to work with such a miserable person."
1,"My husband and I ate here yesterday and both were told how wonderful the fish sandwich was. So we ordered it. First the fries that came along with sandwich were limp and greasy. It is pretty hard to mess up fries but they did. The fish was a glorified frozen fish stick with breading looks like a very large chicken McNugget. It was served on what looked like a yummy French baguette. It wasn't. It was bland, tasteless and rubbery. We asked for the Catawba sauce (mayo and siracha) which turned out to be the only good tasting thing we ordered. Don't order the fish sandwich no matter what anyone says, unless you like fish McNugget sandwiches.  $42.00 for two fish sandwiches and fries that we did not finish or take home, 1 beer that my husband didn't finish drinking, water for me, fried pickles (tasted good not didn't like the breading).  Overall not good food and not worth the price.  Save your money and go somewhere else."
1,"Dickey's catered our sister's surprise birthday party, and boy to our surprise they're serving portions were for 6 yrs. We paid over seven hundred dollars to feed 55 people, which 4 were children. We were lucky that all our guests didn't show up, because we were out of food with only feeding 45. Like I said , the 4 children were included in the 45. For the meat a serving size is 4 oz. I thought a person on a diet got to eat 4 oz. of meat. NOT INPRESSED AT ALL."
1,"This is the worst Korean bbq I had ever in my past 21years. Spend 50 dollars for two, not a single veggie could be provided for all you can eat. Only a few choices of meet. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I got diarrhea just after 5 mins out of this restaurant. I haven't got any diarrhea for more than two years. Now I am not only hungry buy also upset about the food I had."
1,"I've never given a review based on service before...but after being yelled at by the staff here on multiple occasions, I need to voice out. I usually come here with friends because of the favourable location, but we've been...
-chased after to tip more
-told to be quiet rudely by the owner
-yelled at to order faster
-been pushed aside while we were lining up

While I don't expect 5 star service, I think it's common courtesy to use an indoor voice when speaking to customers and exercise basic manners."
1,"Aaron pools came to fix a home warranty repair on my pool.  The service tech tried to sell me something not needed and then finished the job poorly after 2 weeks of waiting.  No pressure gauge on filter they replaced, no access to empty my sand from my filter without a saw.

They took short cuts where they could and took the $250 paid by the warranty company (he told me what he was paid) and spent about 20 dollars of his time and less in parts to do what he called ""the minimum amount required"", but not as much as should have.  Poor customer service and they look to do things as cheaply as possible,  be careful.  There are better Ahwatukee pool companies."
1,Terrible service. A tech came out 3 times to fix a leak and low pressure in the filter. Each time I had to call the office to figure out what the techs did and kept telling them the leak was worse than before. Now the filter isn't working at all anymore and I had to sit on the phone with my home warrenty company to request another pool service company come out and repair their fuck ups. I would avoid this company at all costs.
1,"Does NOT even deserve ONE STAR!

I went to this location for my 30 minute lunch break. Pull up to the drive through and sat at the intercom saying ""hello, hello"" for five minutes. After trying to remain patient I decided to pull up to the window. There was a car sitting in front of me (they must have a lot of patience) and I never was shown any service. After waiting for another 10 minutes behind the car in front of me, I drove off.

After driving off, and not eating since at this point I would not have time to go anywhere else and be able to eat before going back to work, I called this location and asked them if their business was even open. The employee told me their drive thru intercom is not working properly and when I asked to speak with the manager, she told me that they are EXTREMELY busy. 

I have never been through a drive-thru and not be immediately helped, isn't that what they are for?"
1,Terrible service. We've been using Aaron pools for several months and our pool is infested with Algae and is super filthy. Went out to check the chlorine tablets and it was completely empty. I thought the point of having a pool cleaning service was to actually clean your pool. We tried to call them to fix this and they just kept skipping appointments and brushed us off. Called a new company and they were out the same day and we now have a clean pool!
1,"Our warranty company sent out Aaron pools to do work on our pool filter on a house that we were in the process of selling. The repair man came while the buyers were at the property with their realtor. We told him that an email was sent to Aaron pools from the warranty co authorizing and outlining the work do be done. He said he never received any email from the warranty co...and started arguing with the buyers realtor which was the most unprofessional behavior imaginable. He stormed out of the house with the realtor following him and she said sorry that you didn't receive the email I know we had sent it, and as he was starting his truck she saw printed email on his clipboard on the seat ... He said oh yea it's right here ...and left ..didn't do any work. And they are trying to charge a 75$ service fee. The next day his office called telling us we owe 75$ and she was just as rude and unprofessional as he was . Terrible customer service ... Wouldn't use them ever."
1,They have an entertainment book advertisement in the window but they won't accept the entertainment book coupon itself...What gives?
1,"If I could give 0 stars I would.... 
The food was good... The customer service was HORRIBLE!!!!! The manager is such an asshole. I am a vegetarian and I ordered a pasta without chicken and he refused to adjust my bill. When he came to my table... He had the balls to tell me that if he customized it and did everything separate it would cost more. How does a pasta without chicken cost more?? This is the first time ever that a manager has not adjusted my bill. And it says right at the bottom of their menu that they accommodate. I will never go back!"
1,"I ordered sushi last night, I got horrendous food poisoning.  I have eaten sushi for 15 years and this is the first time I became violently ill.  I became horribly sick within the hour. The cramps were excruciating. The other food is ok, but the sushi is so sub-standard even in taste, I am amazed they can keep their doors open."
1,"Coming in to enjoy a leisure lunch with my wife and left completely disappointed.  We ordered the gumbo only to have the server explain to us that the kitchen guys said they were not making gumbo today. Ordered the Monte Cristo and clearly asked ""does this come with fries"" told yes. Sandwich comes out with fruit. When I ask the server where are my fries she replies ""oh you wanted some fries"". She then brings out the fries and CHARGES me for her mistake. My wife had the chicken quesadillas. Not a great selection at all. Not a lot of flavor. Just cheese and chicken. When it was time for our bill, we alerted the server to the issue with the fries and she acted totally clueless. We thought we may have found a diamond in midtown Charlotte but what we found was a cubic zirconium. If you are looking for great New Orleans style food, DON'T eat at the French Quarter, eat somewhere else."
1,"Starting to go downhill, the Prime Rib is always good and you couldn't beat the steak for the price, but this last visit or two was spotty, but last was terrible. I get the usual Prime Rib (med), wife the Sirloin (med)& Crab. 25 mins later still no food, FINALLY it gets there, it was sitting in the back for sure, could tell be the temp. My prime Rib was terrible, tough, dry, overcooked, her steak was like a hunk of fat, 1/2 was a total waste and NO CRAB! Crab came out 10 minutes later and when it did, there was no cracker for the shell, they told us they ran out! Finally get one 5 minutes later, but still no seafood fork to remove the meat from inside! We had enough, got the manager, they took all the food back and got me a new Prime Rib, her a new steak. My 2nd one was just as bad, and my wife's steak was raw.. The manager gave us two $20 Gift Cards which we're going to try to use tonight. If it sucks tonight I will contact corporate. If you sort the reviews by ""date"" you'll notice a trend here, somethings changed here in the past couple of months for the worse, Here's hoping the best!"
1,"Runny eggs and when I sent them back they were still runny eggs. The t-bone steak was 70% fat and I showed the waitress and she didn't care at all. It was the worst cut of meat I've ever had. If you HAVE to eat there get the ham steak you will always get a good cut that way. The coffee was cold and I had to asked for more then one creamer and she brought back a cup with on creamer in it. This screams of management cutting back on everything or the wait staff just hate the customers. Perhaps its a little of both I don't know. 

Never again will I go into a Dennys."
1,"These people are straight up fraudsters.  They replied to the AG by sending a doctored quote, this time adding $76 for ""freight"", deducting the $65 they claim was never a security deposit, and then writing in a balance due of $11.  This is crazy.  Please beware of these people."
1,"i have been here several times and usually order the turkey by the pound, which is very good. Thought i would try the brisket, i have tried the brisket a couple of times and both times it was bland and boring. I always thought bbq brisket should be cooked slow roasted with amazing flavors, not at dickeys, reminds me of deli brisket. There is no char to the meat and no seasoning,  Wish there was a truly good bbq place here"
1,"Absolutely disgusting.  Sorry, but I'm being honest.  I love sushi.  Rolls...sashimi...etc etc and here, it was as if I got sushi out of a vending machine.  It's hard to mess up a spicy tuna roll.  I took one bite and pretty much had to spit it out.  

Maybe the ""food"" is good there, but I will NEVER go there for sushi.  

The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  However, I wish the place that used to be in this location was still there. 

Again, sushi out of a vending machine.  Ick."
1,"Deceptive business people.  We were told the $65 service fee on initial call was toward the repair should we want it done.  Then we were billed the full amount.  Our involve clearly lists this as a security deposit, but they charged us the full $600.  They would not listen to any discussion on the billing practice. 
   The worst part for me is the attitude of the manager.  She truly doesn't care that this complaint will be elevated to the BBB and Attorney General.  They don't care if the people they service feel cheated. The work they did seems fine, they were on time, I see why some people review them positively.  I had one good experience prior to this one and had meant to review then positively prior to my discussion over the bill today. It's all dandy if you get the results and charges you expect, but if there is a disagreement, they simply won't listen to you.  Go elsewhere for your repairs if you prefer dealing with honest people."
1,"I have a few issues with tonights meal. First I wish on sat night when I'm taking out the girl, they would get it right. Also this particular outback has consistently been terrible. I honest love outback and the manager was nice about things and comped the meal. But I didn't get the impression they are going to fix the issues. Or even capible of fixing things. Service was slow. Not terrible just subpare to start with. Salad had almost no dressing.  Soda was very good and bread was fresh. The baked patato was obviously in a steamer for at least four hours. That's just wrong. Can I please have a fresh one with my steak. The crab was the worst I have ever eatten.  The crab was dried out. My steak was so dry I almost chocked on it. I had beef jerky that was more tender. My girlfriend ordered her steak med well and it came out rare. This is the problem. We finally chased down the server who was not good about checking on the food and he had it cooked properly.  You got a second chance do it right?  No it tasted like they cleaned the grill with grill cleaner and scrapped all the old junk off the grill and then recooked it on there. That's just wrong. I felt like it was my fault for not ordering a rare steak.  Seriously I'm not sure how they could have made the meal any worse.  Shame on you."
1,I have tried most of the steakhouses in the area and by far this one is the worst. I had the NY  strip. It looked good when it came out but when I cut into it looked like the cow was just killed. I almost threw up. The waiter was nice but very slow. He apologized but it was not his fault the quality was crap. Don't waste your time or money
1,"I don't usually give 1 star reviews to burgers. I love my burgers and if you've read any of my other reviews, you'd know that....
We decided to go here for lunch because I revived a coupon in an email. you can't go wrong with a $6.99 burger!! Well as always we were ready to order pretty quickly when the waiter came to our table. We ordered a blooming onion and we also ordered the burger to share like always (portion control and no left overs). We ordered the burger with cheddar cheese and no tomato. The waiter even double checked a few minutes later to make sure he placed the order with the right cheese. He was very nice to start off and quick with the service.
When we got the blooming onion, I had mentioned to my husband that it tasted burnt. He though maybe it was just their time to change the oil. We ate around the onion hoping to find some better parts, but it mostly all tasted burt. Just to make sure the business was aware (I'm sure they don't taste every item they serve) I wanted to let the waiter know that it either was burnt or they should test the oil to see if they need to change it. He gave a hasty sorry then went to the back. 
Then we go our burger. We didn't ask them to, but they were nice enough to even cut the burger in half and put it and the fries on two separate plate! I took the top bun off to add some salt and pepper and noticed there was no cheese on the burger at all, and there was a big juicy tomato on the burger.... My husband has NEVER been one to complain about his food at a restaurant. ""you eat what you're given"".... I believe that if you order something a specific way, and you're paying extra for cheese, It should come the way you order it. Not wanting to upset my husband, we began to eat. The waiter came around asking how it was, and at that point, I let him know that there was no cheese and he had saw the tomato picked off on the side of my plate.  He had offered to take it back and remake it, but I always get nervous about restaurants remaking food.... I have see the movie Waiting too many times to feel comfortable doing that.
I wasn't expecting money to be off my bill, but I was expecting a big apology and a thanks for the heads up that the cooks were not doing their jobs properly.... I didn't get any of the above... 
I am so utterly disappointed with the service and food quality we received. Outback is one.... WAS one of my favorite restaurants. I don't think we will be going back. At least never to this one again."
1,Wow bad customer service on front line . Horrible     Need to have your first person be a lot more professional can't understand her voice and asking to repeat rude.  Canceled after several attempts to get them at my house called Warenty company and asked them to look at all reviews .  DO NOT Waist your time and money with the company.
1,"5 thumbs down for this Hictory Tavern location!!!! First of all the waitress was rude to  the customers. She was loud and argumentative with some guys standing next to me. Secondly, my food was not cooked properly and I ""thought"" the waitress was bringing  back a whole new entree.  Nope..she returned my same ""picked over"" burger back to me fully cooked. ( Major food violation) Finally you would think the store manager  ( Tom Blake)  would be trained to handle any/all store issues right? Sad to say.. Tom's way of dealing with a overcrowded restaurant is to call the police and LIE by saying... folks are  causing trouble  and refusing to leave the restaurant. ( Not true!) I sat at my table and watched the whole incident. Those guys was not causing trouble nor refusing to leave! Anyways, I can go on and on about how awful this location treats customers! Honestly, I almost thought the staff was drunk that night! Because I have NEVER seen this type of behavior/crazyness from a restaurant."
1,"My husband and I have been here a number of times and have always had a pleasant experience. Tonight I ordered the grilled salmon with mixed veggies. The plate came with just the salmon. We inquired and the waiter went back to get some. He came out empty handed and said the owner told him no. Then the table across the aisle asked the same question. At that point I retrieved a menu and showed the waiter. He agreed but said he was getting screamed at in the back but would send his manager over. She never showed, we paid and left. Not sure what to make of that..."
1,"I order the sama BBQ beef that i always order last time. They only give me like half of the meat as usual. I do complain about it, and the girl just put the beef in chair n ignore me. And i ask again, she keep ignore me. WON'T COME AGAIN"
1,"We went there last night service incredibly slow , some food items never showed up or showed up after we had eaten most of the main entree. They weren't even busy. The food was mediocre. They have work to do if they hope to stay in business."
1,"Poor attempt at Korean BBQ!!!

Maybe it's not fair to compare this to any bbq places I'd visited in S. Korea, but it was so far off, it was so bad.

The Marinade used on the meat tasted more Chinese than Korean, and the same marinade was used on all of the different kinds of meat.

No panchan, lettuce, sesame oil salt, raw garlic, daenjang, etc.
Kimchi and rice extra? I've been to bbq places where they don't serve rice (Korean food are extremely balanced) but always some fresh lettuce to wrap the meat and kimchi!
That was the dead giveaway. Then we saw the cut, tasted the meat, and it was Game Over."
1,"Tech sent had to come back and fix his work. Both times the same tech was a total schmuck to my wife. condescending, not very good at quality... mostly if they replaced the dirtbag late 80's ex rocker for a tech, i could deal with the work. But until they get rid of the singular tech that is running their company into the ground, their review will not improve. 

After investing thousands with this company, i would never return to them again. Lesson = learned."
1,"Well, according to my doctor, the second degree burn I sustained at the spa couple of weeks ago is starting to heal. Comparing photos from right after the event until now, things are objectively better even in my eyes. While there, I slipped on some water in the sauna area and brought my right wrist down on the heated grill of stones. I notified the manager and requested some burn ointment (after she stared at me confused about the next step) which I was given but aside from a mildly solicitous ""may I get you anything else"" nothing done for me at the spa. I have requested burn ointment at least four more times.  I didn't want to make a scene because I was there for a girlfriend's event but my arm hurt like hell. I wasn't able to have the full manicure experience as the paraffin was too hot for my wrist, and again, the manager nor anyone at the spa seem to care.   Only my manicurist.  Forget about offering a discount or adjusting any of my services to accommodate my injury, just pretend to care.  I'm not one to make a fuss, and again, I didn't want to ruin my girlfriend's event- but this was one of the most horrible experiences I've ever had in my life and I was really mad that the manager didn't give a damn. I have been a long time patron of Elizabeth Arden spas in Chicago and I'm deeply disappointed in Elizabeth Arden for the way I was treated at their Phoenix spa."
1,"el peor y nada profesional que vi en mis 64 años, lo tratan tan mal a los pacientes y cobran por lo que no hacen y por lo que se equivocan también, nunca más voy a este Wallish deberían quitarle su título para que no pueda atender ni hacer más daño a la gente."
1,"My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to the 3 course meal for $25 last night. You get to pick an appetizer,  a side, a main course, and you get a house salad included. First came the table bread. It was the most common, cheap, and cold bread you could amagine. 25 minutes later came a tiny house salad composed of diced iceberg. The appetizer; a cold half potato with what was supposed to be chicken inside. If there wad I didn't see or taste it. The main course was surprisingly very tasty and the portion size was healthy. For the side you get 4 choices.  3 of them are corn. We are both not fans of corn so we chose the baked potato with sour cream and chives. When we recieved our main course there was a piece of a dry potato and an ear of corn. I was confused.  I asked the gentleman who brought the food out who was not our waiter why we got corn when we asked for a potato with sour cream and chives.  All he could say was ' hot plate' over and over. Since it seemed English was not his first language he had our waiter come over.  Without apologizing he told us that he would bring over the sour cream.  The other man showed up with one small portion for the both of us.  When we had finished and needed a togo box I tried to waive the waiter down with no luck.  On the fourth time of him being in sight he was forced to acknowledge me because both my husband and myself had our hands in the air waiving around like we were drowning. I had half my food in the box when I had to reach for my phone in my purse.  The waiter came to our table reached over my open container and grabbed my half full plate and took it and all the silverware away like we were going to steal it.  He never said a word. We were in such shock that he cleared my plate of food that we felt like that was the final straw to our horrific dinning experience and had to leave. All in all the food could use some better quality control but it was the customer service that was appalling."
1,"I don't often go out of my way to write reviews for places. You can check my history and I only review a place if you've really hit a really high or low for me. 

In this particular case, it was the lowest of the low. This kbbq place is literally the worst. 

Do not come here!! To me and my friend's dismay, this place was just abominable. Service was the worst I've ever experienced and the food was sub par. 

Our table dealt with literally the worst server. The whole time we were there, the guy literally socialized with his group of friends at a table next to us and rarely ever served us. His attitude was just off putting and we could tell the guy couldn't possibly care less about the kind of service we were receiving. Additionally, WE DIDN'T GET WATER UNTIL AFTER WE FINISHED MORE THAN HALF OUR FOOD, even after we asked more than a hundred times!! 

The grill was badly charred halfway through our meal and they never offered to change it, even after our food was clearly getting coated in black residue which made the already sub par food taste like charcoal. After we asked, the grill was changed, years later of course, but at that point it was just too late. 

The food was average, and that's just me being generous. The meat options were minimal and most of it tasted just plain weird. The sides weren't great either.

The bathroom was just filthy. It was located in the basement and it felt utterly disgusting. I felt like I came out of that bathroom dirtier than I came in. There was no soap!!!  

Nothing could possibly make me want to recommend this place. It's just bad. Customer service is horrendous, food is sub par, and the price is far from reasonable considering all these factors. Please heed my warning. This is not a reasonable place to eat at and you will regret it!"
1,"This review is only on customer service NOT food

Not happy with them. It says they close at 10pm on saturdays and we show up at 8:30pm and they tell us they're closed! Drove from NM and looked forward to their food for nothing!

Please change your advertised hours on both the website and yelp!!!!"
1,"I've dined here over a dozen times since moving to the east valley.  The establishment is on the way home from work and therefore convenient for me.  The service has been highly erratic-ranging from mediocre to absolutely horrid.  Tonight the iced tea tasted like coffee, the club sandwich was missing items, and the server was nearly nonexistent.  I will not be returning to this Denny's location ever again."
1,Rusted grills!!!! WTF who leaves uncleaned rusted grills to cook raw meat on? They should be closed down. It is so dangerous to eat there.
1,"Worst korean food (maybe overall worst experience) experience. Ordered monk fish, stewed duck and bi bimbab for 3 of us. Non of us was able to eat our food. It tasted weird. Also when we wanted to pay we wanted to leave only 2 dollars tip since service and food quality was horrible. They asked for more tips. Never seen a restaurant like this in toronto. Absolutely not recommended."
1,"First let me say I will never come back to this place and they jacked my Coach sunglasses!! I was impressed upon initially walking in b/c it smelled great. They offer you a free taste of bread as you walk in. My bf went w/ red, white and blue. It was good but not spectacular. I went w/ Coconut Walnut. OMG really good. but the service RUINED it for me. 

We came in for a brkfst sandwich of which they only have 2 options eggs and ham or eggs and bacon - seems simple enough right? you also (acc'd to the paper you write your order down on yourself ) to add tomato or green pepper. Odd combo but ok. mybf ordered 
1) ham, egg, cheese, tomato and green peppers
me i ordered:
2) bacon, egg, cheese and green peppers

well first she came back .. do you want cheese? 
yes.. i circled cheddar.. ok
then she came back.... we are out of wheat bread do you want another?
well.. yeah (i dont want to eat a bread free sandwich)... what do youhave?
her: we have xyz and soudough
me: ok Ill have soudough (my bf ordered white)

we finally get our order - both were on sourdough I might add.. 
Neither had tomato or green peppers... 
my bf took his bk and asked about it and she just looked @ him and said well.. what do you want me to do?
the BF: he said well can you fix it? 
she started  um... well.. um.. and um... er... 
finally my bf just said well can you give it to me on the side? 
HER: yeah that's a good idea. you can see the photo on the side.


I walked out and realized I had left my Coach glasses on the table. I went bk in and they were already gone. This was not a place I'd ever go back. After this neither of the girls would look us in the eye. it seemed like 2 girls that had no idea what they were doing.. One of them commented to my bf that they had been there since 5 am to bake bread.. um.. so that means its ok to mess up our order b/c you start your workday early? 
The fact this place was empty should've tipped us off. As we left there was an elderly couple walking in, I said whatever y ou do just stick to the bread - the sandwiches are TOO COMPLICATED for them to make and they've been working since 5 (she said it, me.. so this was not an insult, just a disclaimer I was passing along)"
1,"Servers are very rude and seem like they hate their job. I live upstairs in the condo beside, I've been here a few times and servers pretend to not see you when you put your hand up. Server rolled their eyes like I was stupid when I placed an order. I don't recommend this place."
1,"We went to Denny's late last night and while standing in the waiting area the waitress came up and abruptly said ""there's a 40 minute wait for food"". I asked, even deserts? She said just a minute and went into the back. She came back out and motioned for us to follow her. We were seated and both ordered coffee as we looked at the menu. We asked her for the molten chocolate lava cake and apple caramel deserts. She said they were out of the lava cake, so we said we'll have the cheesecake instead. She came back a couple minutes later and said they are also out of the apple caramel desert. So we said we'll just take the bill for the coffee. We have liked this Denny's before but this time the waitress was just plain rude which we were willing to look past but then to not have either of the deserts we chose made this a bad trip to Denny's. You would have thought they would have comp'd the coffee since they were out of what we ordered but we paid full price. 
Very Disappointed customers!"
1,"I worked here for a short period of time in 2015.
Let me just tell you that this restaurant recycles its meat. For those who go to eat Korean BBQ beware! THE MEAT SERVED ARE LEFTOVERS FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS!
As a matter of fact, when I worked there I was yelled at for throwing the leftovers in the garbage instead of keeping them for other customers to eat. The procedure was to take the leftover meats and pile them into shelf in the back, then put them into new plates and continue serving. 

As well, this guy named Leo who works here is very very rude. He is a supervisor but sets a terrible model for other employees. If he is your server I feel sorry for you.

Please also be aware that not only is the place unsanitary, the tips that you leave will not be distributed to your respective waiters and waitresses. They will be distributed according to seniority, with most of the amount taken away by the manager and supervisors. Let's just hope that they use it to purchase more sanitary kitchen equipment.

As a side note, I quit my waitressing job here because I was disgusted at the unsanitary practices (such as recycling leftovers) as well as the lack of respect between coworkers."
1,"Closed Tuesdays fix that on your yelp and the location hours even if it is a ""summer"" thing."
1,Been here a few times with decent service but today was the last straw. Got there at 9;05 for breakfast and had a movie planned across the street at 10am. Me and my wife both placed our orders when we sat down. We both ordered hash browns and asked that they be cooked all the way thru and crispy.  When the food came out the hash brown were barley cooked. That is a raw potato.  Then she had pancakes also that the waitress said the cook messed up. We sent back the hash browns as they obviously could not be eaten and they came out at 9:45 with one side cooked. Felt like candid camera. Her pancakes came out at 9:50.  The waitress just apologized but didn't tale anything off the bill. Also our toast was not even warm. When we left the cashier asked how it was so I told her.  She took off $5????  Obviously poor management and customer service.  Don't apologize- fix the problem.
1,"Terrible experience.  I ordered eggs scrambled dry.  Got an over easy egg instead.  Even if I liked runny eggs you could see it was over cooked.  Toast wasn't delivered with the meal.  Told the waitress that my order was wrong.  Took it back and returned the plate with the scrambled eggs that were under cooked for me.  Still no toast.  Before the waitress disappeared I checked the hash browns.  They were cold.  Told her to take it back and I didn't want anything to eat.  While my wife finished eating, I wanted a refill on my coffee.  Had to flag down another waitress to get a refill.  It was not even busy.  Didn't even get a sorry from the waitress when I paid for my wife's breakfast.  I did tip her 10 cents.  This restaurant must be a training location for the staff."
1,"Crappiest korean bbq you can find. Salty marination, disgusting banchan. You will find yourself surrounded by high school and college students who probably never had authentic korean bbq before.
If you are keen to enjoy authentic korean bbq, this is not the place."
1,"It sucks! We haven't been here in 4 or  5 months and I will never go back there ever again. We used to eat here a lot but we were taking a break. The food was horrible, the service was horrible and the place was a mess. There were no utensils, barely any ketchup in the bottles on the tables. We should have know there was a problem when on a Saturday night at 6 pm there was only one other family there. My husband only ate a few bites of his food when he found a piece of some kind of plastic wrap in it and then when I went into the restroom to wash my hands, someone had been smoking cigarettes in there I couldn't even breath it was so bad. We left, never to return."
1,"You guys are terrible. I requested service to fix a leak last Thursday, you guys came out on Monday, supposedly made repairs. Still leaked, came out Tuesday send made repairs, still leaked. And when I called back, they said that they could not come back into next Tuesday! Couldn't even bump me up to the top of the list. No apologies or nothing.

Spoke to the manager Mike and he was very condescending and was even cussing when I requested to be bumped to an earlier appointment since they are not able to fix my problem after coming out twice. ""You want me to tell the rest of my customers to f*ck off?"" He says. Well I am a customer and guess what you are telling me to do?

What crappy service. You best believe that my warranty will hear about this."
1,"Pros: Started our services with AP approx 2 1/2 years ago as they were scheduled through our home warranty. No issues with the fix or warranty, so we started weekly pool service on our very simple play pool. 

Cons: High turn over, poor customer service on the phone or in person - example: said the tech was at our house on Friday at 237pm, as u can see in our picture taken at 4pm, no baskets were cleaned. And on a Seperate occassion, i mentioned to the tech that our system was showing ""low salt"". He said he would take care of it, i watched him put chemicals into the pool and within 24 hours our pool was dark swampy green. Because our service was on fridays they did not come back out until Monday AFTERNOON to take a look at our pool that their person turned green. They did clean our salt cell and we had to run our pump for 72 hours straight to rectify the green pool. Aka: high electricity bill that month. 

Overall, if you actually see a tech show up they are here for less than 5 minutes, never the same one, dont complete the tasks they advertise for $80/month and you will be disappointed by the customer service you recieve when you call the office. We gave them a valiant effort & thousands of dollars but HIGHLY HIGHLY do NOT recommend & its time to move on."
1,"Been to this Korean Grill House a few times, but never have been so disappointed. 

Apparently due to the ""holidays"", the service and the food was the worse I've ever experienced. We asked for a table of 4 but they always forgot one of us...whether it was water, rice or even chopsticks. 

My past experiences here, were not fantastic but never horrible. The waiters are generally very quick and polite. This time we were barely seen and had to always waived them down. The upstairs room is barely more packed than usual. 

Food was disappointing. Mostly got what seemed like scraps and leftovers. Beef ribs had so much fat that by the time it was done cooking, all the fat had melted and all that was left were the bones. Rice was very dry, more than usual. All meat ordered were mainly fat. Also, we had a curly black hair in one of the rice... The manager simply apologized and said she'll go hand picked more need slices. 

Overall, I never thought I'd say I would be disappointed enough to never go back to a restaurant but this might have been the last push overboard. Korean food is always good, but I think we'll have to find a new place now!"
1,"Can't comment on the food as we never got any. Came in and waited at the host stand for a few minutes...finally got seated. Sat and chatted and looked at menu, there for at least 10 min. No one ever even came to the table, so we left."
1,"The in-laws were in town this past weekend, so we decided to show them the newly opened Romare Bearden Park. The park was a lot of fun and after checking it out we decided to stroll over to French Quarter for lunch. 

I had high hopes for French Quarter, given my love of Uptown restaurants and my affinity for Cajun-inspired food, but I have to say both the food and the customer service was a major letdown.

Our server was not very attentive, forgot what we ordered, brought our food out without silverware and took several minutes to provide us with silverware so that we could actually eat, and failed to refill our drinks. The restaurant was also FREEZING... last Saturday was literally the nicest day of the year and they had the air on what had to be 65, totally unnecessary! 

Once we were finally able to eat our food, it was a) cold from us not getting silverware for a few minutes and the restaurant being crazy cold & b) not that great. The gumbo tasted like it came from a can and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant.

If the food and service wasn't enough to leave a bad impression, the restrooms were disgusting and there was no toilet paper. I will definitely not be returning to French Quarter... which is a shame because they're in a primo location!"
1,"The grill burners are WAY TOO LOW and people ended up standing up while grilling because it's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to see what you're grilling!!! Instead of having a relaxing meal experience, it's going to be and will be a stressful one. We didn't enjoy at all, unless you're 6 feet tall or higher."
1,"I know a lot of us had been to Denny's on Gilbert and Germann. Have to post this coz I am so disgusted with the service. Ok, our server was fine, no problem with that. The food, as always, came in after over half an hour - it's a Sunday brunch, so they're swamped. The coffee mug was dirty and heavily stained. I ordered medium-rare steak, and what did I get? Almost RAW, bloody fresh piece of meat!! Judge for yourself! I did not complain coz I don't want to make a scene, nor for them to recook coz the kids are starving at this point. Sorry I'm unable to post the pic, but IT WAS DISGUSTING."
1,"This place was BEYOND disappointing.  Brought family from Rome there (only because closely and superior Marcello's had an obscene line up) thought it would be good.
Guy greeting us told us a table would be ready and asked us to move to the back of the restaurant while we wait. It was only after about 10 mins when I walked up to the front to see what was happening with the table we were told 'I'm waiting for people to finish their dessert and then you'll have your table'  A quick look around and I noticed NO ONE was eating dessert.  We decided to leave and all six of us walked by him and he didn't say a word.  Really professional.  Now I know why I only go to Marcello's.  Loud music and lousy service? no thank you."
1,"The food was cold, and microwaved.... The employees are in the back talk loud and cussing while families are up front, had to flag them down to come to the cash register. I like bbq, but you can tell employees and management don't care about quality...."
1,"Me and couple of friends went to this restaurant  to watch the Panthers vs Seahawks football game.  The restaurant was packed with 85% to 90% African Americans.  The restaurant had a waiting list and we was waiting for a table to come available.  As we was waiting to be seated,  an unknown white couple came to me and my colleague and advised that they vacated a table in the bar area and we can have it.  Our stay at that table was short live, we were advised by a RUDE BLONDE waitress, advised that the table reserved a white couple  and we needed to get up now. We got up and we started talking to some of our friends at a nearby table. The general manager approach me and my friends and advised us stop ""hovering over the white customer's table and we needed to go back up front now or he was going to call the police.  The general manager didn't want hear that we was talking to our friends at a nearby table and not ""hovering over"" the the white couple's table.

The general manager called the police after requested his name and a business card to file a complaint. 

We spoke with the police on the outside of the restaurant and advised them what happened and the officers could not believe that they were called out to Hickory Tavern Harris Corners Pkwy for that bogus call. 

The general manager over reacted to a couple law a biding customers that was trying to watch the Panthers vs Seahawks football game.  I will never patronized with Hickory Tavern again until they make this right with me and my friends. 5 thumbs down! 

I reluctantly use the race card, however, I truly believe that myself and my friends race, African American,  was determining and deciding factor as why the general manager elected to call the police.   I am not sure what management training the general manager went through to prepare him for that role, however,  he failed in a major way.
Question: If me and my friends was white, would the general manager would have called the police?????"
1,"You guys are terrible. I requested service to fix a leak last Thursday, you guys came out on Monday, supposedly made repairs. Still leaked, came out Tuesday send made repairs, still leaked. And when I called back, they said that they could not come back into next Tuesday! Couldn't even bump me up to the top of the list. No apologies or nothing.

Spoke to the manager Mike and he was very condescending and was even cussing when I requested to be bumped to an earlier appointment since they are not able to fix my problem after coming out twice. ""You want me to tell the rest of my customers to f*ck off?"" He says. Well I am a customer and guess what you are telling me to do?

What crappy service. You best believe that my warranty will hear about this.

Update:
Why would I want you to come back again, when you couldn't fix the problem after 2 visits, which I had to wait 5 days total for? Plus you did not offer next day Free, you said if there was a cancellation before next week, then I might could get a visit and that ""I should be thanking you"" for even getting that. 

I called a different pool company and they came out the next day and fixed the leak in one visit.

Read the other 1 star reviews, they are all true. People do not complain about great service, but crappy service is a great motivator. What's funny is that the other pool company says that they hear complaints about Aaron Pools all the time!

Also notice that we all spoke to Mike and were all greeted with the same condescending tone. Why would a bunch of strangers make the same remarks about a single person unless it's true?"
1,"HORRIBLE SERVICE, I have no idea what their food tastes like - On Saturday, I was running and errand and decided to stop in and grab a menu from Dickey's.  I am always looking for casual restaurants in the neighborhood for our family. I was excited by their menu and was pleased to see they offered several gluten-free options for me. I was so excited by their menu that I made plans to come back that night with my husband, son and parents. When we arrived, there was another couple waiting at the front counter. They were frustrated because no one had come to the counter to take their order.  Someone finally came from the back and began taking orders. We placed our order and found a table. After 30 minutes of watching everyone else who came in after us (about 12 people), eating their dinner, we asked where our food was. The employee looked stunned and went in the back to check on our order.  He started to come back to our table but decided to take orders at the counter before returning to our table, taking another 10 minutes. Apparently, the employee who took our order had gone home for the night and never put in our order. We were so frustrated and disappointed that we asked for our money back so that we could go find somewhere else to eat. The employee had to call the owner to figure out how to give us our money back. After spending another 10 minutes on the phone with the owner we were finally given our money back and left.  We were so disappointed after the experience we will not be back and after reading the reviews I don't think we are missing much."
1,"Pros: Started our services with AP approx 2 1/2 years ago as they were scheduled through our home warranty. No issues with the fix or warranty, so we started weekly pool service on our very simple play pool. 

Cons: High turn over, poor customer service on the phone or in person - example: said the tech was at our house on Friday at 237pm, as u can see in our picture taken at 4pm, no baskets were cleaned. And on a Seperate occassion, i mentioned to the tech that our system was showing ""low salt"". He said he would take care of it, i watched him put chemicals into the pool and within 24 hours our pool was dark swampy green. Because our service was on fridays they did not come back out until Monday AFTERNOON to take a look at our pool that their person turned green. They did clean our salt cell and we had to run our pump for 72 hours straight to rectify the green pool. Aka: high electricity bill that month. 

Overall, if you actually see a tech show up they are here for less than 5 minutes, never the same one, dont complete the tasks they advertise for $80/month and you will be disappointed by the customer service you recieve when you call the office. We gave them a valiant effort & thousands of dollars but HIGHLY HIGHLY do NOT recommend & its time to move on.
*** if below comment from Mike is referring to our call with the secretary Monday morning it was anything but pleasant considering how long we've  been customers.. snarky & disappointing was more like it & the only discount offered was to not pay for last week when the tech clearly either no-showed or did nothing at our house**"
1,"CHRONICLING MY JOURNEY:
 I would prefer not to rate with stars & just disclose the facts thus far.

I Had LASIK performed June 30th... There were 2 procedures offered. One standard and a second which was custom approximately an additional $1300. I asked if I needed the procedure and the doctor said you only have one pair of eyes in which I agreed & paid cashiers check over $4000. 
(Recommended mono vision correction).
 Fee does not include 3 types of eye drops to start @ approx. $150+ fish oil etc.).

*Super blurry following the procedure in which I thought would pass & perhaps my eyes needed to adjust. 
*Follow up appointment one pair of plugs inserted  which can cause constant tearing. Still can't see.

*Next appointment second pair of plugs inserted. Still can't see. 

* 3rd apt. I still can't see. The doctor gave me a prescription for glasses and said I would need an ""enhancement "" in 4-6 mos. @ minimum. I'm heartbroken...


Recommended possible temporary treatment options.
*Buy New Glasses. Wth!?!
*I was advised to purchase a special humidifier approximately $450.
*Directed to a website to purchase additional supplements.
*Additional Eye Drops -3 kinds
* Possible dry eye procedures required- IPL 

My vision very blurry, eyes always tearing ,depth perception off , night vision really bad. not safe & I'm hoping to find a resolution to get back to life. 
I will go in for a test this week to see if dry eyes are causing part of the problem which may require additional procedures to follow ,but 75% I still need an ""enhancement."" 

I will follow up with results... My Quality of life has greatly impacted ...Devastated at this time....."
1,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. First off, it's my birthday and I'm in a different state, so we decided before we head back to Vegas let's get some breakfast..... well, we went to Denny's and it was really slow in there. We were sat, 3 adults 1 child, waited for 10 minutes and no one even came by to give us a drink. Needless to say I was not waiting any longer. We walked out and went across the street to Village Inn instead to get my birthday breakfast."
1,Company was sent out through home warranty and they did a horrible job. I was worried as I saw all the other reviews confirming my concern. They didn't repair the job and then made it worse we had to call another pool company to fix their problem.
1,"Scheduled manicure and pedicure one day. Came in, was seated and was told to wait. Waited for over 30 minutes, went back to the front desk, they said they forgot about me. I was nice about it, I guess that happenes (not at the good places, but still happens). At the end wasn't even offered a discount... pretty shitty move."
1,"Will never go to this location after talking to the owner on the phone. Was asking for a reservation for a large group for dinner. I knew they didn't take reservations on the weekend but wanted to see if they would make an exception since we were a large group and it was a milestone birthday (knew the chances were slim). Instead what I was told was how large groups aren't of value to them as they don't make as much money and that they are in the business of flipping tables and doing volume so don't care about groups and don't even want groups! This was said to a customer!!?!! Any owner that basically says to their customer that they aren't as valuable as they  are only focused on making as much money as possible makes me seriously question how they run the rest of their business. Perhaps the owner forgot that the key to have the large group as repeat business is to give fantastic customer service. So if you don't want to support a business that treats their customers like they are just numbers, then join me in boycotting this establishment. Luckily their competition right in the same plaza was happy to take our business and equally appalled at how we were treated:)"
1,"A co-worker and myself stopped her for lunch.  After inquiring about the daily lunch special, we decided to order it. When our food arrived the lunch special was not as the waitress had described. She then got mad when we had told her that this isn't what we ordered and she was very rude. As a part owner in a restaurant myself her attitude and behavior was unacceptable towards the paying customer.  We decided to just pay for it an leave. The bald guy at the register was very rude and was not friendly at all. He has no facial expressions when you greet him or will ignore you when speaking to him. All in all bad experience will never go back due to the rude staff."
1,"Tonight was our first and last trip here. Why? 
1. Very limited kids menu
2. Walked in and there was a haze of smoke from the kitchen. Was surprised the fire alarm wasn't going off.
3. Bathroom was gross and all of the grout had been turned yellow due to neglect/smoke/grease.
4. Fellow diners were a sketchy bunch.
5. Over cooked meat and waffle fries that were like biting into cooled grease.
6. Awful stomachache from eating 1 rib, side Caesar salad and a few waffle fries."
1,"This review is for the delivery service only. I called to order 17 items off the menu at 0800pm and they said I must call a different number to order delivery. I called the number they gave me and it was the customer service number for Grub Hub. I ask the Grub hub rep if I could place and order and he said I have to order online. So, I attempt to place my order online with my IPad through grub hub and the Grub Hub website does not allow me to add items to my order. So I call the Ben Chef and explain the situation and they tell me it's to late to order food from them. They must be doing well to turn down orders of 17 meals. I will never support this business."
1,"I was referred to them by my warranty company. We spoke to them on Monday. Tuesday they called my husband and said they would call back with a date and time. We'd no call, Thursday no call I CALLED THURSDAY EVENING Keep in mind it doesn't take long for a pool to turn green. I called and left a message yesterday. I didn't get a call from them this friday morning so I called again. They stated they were coming out Monday. Really? That means the pool would have been without a motor for a week. And then the lady said we'll call you to confirm a 2 to 3 hour window....now I see why they have the rating they have.....get it together"
1,"Well, my girlfriend and I decided to get some breakfast here, last minute.

Server was nice, but unstocked table caddy. Dirty/heavily stained coffee mugs. No coffee refills. No flavored coffee creamer. Dirty syrup container. Yuck.

Never again."
1,"Today I had a date with my BFF for pedicures. It was my reward ( and hers) after a long week at Mayo Clinic. We were both looking forward to this and got up early Saturday morning for our treat. Five minutes into my pedi the tech cut my toe pretty good which I know she felt bad about, however I am immune compromised and a cut could land me in the hospital.  Needless to say I couldn't risk an infection so we stopped the pedi and just did a nail color change.  I'm really disappointed.  I was so looking forward to this then I was charged $34 on top of all this, and never did get a pedi.  Nice salon but geeze you would think $34 is a little much to charge after slicing my toe open."
1,The service at this location is horrible. The waitress would walk by our table 2 or 3 times before actually stopping to see what we needed. After we ordered the food took forever to come out and it was not busy. When they did bring the food mine was missing and came out several minutes later. The decor definitely needs a little update and the building was freezing. I had to get a blanket out of my car to bring in to warm up. Very disappointing visit for my family lunch.
1,Terrible terrible terrible. They serve meat in small trays with lots of juice in it. I was worried about touching it and cross contamination.  Most of the Waiters didn't seem as welcoming. I asked for sesame oil and salt and the guy didn't know what I was talking about. I then asked for red korean sauce and it was $1. Really? It should come with the cost! To make it worse Kimchi was slimy.
1,"Had Dinner there. Bill of two for an Appetizer - 2 steaks - No Dessert - and 2 Glasses of house wine came to $ 111. Waiter was serving a very large party so our service was sporadic. Steaks ordered Medium and Medium Well. Both steaks arrived on the rare side. Sent one steak back - when we saw it again it was charcoal black. This had to be done for spite - Manager would not come to the table until after the steak was removed and offered to comp the appetizer. Their Au-Gratin potatoes are boiled cubed potatoes covered in Cheese-Whiz. 
Poor Beef Quality, Service and Management.
Don't Gamble your Dollars on this place."
1,"This was absolutely the worst dining experience we've had in a long time.  I am praying we don't all get sick.
Where to begin?
They were out of:
Pulled pork (at a bbq restaurant?)
Ham
Turkey
Sausage
Bbq beans
Pickles
Silverware
The food we did receive was cold.  The place was dirty and disgusting. The sauce station hasn't been cleaned in who knows how long. Wrappers all over the floor. The bathroom was worse than most gas stations. The workers could not care less that the place was a wreck. I wish I could give zero stars. Do NOT go to this restaurant. Please God don't let us all get sick tonight.
***Edited to add:  I am a long time Yelp reader but never post (just not my thing) I actually CREATED an account tonight because this was so bad.  I have a duty to warn people.  We should've just left.  Why oh why didn't we?  Oh and the bathroom also smelled of cigarette smoke.  And previous reviewer was right on about the sinks not working etc.  What a DUMP."
1,I ordered a grand slam online. It was 4 items and they couldn't even get it right. The receipt clearly states what I ordered but my hash browns were missing. I won't be going back.
1,"I have now been to both of the places named Dickeys in the greater Phoenix area.

One, Dickies Dogs out in North Scottsdale would occasionally get my retox business, when we lived out that way...they were close to DC Ranch and close to the DC Ranch Village, so it made getting a hot dog easy enough:)

Then people started throwing dynamite through the windows of Dickies Dogs in the middle of the night in a misguided attempt at extreme restaurant critiquing:)

I quit going to Dickies Dogs when the possibility of getting fragged reared its ugly head!

I'm thinking the guerilla critic might have been guilty of a case of mistaken identity (as well as multiple Class A federal felonies:(

While Dickies Dogs made serviceable hot dogs, you really can't say the same about the ""barbecue"" from Dickeys Pit.

I met a friend at Dickeys Pit yesterday for lunch and a business meeting...from the moment I walked in, I just sort of knew it was not going to go well for Dickeys Pit:(

I took a look at the somewhat limited menu, while I sniffed in vain for the slightest hint of wood smoke in the air.

Then I read their menu more closely.

When they talk about how they make their ""barbecue"" at Dickeys, they talk about how they ""cook"" their meats ""on the pit"" overnight...wait a minute...that's not barbecue!

I walked around to the side of the counter and saw the stainless steel ""pit"", over which they ""cook"" the meat...oh crap?!?!?

At any rate, I was there and I was starving (power yoga and no breakfast make for an empty boy:) so I went ahead and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with ""barbecue"" beans.

They brought out my sandwich, which had been ""cooked on the pit""...sliced pork shoulder (not pulled pork) without so much as a hint of smoke, served with watery beans that had more in common with bean soup than with real barbecue beans...except without the flavor of good bean soup:(

They have serve yourself barbecue sauce and I got regular and spicy sauce (the sweet sauce was almost like candy:(...and I slathered the spicy on my sandwich in an unsuccessful effort to get some flavor into the meat.

It was just a sliced pork sandwich with second rate barbecue sauce poured over the top...it wasn't barbecue, pit or otherwise and it wasn't good:(

The place is clean, modern, family friendly, pretty cheap and completely without redeeming value when it comes to the food they serve.

I think the mysterious Mad Dickies Bomber might just have had the wrong Dickeys!"
1,"I was here for Happy Hour, but they were closed during posted business hours.  The food may be pretty good here, but I'll never know because their door was locked."
1,"horrible service! don't go! 
my 8 year old daughter and I walked in for dinner at 6pm. we were promptly told by a less than engaged host that nothing was available and go look in the bar. no, would you like to wait, no nothing... not the first time the ambivalent nature of service at this location has reared its ugly head, but it will be the last! at least for me! be warned... this chain is going to die if it continues to be managed like this."
1,"Sad to say that this used be a place were I could get a awesome chocolate shake. Unfortunately when my husband and I got here we have to wait forever to order and to get our drinks . In addition, we have to get to the cashier to get the check.  We could hear the people in the kitchen laughing and joking .meanwhile ,the place had dirty dishes and no one to check us out."
1,"Terrible customer service skills!!! I had Aaron pools come out to my home to change a light bulb and the light has been falling out ever since. I called several times to report it and I finally got a hold of them and was told I would have someone out to fix it. Well that NEVER happened. I recently called since pool season is around the corner and they will NOT fix it because it's been past 90days and it's not in their notes that anyone was supposed to come out so not their problem because he doesn't live at my house (his words). Mike (manager) and the receptionist have by far the worst customer service skills. I will never do business with them, nor recommend them to anyone. I was better off without a light. Call Barefoot pools of you want professionals!"
1,"I wish I could give Aaron pools a negative star rating because they don't even deserve a 0. I called for a technician to look at my pool filter and when they came out they were very rude.  Mike treated me like I was stupid and didn't want to listen to anything I had to say. He was very combative and arrogant, not wanting to help me with my problem. He seemed very lazy and told me a bunch of different answers that didn't make sense. It seemed like he was trying to get out of the work.  When I called a different pool company they gave me an answer and fixed the problem right away. They told me it was an easy fix and Mike's answers did not make sense.

And don't even try to report a problem to the manager. They are even worse and more rude. She didn't to listen to me or help me at all. This company needs major help in customer service and should be AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS!!"
1,"Faulty service, extremely unprofessional work if you can call it that. Left a dangerous condition which thankfully wasn't worse. Poor and deceptive workmanship. Due to improper electrical connections to the pump number one, wire was not grounded on inside of pump, two, wire housing connected to the pump was taped with electrical tape come to find out this was because the tube was broken so they hid that by taping it rather than fixing it and telling us it was an extra precaution. Due to the recent storm this was exposed as water got into the pump through the tape job burning and melting where the positive wire was connected melting wire shielding 4 inches from pump. Thankfully there was not a major house fire and our other pool equipment was not damaged as far as we know. Had another pool company come out and took these pictures. Shady work. We thought the young man that came out from Aaron Pools was very nice and honest but nope. Watch for electrical tape on jobs!! 
We called the company last night when this was discovered and they were closed. Also submitted a contact form on their site. The hope is they will fix the pump and take care of the sketchy work which will then be inspected by another pool company. We will post what remediation takes place and hope they take ownership and correct ASAP.
See pictures."
1,"my family and I will never step foot in another Outback Steakhouse again.
- it took 2 hours to eat and get out of there and there were only 6 customers in the entire restaurant
- it took 40 min to get our onion blossom appetizer
- their restaurant smelled like dirty, damp, rags
- menus were sticky
- ordered the steak and lobster dish and the size of the steak was smaller than the palm of my hand and I have small hands!
- service was ok but the refills on water need to be worked on."
1,"Registered here just to write this review and WARN people.
I would put minus 5 stars if I could.
HORRIBLE!!!!
NEVER WORK WITH THESE PEOPLE!!!
UNPROFESSIONAL, IGNORANT, DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM SECRETARY TO THE OWNER.

We were referred to them through our Home Warranty company three weeks ago.
The technician showed up for 5 minutes and left. No one contacted us after to tell us what is going on.
When we called them that same day the only thing they said ""Your warranty will not cover. Pay us $65  for the visit.""
We said that we would pay whatever warranty doesn't cover and please let us know the estimate.
The answer was ""well, we will have to send technician back to give you the quote and you will have to pay additional $65.""
I mean, why technician did not check to give the quote in the first place, right?
Anyway we don't like conflict so said please go back and give us the quote. He went to our house, parked outside, never went back to the pool (we had a guest in the house that whole week, so we knew for sure what happened). Then he quoted us (from his car) that the fee will be $200.
We said OK, we will pay $200 if you fix the pool. He came a week later WITHOUT NESSESARY PARTS. My husband had to go and buy those himself whole the guy was waiting in the car.
When we had all the parts he worked on the pool and left saying not to turn on the pump for a couple of hours. 
When we did turn on the pump -- the problem that we had WAS NOT FIXED.
When he was laving he told us that we can call him and he would come back and fix again if needed. But when we tried to reach him he just never picked up the phone and when we called the company they were extremely rude and said they will not do anything unless we pay (for still not fixed pool???) and that they would just sue us if we don't pay.
Now they are telling us that if we want them to go back again we have to pay $200 plus additional $65 again.
The owner is extremely rude, the secretary is worse.

So really, never hire them!!
The only good reviews are most likely posted by friends and family."
1,I was there last night  The staff was friendly  but it was the WORSE steak I ever attempted to eat. It was raw and tough. I sent it back and paid for my salad and drinks. AVOID
1,"We were just walking around Charlotte visiting several bars and saw a Chicago Cubs flag on building a block down, being from Chicago I wanted to check it out hoping maybe it was a Chicago or Cubs themed bar. It wasn't very busy and we sat at the bar. We ordered 2 vodka and soda with house vodka. I asked the bartender if this was a Cubs bar and said no, I mentioned I found it odd since there was a Cubs flag out front, she stated she had no idea about the flag. She honestly had no personality, typically a bartender will try to engage the customer in a little talk, unless they are busy of course, but all she did was serve the drinks and walked to the end of bar and just stand there until someone needed something. We finished our drink and asked for our tab. It was $12.50 plus tax for each drink, we were shocked my gosh it was house vodka. A real rip off."
1,"No no no no no NO.
I've heard great things about grazie and about the amazing 'authentic italian food', and excitedly brought my friends here.. well actually, I got in their car and made them bring me.. BIG MISTAKE!

We got seated immediately and it was a nice environment. No other asian spotting in the restaurant though. It was all white families enjoying their meals- a good sign, I thought. The waiter comes and gets our order and we proceed to wait half a century for our meals... ok, you make each order as you receive it, but it shouldn't be 40 minutes before anything comes. Oh wait, I lied.. the bread appetizer came.. but it was literally like chewing on rocks. So hard and it could've broken off my tooth. We also didn't get olive oil to dip it, like all the other tables did? Is it because we don't belong? Anyway, after I've aged to 80, the food finally came and it was delicious. Great texture of fettucine and nice sauce. The waiter was never to be seen again, not even when our waters were empty and we were dying of thirst. Then he came back with our seperate bills and as my first friend paid with her credit card, I handed him a $20 for a $16 bill. He snatched it rudely and fast out of my hand with two fingers (my friend is a eye witness of this ridiculousness) and then he slammed it on the table as my other friend proceeded to pay his bill with his card... No 'thank you' or 'do you want change for this'.. he finishes the transactions and rushes away with a 'have a good night' ... does that mean I don't get change? Dude, I was going to barely tip you the 10-15% but apparently you decided to keep 20% for yourself without asking..?!?! I'm pretty sure many restaurants train you to ask if the customer wants change even if they gave you barely over the price they have to pay... WTF? Ridiculous. So, thank you STEVEN, who works on sunday night for your awesome behaviour! I will NEVER return to this location again."
1,"My husband and  I recently went to Waverly's as we so often have done in the past.
I ordered their 10 oz Sirloin Special expecting to get the same quality of meat and thickness that I had received in the past.  When i received my steak this time, it looked like a very ""thinly"" cut piece of breakfast steak.  I have eaten better looking steaks at a cheap buffet.  It looked as if they were running out of the special so they had to compensate with a cheaper cut.  If I would have known this to begin with I would have ordered something else.  I happen to like sirloins and believe me, you can get a much better steak from OUTBACK.

When I brought this to the attention of the waiter and manager, they offhandedly said that I had received an end cut.  I I had a center cut of the sirloin like I did before, it would have been a thicker cut of meat.  Where is the quality control here?  One day you get a center cut and the next time you might get a breakfast steak????????????
For a self-proclaimed upscale restaurant, this should be inexcusable.  I was not offered an apology or compensated for an inferior and smaller cut of meat.  Needless to say, there are a hundred different steak restaurants in town and I will not be returning to Waverly's."
1,"This office is such a pain in the ass. Have appointment at 7:40am and didn't see the doctor till 11am. Wtf? Wasting a lot of people time. Please take care of your patients, and if you're too busy don't take too much of appointments that you can't even squeeze them in."
1,"If your home warranty company refers you to Aaron Pools for service do yourself a huge favor and ask for someone else for service. 

Someone things that were working just fine all of a sudden don't when they leave. His response ""bad luck"". When the technician calls back he is rude and talks over you while raising his voice and acts like he was doing us a favor by fixing what he was contracted to do through the warranty company."
1,"(I hope the owner is reading this because it's in English get a translator because no one at huh ga ne speaks English!!!!)

-good food
-big portions
-bad service and unfriendly unless you are Korean and can ONLY speak Korean as no one here speaks any English or speaks very little of it 

Also there's plenty of side dishes included and can be refilled 

The service is and always will be s*** we asked for lemons and the lady brought us a menu saying we don't sell it so we were confused after we repeated 5 times we just want lemon slices she understood 
(all of the servers speak no to very very little English are they illegals or something?!)

anyways we were halfway finishing our meal and one of them brings us the bill which i find REALLY RUDE we DID NOT ASK FOR THE BILL!
it's as if they think we were going to dine & dash even though we've been here MANY times"
1,"""UPDATED"" Ordered mac n cheese, never got it and we were never told they don't have any.  Both soda machines were down, the workers got snippy when flaws in the meal were brought to their attention.  We thought the green way location was bad. ... took forever to get your food and it was still wrong.  Feel bad for the employees with a lack of management.  This place needs to be on mystery diners. ... heck, I could tell them their problem from sitting in the restaurant. Another dickeys that I will not be going to again.  Management, where are you?

Update - I got a message from Dickey's customer service asking me for my contact information the very next day.  I gave them my email address now over a week ago.  No response.  They must work like this in every department... they now have 1 star from me.

It is now the 8th of May - still no response from Dickey's."
1,Arrived at 4:00p on a Friday and my food was the obviously the leftovers from Thursday. Be sure to come during prime hours if you would like food.
1,"We came in right at about 7:55 for a quick dinner. The waitress visited our table about 7-10 minutes later to take our drink orders and give us the menu.

She refused to allow us to order the Happy Hour, despite it being only 8:02 and that she was the reason we missed the 8:00pm deadline. Most places have a 5-10 minute grace period for Happy Hour.

Ordered the 12.99 Bento Box with panko chcken, wife had the Teriyaki Beef 8.99 Bento Box with lettuce roll instead of sushi

Soup was fine.

Crab puffs were relatively stale, dumplings were from Costco.

My sushi was a full-scale disaster--undersized, WEIRD taste, and they somehow managed to mess up a Crunch roll into something barely edible. My wife's Teriyaki beef was tough and cold to the touch.

I am baffled by the ratings here and convinced that people in my area must just be used to terrible Asian food."
1,Beware!!! Aaron pools is contracted with many of the home warranty companies.  When you make a service call to your warranty company for pool repair do yourself a favor and make sure it is NOT AARON POOLS.  I have been a professional realtor over 20 years I hear a lot complaints about them.  From my personal experience their technician was rude and had a bad attitude.  He was at my house for 5 minutes to tell me that the warranty company will not cover a loud pump motor which is going bad until it is completely stopped.  He also said that they will not cover a broken handle on the valves because they are turning.  I asked him if he checked with the warranty office and they said that he doesn't have to do it because he knows.   Never again!!!!  I'm going to get my repairs done and it is certainly NOT going to be by Aaron pools.
1,"This weekend my husband treated me to a spa day which I was stoic to find out was at the famous Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa. As a working mother of a 1 and 2 year old, I never get pampered like this both for time and financial reasons so needless to say it was a very special treat. I was left in the relaxation room for nearly 45 mintues after when I was suppose to be seen, the bathrooms were broken, the showers were broken and when I said I had to pee the lady said, ""do you have to go really bad?"".... During my facial I could hear pounding and a plumbing snake being taken in and out.... The lady explained that all appointments had been cancelled and was the last one to be seen because they had plumbing issues.... I would have much rather have been rescheduled... my massage, while it was ""relaxing"" the constant smell of sewage was not. It was awful. I would have expected so much more from a place like this. I know things happen so I didn't want to complain but my experience was not great and I think management should know. I was disappointed in my experience, the fact I couldn't use the restroom or shower (which had black sewage water coming out of it) and sewage smell is not a great aroma therapy smell."
1,"Awful company, awful service and crappy attitude. They made wrong diagnosis and caused more issues with the pool. I wouldn't hire them. Simply awful."
1,"Placed an order through postmates and left a note letting them now I dont eat meat. Then called to let them know i dont eat meat and not to put meat in my salad and to instead. Add an extra roll. Instead of getting what i requested i get a salad with bacon and ham in it. Called them to have the salad refunded back on my card because i had to dispose of it and was told i would just get my whole meal replaced for free. So I call the next day to have the meal replaced so i could pick it up and a manager states ""we keep the names in a call log and details of the issue, your name isnt on there"" whos fault is that? YOURS. I had proof that i called, proof that i ordered, and proof that i even left a note in the postmates order. The idiot that answered the phone at the bar messed my order up in the first place and you promise me a meal to be replaced and now you tell me no? Offering to replace the salad was generous on the 2nd managers behalf that i spoke too, but lets get a little more organized."
1,"I had a home warranty claim and I told them to have technician call me 15-20 minutes out so I could be there for the repair. They told me her would that was on Thursday.  I called on Monday to verify that the technician would call me, they said yes.  I wake up today and am waiting for a call.  I decide to call the office and they inform me that the technician was there and already left.  I said, ""he was supposed to call.""  The lady replied, ""well he looks like he didn't.""  I wanted to be there and they assured me I would get a call.  That is unacceptable .. can't even make a phone call.  I will make sure that Aaron pools doesn't get my business if I ever make a warranty claim.  Absolutely unacceptable !!  I have heard that they don't don't do repairs with brand new parts amongst other things, and when they don't call me to let me know so I can meet them makes me wonder if they are doing some shady stuff.  I'm heading over to my rental now to make sure they actually replaced what needed to be replaced."
1,"You get what you pay for... and cheap is definitely reflected in all aspects of this restaurant. Small, round hole in the ground style grill (aka the less meat you can grill the less you can eat. A table of 20 patrons... 3 grills? What a joke!) meat quality is horrendous at best comprised of cartilage and fat aren't you lucky, paired with HORRIBLE service. Good luck."
1,Called Home Warranty company about a pool issue - they sent Aaron Pools out.  A part was installed backwards causing a significant loss of water - they came out and fixed the problem but we had to refill a portion of the pool.  They refused to pay the difference in our water bill due to their mistake.  Will never use this company again and may re-think home warranty company American Home Shield.
1,"Called 5 times to get a prescription called in, no one ever called it in .....they have the worst customer service ive ever experienced, then ""Roxanne"" from the answering service hung up on me......when I said I wanted to cancel my follow up. No sense to go if you never got your medication to begin with.....
Not surprised, las vegas has the worst medical care in the US.......don't get sick here."
1,"Why would I want you to come back again, when you couldn't fix the problem after 2 visits, which I had to wait 5 days total for? Plus you did not offer next day Free, you said if there was a cancellation before next week, then I might could get a visit and that ""I should be thanking you"" for even getting that. 

I called a different pool company and they came out the next day and fixed the leak in one visit.

Read the other 1 star reviews, they are all true. People do not complain about great service, but crappy service is a great motivator. What's funny is that the other pool company says that they hear complaints about Aaron Pools all the time!

Also notice that we all spoke to Mike and were all greeted with the same condescending tone. Why would a bunch of strangers make the same remarks about a single person unless it's true?"
1,"I went to the Wellish Institute for nearly two years. I have Sjogrens Syndrome (severely dry eyes). When I first went there, Dr. Wellish and Dr. Abrams assured me they could help me, and make a difference with regard to my eye condition. I felt so hopeful. I had procedures not covered by insurance, and they did not help at all. After that, the technicians would merely apply contact lens bandages on my eyes. They were not good at it, and had great difficulty with the process, causing more than one technician to try each time. The process was very difficult,  and the lenses never stayed in. After many months of tedious visits, the doctors seemed to have lost interest in helping me, and did not want to even see me. I was disappointed, and left. I would not recommend them."
1,"If I could give a big ZERO, I would. Last night my husband and I visited because we were craving BBQ. Usually we make the 30 minute drive to Chandler to go to Rudy's BBQ which is from Texas, but last night we were too tired. I ordered the brisket. It was grey and absolutely dry. The spicy beans were cold and the food plainly... sucked. My husband ordered their chicken sandwich. It was nothing special. A couple chopped up chicken pieces and bbq sauce. Totally disappointing!! I can not understand how this place stays in business, If you want GREAT BBQ, go to Rudys!!!!!!"
1,Waited in line for over 1 hour and they do not take reservations on busy days but somehow this gentleman who is the owners son happens to bring  5  friends in And bypass a long lineup . I am still in line waiting. !!! Jan 15 8:17 pm ... Poor service and no respect for loyalty of customers !! Last time ! Only staying cause I waited an hour
1,"We went there last evening the service was slow we waited over 25 minutes to get our food my burger tasted like the meat was about to spoil my ff were cold I  my burger bun was burnt asked them to take my meal off our bill due to it was uneatiable the ""manager said he would discount it but not take it off the bill due to the fact I had try ed to eat a few bites of the burget if this had been the first time this had happened  I could understand but we took my mother there for Christmas dinner and after we were seated never saw anyone again so after 45 minutes we hot up and left and it wasn't even busy so that says something"
1,"I usually NEVER leave reviews or complain. However, I Spent a $150 and 2 hours to get a shellac Mani-Pedi yesterday and it started peeling today. Not to mention the mani-pedi was just not worth that money. Absolutely disappointed with this. Not worth being a 5-star place if the quality is not good. Please listen to mine and other advice and don't go here for mani-pedi. Really not worth the money. They just wanted to get done with the last customer quickly. Extremely disappointed. I wish I could get my money back for this. Absolutely ridiculous when there is no work ethic."
1,"coming from a vietnamese person, this is probably the worst pho i've ever had.... the texture of the noodles weren't right and the soup lacked flavor. i dont think i'll be coming back :/"
1,Went to outback last night for my birthday and was disappointed. The hostess said it would be a 10-15 minute wait but a lady and her family came after we did and was seated before we were. Our server took atleast 10 minutes before approaching our table and took even longer to bring our bread and waters. The service was ridiculous and also being that it was a slow night. Not too many customers. Many were leaving when we arrived. Wasn't impressed
1,Rip Off.   Aaron pools was assigned to me by my home warranty.  I explained to the home warranty company that the pump motor was not working on waterfall .   I was told that it was covered because it was part of the original pool and not an add-on. And it is using the same plumbing.   I also made this very clear to Aaron pools when they called to set-up the appointment.  They asked that I leave the co pay  in the timer box because no one would be home at the time of service.  They came out as scheduled picked up the check and refused to fix the pump.  They said waterfalls are not covered.  I feel totally ripped off.  They knew ahead of time that they were going to be working on the waterfall.  All they did was steal $75.00 from me.
1,"I have had this internet service for the past 5 months. Every month they have added an up service with out our permission and I have had to call and spend 1 to 2 hours each month getting them to try and correct it to the original quote which was 39.95 for internet and nothing else. They have added phone service, charged us twice for a router and installations. It has went on and on. customer service is friendly but they simply just say ok and do nothing. I would look into another company before you sign a contract with them. As a business owner I see a huge breakdown in this company and am starting to question there integrity. I'm extremely bothered by the time I have waisted calling in repeatedly."
1,Horrible billing department. Always a problem every month. Lowered our services and were put on a contract when we downgraded. They charge per box per room. I manage a 400 unit apartment community and they tried to become our main service provider and I told them you suck. I hope they fail. Truly you guys suck. Cox was 100 times better. Also tech support at centuryLink is worthless but that goes along with everything else they do.
1,"Go with COX cable if you can.  This company is very incompetent with their billing processes.  They will continually add extra charges and forget to apply discounts.  They will require you to call them very often to get any discounts renewed, and if you forget you are stuck, no going back.  Worst company to deal with.  Try everything else possible before going here."
1,"One you receive your first bill you will see that there is not one other bill that will reflect your contracted rate.  If you want to speak to a CSR in the US you will need to wait on the line for approx. 30 mins to be told that a CSR can't help you. You will need to call billing, who will tell you that only a CSR can make adjustments your account. Your will NEVER RECIEVE a billing statement with your contracted amount EVER!!!  It is a nightmare.  My contracted rate was 169.00 Per month for premium bundle. My Payment history 11/2015 - 5/2016 has been $1322.00 making my contract rate actually 220.33 per month.  Check you bill every month and ask for your contract in writing..."
1,"This review is not specific to this location but to the overall company. If you can stay away from this company I would at all costs. About a year ago my fiancé and I moved to lake las Vegas and had to drop our cox service since they are unable to provide service in the lake Las Vegas community. When we first signed up we were told we could have the highest speed of Internet available but when the technician showed up to set up our internet he let us know we would not be able to get their highest internet speed. We accepted this. A few months later... Aka December 2015, we had an unexplained late charge added to our account. We attempted to contact customer service via online chat 3 times. During each chat session we were explaining that we had a history and proof of our payments being withdrawn we were hung up on. I decided after failed online chat attempts to give them a call. I was then hung up on 2 more times. So we ended up paying the late charge since everyone refused to help us... And kept hanging up on us. Recently our bill was increased (which I understand happens sometimes) but I was met with an idiotic customer service rep who told me how much my bill had increased... Which is information I provided him with at the beginning of the chat. He then told me after me asking multiple times if he could explain why my bill had increased, that I would have to call billing who then was unable to locate my account and told me I didn't actually have an account with them. After having a late fee added and our bill increasing an being met with incompetent customer service reps that are unable to transfer calls and look up your account info... I would never recommend this company to anyone. IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO WITH COX, please save yourself the trouble and go with them... Century link is incompetent and doesn't deserve your business."
1,"I never write reviews but I had to on Arrowhead and share my story because NO ONE else should EVER have to go through what I went through. Arrowhead is AWFUL! I delivered my son there in January and 7 hours later they realized THE EPIDURAL NEEDLES WERE STILL IN MY BACK!!!! They said, ""Oh, labor and delivery should have taken those out after your c-section."" I had an infection during labor so my son was in the NICU and they would not let me see my son until 7 hours after he was born. At first it was that I could see him when I had feeling back in my legs, then it changed to well we are switching nurses so we need to wait for that. Then it was well we need to change your antibiotics. Then it was well you need 4 vitals before you can go. The head NICU nurse tells me, a first time mother, ""your son is the 1 in 10 babies that scare us."" That is NOT something you tell a new mother and makes me feel like you don't know what you are doing. They didn't send my placenta out for testing. Our son stopped breathing and anytime the alarm went off WE HAD TO GO DOWN THE HALL TO FIND A NURSE!! That is UNACCEPTABLE! Later we witnessed our son having a seizure and HAD TO FIND THE NURSE to ask what was happening. That was the FIRST time it was documented in the paperwork we reviewed. It made me wonder if he had them before but it wasn't noticed because there wasn't a nurse around to see it.

They ended up transferring him to the county hospital without consulting with me first about which hospital I wanted my son to go to. First they were going to transfer him to Phoenix Children's hospital but then changed it at the last minute because the doctor they were talking to was at county. That's not a good enough reason. They were ill equipped and couldn't do anything for my son. He was transferred so they could do an MRI and other tests that he could not get done at Arrowhead. I would not recommend Arrowhead to anyone. They were so unorganized and not prepared. They were not professional. My son was finally transferred to Phoenix Children's Hospital where he later died. I will always wonder if something happened at Arrowhead to where he would be here right now if something was done differently. I will never go to Arrowhead again."
1,"Never use them. They have you pay for 10 mb and all I ever got was 6.2 on the speed test . They strung it out the whole year  . Making excuses for the problem . YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED !!!!! Glad to be rid of them .    Frank at the 1 800 number all but told me it was the best they could do .     Lousy , lousy ,lousy"
1,"I went into the store when i first signed up with some incompetent morons who lnockedr on my door. BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE and it's only turned to crap since.
I  have spent approximately THREE HOURS on the phone with MORONS. I  was told the first time that they had no record of my phone number. But it gets better.  The secons time the useless zombie told me she had NO record of my name or address. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? ??? Where were my checks going to every month then? all of this was because they can't help me with a password to hook up to my new Kindle.
Instead of everyone complaining about these jerks.  I  suggest that we all get together and launch a law suit against Century Link.  Apparently our complaints aren't getting us anywhere.  This is complete BULLSHIT"
1,"Excellent in making sales but could not live up to the services!!!! I feel really really bad for the technical support / personnel that works for this company. They are of a good character, kind and pleasant but unfortunately their so called  'SIGNAL'  for TV prism and internet services are as of the poorest and lowest ever!!! 

One time on a fight night we ordered PPV which costs about $70.00 and it freezes while the boxing fight is going on!!!!  My TV ALWAYS freezes and had to reset the whole DVR system. WORST WORST WORST WORST. Save your hard earned money and DO NOT get CenturyLink Prism."
1,"Went here for the first time today.read reviews and thought I'd try the beef bowl . Man was I disappointed, looked and tasted like they threw the beef into boiling water then threw it over rice.no flavor.won't be going back there again"
1,"The business oversells tickets by a far margin, even before show starts, so even if you bought in advance, if you aren't standing near entrance to show room, you might find yourself with no seat, and not even anywhere to stand as there are already a dozen or people sardined into the narrow back of the room.  We ended up leaving; we were quickly refunded, ....this must be common.   At least the bar has Blanche de Chambly, but they shouldn't sell more tix until the scheduled timeslot and the room settles.   Never again."
1,Worst service I've ever experienced from a company. I've had their internet service for a little over a month now. I've had to call 4 times already because of crappy connection speeds and each time they've had to send someone out to check the lines in the neighborhood. Not to mention the nightmare I experienced during the initial installation. Overall they've now wasted a good 20 hours of my time in the past month. I will be switching back to Cox tomorrow and cancelling their atrocious service.
1,"Never been to Freddy's before, so I thought I'd check it out. They have all kinds of ice cream and custard, which actually looks good, but I didn't try the desserts. I got the Original Double burger. It looked big in the picture. The patties are actually hammered down into thin meat wafers. They stick out of the bun by about an inch all the way around, but they are super thin and crispy. I'm more of a juicy burger type person, so I thought the burgers here sucked. No flavor and dry."
1,"Rudest, racist and the scariest server ever! I dropped off my parents here and left to look for parking around 11.10pm Sunday night and he would not let my parents order because apparently it was too close to 12am (closing time). I came in around 11.15pm and he was nice to me at first but when he saw my dad walk up to me, he immediately started being rude. I asked if I could have a minute and he rolled his eyes and said ""I don't have time, we are closing now"" so my little brother said to him  ""but you close at midnight"" and he said ""It's midnight now"" (it was only 11.15PM). I told him that it's not and he just asked me to hurry up. There was no one behind us and still had 45 minutes so I was confused but we ordered our food and sat down. The burgers tasted good but they were literally bite-sized. We were there until midnight and what's really pathetic is that he took 9 more customers after us without a fuss! The chef however was really quiet and polite so we thanked him and we left. 

My brother and I didn't want to create a scene (and plus I was really intimidated by the server) but we will be filing a formal complaint as my dad had a very obvious back injury and yet the server was so rude to him and to my mom. My parents are really polite, quiet and naive people so it was upsetting to see them eating in a hurry as they were quite embarrassed and distressed.

I rarely ever write a bad review but unfortunately, this was a really distressing incident, especially for my parents who did nothing but were discriminated against for very obvious reasons. 

I hope this is just an isolated incident but until the management follow up, we will not be returning."
1,"The Bartender was rude, on her phone the whole time. The drinks we ordered were brutal I don't think she knew what she was doing. We ordered a long island iced Tea in which we could only taste the tequila. The comedy was way over priced. 10$ for an hour of not so funny comedy. The show we attended ""Cage Match"" wasn't designed well. The comedians have a 20ishmin time frame to just improvise which sounds fun until they end up spending that time in comedy purgatory, not sure what they are doing. I'd never go to this bar again."
1,I have been a customer since Sept. 2016 They overcharged me and said they would correct the bill and email me the corrected amount. They never did. Instead they charged a late fee. Every month I call and Every month I am told it will be taken care of with credit and I will be emailed the correct amount and every month they fail to do so and charge me with late fees. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM!
1,"I am extremely disappointed with the customer service I have received today. Not only was I not informed at the time of account cancellation that I was going to be charged full price for my services as I lost my discount when I didn't have the account for a full month, but am being charged two extra days at a prorated full price of services I did not use. I spoke to a representative weeks before and was told I could opt to have my account cancelled when I returned my equipment. Not only was that not true, but I was not able to reach anyone through the phone number given to me by the store clerk that day and had to call the next morning. Then, I was informed it takes 24 hours for it to be cancelled, having them charge me an extra day of services I was obviously not using as I had already returned my equipment. So now, because of incorrect information provided to me, I am being charged these extra two days because of Century Link's incompetence. After being a loyal customer for over 2 years, I am shocked to be treated in such a manner. With them not ""believing"" me that I tried calling the day I returned my equipment and not being able to ""prove"" that I did not use the service those extra days (without my equipment and as I drove across the country, no less), they can't bother to credit me for those days. Must be nice that I was enrolled in autopay and they could just debit that automatically from my account, right? Did I mention I would've kept my services if they were available in my new state? I wouldn't return to Century Link as a customer knowing how they value loyal customers even I had the option again. 
I hope more people will shy away from using your services as I share this with social media."
1,"Very bad service. Did not deliver what I ordered. When I let them know, I was treated extremely rude. Will never use this company again."
1,"Only giving one star because I can't give less
Please please be aware making contracts over the phone!!! 1yr I stayed on a month to month after the yr was up I decided to stay a second year on a month to month again but this yr I'd pay $10more and again on a automated payment agreement. Then I move try to cancel and now they claim I'm on a year contract when I never agreed to nothing more than a month to month because I knew I would eventually move!! Two months after they charge my account with $191 without a notice!! And now that I've cancelled am told I'm in a contract when I paid almost a year 10more than the previous to be able to stay month to month so frustrating this means someone put me on a contract agreement in the century link department without my consent I feel EXTREMELY VIOLATED!!!!"
1,"The worst cable service ever! They came knocking on my door, saying I could try it for 30 days satisfaction guarantee free, I had the service for 5 days and then I cancel because it was horrible and they had the nerve to bill me $143.32."
1,"White ASU out of towner college peeps love this place, however for the rest of us?

The food is a step above Filiberto's. So for these ""bro dudes"" im sure it's like a turbo charged Taco Bell..Ok at best. Ate here twice only because they were open late and We were desperate.

 Service? Let me share my final experience here.. 

I asked if I could have salsa in container instead of them just flinging it all over everything like they do and the guy was all annoyed he had to take the extra tiring step of lifting up a plastic cup and putting some salsa in it, but did it for me, then I asked for extra salsa and one of the guys working with other guy told me ""No"" . Excuse me????

I want what I want and will pay for it, if you are going to tell me straight up ""No"" well then you lose! You just made those tacos for nothing and can shove it I am no longer eating here nor paying you. 

Who the #?!$ do you THINK you are??"
1,"Do not go here.  Terrifying.  The level of patient care we experienced here is abject. Patient neglect is rampant.  My elderly father unfortunately was directed here and went in about 8 am for shortness of breath, atrial fib, and pleural effusion.  He also sufffers from autoimmune kidney failure and severe sarcopenia.  I arrived at 5 pm and he was laying in his bed alone, no oxygen, no food ALL DAY(he was not npo), no one checking on him, has not been seen by a physician or checked on by a nurse.  The nurse are in a gaggle at the nurses station down the hall, talking about personal stuff.  They discharged him five days later without addressing either problem, and actually sent him home with an IV line hanging out of his arm.  He was too weak and out of it to notice.  When I called, concerned about this, it was a joke.  No level of concern and not responsive to phone calls and voice messages asking for help about this.  Told us to drive to an urgent care to have it removed, but did't offer to pay for that! Of course he ended up being sent right back to the hospital the next week, because Arrowhead Hospital so badly neglected addressing his issues.  He ended up at Banner Thunderbird this time and they addressed both issues. I cannot stress enough that if you have a family member in this hospital, get them transferred elsewhere or stay in the room at all times and advocate for care for your patient/family member.  Abrazo responded to a Facebook post about this saying they would like to talk with me about our experience, so I submitted my contact info the them as requested, and zero response from them after 2+ weeks.  A terrible, awful place to go for serious medical needs."
1,Food is good but dont use the coupon they cheat they only hive 2 dollars offf and  not the 5 . Upo  asking they said it was the tax but when i said taz was 13% they changed and said u can pay yhe full price.....
1,This is the second time in 2 months we have been here. The 1s time was as you would expect a husband spiral staff to be. Compassionate and nice. The second time was horrible!!! It depends on who you get. Some of the staff is awesome but many should find a different line of work.
1,"My husband was admitted last night. You can't ask a question without getting a defensive response. You feel like asking a question is such an inconvenience.  My questions were general, like what's the next step (day 2 in the hospital the ER doc followed up and didn't know my husband had a procedure done the night before), and what medication was being given (when I questioned why, ER nurse said its what was ordered and shrugged when I said my husband would have opted out if he knew what it was for, and continued to administer). I don't want to bash the hospital or staff, there are 2 sides to every story. Maybe they are understaffed. But the treatment was so disappointin. We delivered our 4 children here. It was never this bad. 
On the bright side we met a doctor that's a pancreas specialist.  He seemed to care about finding out the root cause instead of just treating the symptoms. Fingers crossed."
1,"I went to the emergency on Friday night around 8:00PM. I had an avulsion fracture and torn ligament. I had a CD with my x-ray on it and I already had it read by a doctor. My PCP had suggested me to go to ER, I was hoping to get some orthopedic advice. They wanted to x-ray again which I refused since I had an x-ray done just a few hours ago. They told me the x-ray shows an avulsion fracture, which I was already aware of.  Abrazo told me to go home and wait till Monday to see an orthopedic doctor. This advice costed me $1296! Also, no doctor came to see me, just a tech to put a fiber glass splint. These splints are $20 on amazon. I had an ankle fracture and she put the splint past the knee which further restricted movement. So I had to throw away that splint. Also all this utter waste of time lasted 3 hours! This place does not even deserves 1 star."
1,"Many lies, and if a class action suit doesn't surface, then there is definitely something wrong.
     The sales person was very polite but a sexual predator would not disclose that they will be raping you either. The initial paperwork given to me as this guy promised me stuff like first month being free, and quoted me prices no higher than $118, An American Express gift card for $100 and free installation. 
     I told the guy that my commitment with Dish Network was no longer under contract, and I was looking for service that would not send me pixelated signals. He verbally attested to me that I would be getting crispy clean service, while from my installation on March 3 and disconnect which I asked for on March 25th did not go in until March 30th, I had an instance of interrupted service at least once every time I turned on the television.   
      Now, after using there services for 21 days, my quoted price was not $118. It was more like $173. As far as the gift card, I have yet to receive it. The free installation is not true. The 30 day free trial is not true. And the quality of service is not true.
Even during  contacts with technical support, when one interruption lasted 6 minutes, and I initiated the call within 30 seconds, it took them 8 minutes to answer the phone, and they love to say, the best way for us to troubleshoot your issue is if you call when it happens. Can that be considered another lie? Are they promising to answer immediately when I call?
     I spoke to this lady from some sort of customer service and she says that I did not qualify for free installation or free month because I did not answer some survey. That information was not disclosed to me on my paperwork, from the installer or the guy that quoted me all that good stuff. 
     So, a mountain of lies and piss poor communication practices which they use towards their advantage. Let's see how the BBB sees this."
1,"***DO NOT USE CENTURYLINK***  The Customer Service provided by Centurylink is TERRIBLE!  Every time you have to call them you are placed on hold many times and your call will be transferred several times.  Each time your call is transferred you have to explain your request to the new person on the phone.  Nobody puts notes in the system and they will not have a record of you calling in before.

I moved out of my residence on 1-20-16 and called to cancel my service.  It took 30 minutes of hold time to request the cancellation.  It turn out that my service was not cancelled and I was billed for February and March because I was on auto-pay.  I called on 3-31-16 to request a refund and cancel the service again. They told me that they had no record of my call in January, I was placed on hold several times and transferred to 4 departments.  It turns out I was still not cancelled but they were able to find a record that new service was established by someone that moved into my old address so they agreed to give me a refund for 2 months. Now here is the kicker... I won't get a refund until after May 7th 2016!  The reason they gave me is that ""It is their system"" I was so frustrated  after being on the phone for 45 minutes with them, that  I just hung up. Please save yourself some frustration by using another provider, even if it costs a little more."
1,"Keep moving. 

Basement bar with a very hole in the wall - college dive bar feel to it. very cramped once inside especially when you're waiting to get into a show and the line up is in the middle of the bar. Very awkward. 

Went to see a show and saw the comedian insult a girl in the audience for 10 minutes and then he proceeded to go on a 10 minute pro rape rant. People were telling him to get off the stage but apparently the comedians produce their own shows so that gives them the right to stay on stage indefinitely and talk about how fun rape is. 

As other stated, seating is very tight and except for a couple of tables in the back of the room there's no place for drinks and no servers also which means you have to miss the show to go get another drink. 

Complained to management about the show just to let them know about it and offered to comp our next show. Never heard from them again. 

There are lots of other venues for comedy in Toronto so we will not be going back there and I advise you to do the same."
1,"The smell of Pinesol is OVERWHELMING! EW! Decided to take my food to go! Beef bowl is AMAZING! The menu has expanded, too."
1,"Took my husband into the emergency room today. He was feeling dizzy and has several different health issues. I tried to go with him but was told that the nurse was going to do a quick triage and he'd be back out. He disappeared from the room and I inquired about his where abouts. I was told that he was taken back, I couldn't go to him nor was I entitled to know what was going on. I waited in their germ riddled waiting room for an hour. Inquired again and received a very condescending comment, just rude. It's making me sick that I left him there. Made a phone call and they're just as rude over the phone as they are in person. If this is one of the best, I'd hate to see the worst this area has to offer."
1,"They got me in right away. I was there for 7 hers. I only got to see a PA not doctor. They diagnosed me incorrectly with a uti,was told to see a urologist, I waited from thur to mon getting worse.first thing urologist said didn't they tell you your liver enzymes are 10x what they should. Why did they give you macrobid worse thing for live.the hospital had made me an appointment are arrowhead health on thurs one week later.am thinking this hospital made multi booboos"
1,"Panda Express kicks this place's bum, and I don't even really like Panda."
1,"shows are always late and the quality of comedians isn't that great at all.

last time I went to see the Sunday Night Live show, showed up at 8:30 for a 9:00 show, they didn't let us in until 9:45. 

after the hour and 15 minute wait we walked in and there were no seats available, they said they oversold by mistake and wouldn't refund our money, they just gave me a voucher for a show in the future which I will never use.

I don't think ill be going there again. the business is completely unorganized and not worth it."
1,"Have had Century Link for 4 Years ( 2 in Arizona and 2 in Nevada). Hands down the most pathetic billing practices ever. Just since October last year, I have over 12 hours collectively of my own time on chat and on the phone with the billing, CS and Customer Loyalty Departments. The problem: The bill is never ever correct. Ever. Ever. It's not off by a few cents but by a lot of dollars. When I call to have it fixed it's just a struggle. I spend at least an hour on the phone per call on the average. 
The actual internet service is reliable and that's why I have stayed with them this long. However, the aggravation is ridiculous and no longer acceptable. 
I even got their Corporate address and wrote them a real letter and sent it via snail mail. No response. Nothing at all. Of course I would have emailed Corporate if they published an email address but there is none available. 
Hopefully their poor practices will catch up to them soon."
1,If I could give negative stars I would. My tech was supposed to be here Thursday. They didn't show up. Then Friday. They didn't show up. Then Saturday. You guessed it...they didn't show up again. Now they won't be here until Tuesday. Unbelievable. Stick with Cox. Do NOT sign up with CenturyLink.
1,"the service wasnt really good , it was dead slow..the price isnt really worth the food there. i got this pho called ""pho dac biet"" and the noodles was  like a ball of noodles stuck together. the rice there isnt good too. like its a small bowl of rice flipped over on the plate to make it look ""good"" but the problem is the rice looks nice but the whole plate of rice,meat and egg just looks weird like a face drew by a 2 year-old (no offense)"
1,"I went into the emergency room with asthma conditions, couldn't breathe. They took me right back and got me into a room, I was hooked up to an O2 stat machine for all of 30 seconds before disconnecting and they did not bother to come back in as I was coughing my lungs out. The nurse did check in about every 20 mins which was amazing but was offered tylenol and upon discharge my mother was told I refused cough syrup, which was never offered. I was told I have a virus and set loose. Come to find out 32 hours later - getting a second opinion as I was getting worse- I indeed had an infection, not only in my sinus's but in my lungs and coming out my eyes and still not able to breathe well. What a disappointment this hospital was. All could have been dealt with and placed on the proper medication the first time, had they paid attention for one minute. No one seemed to care that I was even there. Not only did they get my age wrong (said I was an 18 year old female, which I am 31) they did not even review my results with me (all they said is I was clear - which is not the case). Seems like they are there to collect your money and release you. What a terrible feeling to have when you go somewhere for help."
1,"Don't eat here if ur hungry. Haven't seen a burger joint with such SMALL burgers. 
Don't even buther with the industrial onion rings...
Fries are good. 
Too much ($15) for too little..."
1,"FIRST OFF... their fastest Internet speed is 18x slower than COX's second slowest speed. I'm totally serious. Every one from the phone reps, and in store service reps down to the installers are major assholes! It boggles my mind. Is being a dickhead a job requirement?!"
1,"The best way to describe centurylink: incompetent. Their advertised prices aren't the real prices, when you sign up online, they call you back to finish the contract, and immediately try to upsell you. I was so put off, that I cancelled my order then and there...

..or so I thought. They've been sending me bills ever since. I've contacted them 3 times over the last few months telling them I never received service, and each time they immediately apologize and say they fix their system...but the bills keep coming!

If you want a bundle, you might get lucky and not have any issues with centurylink, but I'd highly recommend going with another provider, any other provider really."
1,"I wish I could give negative stars. Worst company in existence. They provide phone line internet not cable internet, so right off the bat, its a dead tech. I tried to purchase fast internet and they were only able to provide 3mb speed because of the line, which is useless. Then I canceled service which is a joke. They set it up like this, you need to call a special department and file a form, which common practice is a 2 hour wait, possibly a disconnect or spotty reception in hopes you'll give up, then when you fill out the cancelation form, they lose it. SCAMMERS AND CHEATS!. All in hopes that they can rack up a bill while you think its cancelled and they sell it to collections when you refuse to pay a bill you should have never had. They actually consider this common practice and part of their bottom line."
1,All they care about is making money they do not care about their patients well-being I felt violated and used I will never go there again did not treat my injuries from me falling off my ladder also lied to you to get you to do what they want which is extremely unethical be very very careful going to this facility they are extremely conniving and I cannot caution you Enough they will lie to you
1,"I'm a big fan of good burgers and have wanted to try this place since it opened. However, when I finally did, I was very disappointed. I'd describe the burgers as mediocre, but the fact that this location is understaffed or inefficient is what made the experience really unpleasant. Having to wait for 2 burgers for 30 min after the order at 4pm when the place is practically empty is just not good enough for what's supposed to be essentially a fast food restaurant."
1,"Bad. We walked into the dingy establishment and were greeted by silence from both staff members. After perusing the seemingly impressive menu I ordered onion rings and the burogie - a burger topped with coleslaw and a latke. The order was ready in a few minutes and served to me on a tray absent of paper lining. As there was no condiment station I asked for some ketchup for the onion rings and the lady behind the counter handed me the squeeze bottle of ketchup used for burger prep. I sat back down to dig into the food and was completely disappointed. The onion rings were OK but clearly purchased frozen from a manufacturer likened to McCain. And the other portion of the meal was the dry, lacklustre ""micro-burger"" ($10!), which I'm sure could have sat very comfortably in the palm of my hand given its size. A total ripoff. Overall, way too expensive for what you get (you can't charge average prices for subpar fare), and the ambiance was cramped and unfriendly, with employees completely detached from and inattentive towards the customers. I would say that this place may only potentially merit a visit (for takeout) during hours when the daily special offer is valid (2 for 1 burgers until 5pm), and only if you happened to be very close by. But I wouldn't return."
1,"Not really anything new to add here. Same crappy customer service as everyone else. I tried to change my service and waited 6 days for a technician to show up. I talked to customer service 14 different times trying to find out where the tech was and was promised he would show up in a four hour window each time. I was promised $20 three different times and $35 one time for the inconvenience, and of course never saw any of it.

My one recommendation if you make the mistake of trying to get this pathetic excuse to give you internet service is GET CONFIRMATION NUMBERS FOR WHEN THEY PROMISE TO GIVE YOU CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CREDIT. Good luck."
1,Absolute worst!!! We received our modem but they said they had to send a tech to set it up.. ok fine no problem a week later still nothing. The rep said we were on the list with an appointment just the tech never showed and they didn't know why! What! Really!! Honestly feel like going back with Cox
1,This is the worst Japanese-American restaurant I have ever been to. Food is literally something my Japanese friends can make literally 10 times better. Food taste really bland and disgusting. Don't ever eat here because they over charge for meals here and the quality is terrible.
1,"Interesting experience.  Never again.  We went in to the ER area.  We're vacationing so we weren't familiar with this hospital.  Empty waiting room.  Went to the front desk and asked for Urgent Care.  Person at the desk gave us forms, took our $20.00 Urgent Care Co-Pay.  She was a little bit vacant, no indication they didn't do Urgent Care there.  Short wait we went into a Triage room and met with a PA.  Pink Eye, fine we knew that but needed the prescription medication.  That takes a visit to a Doc.  
  Month or two later we get a bill for an ER visit.  Not Urgent Care, $250 C0-Pay.  Some hospitals do have Urgent Care and ER in the same location.  Not this one.  We didn't dirty up any of their ER rooms, just a Triage room meeting with a desk.  Still thinking it was an Urgent Care.  
   Final bill was $830.00 from the hospital and $310 from a MD we never did see.  It was I'm sure for his PA.  For a $1140 total bill you can get a prescription.  They code it as OP ER/Urgent???   I complained and the reasoning was ""It happens frequently""  How about fixing it?  Post a sign or have your front desk person wake up and tell people it's not an Urgent Care.  Pretty simple but less profitable."
1,This is the worst run company I have ever done business with. For the 2 years I had the service there were problems problems problems. And it is impossible to get any help by phone. If you email or chat they tell you that you need to call in. I canceled my service and was told that I would be receiving boxes to return there equipment in and after waiting 2 weeks I called in which took 2 days to get to some one to talk to. Only to be told that since my account was closed they could not help me and oh by the way the boxes were never sent out. I asked for a manager and was told there was no managers. Wow. When I asked what I was suppose to do with their equipment they told me to take it to a Centurylink store. Too bad they didn't offer that to me when I canceled. The customer service is the worst that I have seen. I hope they treat their employees better than their customers but by the looks of the store I went to to return it is doubtful.
1,"OMG Many of you have heard me rant about how horrible CenturyLink is in the past - here we go again. Yet another reason to say AVOID THEM LIKE THE PLAGUE! Just when I'd gone enough consecutive months without downtime or bill problems and started thinking maybe ... JUST MAYBE I would stay with them when my contract expires in May ... they go and shove their foot in their asses again. They knock on my door offering me a 30 day free trial of Prism TV. They'll get me out of my DirectTV contract AND install all brand new wiring, provide me with a new modem, faster internet, more channels and if I love it and decide to keep it the monthly fee will be less than I was paying with DirectTV AND they would give me a $100 American Express gift card. Too good to be true right? It really was.

Problem 1: The 30 day free trial wasn't really a 30 day free trial it was a money back guarantee which means they want me to pay for my internet and my last month of directtv and my first month of prism and then next month they'll credit my bill for the overpayment. Instead of going down $60 as promised, my bill went up $80.

Problem 2: I knew that my internet would be down for awhile while they installed the new wiring and set up the Prism TV so that didn't surprise me and I was able to schedule it for a day that was convenient for me (i.e. not during work hours). However, the Prism worked for ONE day and then froze. A week and a half later when they finally sent someone out to fix it (on a week day during work hours and no, they wouldn't let me schedule it like I did for the install) I was without internet for over 3 hours.

Problem 3: I paid for the modem/router that I had before Prism TV but they needed me to use a fancy new modem/router combination for the Prism and when they did the install they ""stole"" my old modem/router. I can't find it anywhere and they have no record of the repair guy taking it on accident.

Problem 4: I ended up canceling the Prism because it lagged like crazy, the menu options and programming were insanely confusing, and the picture kept pixellating. When I canceled it they told me they would need to mail me a new modem/router to replace the Prism modem/router because it wouldn't work right once the Prism service stopped. I asked them if that meant my internet was going to go down, they said no just keep using the Prism router until the other one gets there ... the next day, no internet and when I called them they said ""well you need a new modem, the one you have doesn't work anymore"". I asked them if they could cancel the one they were going to send me and I would just go to my local store and pick one up so I didn't have to wait three days without internet for the new one to get here ... their response ""we're not sending you one, the order to have one sent to you was never entered into the system"". So I drive my happy ass down to the local store, pick up a new modem (still no credit/replacement/acknowledgement of the one they stole) which I have to lease from them for $6 a month and the internet STILL doesn't work so I call them again and they so 'oh yeah we need to send a technician out to switch you back to the old wiring because the new wiring doesn't work without Prism either"" (NO MENTION OF THAT DURING THE FIRST 1/2 DOZEN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM) so I end up without internet for the entire rest of yet another work day waiting for the service guy to come out and fix my internet.

Problem 5: I got my bill today, almost $200. TWO HUNDRED. Why? First of all, because they billed me for the so called ""free trial"" of Prism TV. Secondly, because they also billed me in advance for the DirectTV service that I will NOT have next month despite the fact that it was canceled two weeks ago. So I call them AGAIN. Oh but that's not all! It's not showing up on my bill but when I called in they also informed me that they're charging me $300 for the Prism equipment which they show as unreturned.

Where to even begin?!?!?!

So they ""can't"" remove the Prism TV charge from my bill that's due on April 1st because it wasn't really a 'free trial' it was a 'money back guarantee' so I have to pay them for the service even though I had it for 2 weeks and for 11 of those 15 days it was frozen and didn't work and then they'll give me an $80 credit on my NEXT bill which will print on April 9th.

I had to call DirectTV about their portion of the bill because CenturyLink said they have no control over what DirectTV bills me for even though I signed up for DirectTV through CenturyLink and all of the charges show up on the same bill which is sent to me by CenturyLink.

(There's a whole lot more.  I'll try to finish in comments or you can view the full review on Google but long story short, they want me to pay $500 so they can credit me $477 back on my next 15 bills)."
1,"Soda machine is down. Girl at the counter waited until we finished ordering our entire meal to let us know, all of our meals coming with drinks. No carbonation, no ice unless you go to the counter and ask for it. Talk about frustrating, probably would have gone elsewhere had we known before we ordered everything. Very underhanded."
1,TERRIBLE customer service!  Warning!  Stay away!!!  We scheduled an install to switch over from Cox for internet and they set a date for a Saturday from 8am to noon.  At 11:00 am we got nervous and called in asking if they were still coming.  They told us they don't install on Saturdays and can't switch from other carriers on those days so we would have to take time off work during the week to re schedule.  We told them no thanks!  We are staying with Cox!  ZERO respect or customer service from this horrible company!  Go with Cox!
1,"Centurylink is bar none the worst company i have ever dealt with, even among cable companies which is really pathetic.

I called them 3 times, and they never updated their notes or kept record of my call. Everything each customer service rep promised was never done or followed through with

This company is terrible"
1,"I had a heart operation to replace my aorta, the surgeon Dr Kirshner was the BEST EVER, I mean 10 stars, but he uses Arrowhead Hosp, and the staff of nurses there are the worst I have ever experienced in 53 years , if I had to do over (God forbid) I would have Doct Kirshner, do operation at Thunderbird Hosp. Sherry the highly regarded nurse (by her own standard) comes in after I had been pushing call button for 10 min, they had put me in a chair to sit up and my tubes had gotten under my foot I didn't want to step on them so I was having to keep my foot elevated to do so, my foot and leg after 10 min of holding it up was very painful, I was even start to yell out of room for help, a great nurse  (Russ) there came in moved the tubes and pushed the WORKING call light and left room took about 10-15 seconds, so Sherry comes in and starts by ""what's your problem"", I try to tell her about call light and she blows me off saying no no the lights work, and I try to explain the button I was pushing didn't work, this go's on and on not to get too detailed she is yelling at me and now I am really upset that she is calling me a lier, Sherry ends up calling in my surgeon (calls in one of the best and In Demand heart surgeons in the state)  for a broken call light. In the end I almost moved Hosp for recovery (wish I would of) Sherry was told none of the call lights on the beds in ICU worked that's why they, installed the buttons on a cord, Sherry didn't even know that, I feel this ICU unit, have a old single women in menopause that abuse patiences.  Do NOT go there. Warning"
1,"Do not switch to Centurylink! I repeat. Do not switch to Centurylink! 

Where do I start. Ok. Well, I setup centurylink internet for my parents because they were looking for a more affordable option than Cox. Signed them up for a promotional offer and 2 year contract according to the rep. Asked the rep several tines if my parents would receive the same price each month for 2 years under the contract. The answer was yes.

Within a year of the contract the internet speed was marginal at best. Not as consistent as Cox but more affordable through the offer. 

After a year I get a call from my parents that the bill went up $40! Call Centurylink and they tell me that the offer was only for a year. They couldn't renew my offer and on top of that charge my parents an additional $15 to disconnect the line. As far as I'm concerned they are a bunch of con artists. If you are thinking about switching services thd best combo that you should get is Cox for internet (even though they are a little higher) and Direct TV for video."
1,"If I could put no stars that still wouldn't do this company any justice. I am tired of getting ripped off by cable/internet companies and I will NEVER use this company again. I am in touch with a high rate of new ""Las Vegans"" every year and I will make sure to tell them to never use CenturyLink. I already had problems with their customer service but to have someone in the retention center YELL at me because I inquired about the high fees for ""termination"" which is not my fault I have to terminate is unacceptable. Every person I've talked to has been unprofessional and they do not have to worry about my services ever again."
1,"Poor service is what you get when you come here. The food may be good, but expect to wait exceptionally long for a basic burger and fries. Also the female server who served us was extremely rude and overcharged us. No apology or acknowledgement of her mistake."
1,"DON'T WALK. RUN AWAY. 

I thought the previous posts were just bitter customers. Not true.

Centurylink will waste your time.

After three failed installation appointments, I am cancelling my services today as representatives lied to me on several occasions about being serviced.

I made an appointment last Saturday and waited 7 hrs for a technician to come only to find out that no technicians work on Saturdays.

I was then rescheduled and given an exact appointment time only for the technician to lie and say that he came out when he did not.

I spoke to a representative who then went and dispatched another technician to come out on today, a Saturday.

I said, ""what happened to not serving homes on a Saturday?""

To which the rep said, ""Oh, he'll make an exception for you.""

Do the math. The technician never came.

Back to my opening statement, do not walk. Run from this company.

They will tell you a lie with a sweet voice then waste your time with no apology and no empathy."
1,"Just as bad as MedPost. Took my $150 copay and offered me nothing except a referral. They never even let me see a doctor.

***UPDATE***

I received a call from a member of the ""care continuity"" team who wanted to know more about my experience. After explaining everything (by the way, I forgot to initially mention that the PA they gave me knew nothing about my issue and spent most of my visit looking things up on her phone; eventually she told me that everything was ""normal"" ...yet still gave me referrals for several specialists), the lady I spoke with assured me she would call me by the end of the day (which we all know is pretty much universally translated as ""you will probably never hear from us again""), and that was the day after I posted my review. I called again the next day and left a message. Still no callback. 

So let's review the facts. An urgent care facility advised me to visit the ER. The ER would not let me see a doctor, even after the inept PA knew nothing about the male anatomy, spent the majority of my visit conferring with Dr. Google, and instead of letting another professional examine me, told me everything was normal and sent me away with referrals for specialists (why would I need them if everything was normal?), and made sure to collect the $150 they so rightfully earned by insulting me with the level of care I'd expect from an intern. 

Another fine example of a company looking at patients as dollar signs and not providing any decent level of care. I will be filing a complaint with the Arizona Medical Board."
1,"If I could give it less than one star I would.  NO medical staff member washed or alcohol cleaned their hands upon entering my room.
My IV was removed without gloves.
The ER doctor spent more time training and talking to the student MD who was shadowing him than to me the patient.  I felt like a dummy laying on the table, being used for training purpose.
In reality I was a living breathing human being who should have been acknowledged and treated with a bit more respect.
No problems though with them coming into my room to collect my deductibles.  
I was discharged with NO follow up care information."
1,"I was hoping for more out of this place. After passing it by for the past two years my girlfriend and I decided to check it out as part of our Valentine's day outing. 

It's a basement local and it can feel quite cramped in there as the waiting room/bar area is quite small.  The line up for the main stage is right beside the bar which is not ideal to say the least as everyone waiting in line to get in is in the way of everyone else coming and going at the bar.  If you didn't think to ask the ticket person  which stage your show is on you're left having to ask around until someone sorta knows because there's no indication once you're inside. 

The bar itself has a hole-in-the-wall/college bar feel to it. Beers are cheap and the servers are very friendly so there's that going for it. 

Show started late which seems to be the norm. Inside - chairs packed as close to each other as possible in front of the stage. If you're drinking and sitting you either have to hold your drink or put it on the floor and hope no one knocks it over because there's no tables to put your drinks on in the main area. Also no servers during the show so you have to get up and miss part of the act if you want another drink. 

All this was irrelevant at the time because we were out for a good time and about to see a show. 

THE SHOW - I'll say that the MC was terrific and all the comedians that night were great except for one guy. I'm not sure if he was drunk or high or both but it darken the mood of the whole place and on valentines day you think he would have eased up. His 5+ minute tirade on a girl got to be quite uncomfortable and I can't imagine being that couple on a night out on Valentines. But he then continued on for 10 minutes on a pro rape rant that got people telling him to get offstage which only fueled his resolve. Crap comedians happen but he should have been pulled off the stage earlier.

That comedian was no where to be seen after the show - I wonder why? 

I emailed management later to briefly state our dissatisfaction with the comedian and not asking for anything. He emailed right back apologizing and offering comp tickets to another show. I thought that was a super way of handling the situation and that was the last we heard of that. No comp tickets and further emails were ignored. We really couldn't care less about the money or getting free tickets but if you're going to offer something follow through with it. 

Will never go back again and will make sure to not recommend this place to friends. There are lots better venues in Toronto for comedy so do yourself a favor and skip this place."
1,"When I asked the bartender what was on tap, she said ""those 10"" and pointed towards the taps insinuating that I was to leave my seat and go look for myself. In all my years never had I had been told to go look for myself. Being a former bartender myself, I was apauld. Sorry, you lost my business."
1,"Mediocre product, and ever changing bill, random charges for no reason, having to waste and hour of my life every month or so with their terrible customer service... I can't wait to switch when my contract is up.   

I was told to call back on a certain date to ""renew my discounts."" This already annoys me because it is simply a waste of my time.  Either way, I called on that day, using a reminder in my phone,  and was told I'd called too early.  Fine, I called back on the new day I was given.  Now I was told I'd called too late and my bill had gone up by 50%.

I told them the story and they ""cleared it up.""  Next bill, I have $90 in charges extra.  I call again and am told this is the pro-ration for passing my deadline.  I inform them that I'm not paying that and to pass me to whoever it is I have to talk to to deal with that.  This charge is put down as ""disputed.""  

That was in may of last year.  The charge is still on my bill and now I'm getting a $7 late fee each month for not paying that.  I call again and tell them what is going on.  I'm told the late charges will be removed and I won't get them anymore.  I keep getting them and not paying them, nor the $90 charge because it is in dispute and I was told not to pay it by their rep.  It is now almost February and the dispute is still going on.  

My remote stopped working after almost 4 years of service abd when I called to get a replacement, I was told it would cost me $10.  I told them that it was the least they could do for my troubles to send me a free remote, allowing me to actually use their product.  They did, however they sent it to my old address that I haven't lived at for almost 2 years and their company installed my service at my new address.

I called back and they apologized and told me they would overnight me a remote.   Cool.  Next bill, I'm charged for 2 remotes at $10 each and an overnight delivery charge of $15.  

This company has the worst customer service I've ever seen.  Never on my life have I dealt with a company that made it so hard to keep their service.  

I can't wait to switch."
1,"Don't do it. I promise you will regret switching to Centurylink. I don't even have the energy to relay all the drama and problems I have had with them since switching from Cox. TERRIBLE is too nice a word for their customer service. I am moving out of state and needed to cancel my home phone which was the last thing I still had with them (I dropped the internet several months back as it was useless). I kept the phone because they cut the cable phone line when they installed theirs, and I was told I couldn't keep my number if I went back. I was gleeful calling to disconnect thinking they could never annoy me again. Then they tell me there is a $16 disconnect fee. I have moved a dozen times and NEVER been charged to disconnect a home phone by any other company. Just another example of their terrible business practices."
1,It's cheap but the food kinda sucks. Both the burrito and the tacos were kinda soggy. I like spicy sauce but they put a ton of it so it was hard to eat. And the chicken was very dry.
1,"Gigabit salesperson came to my door, talked me into a 3 year commttment.  I was considering selling and the guy said no problem, just move the service.  I asked what if there wasn't gigabit service where I moved, they said they'd waive the etf.

Fast forward 6 months and I've sold my home, put the service on hold while I move, and asked to transfer my gigabit.   They only offer ""up to"" 10 mb at my new address 4 miles from my old address.  They say I didn't get a promise of gigabit, just ""service"".

I talk the buyers of my old home to take over my account, call Centurylink, they say they can't just move the service into the new buyers, they have to mail a letter.  I ask for email, fax, anything, no, the ""procedure"" is to mail the letter.  I tell them the buyers are jumpy and might switch to Cox if they can't get internet right away and I ask when the letter would be here, they say it should be there by Friday (it was Tuesday).  I say lets go ahead and turn service back on, I don't want the buyers to back out of the deal.

I schedule service to be turned back on Thursday afternoon.

Installers don't show up Thursday, letter doesn't show up Friday.  I'm on hold for hours where Centurylink keeps telling me they had previously turned on the service so didn't need to send an installer even though I had told them multiple times that I had moved all the equipment to my new house and the fiber line was damaged so needed an installer.  They charge me 50 for the installer (which I thought was fair to avoid the ETF).

They get the service, the buyers are grumbling but kids can do homework via internet.  Letter never comes.

Following week, they agree to send another letter.

Following week, I beg them for an alternative to the mythical letter, they agree to let me come to a local office to pick up a letter.

I'm charged another 150 for service, I'm now at 200 total, I spend an hour at the store fighting with the guy to give me the letter. They give me the letter to transfer yellowpage service.  I say screw it, I'll fill it out, cross out anything related to yellowpages, get it notarized, and go to the buyers.

The buyers say ""nah"", they'll get their own service.  They say its been a hassle, they're upset.  

I say screw it, just put me on vacation mode, its cheaper than the ETF, they say they'll waive the ETF (after I file with the FCC of course complaining).

I agree to let the service get cancelled if the fee gets waived.  They send me a bill for 350.  I call them, they say they can see where the manager waived the ETF, then explains that the ETF waived was the ""extra"" ETF above and beyond my contract amount.

""I needed a manager to waive portions of the ETF that were above my contract ETF amount anyways?""

3 months later, total cost, 350 + 150 for 500 dollars and about 11 hours of being on hold and 1.5 hours of sitting in an office.  And being repeatedly told ""I could just keep the service at my new house for the steller 10MB of internet"" to avoid half of the fees."
1,I had never had a bad experience until today! The ER staff was beyond rude and disrespectful I have had major stomach pain that yes has gone on for months. They treated me horrible I left in tears. The nurse comes in did you take your IV out no I told you 20 minutes ago it came out. I left hurt and helpless. The nurse Mrs. Wiley was condescending and rude then the doctor Galskpy was even worse. Nobody deserves to be treated like that.
1,"Literally the worst company I've every dealt with in my life!  That's saying quite a lot with today's low standard bar for customer support.  We thought we hated Cox and decided to try switching to CenturyLink.  Scheduled 4 setup appointments that ALL got rescheduled until they finally showed up on the 5th appointment just to tell us they couldn't hook us up because of something to do with the outside lines.  So supposedly some guys came and worked on the outside lines several days later, then after 2 more scheduled appointments that they were a NO SHOW for, (no call, no apologies) and after us having to call them we finally just thew in the towel and said we don't want your service.  Cox started looking a whole lot better after dealing with CenturyLink for 6 weeks of hell.  After all was said and done.. they never even hooked up one wire in our house then had the nerve to send us a bill for our first month of service (which I was told would be free BTW) and this was for a service that NEVER GOT CONNECTED.  Stay away from these fools... they are a horrible company."
1,"i have absolutely no clue how this place gets good reviews.... in fact, i am so dumbfounred i think i'm gonna give them one more chance.  i was there late at night and maybe the cook was new but i am still upset with myself for NOT complaining... i had to catch the subway.  My burger was BEYOND EDIBLE.  IT WAS SO GREASY AND OILY and it basically fell apart in the bun.  Sloppy joe's are more solid than that burger i had.  I felt bad so when i think he was the owner turned his back i wrapped up 40% of what was left and threw it in the garbage.  i even felt kinda sick on the subway from the grease. Beyond gross.... it was like someone was pulling a prank on me.  i will go back but i hope other reviews are sincere and not friends of the owner.  Lastly, i am far from the whiney, snooty complaining type..... but i had to leave a review... i mean eating only 60% of my burger is unacceptable."
1,"Not impressed!

I decided to try this place one night; I ordered a burger , fries , and a small custard. The burger was greasy and the flavor was dominated by their mystery sauce. Fries were too thin for my taste. As a result of being thin, they soak up a lot of oil. The custard was good, but too heavy after the feast of grease.

The meal cost me $12 bucks. Do yourself a favor and go to in n out, your wallet and taste buds will be better off."
1,"I ordered the utility combo and they forgot my fries and drink. Also the bread from the sandwich was soggy. I got it delivered and when I called them to tell them I'm missing items they first just said so like they didn't care then they blame the new staff that they hired. The food is also overpriced. Never again will I order from here, and I'll make sure to tell everyone not to order from here."
1,"The absolute worst company on earth. Poor extremely poor service!! Horrible customer service on all ends, billing, tech, and customer care!! They will hang up on you just to avoid having to deal with your issue, trust me it has happened 7 times, I have spent at least 30 hrs on hold or speaking with these people because of bad internet, or frozen screen, or checker boarded screen, or just plain black screen!! They lie about their deals to get you sign up and then all the sudden your 24 month deal disappears and your bill is 150 percent more than what you were quoted and when you call they say that special never existed???!!!! WTF!!! Please do not get this service!!! I am doing you a huge favor by giving you a heads up!!! And to top it off you can't cancel, they threaten an early termination fee for both prism and Internet!! This company is absolutely criminal!!!!!"
1,"Finally, I'm all setup to write my first review.  This used to be one of my favorite place for traditional Vietnamese food. However, I've been quite disappointed with the service. We ordered some pork wrap #12 for my wife and I and two little kids. We ordered the medium size and was only given dipping sauce. So we asked for to additional sauces for my kids. 

During the meal, the portion of vermicelli was very little and was enough for the wraps, we asked for more. They kindly gave us some additional. 

When we asked for the bill, it has the #12 order and a drink we ordered. The bill has only those two items (that we ordered) and a total. No tax portion etc. I added up the price and it didn't add up. I kindly called one of the staff and told them that there maybe some mistake be abuse the total was actually more then what's indicated. They said there's nothing wrong because it also includes the 2 extra sauces that I have asked for and also the extra vermicelli. 

I was very disappointed that they would charge you for the sauce and not letting me know that they are extra cost when I asked for it. Also they didn't even put that down on the bill. No tax portion, no extra items that was also charged on the total. 

I was going to give extra tips but after realizing what they did, I decided not to.  I would gladly give a 4 stars to this restaurant but now I'm only giving a 1. Shame on you for charging extra sauces and not notifying the customer before hand and charging them on the bill without identifying the extra charges."
1,"Yes the decor is terrific; retro, old, vintage. 
That sandwich is gross.  I'm not a big fan of bologna to begin with (not sure who is...), I felt almost bad because the staff is pretty watchful, but I couldn't get through half of it. Fried bologna yuck! Not for me."
1,"I've been a customer of theirs since 2010, after switching from Cox cable. This summer i experienced my first of two waves of the worst customer service I've ever had in my life. I have called 4 times to schedule an install at my new house and they keep telling me to call back. Meanwhile Cox cable is knocking on my door telling me they can install in 2 days. Why am I begging centurylink ? They obviously do not care about their long time customers. I would sign a 15 year contract if they let me !! But they don't even want to install it."
1,"I came to the restaurant first time last night at around 9:20ish. Heard a lot of reviews and people were talking about it. With all the high expectation and excitment I came, I am sorry to say your service is below below waay below average. The food was good I really liked the meat in comparison to HERO burger your meat was a lot mroe delicious and tasteful. I won't lie on that. But I don't know if your staff has issues in kitchien, with each other, because they are working over time, or they are tired and it is sunday night, or they have a bad life but don't bring it to the customer. nothing is perfect and noone is perfect. I am paying $15 for a meal i expect a smile on the persons face, a thank you and not to kick me out at exactly 9:59 (yes i looked at the clock) that is extremely RUDE. You can ask me we are closing, you can wait clearly just WAIT as I was done.. but no your staff kicked me out. I was actually havING a good time with my family and left with a bad taste in my mouth. Not from your food but from your service. I know for a fact I WOULD NEVER ever refer you to anyone not bcus your food was great but your service was so bad it pissed me off.  i am so upset. I was watching the tv and laughing with my frends and family while walking out.  Your staff come in my face takes the remote and SHUTS THE TV DOWN.. SERIOUSLY? This is what you do when the customer is looking at the tv and talking about it. you should train  your employees. i don't give a shit if its 9:59 or 9:58 if a customer is sitting there.. just wait until they are gone.. bcus you gotta clean up anyway. thats the problem with HALAL places. either their service is bad, food or they are high priced for no reason. i thought you were worth it but i guess everyone falls in one category.. I hope NOONE has to experience this"
1,Century link came to my House and told me for $45 a month I could get internet service. Since i was paying 66.99 with Cox I jumped at the idea. Just got my first bill after all the service fees setup fees and what not...and guess what...Its not $45 a month its 64.30. Not much difference. Thanks Century Link.
1,THE WORST SERVICE ON THE PLANET..!! I have had them for about 6 years and every time you call them for even the most minor problem everything gets screwed up..!! I'm going back to COX asap..!!
1,"Ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and a drink. The burger was very poorly seasoned and overcooked, the bun to burger ratio was very poor( meaning too much bun, not much burger. The bun was also poorly toasted, and tasteless. Overall, the burger tasted like nothing, even with all the condiments. The onion rings were very greasy, not a pleasant experience. The wait time was way too long, and since it was an open kitchen I got to observe the process. The cooks were very unorganized and obviously lacked experience. 

Definitely, not a repeat, even if you are in the area and craving a burger, go somewhere else!"
1,"Never go to this location. Went there last Tuesday around 9:30 pm with a group of 12 people & young kids to grab a quick bite to eat. As soon as we got there the cashier named Alfonsina said it was for to go orders only. Mind you that this place doesnt close till 10pm. There was another family ahead of us & they ordered and sat to eat there dinner in one of the booths. Thats when the rude cashier agreed we can stay & eat in but in one condition only in certain spots.  3/4 th of the eating area was already cleaned with the chairs stacked on top of thr tables. There were other customers coming in & she turned them away. I dont think the owner would appreciate that. While we were eating Alfonsina was mopping around our area with the strong scent of pine sol. I thought that was disgusting but I guess it was alright for Yoshinoya establishment to add scents to their food. To make this visit even worse the same rude cashier, cleaning girl Alfonsina announced to our group it was 10:00 & there closed. She kicked us out & we didn't even finish our food. We had young kid's & they didnt get to finish there dinner too. Our bill for this horrible dinner was $75, I think Yoshinoya should give us time to finish. Alfonsina was so eager to get us out she even touched our food cartoons to throw away. I repeat NEVER go to this Yoshinoya in Las Vegas off of Maryland. Especially when Alfonsina is on."
1,"I was frustrated with Cox and them not honoring my old price structure when I moved.  So, I decided to try Century Link at my new address.  Both are horrendous at customer service and they both lie to you.  Century Link told me prices and I asked for them in writing and they wouldn't do that, just verbal promise on the phone.  I liked the pricing so I switched from COX to CENTURY LINK.  Then I call to confirm my set up and pricing the day before installation, since I got no written confirmation.  All of a sudden the internet speed was slower and the speed I agreed to wasn't available in my area.  The price was also much higher.  So, I agreed to a new plan and a new higher price than originally quoted.  The installation guy was the only honest and good thing.  He showed up on time and installed the correct products.  Then I got my first bill, it was so confusing and I called to see what my monthly price was and it was $10 higher than the second promised on the phone.  I was also promised a $100 Visa Card with new service if I applied on-line.  I did apply on-line for the Visa card and have a printed confirmation dated 2-14-14.  It was supposed to be 8-10 weeks to get the card.  It is now 5-19-14 and after several e-mail attempts and phone calls to Century Link I finally get to a live person who says my card is in decline status.  She informs my she doesn't know why as she too can see I applied on 2-14-14 and that I have all the services required.  I finally cancelled Century Link in 2016 and that was a nigh mare as well.  I returned equipment to the local Henderson NV store and called to cancel.  Guess what I got billed for almost 6 more months till they finally credited me for cancelled service.  During the entire 2 plus years of service I had nothing but billing problem after billing problem."
1,"I suppose if I was REALLY homesick, I'd like this place.  The rice was terrible, and the vegetables were foul--just like my mother makes them.  For not much more than the same price I can go across the street to East Boy and get a decent chicken bowl with green beans, seaweed salad and nice rice.  Yoshinoya is the first place around UNLV that I won't bother to return to."
1,"CenturyLink?  Run, run very fast away from this company!  I've been dealing with them since Jan. 2013 in a very negative manner.  They've sent me to two different Collection Agancy's, seeking $715.77, all of which was a total mistake on their part.  Just today, July 07, 2015, I finally got a confirmation from CenturyLink that they have released me of all charges.  2 1/2 yrs it took me to get this issue resolved...that's really bad, BAD business!  I wouldn't go with CenturyLink if they were the last telecommunications business on Earth!  They lied about their service, they (conveniently) lost conversations over the phone with me, their service was more than below adequate.  Prism TV was blurry, Internet service was DSL (which they never told me it would be when I signed up), and they had no problem with continual harassment via Collection Agency's.  I will NEVER, EVER recommend CenturyLink to anyone...friend, family or otherwise.  RUN people....RUN away from CenturyLink!"
1,everytime i'd drive to azusa my roomie would tell me i HAD to stop by west covina to get a beef bowl from yoshinoya. i never did.. but i saw that this one had opened up! i got the #1 beef and chicken combo bowl with veggies and mac salad. i couldnt decide between the beef and chicken so this was perfect for me. i tried the beef first.. there wasnt much to taste. the chicken was a little better.. had a little more flavor but there was a lot of skin and not as much meat as i would have liked. both meats and the sauce were awfully bland. the mac salad was really tangy. i prefer L&L mac salad but they are two totally different recipes so thats not fair to compare i guess. i wont come back here to eat.. just not my cup o tea.
1,"This is a huge scam... The customer service, after your hour wait, is usually terrible. Some people are nice, but they're not allowed to help you. I think the owners insist the employees lie or keep secrets, because they KNOW they're terrible business owners. Our service cuts out every single day at least once a day. Our ""fast"" internet doesn't allow for streaming half the time. Our bill is over 300 a month, and if you try to change it, they charge you over 100 in fees for changing in the middle of your billing cycle. But you don't see your last bill until the middle of the next cycle. We've tried 4 times now go fix our issues, and end up paying more each month! We're done. We had Cox, which was expensive, but at least they have customer service. I've spoken with them directly, they're business partners with DirecTV. Just don't do it! They should be put out of business. It's a shame."
1,Never use this hospital. I've been there and my mother was taken there. They have to be one of the worst in the city.
1,"Always love Freddy's food, but tonight on Monday oct 1 I went through the drive through with my girlfriend and she specifically asked for no whipped cream and cherry on her concrete. After waiting at the window for 15 mins, my girlfriend got her concrete with not only whipped cream and a cherry, but also some nice paper to choke on. We have both worked in fast food and we know sometimes it's difficult to keep up with everything, but following simple food orders and keeping non-edibles out of the food is kinda a must. Needless to say we won't be returning workers do not care about customers at all."
1,"Emergency Room Experience was less than effective with doctors guessing at my daughter's diagnosis. Thank good ness we did not opt for the 'extra' offered tests that were unnecessary. Our insurance did not pay any portion of our bill as we were out of network. Apparently ""Abrazo"" doesn't lower there service fees for self pay patients and refused a pay-out even though there bill was only projected to charge at one-third of what was billed. The social inept ER doctor we had was less than informative and appeared to have better things to do than make an actual diagnosis."
1,"I came here twice for sever stomach pain and throwing up blood. I was told I was simply dehydrated and given fluids and sent home. 1600$ in medical bills, I recently went to another hospital who actually found out I have a very severe stomach infection. I will not be using this er or hospital in the future"
1,"After closing my account in February or March I have yet to receive the $41 dollars that CenturyLink owes me for overpayment on my account. I've called them multiple times and they assure me they are issuing checks, which I never receive. They are incompetent liars."
1,"The absolute worst!  One star is too many!  My service is out at least once a month. They tell me go reset your box blah blah blah.......they make Cox Cable look amazing. I can't wait for this contract to be up!
DON'T GET YOU'VE BEEN WARNED THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE...."
1,"My sister was admitted here Early Sunday morning and made her wait in the emergency room for two hours before they did anything while she was literally screaming in pain. Her whole stay here has just been full of all the nurses lagging. They gave her her meds over two hours late. They took almost 45 min. for her  assigned nurse to arrive once we called her. None of the other unassigned nurses were helping us out. Me and my brother-in-law thought of the only two good things in this hospital; the ice (that is at the perfect level of frozen when I didn't know there was such a thing), and the supervisor Al. We will definitely never be visiting this hospital again."
1,"poor care, understaffed, if you have a senior with health issues this in not the hospital to go to. Did not seem to think the elderly are worth the effort to save. Attitude was they had a good long life and let them go. Nurse advised against feeding efforts and not to try save him if heart or breathing stopped. T.ook way to long to make room in icu. My dad died there. Some staff cared some did not. Nobody even called after the fact with regrets. Entered with a fall, got pneumonia and passed. A lot more details my advise is beware and if you end up here you better be ready to live here and push them for care. Not a hospital  for the elderly if you want them to survive, imo"
1,This place draws 3rd rate comics and charges 1st rate prices. Absolute Comedy and Yuk Yuks are far superior options in Toronto. I wouldn't reccomend Comedy Bar to anyone looking for a good night out. Rivoli also has comedy nights which are a good option..
1,"Had a installing show up to install WIFI service scheduled for 2days before on Saturday but they were a ( no call no show) call after call after call to service center and we were assures us the tech would arrive at 6pm ( wihich never happend) then just showed up at our door . ( the orignal install was suppose to be 2weeks prior on thurday) once again no call no show! Then memorial day he arrives at door and speaks very abrasive & rude when he tells me "" pit the dog away i'll wait ( so he did) after putting away dog , he comes in with big boots in my clean carpet,he installed away from where we wanted on the desk because "" he stated he had too! So then he spoke sharply to my wife as he explained how to set up the laptop. He finished and left ( service equipment is fine ) but these installers are WIERD & RUDE ! NEVER EVER AGAIN AFTER THIS Experience!!"
1,Wow. The slowest fast food ever. Waited 40 minutes for food.When we get to the window she hands me our ice cream and we wait at the window for like 12 more minutes as the  Ice cream is melting.  Total wait for 2 burgers and fires and ice cream 45 minutes. Ice cream is totaLLY melted. Not sure how long it sat before we got to window. And price is ridiculous for OK burgers.
1,"Do NOT bring your baby/toddler here for ER care! Besides being put in a dirty room, (I have pictures, and baby's mom and I both got sick 48 hours later) the staff had NO CLUE how to deal with a 2 year old with DD issues. I knew she needed IV fluids, that was why we were there; we had her to urgent care hours earlier, and we went to the ER per their instructions when she would not drink, continued to vomit, and had no wet diaper in over 12 hours. Nevertheless, the  staff tried to guilt trip me over ""putting a needle in her"". They handed me three little bottles of pedialyte, no nipple, no sippy cup. You can't explain to a kid that they are nauseous from being dehydrated and need to drink!  
Then it came time for the needle. The staff could not find a vein, used a portable ultrasound unit for 20 minutes. When he did, he did not strap her arm down to a board, then complained that she kept moving! He finally put the board on after I suggested it, long after the needle was inserted. Hell, I was on my phone looking up ""giving IV fluids to a baby"" and I had more knowledge about what to do after reading that article than the supposed health care professional!
We have had good care in the past for adults, but I will never take my granddaughter there again!"
1,"My wife did two NST test here and this hospital was in my insurance network. I got two bill one is from hospital and other from the provider. But I surprised when I saw the bill with full amount since provider is not working with my insurance. I spoke with the hospital billing department they simply escape saying that I'll have to speak with provider. I used services from many different hospital across US and have never encountered such situation before.
If the hospital is in-network the provider also should be in same network.... if not they should inform the patient and share the estimate of the cost before giving service; considering the financial burden after the treatment. This test was not emergency case, hospital staff could have discuss the cost and avoid this situation. We would have used another in-network provider to read the test reports. 

I spoke with hospital customer, also sent a complaint letter but they didn't bother to response from hospital. This is one of the worst experience I had ever.... So we have decided not to take any service from the hospital henceforth also not to recommend to anyone."
1,Save yourself. Do not under any circumstance go to century link. They have poor customer service and poor Internet service. I have been yelled at my their customer service reps several times for questioning why my service was turned off for no reason (I've always paid on time). They are fill of bitter and clueless employees. Sooooo done. Canceled my service today.
1,"This is the worst burger ever, I never had this kind of burger in my life.... 
Smells like dead dog meat... 
People giving good reviews they don't know what is the burger..."
1,"I'm only giving it a 1 because you can't give a 0 on Yelp. Nasty fried bologna sandwich, flat pop, staff that watches you when you eat, basically hovering over you.....pressure you to order more, etc.....no thanks! Great location, nice old vintage look to it."
1,"I would not be alive today if I stayed at this miserable hospital. I discharged myself and went to another hospital where they immediately did tests. When the doctor saw the results, I was rushed to an operating room. It took less than 20 minutes to go from the minute I stepped into the ER to being sedated and being operated on. I would not recommend that anyone go to Abrazo, especially if it is a life or death situation."
1,"I'd give a zero if I could. They only do sales. Don't help with returns or package change, unless it is to upgrade. The prism pic was great when it worked but service sucks!  Never will deal with Century link again."
1,"Straight bs, these guys cant find good service if good service smacked them dead center in they're face. Poor quality that is why they are merging with direct-tv!"
1,"So I went to this restaurant and ordered the jucy lucy of fire combo with poutine. The burger was ok, i mean it wasn't that great but edible, the burger in it of itself would be a 2.5/5. However, however YOU DO NOT MESS WITH THE POUTINE. There is one and only one simple way of making poutine. Fries with gravy and CHEESE CURDS, not shredded cheese. Who the hell, puts shredded mozzarella on fries and gravy, and then has the audacity to call it poutine. Now thats just disrespectful man. The chef needs to visit montreal and see what a poutine looks like. and taste it, and learn what a poutine tastes like. The Burger Factory should go to montreal and apologize to every montreal man woman and child for calling such an atrocity, poutine."
1,"We came here cuz I wanted ice cream and roommate was hungry. The concrete was supposed to have Oreo, extra Oreo and be chocolate and vanilla swirl. I got a mostly chocolate custard plain first and when I said sumthing she dumped some Oreos on top and by the time I mixed them in there was no vanilla. Custard wasn't good, tastes like soft serve. Roomy didn't receive his drink and said the hotdog was alright. First and last visit. Edit: went to DQ after:D"
1,We have had nothing but terrible experiences with CenturyLink. We restart our router every other day. Their customer service is terrible and not helpful. We're going to be switching companies and paying more just to get away from them.
1,"SCAMMERS. 

We cancelled our service in December 2015 and they said they would send a label to ship the equipment back.

We NEVER received the label. Because we know they are scammers, we decided to PAY OUT OF POCKET and ship the equipment back to the address listed on the website via tracked courier. 

We get a bill 3 months later claiming we owe $99 for unreturend equipment. IMMEDIATELY, I call their CS department and dispute the bill, providing the UPS tracking code.

Guess what? After 1 week, they charge my account with the same amount. I called them and they say ""Well you did not cancel AUTO PAY"" ... WHAT? I cancelled my account MONTHS AGO, but AUTO PAY is still in effect? ""We are investigating the issue"" 

AFTER 3 months? How about you don't charge me until you have investigated enough and put my account on hold, regardless of AUTO PAY?

Why should I lend you guys money for free when I have 4 kids? They CAUSED MY BANK ACCOUNT TO OVERDRAWN!!! 

Jokers."
1,"My daughter has a chronic disease and is in the hospital quite often. Her treatment at this hospital is a joke. She has had this illness for 3 years so she knows her body and the symptoms. Nurses will not listen to her. In fact, two nurses were overheard this am joking about her PTSD. You just can't make this stuff up.   RUN to another hospital!!!!"
1,"Came here yesterday for dinner. Pho was extremely salty and was promptly followed by food poisoning. 

Girlfriend and myself have been sick ever since. 

Beware of rare beef"
1,"I've been with CenturyLink for 6 years for landline phone and internet. It seems that every few years THEY SCREW SOMETHING UP! In 2010 one monthly bill was $270 when the correct total should have been $87. Took several days of emails & phone calls to management office to get that fixed. In 2011 minor billing error for long distance corrected with 2 emails to management. On 6/1/2016 after seeing numerous TV commercials about faster internet I did online chat with Madison M and was told I could upgrade from 10Mbps to 25Mbps for only $7/mo more than my current monthly total of $72. Aside from the fact that it took 9 days and numerous contacts before I actually got the upgrade, on 7/30/2016 I discovered that instead of the $79 correct total, Century just billed me over $125! Thus, if you have CenturyLink or move to it from another service provider DOCUMENT EVERYTHING THEY SAY IN WRITING & CHECK YOUR BILLS EVERY MONTH!!!"
1,"This place is disgusting. The components of my hotdog were handled by three separate people all of who were not wearing any gloves. The old guy who cooked the hotdogs kept coughing into his fist as he stood directly over the grill, coughing into the same bare hand that he used to rotate the dog to another side. I was appalled watching this unfold and kept my mouth shut because 1. I was curious just how gross it could get and 2. I don't want to give anymore of a reason for these French fcks to dislike Americans. I didn't want to add ""bitches about how I make food"" to their reasons they can be rude. Will. Not. Go. Back. Ever. I took it to go then threw them in the garbage on the street."

1,"My grandpa was admitted to this hospital last Tuesday and passed away there on Monday. We had a terrible experience and seeing the reviews horrify me... I wish he went to a different hospital but he had to go here since the other hospitals near his house were full. Now I'm beginning to think I know why this hospital was empty... I am deeply saddened by the loss of my grandpa but since the day we got there I can't help but think what could have been done differently if he went somewhere else. We were told by the RN that my grandpa probably wouldn't make it to hospice (meaning he wouldn't make the ride there) so it was best for him to stay at the hospital and pass. Yet the DOCTOR was pushing for him to go to hospice. His reasoning was because they needed to utilize the rooms in the ICU for other patients. I completely understand however we were told by the RN that if indeed there was another person in desperate need, we could just move him to a different room, out of the ICU. The doctor didn't agree. He said it's comforting and there is a priest at hospice. I told the DOCTOR that the RN didn't think he would make it to another facility and what his thoughts were. I asked him ""what do you think? Would he make it?"" The doctor replied, ""no there's a possibility he won't"" ok...... then why would we move my dying grandfather and make him suffer?!?!?! Our hearts are hurting enough... all we wanted was for him to pass away in peace surrounded by his loved ones, not in a van or ambulance. After the Dr left... the RN came in the room and asked what was just discussed. I explained everything to him in tears. The RN APOLOGIZED for that DOCTORS unprofessional behavior and said ""do not worry, your grandpa is not going anywhere"" the RN said you don't worry about what he said, you guys spend the time left you have with him. My grandma said he was an angel sent by God. I don't understand how a human being can be so selfless and cruel. He doesn't care about people. He clearly cared about his paycheck. I don't recommend coming here but if you have to I hope you don't see this Dr. I won't post his name because I don't feel that's right. My grandpa is gone and there's nothing that can change that. THANK YOU to all the amazing RNs in the ICU! It makes me cry just knowing you were genuinely there to help the people! We had a bad experience with one just one RN. My grandpa said he couldn't breathe and instead of listening to him she said ""you know what that means? I'm going to sedate you"" even though he was responsive and coherent enough to say NO! She didn't listen and shoved large pills down his throat when she was told he couldn't swallow big pills. She was told this and still did it. That was the last day I saw my grandpa awake and I didn't know that would be the last time we ever talked to him or saw him with his eyes opened. He said NO i do not want to be sedated, but she did it with no explanation. She treated him poorly. He was a person that deserved to be treated with respect. Rose, Collin and Jonathan, all you RNs were a breathe of fresh air and my family and I appreciate you so so so much."
1,"Tiny burgers and staff can't seem to understand add-on toppings. Got a regular to add this butter chicken sauce...never got it. $5.65 for mine and nearly $9 for his. Bf got a burger with bacon and cheese ($2.50) and forgot both add ons. Finally got bacon but still forgot the cheese and bacon seemed overcooked. Did the even rebook the burger for customer service sake. The Friday fish burger looks amazing but I dunno if they'll pay attention. It wasn't even busy all, too busy talking. Shame, I could see potential but we refuse to come back here. BIG MOE'S is next door, think it's a better option. Not even full...he'll A&W could do better"
1,"This place me my only go to place for Nem Nuong for years. Since when they started adding flour to their meat? Nem Nuong is not sweet, it tastes rubbery, reminds me of doughy fish cake/ fish balls, actually it doesn't taste like real meat at all!! What a disappointment!"
1,"Trash quality burgers, bad service. Wouldn't go there again if they paid me. I don't recommend this place a ton of other places serve better quality for less if not same price.."
1,This place is a piece of shit. They ask you to make a payment while you're laying there in pain. Never seen anything like this before. F*** this place.
1,"Do people only rate because of food and forget about service? I am really upset because I came here based on people's review. I am on vacation, and since I came with my family, they wanted some authentic Viet food. 

When we first arrived it was 12:06. The restaurant was supposed to open at 12. The guy opened the door and did not greet us. He didn't even seat us. He was so damn grouchy. Just because you're a grown man does not mean you could act however you like. At least respect my parents and say something in Viet! Is all service in Toronto Chinatown this rude that people give it such a high rating? Ok, enough of me yapping about the poor service here comes the food.


We wanted to eat family style, but like usual, I'm an outcast and ordered Pho. I won't deny it, the Pho was delicious. It could even be compared to the Pho So 1 in Dorchester, which is my favorite. 

My family ordered,
Ca ro: fishy to death! I am not lying, this was so fishy that it was so difficult to eat. My family loves fish, my dad is from the South and is a fisherman, but this fish was on another level of FISHY, the type you want to spit out and barf 
Canh chua ca bong: Again, we are a fish fan, but not only that we care about the broth. Canh chua is supposed to taste sour because of the tamarind, however we did not taste any tamarind at all
Stir fry chicken: The chicken was extremely dry, dry to the point where when you eat it you either drink water, or you'll choke to death inside the restaurant

This is the worse Vietnamese restaurant experience ever. My parents came out really disappointed, my brother constantly complained because he hated it that much. I waited to complain on yelp."
1,"Terrible customer service...

Called one day to cancel my TV (the bill had almost doubled and I rarely watched the TV anyway) and just keep my internet. The man I spoke with was very nice and said instead of cancelling my TV he would add some promotional deals and it would drop my bill to $90. I also explained to him I would be moving in 3-4 months to an area Centurylink did not service so unless the bill would drop below $100, there was no point in keeping the TV service. Anyway, he sent me a confirmation email displaying all the changes to my service and bill. 

All that's well ends well eh?

No

The next bill I received was $130 and I assumed that was the bill for the month prior so I paid it not thinking much about it.
Next bill $130

After spending about 3-4 hours on the phone with different people that ""couldn't help me,"" they finally told me I had to sign a year contract to get the discounts. I explained to them not ONLY did the guy NOT tell me this, why would I sign a year contract if I AM MOVING in 3 months?? They finally told me there was nothing they could do and they could not remove any charges... so... I said  ok just cancel the TV service. So they did.

Well my internet stopped working as well... turns out they not only cancelled that too, they failed to tell me I would have to get a separate router because that router I had only worked with the TV service. Oh yes and they charged me for the new router. By this time I am just over them, and I am moving in a month anyway.

So it gets even worse.. the last day of June I return the new router (because im moving and cancelling all services) and they give me a confirmation saying I have returned all my equipment and my service has been cancelled. Funny thing is the guy never actually cancelled it and they billed me yet again. 

Not to mention my service would occasionally go out and or mess up, and I would not be able to use the TV or internet.

Needless to say I think they are actually WORSE that cable. 

If you have ATT UVERSE in your area they are amazing. If for some reason your service stops working they will reimburse you for the days you miss, and also send a technician to your house that day. Great customer service and great rates."

1,"Do not go to the ER here. My mom had high blood pressure 260. They released her with BP at 160 and was still unstable and her potassium levels were critically low  around 2.0 and did not give her anything for the potassium. Luckily my wife is a nurse, we had to go to Walgreen's and get her potassium supplements. They did a CT scan on her and forgot to hook her IV backup. We had to ask the nurse about it.The next day we had to take her back to the ER. We took her to Banner. I would recommend Banner. I am not exactly sure what happened at Abrazo Arrowhead. It seemed like they take you in and take your money and then get you out fast to clear a room. This was very dangerous for them to release her under her condition."
1,"This company is the worst I've ever dealt with.  If I could give them no stars I would.  Their customer service reps are incompetent and consistently give incorrect information costing us a ton of $.  My ordeal is too long to describe, but trust me, go with Cox!  I'll be filing a compliant with the FCC."
1,"This rating is not for the hospital itself, but, for its billing department which is in another state! 
After my ER visit, I began paying my portion through my bank. I have every bank statement showing all payments and the bill was finally paid off. However, one of my payments was never posted to my account and is not reflected in the hospital billing statement. 
Called the ""only"" number to resolve. 10/13 I faxed letter with bank statement showing withdrawal. Was told takes 48-72 hours for my fax to be scanned into their system and then have to wait two weeks for them to research. I called 3 days later and was told my fax was scanned 10/17 and to wait two weeks. 
Called 11/1 and was ""then told"" that nothing but cover letter came through on fax!!!  They will not call you to confirm receipt of documents. Had to re-fax documents and now have to play waiting game again! I have never heard of a billing system that cannot confirm receipt of faxed documents! 
I read some other horror stories through the BBB and the billing is number 1 issue. They have poor rating with the BBB and I know this is going to be like pulling teeth to get my payment refunded."
1,"Don't bother. When you buy a voucher for this place they will not tell you anywhere that they have a cap on how many people they will allow in on a voucher. So, you will then drive and waste $10 of gas, pay for parking only to arrive and be told that they have met their secret cap on vouchers but that you may purchase tickets -- even though you already purchased them. Nowhere on any voucher does it indicate a reservation is required or that or that a cap is in effect The ticket person you speak with will be highly unpleasant and provide a vapid string of excuses, and the smell adventure that ensues upon opening the door (which hits the staircase on the way in) will be almost too much for you to handle so you'll be okay to go home and get your money back."
1,"My cat had painful experience. 

The vet hurt my cat with the sedative.  My cat was very lethargic. When the vet injected Tyler, Tyler attempted to run away. We had to restrain him. The dose of sedative was inadequate. A second dose, also painful, had to be given. Two attempts were needed to place an iv. The worst was that the vet gave mixed signals about our timing to say goodbye. Clearly our cat was wasting away and dehydrated. Tyler had also developed a severe upper respiratory infection overnight with fits of sneezing and eye discharge. I also had discussed with our usual vet. It was time. After all euthanasia is about avoiding suffering.  Go elsewhere. The only positive was that the euthanasia team tried to be empathetic."
1,"our son experienced belly ache, admitted to ER.  had two tests done concerned for appendix, and both tests inconclusive. they kept him over night and would not allow him to eat.  that next morning they would not release him until surgeon saw him again.  he called me and said he is very hungry, they would not provide food, and the doctor was not available to see him.  I called a couple times and said he was being kept against his will.  coincidence the doctor then saw him within minutes and released soon after.  $17,500 +  We would like to better understand why he was kept overnight and why the excessive charges."

1,"I get forced into signing up for century link because it bundles with DirecTV, not only did I hear bad things but I decided I would give it a try for myself. They sent out many technicians within two days then to tell me that my area does not support very good Internet. So within about less than a week I canceled my service after they told me it was not supported in my area and now they are trying to get me with a $245 cancellation fee. Are you serious?! What amazing customer service, you should be real proud of yourselves century link"
1,I recently signed up for Internet service with Century Link since Century Link is the only provider where I live. They said the monthly service is $39.95. I get the first bill and it is $49.95 per month (which they say includes taxes) plus on top of it is $3.63 taxes. Service is slow and unreliable and super expensive for it. Not to mention the close to 10% taxes they did not mention when signing up. When I asked why not they said that they area a national company and they don't know taxes in every state. Ha???????? Why is that my problem?
1,"Horrible experience. I was in the worst pain I have ever had in my eye and was treated like I was stupid for coming in because of ""pink eye"" and sent away still in pain. At one point the nurse practitioner yelled at me because i was crying and she couldn't understand me. Got eyes rolled at me and everything. The pain was making me shake and feel nauseous. Her name was Helen Hayden. It felt like she was judging me and thinking i was just looking to get pain pills. i just wanted a solution and all I got was a drop to numb my eye temporarily and a statement that i just had to live with it. Still in horrible pain i went to Urgent Care the next day. Turns out I had an abrasion across my eye and thankfully found an urgent care who was willing to look into my pain and help fix the problem."
1,"Couldn't eat meat for religious purposes the day I went, only ONE seafood option. Ordered it. It turned out to be spicy as hell!  When my boyfriend went to ask if he could order one with ""no spicy"" the register woman told him it wasn't spicy, and it went back and forth with her (""spicy, no spicy"")  for a while until he said, ""do you want to taste it!? all i want to do is buy another filet with no spicy"" and she said that they had no filets that were not marinated. so, I ended up eating miso soup and rice... the food was okay according to my boyfriend, who had chicken and beef terriyaki, and ultimately... my spicy filet. I guess, what could I expect. Should have gone to a non fast food place."
1,"Attention CenturLink Staff:

     I am writing this review on an experience that I have had with the CenturyLink Corporation.  As a Professor in interrelations, I have to say that I know professionalism of a successful company, than a company that is full of risk. I was billed two bills from the CenturyLink company in which I do not have service with.  Contacting CenturyLink customer service was like trying to find a needle in a hay stack. 

      This company uses automative phone services responses, when a company uses automative phone response technology this is a ""red flag warning"". Companies that mostly use this technology avoid interactions of customer service complaints and they do not want to solve complaints that pertain to financial matters. It took me 35 minutes to get pass the automative responses.  When I reached the first representative I explained my situation to him and his attitude was unpleasant when I told him about the financial mistake.   

     So this representative solved one problem of one of the bills and said that he had to pass me over to the ""retention department"" now, I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes as I was relayed to 7 different representatives that told me that they had to forward me over to the right department, when I finally reached someone and explained my situation to them for the 8th time, this person apologized to me for all of the problems that I had went through and solved the problem, I want to thank Nicki for her kindness.  

     As a professional in interrelations and a scholar, I am very disappointed in this company that interacts with customers through networking. My evaluation of this company is 0% I only acknowledge the one representative Nicki.  In the reviewing of the present post of complaints it is to be made aware that this company has a negative impression on customer service and the community and is to be avoided as an internet and service provider. This company has leadership and managerial problems in which is demonstrated through the action of their employees. 

     I recommend that CenturyLinks senior representatives and stakeholders sit down at the table and start with a new management risk plan, because the actions that are displayed are a risk to the customers of taking a chance of putting their finances and trust in a company that does not deliver on their products and services and make grave mistakes. I recommend that consumers use internet and service providers that are competent and that have good relations with their customers such as Dish network or Cox.  Consumers should avoid services with CenturyLink until their customer satisfaction has improved and that they have demonstrated organizational professionalism.

1,"I ordered a combo from here which was $8.99 this included a burger, fries, and a drink. I have a younger daughter so I needed a cup to pour in for her. The lady working who may be the owner was overly rude and did not have any people skills. She told me out loud ""we don't have cups!"" This is the first time I have ever experienced a restaurant tell me they don't have a cup. NEVER AGAIN WOULD I COME
BACK AND WOULD NOT RECOMMMEND this place. Better to pay more and get good service and get good food."
1,I've had 2 of the worst experiences at both the ER at the hospital and the stand alone emergency center in Peoria. The first bad experience was when I had tonsilitis. The Dr looked at my throat and told me that it wasn't that bad and to follow up with my PCP. Two weeks later I had surgery to have my tonsils removed and was told by the ENT specialist that mine were the worst tonsils he'd ever seen. The next experience was at the Peoria center. I ruptured me Achilles tendon working out. After having my trainer as well as a PA look at my ankle they both believed my tendon was torn. I went to the ER and after feeling my ankle and taking an Xray the Dr gave me a boot and told me that my tendon was just strained and I didn't have any broken bones. He then said that if it wasn't better in a week I should follow up with an orthopedic surgeon. The same day I went to my PCP where an immediate MRI was ordered. After finding out my tendon was indeed ruptured I was sent to a surgeon who said that had I listened to the ER Dr and waited a week it would have been too late to repair my tendon. Both of these Dr's were rude and extremely unprofessional. I will never go to Arrowhead Hospital again. If you want quality care in the ER I highly recommend finding another hospital to go to.
1,"If you just came out of JAIL after 35 years...come here!

You've lost your hair, your belly is protruding, you don't remember the last time you actually said: ""Wow, this is delicious!"", your children have all grown up and moved far away from you...
Well, then, THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU!
Crudy old resto, that hasn't changed in the last 40 years (probably ever!), their food is what a 2 year old would love to get their hands on. Comfort food for people that haven't developed ANY sophistication or taste...

Old waitress throws the food on your place at the counter, and rolls her eyes if you don't drink a cola and want water or don't finish their DISGUSTINGLY TASTELESS CHEAP ""FOOD"".

Good place to do a photo shoot, shoot a movie that takes place in the 1940s, but TERRIBLE PLACE to eat at.

Lived 2 streets away from this place and went there cause a friend dragged me there saying her father used to love it there as a kid, well he's dead now, don't know if it's related to his terrible eating habits, but it definitely didn't help.

Go for the look of the place, the time warp feeling, but STAY AWAY FROM THE ""FOOD"".

1,"J'avoue n'avoir jamais compris cet intérêt autour de ce snack-bar du Mile-End. Chez Wilenskys Light Lunch tout est ordinaire : la nourriture, le menu, le personnel et le service. Pour 3.90$ (taxes non incluses), la famille Wilenskys vous servira, sans sourire ni politesse, la spécialité de la place : un sandwich au saucisson de Bologne. On parle ici d'un pain kaiser aplati (d'une catégorie difficile à décrire) à l'intérieur duquel vous trouverez quelques minces tranches de "" baloney "" accompagné d'une lichette de moutarde jaune. Les plus excentriques choisiront d'y ajouter une tranche de fromage. Pour le reste, les options s'amenuisent, car le menu est limité. Très limité. N'espérez pas manger des frites ici.  

Le sandwich ne remplit pas l'estomac, loin de là. Pour espérer en faire un repas, il faut en commander au moins deux, sinon trois. Vous pourrez y ajouter un Cherry Coke tiré de la fontaine. Pour deux "" Wilensky Spécial "" et une boisson gazeuse, vous devrez cracher une douzaine de dollars. Pour le même prix, un resto du coin vous offrira un spécial du midi convenable. 

Le seul intérêt de l'endroit repose sur son côté historique. Le restaurant, fondé en 1932 par une famille immigrante de Russie, se trouve à la même adresse depuis les années 50. Le décor reste inchangé depuis plusieurs années. La place fut l'un des endroits préférés du défunt écrivain montréalais Mordecai Richler.

Conclusion : J'ai toujours cru qu'une visite au restaurant ne se limite pas qu'à regarder un joli décor (historique ou non). La bouffe doit être bonne et les prix raisonnables en raison de ce que l'on vous sert. Pour cette raison, évitez Wilensky autant que possible."
1,"First time here and I had to wait over 25 mins for my order. When I got up to find out what was taking so long, the worker said they didn't have my order receipt. What happened was after my order was placed a customer that was already eating placed an order for another burger. Instead of putting his order in line with the rest of the orders the lady rushed his and pushed everything back and ended with my order being misplaced.  Asked for a refund after being told it was going to be another 10 minutes. Horrible first visit, never got an apology or anything, will never go back."

1,"Absolutely the worst ISP in Las Vegas. I pay for 4MPS, I'm LUCKY most of the time to get around .43MPS, that is not a typo. That's 1/10 of what I'm paying for. When I call their Customer Non Service it takes 10 minutes minimum to talk to someone in India who barely speaks English. Then it takes another 30 minutes of them treating me like an idiot: ""Is your modem turned on sir..."" to get them to admit that THEY need to re set my wireless connection. AFTER ALL OFTHAT, 40 minutes of my time, I get about 10-20 minutes of 'normal' service before the whole thing goes south again.
Later, Rinse, Repeat, WORST ISP EVER."
1,"Century Link is the worst!!! I don't understand how they are able to be in business.  I hope people research and read reviews before ever decide to switch over for cable, internet, and telephone. I made a very bad and very costly decision to switch from cox to century link.  First of all, do not believe the sales person.  They give you an amazing price to bundle.  you will later learn what was said on the phone will be extremely higher when you get the bill. The reason why I switched over is because i thought I was saving money!!! Instead I was paying more then 80 dollars more then cox.  The sales team will lie and lie.  First they lied about the price and second they lie about receiving a 300 gift card when you sign up. So please people don't be fooled!

So we get the bill and of course you want to call and question about the enormous bill that you were quoted a substantial lower about when agreeing to switch over. Be prepared to be on hold for an hour!!! Then I realize I'm not the only one upset.  They are others like me who have discrepancies in their bill!!!

Oh and the service itself is the worst. The cable will pause. We could be watching a movie and it will just pause. Imagine watching the super bowl and it does this. Second the Internet is slow. We had the the 1 gig. Omg!!!! Forget watching Netflix or stream anything!!! It kept cutting off!  And I constantly had to call my alarm company because my security cameras were always offline due to poor Internet service. Even they said I should have stayed with cox. So I called century link.  And again prepare to be on hold for an hour to schedule someone to come out to fix it.  Then when they do arrive they ask you what are they there for. I'm like don't you have a work order????

After all is said and done, I decided to cancel. I waited another hour on hold to do this. When I called to sign up I specifically asked through sales person, am I under any contract and he said no.  He said I am able to cancel if I am unsatisfied with the service with no charge. That was an lie. I get a bill of 400 in cancellation fees!!! I feel that they are unethical and I wouldn't want any of my friends to endure the crap I went through with century link. 

They say that they are cheaper then cox. That's just lies.  The reason why cox seems to be more expensive is because they tell you up front about the pricing.  Century link will give you a cheaper price over the phone but surprise surprise when you get your bill! All in all, I went back to cox. And I can watch football without interruptions!!! And my security cameras are online without any disconnections because of slow Internet service!!! I'm sooo much happier with cox."
1,"Worst experience ever! Had my daughter there with Dr. Austin who was an absolute monster!!! Her cervical checks left me screaming and begging her to stop - and she never stopped. This is my 3rd child and was well aware of what a cervical check entails. It was so horrible my husband and mother were hysterically crying not knowing what to do or how to help!! And this was for a NORMAL, low risk, healthy pregnancy and delivery with NO complications!! 

The hospital was neglectful on so many occasions. After baby was born, they placed us in our room and never came back for 6 hours!!! We had no diapers for baby, no personal items for myself. NOTHING! The staff for the baby was so disgustingly rude and harsh. Literally 2 seconds after the baby came our, the nurse tried to come rip her out of my harms to take ""measurements"". The baby was fine and fully healthy! How horrible! I just birthed my baby and now you want to take her?? What about the one hour skin to skin contact that I was promised?? 

They were horrible during the entire labor, they administered medication with out my consent while I was asleep through my IV! 

They rush you in and out like you are a cow! Their c section rate is SO high, their nurses are miserable and they are not accommodating at all during one of the most important and vulnerable times of your life! 

I would run far away from this hospital and deliver elsewhere!!"
1,"Ordered a hot cheetos steak burrito from here on 6/13/18 and it was not great. The only extras I asked for were sour cream, cheese, pico, and rice but it seems like they put everything on it and the meat was minimal and not very meat like, it tasted how wet cat food smells. I failed to finish the burrito... I'm good on trying this place again."
1,"I had the worst year of my life with this company. To start EVERYTHING off when they came to my house to install the internet and wifi, the guy literally did nothing but hook up the box.  He left the box it came in on the desk circling the WRONG password for the box.  I should have run at this point.  Complained... Silence..  I really tried to fix things with their tech support (or shall we say NO tech support). They offer services such as selective call block and then when you really need to use it you can't because.......you cant block long distance numbers.  Are you kidding me!!! Their wifi worked in my house, however it would constantly stop working off on off on off off off.  Their solution.... go to Amazon and buy a booster for your house!  Are you freaking serious!! I filed complaints and never was any follow up contact made.  THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! And I thought Direct TV was contracted with them for some areas. So why was it that even after telling them that Direct TV was my carrier, they still tried to poach their customer.  Wow.  Steer clear unless you like doing all the tech stuff yourself but still paying as much as if they were doing the tech work for you. And if you don't need wifi then this is definately the company for you.  Good riddance CenturyLink!  If I could I would give them 0 stars!"
1,"Don't do it!!!!
. Service sucks and customer service is the worse. Every call to customer service lasts from 40-60 mins, who has that time to wait on the phone. I had their internet package. the schedule instalation two times and left me waiting. Around 5;30 I got a call saying that I had been reschedule for another day. Are you serious!!!! they did this twice and the third time they finally sent someone on time. This time I had internet, unfortunately it did not work properly and after two week I called and canceled within their 30 day money back guaranteed. I have been disconeted since july. Its December and I still get a bill every month. I called and they adjusted it to zero balance, but I am tired to call every month with the same situation. I really hope that they stop this!!!! I moved to cox. A little bit pricey but I think is worth it. Their customer service is great"
1,"This is the worst customer service company I have ever dill in my life with
I am still stuck with the security system, even after hours and hours at the phone.... As well bill are way bigger then the price you agreed on, customer service is most of the time rude and frequently knowledge less 
.... Just stay out of this! Many other better option around 

This is not for the store!"
1,"I give this hospital no stars. If lil Jr. comes in to the ER with a mild cough and you show up 5 minutes later, in obvious pain and discomfort then guess what- you're going to sit and suffer while the kid who could be treated at home with a slathering of Vick's Vap-O-Rub is seen before you.

The billing department is also a shit show- set up a payment plan, pay on time and then be treated to multiple phone calls claiming they're about to send your account to collections and shaking you down for the money.

The best that could happen to Arrowhead Hospital would be a total evacuation of all human, canine and feline life to a minimum safe distance, followed by an expert firebombing and razing.

It's the North Korea of so-called healthcare."
1,"To be completely honest,  this place is horrible.  My sister had her baby here and it was a disaster.  When my sister had excruciating pain she was told by one of the nurses to go get a McFlurry from McDonalds! Are you kidding me?  That was beyond disrespectful,  and she wouldn't get admitted until she walked to get dilated.   Then after several hours of walking around the hospital at midnight she was finally admitted because I demanded somebody see her.   I regret it because I should have taken her to a different hospital at that point.  She was under a lot of pain and nobody seemed to care at all.  She was taken to the maternity unit around 3 am and it wasn't until 8 am that she was offered an epidural,  this is the first baby in the family so we had no clue what to do,  nothing was ever explained.  Still crying my sister got the epidural thanks to ONE wonderful nurse,  she was the angel sent from heaven that saved the day.  I'm giving this hospital a one star just because of this lady that pushed efforts to help my sister.  The nurse was awesome but the hospital sucks,  very old furniture,  the doctor on call never showed up.   My sister ended ip having her baby around 3 pm the next day and after labor she was escorted to a different room by Walking!!!! What?  No wheelchair l?  Nothing!!!  Then she was given a couple of witch hazel pads and a spray to take care of herself down there.   No instructions,  nothing!  If you're having a baby,  I strongly suggest that you don't go there!   Think about it twice!   If you have to pay more money, do it.... the lack of compassion isn't worth it."
1,"Tasted like a frozen veggie mix and boiled beef with no flavor.  Even the rice was overcooked, its RICE.  will never go to again"
1,"My dad passed away, and they would not let me disconnect his phone. They gave me such a problem and kept giving me such a problem saying I was not authorized to call about his bill even though he passed away, and kept charging his account. 0 stars for this place."
1,"This is no Yuk Yuks. No Second City either. You may have guessed it... not all that funny, and kind of grungy for my taste. A note for all the deal buyers out there: this place is often on deal for $20. Not worth it. Not even worth $10. 

I came here with some colleagues from work. The ticket for the comedy show was $8. The guys bought beer. I got myself a Vodka Cran. Regular drinks, nothing fancy here. The place itself is super dive. And I was surprised at the crowd it brought in on a Friday night. I wouldn't be a second timer. 

We walked into a dark room with a dinky stage set up for the comedy acts. The chairs weren't comfortable either. The acts were apparently selection from the Toronto Comedy Fest. Well, 1 out of the 5 we saw brought out 2 laughs out of me. Some of the guys I was with guffawed at the other ones - but guys will laugh at anything. One act, in particular, was a whole new level of crass. A girl ran around the audience seating throwing panties at people. My colleague ended up with 2 pink panties... out of which one was kid's underwear. 

I wish we'd gone to Yuk Yuks instead. Never coming back."
1,"Terrible ER experience.  I was on meds that suppress my immune system and none of the ER staff entering my room washed their hands or used alcohol wipe.
Mostly seen by student MD.  Rarely saw the physician.  When the physician did examine me, he completely ignored me and spoke to the student.  I was simply a test dummy laying on the bed.
No followup care instructions given.  Not even the phrase: ""follow up with my PCP"". 
Only time I received their undivided attention was when they came to collect my deductibles.
Next day I ended up seeing my PCP who was able to diagnose and treat me effectively.
I am a insured paying customer who does not abuse the ER, and will not return to this ER."
1,You would think a hospital would have policies in place that would prevent the bathrooms from not having working soap dispensers!   Disgusting!
1,"You'd think that if they managed to stay in business for 80+ years, they would have made enough money to refurbish the joint (Note: I did not say remodel). With the absence of fireproof construction around the cooking appliances and the garage space heat blowing overhead, you gotta wonder about the building codes in Montreal. And the short-order cook scratching his head right before he goes to town on a sandwich, let's you know for sure this place is not a kosher-style deli."
1,"The worst and stupidest customer service. Before notifying me that installation will take place 4 week after starting an account they withdrew $65 starting fee from my account and notified me of the 4 week installation gap. But that's not the worst yet after I refused and cancelled their one month off service they said they will mail my refund in 15 days. It's 2 months now and I haven't gotten my refund yet and every time I call to see where my money is a dumber person answers the phone giving me the stupidest reason or how it could take long to get a refund. Do not and I repeat do not even give them any credit card or banking information they are worst than those out of country fraud scams. These mother f-ers will go through ur account any take everything out. They should be closed down and thrown in the trash,"
1,"I have lived in the Arrowhead neighborhood for 18 years, and will do everything I can to avoid it in the future. My first experience was a broken ankle - which was pretty routine. However, I was billed incorrectly and had a fight on my hands. ""No - you cannot bill me for a room. I laid on a gurney in the hallway for 5 hours!"" All caregivers had billed me separately, so I asked for a detailed invoice of charges. I finally had to write to the administration of the hospital. 
They clearly have not improved as my 88 year old mother is there as I write this. She has been in ER for 3 days! Supposedly, they are attempting to transfer her - but when I call Banner, they say they DO have beds available. Further, our family members have had to ask - and go find - a blanket, socks, and they do not feed her in ER. 
Because our family members are currently sick with flu/strep/pneumonia - we are ""rotating"" visits among whomever is healthiest to be there and meet her needs. It's extremely stressful not knowing if she's been fed, assisted with hygiene, etc. We have medical personnel in our family that have commented that while they understand the demands of the ER, the personnel is only doing the bare medical necessities and lack compassion. 
It's  like she's alone in a refugee camp."
1,"I hate Arrowhead Abrazo hospital,  I've been let down more than once by their incompetant staff. The first time I was sent away when having severe chest pains which only landed me right back there for round two of their incompetence trying to send me away after being sent there with a call ahead to them to admit me by a cardiologist only to have a double cardio arterial bypass graft 3 days later while experience a widow makers heart attack. Today I was scheduled for an outpatient procedure and reassured by the requesting doctor that I'd be out and wont remember a thing. I checked in was told by the radiologist and the RN that they'd be administering fentanyl and volume and I would go down and out quickly for a short period of time and not remember anything. I cried out in pain, begged and pleaded with them to give me more as I was feeling everything and they said that they had given me enough. As soon as the agonizing procedure was over I was suppose to return to recovery for 30-40 minutes. I returned, told them to pull the IV cath out immediately or I'd do it myself. I got up and dressed within minutes of returning to the recovery room. They tried to apologize only to get my palm in their face and I told them not to talk to me. I was told they were getting a wheel chair and I responded with don't do me any favors. I was still crying in excruciating pain as I found my way out the door on my own two feet. My mom was shocked at the commotion as the RN was trailing behind me. The sound of the drill and the agonizing pain will probably forever haunt me. I'd rather die than to ever return to Arrowhead Abrazo again. They only recieved one star from me because I couldn't give them a BIG FAT ZERO as they so caringly deserve!!"
1,"Absolutely horrible connection.  It is a funky connection that constantly goes in and out and drives me nuts when I am trying to download anything or even watch a movie on Hulu.  My current download of a 1 hour TV show on iTunes currently says it will take 8 hours to download with the current connection.  I have already called to have Cox put back in.  They drove me nuts with their billing, and they are just as expensive but at least they work and are super fast.  Prism sucks.  They need to take some of that money they spend on TV ads telling us how great they are and actually upgrade their service."
1,"Where do I start? I went with Centurylink because Cox customer service was horrid. I thought it couldn't get any worse, then we ordered Centurylink Prism. I was stuck in a contract for two years. Finally, my torment is over. 
The internet was a snails pace. It would have been great fifteen years ago. Worse, the internet connection would randomly drop and the modem would cycle and restart. When it did work, speed test for me was d/l @ 8mb/s. If i could get a good connection to stream NETFLIX or Amazon Prime, there were always connection, buffering or video quality problems.
Television is VOIP, voice over internet because they are a phone company and run tv through the phone. Picture was not great. On demand service is junk. When it did work, they had a really limited hd selection. Even in the premium channels that I am paying another 15/mo for. 
DVR would only record 2 shows. But, because the modem would restart and the connection would be lost, 70-80% of our recorded shows were missing time. When the modem restarted, the tv would freeze for a few minutes and always at the climax or big reveal of the show.
Recently my contract expired. Bill immediately jumped 80. Went to the cox store. Got their best package, all premium channels and 150 mb internet for 10 a month extra. Picture is 10x better, OnDemand has everything and net is blazin. DONT GET PRISM! I know this is long as heck, but if I read a review like this, I would have had an enjoyble ISP/TV service for the last two years. Good riddance CenturyLink!"
1,"I rarely write reviews but I felt this one needed one because of how bad it was ! 

The buns were thin and small and looked like ones that we can buy at a grocery store, which is probably why they got soggy and all the toppings literally just fell out of them. The taste was also very mediocre. Nothing special, in fact quite disappointing."
1,"My son was taken there by his friends after breaking his wrist. He had his wrist reduced and they sent him home and told him to follow up with a doctor on Monday (his accident happened on Friday). My wife who is a nurse saw that he had an open fracture, meaning the bone had broken through the skin. She called over to the hospital she works at and the surgeon told her to bring or soon in right away, that he was at risk for infection and needed to be on IV antibiotics. We brought him in right away and he had surgery that day. Good thing we got a second opinion. I don't trust that hospital. I went to the ER there because it was close and they gave me some passion medicine for kidney stones and sent me home. When I went to my.doctor later that afternoon he admitted me to the hospital immediately with a perforated ureter. Good thing I followed up with my doctor our I would have been in real trouble. Avoid that place at all costs. I have given one star because zero stars is not an option."
1,"Warning Do NOT GET THIS SERVICE!!! I am one of 33 defendants because centurylink was hacked by Torrent bit something or other, supposedly gave me illegal access to a movie on Centurylink cable.  The information for this accusation was given to them by CENTURYLINK! I only use Netflix, Amazon, and the cable bundle to view movies.  Received a letter from Centurylink to speak to the defendant attorney with now warning about the legality of this and fell into a rat hole - thank you Centurylink.  I do not have any clue about how to hack this service but have been thrown under the bus by Centurylink who said the could sell me a antivirus package for a monthly fee to avoid this,  REALLY?  If after reading this you decide to get this service, there's probably a Darwin Award waiting for you around the corner.  ALL defendants in this case are being sued for $150,000 plus legal fees!!  ALL defendants just happen to be CENTURYLINK subscribers!!!"
1,I came here in excruciating pain from passing a kidney stone. They were nice enough to give me a shot to remove the pain. But I left with more stones to pass and a prescription for IBUPROFEN & a very rude unsympathetic nurse who treated my like an addict when I requested something stronger so that I wouldn't need to return for the same thing in the near future! Just another hospital giving just enough service to need to comeback again soon for more money! Stay away unless you are independently wealthy!
1,"I feel that Centurylink Prism still can't deliver a consistent television picture to the southeast Henderson part of valley, and until they bring more upgrades in all areas, I feel Prism can't be taken seriously as a real competitor to Cox or DirecTV. 

Centruylink's  Las Vegas retail customer service representatives are pretty cool, and they do try there best in dealing with the Prism problems of freezing picture frames, but in the end most of the prism issue will be routed an out of state operator for you to talk too.    The Las Vegas customer service is great for telephone, and internet issues, but when it comes to Prism TV, the most they actually can help you with is to show customers how reset the prism box, and pray the freezing stops.    Due to the good customer service at the local offices, I'm bumping up Century link another star.  

Getting back to the PrismTV, I'm only about 3/4 miles from the transfer relay station, and I shouldn't be having knock off and freezes on my broadcast service, but it does happen about a couple of times an hour.   We all know Fiber optics internet is the fastest transfer rate in the world, and Google is doing it at 1GB in Kansas City, but at them moment Prism is only going up to 10 to 40 mbps in Las Vegas and in my area it's maxed out at 10 mbps.

The picture quality is very clear, but watching Football can be a little disheartening, because the refresh rate is showing blurs, and this shouldn't be happening on my Plasma because it has a 600 mhz refresh rate.  On the other hand, If it's not a fast moving picture, the picture quality is great !

Another thing to bring up, if you only have two HD television in your house, and only two people living there. Prism is for you, because you can't record more than one show at a time, and also you can't watch more than two HD channels at the same time.   There isn't any Time Warner sport network or CBS sport network, so if you're a Laker fans or UNLV running rebel fan...you're out of luck.

I hate bashing this system, but it needs a lot of work before it can be ready for prime time. Don't get me wrong, the price is right, but I personally need better service for my household....Sorry Centurylink, but you need to bring it up a level.   Thankfully, Prism has a 30 day escape clause, and I did excise the option to cancel on my contract.  . Don't get me wrong, this system is perfect for a small household, but won't work for my household which has four televisions.   The way I see it, when Centurylink get their internet to 1 GB speeds in the coming months, and you'll see everyone in Vegas coming your way,     Heck, I'll come back to you at that point, because all of these Prism issues will disappear with higher speeds..    Speed kills, and I'm praying Centurylink gets it very soon.  In any case, I'm still a DSL customer.with Centurylink, and looking forward to their upgrade..   

Update:   Centurylink no longer provides their PrismTV to my part of the woods."
1,"Horrible horrible beef! I ordered two combo plates and a large beef, the beefs were 90% fat I would had demanded a refund if I wouldn't have lived so far away. I loved this place in CA when I was growing up. A coworker told me there was one in Vegas I was so happy! I ordered our families food and took it home, when I got home I was mortified we threw it out. I still can't believe how disgusting the beef looked, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt but it was like chewing half cook fatty bacon, do yourself a favor and skip this place $27 in the trash."
1,"1/12/15  took my wife for a small procedure in Endoscopy. The first nurse she encountered was somewhat friendly. In comes the anthologiest,acting and talking like Lurch from the tv series Adams Family. Procedure did not take ten minutes. Out comes the Dr. I've had better conversations with a cold dish of oatmeal! 
Needless to say never again will I step into that lousy place called a hospital!"
1,"Burger was nothing special, based on reviews I expected a lot better, tiny for the price.  Ordered mushrooms at extra cost and when I arrived at my destination and unwrapped it there were no mushrooms. Burger was generic, fries nothing special, will go back one more time only to let them know they messed up my order and leave, maybe they will make it right. 

Not worth the price for a four ounce patty, I asked the size of the standard patty while there."
1,"Disgusting Food, terrible service. They close at 10, i came in at 9:25 and their faces be like ""why the f ur in here at this hour?""... The udon dish felt like i was swallowing salt down my throat. The beef dish was made w flank which is the cheapeast kind of beef out there. I ended up throwing the food away after 20 minutes struggling figuring out what the hell are these stuffs i been swallowing. I exit and the lady who took my order just stare at me didnt even say thank you. Im also a server and i was like ""how the hell did u get hire?"" Strongly not recommended. Worst restaurant i ever eat at"
1,"If I could give zero, I would.  Waited all day for a Century Link installer to arrive.  The window I was given was 8am - 5pm--no I am not kidding. But CL never showed anyway.  This is a new home and was ready to give CL a chance.  Now back to reliable Cox. CL needs to work on it customer service.  They are novices compared to Cox."
1,"My gynecologist nurse told me to have someone take me to the er immediately due to severe pain from my ovarian cyst. I was seen by PA Anthony Spruell. I got an ultrasound and a ct scan. I was given meds and fluids. I asked for him to call the on call gynecologist from my clinic and he refused. I was told my ovarian cyst ruptured and shouldn't be causing me any pain. I was told I have an ovarian cyst on the other ovary. I was sent home in as much pain as I was in when I came. If I ever have to go back here, I refuse to see this PA. He was very unprofessional and not sympathetic at all. A day later I am in such severe pain. Thanks for nothing."
1,"So my mother has been in and out of this hospital for four weeks now. Today has been the worse care day for her ever. Her nurse ""Tina"" on the 2nd floor has zero concern obviously because her attitude was poor when I called to talk with her about my mother and when I arrived my mother was slumped over her food tray a sleep with blood all over her hand and gown. When I went to the nurses station to talk to ""Tina"" she was condescending, rude, and lacked any urgency. Worse experience ever! If you care about your loved ones, Arrowhead may not be the place for them and pray ""Tina"" on the 2nd floor is not their nurse. I wish I could add the pictures I took, but I'll just post them on other social media sites. Maybe then someone will care about my mother."
1,"We had there service for the last year.  Was the poorest internet and tv we have ever hard in past 10 years! Signal prob tv locks up and internet goes out every day for 5 min to 20 min,Very unreliable service.... Cox is more $$$ but there system works
 
 Now they want to charge a termination fee of 125.00 for tv and 125 for internet,,,,,,$250.00 And don,t have service where we are moving

Customers Beware

 1 STAR IS TO MUCH........................................"
1,Im shocked they have any good reviews! If I hadnt thrown out the DISGUSTING beef already Id have taken a pic to show how horrifying it looked. I almost threw up! All fatty and stringy.. thats not beef by any stretch of the imagination. And the teriyaki sauce is awful too. Idk how this place even exists. Then when I asked the woman if I could just get veggies instead to put in my rice she looked at me like I was insane. Sorry your food is nasty. And I didnt want to eat it. Never wasted $7 on anythhing worse than I did today. Now im heading to work still hungry and $7 none the richer... awful. Stay away.
1,"I wish I could give them a half star because it was terrible.

Our burgers were extremely soggy. The veggie patty was the worst I've ever tried. Poutine was OK and the Nutella heaven shake was anything but heavenly (also very runny)

This will be our first and last time there."
1,"The Wilensky special tastes like what bologna, white bread, and mustard put together would taste like. There really was nothing special about this place or the food. I don't know why there is such a hype. Don't go out of your way but if you do, make sure you're paying with Canadian dollars. The exchange rate is 1 to 1, and she won't give you American dollars back for change. Overall, it was not a great experience."
1,"Avoid CenturyLink at all costs! This service is garbage.

In 4 calls over the last 3 days they haven't been able to even verify my account in less than 20 minutes in order to let me tell them why I called. This is both using their live chat and by calling them.

I paid extra to purchase their modem and I'm on my 2nd hardware failure with it this week.

This company is horrible - their service is horrible - I highly recommend you find any suitable alternative by any means necessary."
1,"I don't see why they closed,unless colleges students are much ickier than i thought. First we have one,then we have none! WOW. You'd think that it would be booming.LOCATION IS EVERYTHING.Just sayin, they have so many in California, open one on Charleston and Town Center, you'd be surprised!"
1,"I was having a debilitating amount of pain on the right side of my stomach for three days. I took ibeprofen consistently but the pain wouldn't subside. I was told by multiple people it was probably appendicitis, so after days of pain, I went to the hospital. They had no rooms when I got to the ER. I waited an hour in horrible pain to even get my info in the system, then it was almost another hour before I was in a room. The nurses and staff were very friendly so it wasn't a big deal. After that I got a cat scan done, waited another hour did the doctor to tell me I have an abnormally large cyst on my ovary. The doctor, DR. KANG, told me this and ordered an ultrasound. After a couple more hours of waiting in a lot if pain he came back, repeated I have a cyst and sent me home to ""go to a gyno"". Then he walked out. After HOURS he didn't even tell me how big the cyst was and gave no further information besides to take 600 mg ibeprofen. When I explained that I had already been taking 800 ibeprofen for days and that's why I came to hospital, and if prescription ibeprofen worked I wouldn't have needed to come. I was on morphine while in the ER and was still in a huge amount of pain. I explained this practically in tears and he literally repeated his sentences and refused other treatment. I started bawling from pain and frustration and he responded with ""I'm not prescribing you opiates"". I was COMPLETELY and utterly offended. I work 70 hour weeks and I consider myself to be responsible woman, and I can't work those hours in this kind of pain. I felt as if I was being made out as a person with a drug issue because I'm younger (24) and ibeprofen doesn't work on me. I explained how I felt and told him how I felt that he was treating me unfairly and unprofessionally. Especially by not even taking more than 30 seconds to explain what was wrong with me. He didn't even let me finish my sentence before He immediately got defensive, raised his voice, saying he told me it was a cyst and if I wanted to know the size then he would just show me the paperwork and then snapped that he would write me a different prescription and walked out. I immediately burst in to tears again. I felt as if they were just trying to get me out of the hospital without a care to my health. All he thought I cared about was getting a prescription when I was more concerned about the cyst GROWING INSIDE ME. The other staff was nice but he was very insensitive and rude the minute I stood up and told him how I felt. He treated me as an unruly 20 year old instead of a young woman in excruciating pain. I have been using arrowhead for quite some time but after today I will never go again. After six hours, $100's of my money, and still having an enormous amount of pain. I got basically no answers and felt like I was treated extremely disrespectfully."
1,Been eating yoshinoya since I was 5 that's 20 years ago I love yoshinoya in Cali wtf is this their very stingy with the ginger here!! Hate it don't recommend I rather drive to Cali. Plus they give small amount of meat it's mostly rice and the price increase man I'm so disappointed and I love yoshinoya not this one
1,"Brought my wife in for an Emergency room visit back in 2016 and walked out 3 hours later with $6k bill. That's not the worst part of you can believe that...

A YEAR LATER.....

I have been calling EVERY month to their billing department to try and rectify a mistake on their end and surprisingly agree to their shortcomings every single time. They promise they'll fix it and it never happens. They made a $4k mistake and I caught it... now, I can't get them to fix their mistake. 

Dear Abrazo, 
I am going to BBB, 3 TV on your side, and every other tv station that would love to chew on your inability to properly do your jobs and follow through. This would make a great story on a weekday night."
1,"Milton location
Ok it's new 
Ok so there will be growing pains
Ok so the bearded hipster's pant are falling off 
Ok I get it

What is obvious immediately is there is very little training. Didn't seem to have a system or the system was certainly nit a great one.
You would think,one person is grilling, another is doing the fries , another is wrapping and serving...... not quite 
Everyone bumping around each other and not communicating or calling out to each other, and no leading the team 
Order took forever, 3 people standing around looking at the cold remnants of fries , anyone think to put on fresh ones? Place was packed!
No the call was to give us cold fries. Really that's the best call?
Anyway we ended asking for fresh ones 
The burger was ok, was thin and fairly salty,
Bun was good which is a surprise, but all in all not a great burger especially compared to Five Guys , but not as expensive as them. There operation should be a training example for sure.
All in all could have been much better, maybe trainer prior to opening?
In time I'm sure it will be better
But if I'm going down the greasy burger rabbit hole 
I'll pick something else in the future!

1,"Do not, I repeat, do not get CenturyLink for your internet service...No matter what kind of deal you are offered.  It is as bad, maybe worse, than old-school dial up.  My speed is 10mbs downloads and 0.9mbs uploads.  Took over 12 hours to upload a 20 minute video to YouTube.  Unless your only plan is to check Facebook through your home wifi, search elsewhere for service.  I promise you will thank me later!"
1,I got rid of century link bundling with prism in favor of COX and they shut off my tvs a day early. I tried to call and after a half-hour in hold my phone died my wife was on hold for an hour and they said her name wasn't on the account. When I got home and called back they said their offices had closed. Don't have anything to do with this incompetent company. COX called them to shut it off on Oct. 2. Today is Oct.1. I will never use them again.
1,"Truly poor service at an otherwise pretty descent burger shoppe. 

I was excited to try one of their delicious creations however as a vegetarian I cannot eat a meat patty. No matter how much I tried to explai to the staff member and no matter how much money I offered for the difference (approx $1.50) they would not accommodate me. 

With many other burger options nearby I will not be coming back. Goodbye and hello W Burger"
1,To those they helped...i'm glad for you. But you shouldn't say you are available 24/7 days when you aren't. We needed someone at 330am yesterday when our very large dog was suffering & we couldn't move him. We called & got a recording that they weren't doing 24 hr service right now. There's only 2 places in town that claim they are 24hr at home care....well the other place isn't either.
1,I had to put in one star but this company gets NO stars from me. I disconnected my service on 8/30 after 5 years of service and now they are saying that I owe a disconnect fee. $16.82. Really!!! They gave me a final bill on 8/30 and charged my credit card. But now found something else to charge me. The best is the ass---- on the phone laughed at me and said he would not remove the charge and would not get me a supervisor. Must be nice to think he was important. NEVER NEVER sign with CenturyLink.
1,"it was really baaaad!
i don't know who gave it good reviews but i would never go back there again!
the service is really slow and the burgers are unedible!"
1,"Disgusting !!!   Shame on me.  I went there last year when it was right on Yonge Street ( if that's the same franchise)  and it was late.  Unfriendly staff cooked me a burger that was beyond greasy.  The burger fell apart.  No flavour yet so greasy.  Last night i was downtown and i seriously had to go to the bathroom , i saw Jacksons Burger on Elm and seriously said to myself "" ah crap , well i gotta take a leak, i'll just buy some fries""  so i go in, once again unfriendly staff , not rude or anything but not friendly , i order a poutine and diet coke, got no problem with 10 bucks cuz i know rent is expensive downtown.   This poutine was DISGUSTING .  Once again i only ate some it and threw it in the trash.  Gross gravy, cheese curds that didn't melt at all and lousy fries.  I was probably there 25 minutes in total.  I never did get to use the bathroom cuz i think drug addicts were in there. I could care less about the customers , i could care less about the price, but gross food and unfriendly staff?  Ya right ..... Never going back again."
1,All they care about is making money they do not care about their patients well-being I felt violated and used I will never go there again did not treat my injuries from me falling off my ladder also lied to you to get you to do what they want which is extremely unethical be very very careful going to this facility they are extremely conniving and I cannot caution you
1,"My daughter was taken to Arrowhead Hospital on 11/26/11 by the Peoria Fire Dept after passing out 2 differnt times, hitting her head, throwing up, and shaking and wetting her pants. Her nurse was so rude to her and my wife and I. Her bed side manner was so far off base. The so called P.A. that was taking care of her seemed like she did NOT care or want to take the time out to figured out what was really going on with her. I would have rather had a vet take care of my daughter then this so called P.A. who spent a total of 10 mins with her. All she did was order a number of labs to be done then after they were done she  came in said everything came back okay and said ""Some people just pass out for no real reason its nothing to worry about just go home a rest."" This was the first time she even saw her. She just did not want to take the time out to figure out what could be going on. Trust me I would not take a frog there for a Band-Aid.
I hope this is helpful and hope you are all in good health.

1,"I had my son in the ER early this morning - I am VERY unhappy that I was charged a $600.00 deposit on my credit card, when I only authorized a $100.00 deposit - I have called the billing office and the hospital direct to get this taken care of and of course, no one is will answer their phone - Next step is to contact my credit card and dispute this charge.  BEWARE - they make you pay up front and if you are lucky enough to get a refund from your deposit, it will take months - 
Also, you will receive an additional bill from the ER doctor because he is not part of our insurance group - even though Arrowhead is part of our insurance group.  This hospital is all about making the money - steer clear and go somewhere else -"

1,"Speaking of my parent's ISP in Las Vegas.  CenturyLink is not worth the hassle. We paid for 10 Mbps, we get an average of 2 Mbps.  On a good day we get 5 Mbps.  CenturyLink is a terrible Internet Service Provider.  I will be changing to cable internet, way more reliable."
1,Food was not prepared at all good....no smoking flavor. Sides are overpriced. There are better places to get BBQ
1,They trying to hard to be a Texas bbq. To much rub. Can not taste the ribs. Corn bread was over spiced and took away from what could have been flavorful  Certainly not a good representation of good Texas style BBQ.
1,"This place is filthy .... the staff is slow... I overheard a doctor yelling at staff because this place looks like a bio hazard.... I'm really concerned ...the staff seems nice though... friendly and not rude.

Update:  they charge you before they treat you here... 400$ to be exact and they charge even more billed separately by the doctor. I cannot make this up.  I am outraged..."
1,"I recently ordered fish and chips delivered from this place via UberEats. Unfortunately, the food arrived with disgusting orange seasoning powder on both the fish and the French fries. This seasoning tasted cheap and nasty and there was tons of it covering the food. It ruined my meal. 

I did not know that it was possible to screw up a basic type of dish such as fish and chips. But El Paisano managed to do so. I wonder why they would want to tamper with a classic recipe like that. 

I will not be ordering from this establishment again in the future."
1,there was a bread bag closer in my tacos!!!! a literal piece of plastic! how can they let that happen?! i will never go back!
1,"Absolutely horrible experience in the maternity ward. Not only was the climate control broken for our room that we stayed in for days, but we were billed almost 3 times as much as they presented to us when we checked out, after we left. The nurses were very nice, but the facility is in desperate need of updating."
1,"If there was a zero star rating I would have put it. This is one of the worst restaurants I've been to. The first time I went here I thought it was nice at first. But that's where the positive ends, right after we were seated at our table. The restaurant was very cold even though it was the winter and the hostess was quite rude. I understand that it was quite busy that day but almost everyone that was there had already ordered when we got there. So why exactly did we wait a good 40 minutes to order drinks. DRINKS! NOT actual FOOD but DRINKS. Mind you we went at around 7, which is later than the usually dinnertime rush. Also, while looking at the menu I found nothing that I liked. There was no really basic food (I'm more of a simple plain cheeseburger kind of person when ordering at restaurants) except for on the lunch menu. So I ordered dessert. Yes, I actually hated the options on the menu THAT much that I ordered a brownie with ice cream on top for dinner. So then we finally were able to order our food and then we waited another hour until the food was served to us. Now if we had had a large party then maybe, MAYBE, I would understand the long wait. But it was only for four people. If you recall I ordered a desert, which was disgusting. The brownie was overly hot and the ice cream was soup on top of the brownie. Everyone else's food was pretty disgusting and my dad's chicken wings were also UNDER COOKED. At the end of our meal the manager was circling the restaurant making sure that everyone was satisfied. My father told him about it and the nice man took off the cost of the chicken wings. So we figured that we wouldn't go there again. But then just a few weeks ago we decided to go there again because we wanted to go out to celebrate school being out for summer. We decided to get outdoor seats since it was a nice evening and we didn't want to have to deal with the overly air conditioned indoor seating. But the waitress placed us at a table with the sun beating directly into our eyes even though there were two other tables that were in the shade and had umbrellas. We asked the waitress to put us at another table and she did so with no attitude so we had hope for this visit. Sadly it turned dour AGAIN when we waited about the same wait to order and get served as we did the previous time. The hostess had very long hair that was just down, which I thought was interesting that they didn't make her put it up in a pony like they would do in most workplaces. So when she served our drinks her hair went right into my brothers drink. We all ordered the same burger. And the burger was burnt to a crisp and tasted pretty bad. Plus we had fries as a side to our burgers and there was no ketchup on the table just hot sauce and BBQ sauce, which was odd because that is a pretty standard condiment to have at a restaurant. In the end we will NEVER EVER got to this place again. Sorry for the long review I just feel very strong about this place. I definitely would not recommend. Also there was really nothing on the menu for kids so it's not really an ideal family place."
1,"Where do I start, I am a medium business owner, with 100 phone lines.  Centurylink has been my hell for over 3 years.  Their customer service is absolutely horrible.  
1. wait time over 15 mins
2. unorganized, so calling back to follow up is useless, they don't keep records.
3. no support, they don't know whats wrong when your lines go down, and send maintenance that cant fix it.  Its always "" talk to your phone vendor its not us""

I am trying to get my phone numbers ported over to another carrier right now, and they are putting me through such a hassle for over a month, that I decided to not even keep the numbers anymore.  
This is by far one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with in the country."
1,I went there due to severe pain in my stomach.  They took x-rays and blood tests and hooked me up to an IV because I was dehydrated. 30 minutes later they unhooked the IV and said there's nothing wrong you are being released. I got probably 10% of the IV fluid that I'm certain 100% of it will be on my bill. Later my own doctor showed I was severely depleted of potassium and my blood pressure was higher than normal. I've actually never gone to the hospital and left without a discussion of my potassium levels and supplementation.  A week later the pain is twice as bad and a CT scan shows two large cysts and a gallstone. I have no insurance yet the ER was empty of patients so why was the care so rushed and devoid of any effort?
1,"Giving this restaurant experience a one star is being kind. This was a weekday evening out with another couple. Each of us ordered different entrees, ribs, brisket, chicken and perch, all equally bad.  Ribs and brisket were extremely fatty real artery cloggers.  Chicken was dry and perch was 90% greasy burnt breading.  Our wait for food was over one hour and the waitress could only say"" we're short staffed in the kitchen"". The wait would not of been bad if the atmosphere was conducive to enjoy an evening out without having to scream to talk. Probably one of the noisiest restaurants I have ever been in EVER.  Simply put horrible horrible horrible."
1,Dry and bland. Super disappointing. Don't waste your time. This area needs better restaurants and this unfortunately isn't one of them. The only thing tasty was the pickles - not enough for a return visit.
1,"I've always wanted to try this place, the gigantic glossy pictures look great in the window and BOGO during happy hour (3pm-5pm) is an easy selling point for me.

I was quite disappointed when I got the ""swiss-made"" burger with swiss cheese and mushrooms. Small burger with a dry patty x2 makes for double the misery. I could broil a juicier patty in the oven for the same time it took for me to wait and get the burger. And the patty size - if you see other pictures indicating the size of the patty as smaller than the bun, that's what mine was like too (except my patty was too small to be seen...).

Generally, the restaurant didn't seem all that clean.

I understand that other people enjoy the burgerrito, so maybe I should get that instead next time."
1,"I'm not one to give bad reviews when unwarranted, but it was stunning how bad and overpriced this place was. I heard from some others that the food was mediocre, but thought to myself that those people really weren't ""BBQ people"" and it simply wasn't their type of place.  As someone that lives right around the corner and loves BBQ, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.  

Really disappointed.  Priced for high end BBQ with low end quality.  This place doesn't even compete with most places in town.  I really hope they turn it around or else that place won't survive long. It's really a shame...they put tons of work into making the old Fishers look great."
1,"I had a veggie burger and poutine. The place is quite beat up and dirty looking, so I should have known better. My stomach certainly paid for it afterwards."
1,"Horrible from Day One, everything from customer service to the internet service, I was supposed to get speed of 25 mbps but all got if I was lucky 5 to 7 mbps, this was not enough to get wireless printer to work. My smart TV became useless for 1 1/2 months I tried and tried but never got any better, got worst and worst everyday. At the end I wanted not part of this company, so I requested my money back because of the horrible experience I had with their service and their customer service.
I decided to pay a little more with another carrier in my town, which all I had anything but pleasure from day one, that is opposite I had with CenturyLink.
I was told that, I would be getting my refund in 30 days when I disconnected but as today is over 5 months later and still I have seen my refund yet, I had to file a complaint with the FCC for help. If you don't pay your bill on time they hit you late fees, but they play stupid with your money, still no refund so beware.  CenturyLink where is my refund?
I don't recommend this service to anyone because of my own personal experience is been negative from day one.
Is there is anyone getting 1 GIG Internet yet? They advertised it for years but everytime  you ask, they replied is not here yet.
Overprice service for what you get in return, is not worst it the headache they put you thru."
1,Only saving grace was White Raja IPA was listed as on tap unfortunately ....they were out.
1,Arrowhead ER sucks.  I have been sitting here 4 hours and being sent home and basically nothing.  The PA Christina has no clue what she is doing.  I will never come back to arrowhead again.
1,Ridiculous customer service. They messed up my order and I had to wait 45 minutes for another sub par burger. When I went to inquire why it was taking so long I was met with hostility and attitude. I suggest management teach their employees how to deal with customers in a respectful manner. Will not be coming back to this location and will ensure my family and friends don't either.
1,"This place is all kind of awful from its concept to its execution. Awful on all levels. For starters they are specific on their offerings and nothing can be substituted.  The menu had too many  instructions...all which made ordering a hassle only to raise cost. We ordered an appetizer which we didn't like...we couldn't figure out if it was a Mexican or bbq restaurant! We decided not to order meals and the waitress looked at us like we were idiots. It then took us over 20 minutes to find her to get our check so we can get out of there!!! We tried the manager who was clueless and was standing there talking to other employees. Once he tried to actually hunt her down, it  took another 10 minutes. Basically...horrible menu..horrible food..horrible service..ineffective management. Do not waste your time or money."
1,"We could not wait to go to this Quigliata BBQ restaurant, it was one of the top 10 most anticipated restaurants to open this year.  There really isn't any BBQ places local to go, so we were really excited.  This is more of a Tex-Mex restaurant and not a true BBQ place.  You can order Traditional or El Jefe style.  The restaurant just opened recently but our whole experience was bad.  Our waiter was chomping on gum, never brought plates, a knife that could cut and several other requested items.  The BBQ sauce and the ribs were terrible.  We ordered a full rack of ribs to split along with several other dinners and the waiter didn't bring plates to go with it for the other two people to eat their meal.  We asked several times for the dishes and never got them.  $28.00 large fatty ribs and the BBQ sauce was not good at all, it was a mix of BBQ and Mexican sauce.  It would be great if there was some other type of BBQ sauce to try but there wasn't.   No sides included with your meal, those are extra.  We never got the fries that were ordered either.  The pulled pork was also very plain and didn't have much flavor.  I couldn't put the BBQ sauce on it since I didn't like it.   I asked for ketchup and that tasted just like the BBQ sauce, I think it was actually the BBQ sauce.  The sweet potato mash with marshmallows was extremely delicious along with the 1/2 chicken.  We will not go back unless there are big changes made to this menu. It is not cheap to eat or drink at this restaurant so these 6 people won't be going back in the near future.  If the food was good, I wouldn't mind paying more but this was just not a good experience from the food to the service."
1,"It's okay! Compared to real Mexican food I won't give more than one stars. Need to hire more professional people in the kitchen, and speak English."
1,This company is the worst I've ever encountered. Service has been out since last Wednesday.  Had a repair scheduled last Friday.  My original time was 8 am.  When I called to confirm they said it was 8-5.  No one called no on showed up.  Called 4 times got 4 different stories.  Spoke with a supervisor named Kyle who assured me the rescheduled to Saturday.  It would be resolved.  The tech assigned had to pass the job off to another tech who knew more.  No one showed or called. Saturday afternoon I called again and Travis told me that some one was out and fixed the issue and closed the ticket.  He would have to open a new repair ticket and the earliest repair date is Friday the 28th.  My service went out on the 19th. I called customer service to cancel service because no one knows what the heck is going on.  Ashley assured me that because I had been scheduled and the issue was not resolved they would put me in the rush que and move my repair date up. The tech would call with new date. So here I sit on the phone again waiting to speak to a supervisor.  I've been told by Edillo that my service is scheduled for Friday and he has been looking for his supervisor for 21 minutes so far. This is beyond acceptable. This company is the worst.  Raymond the supervisor can't help me or move up the repair date so I am canceling service.  This company sucks.
1,"A slap in the face customer service!  These guys are the WORST company I have ever dealt with regarding customer ""service"" , more like ABUSE.  Do you want to pay Century Link to upgrade your speed? It's simple, just call them 4-5 times while you get to waste 45+ minutes while you hold.  It's like a company with ZERO supervision, these guys don't transfer you to the right dept etc.  Big huge monopoly, LTE 4G technology it fatser than DSL in most cases nowadays.  Unfortunately in Lake Las Vega this is the only company available, I think I need TUMS to deal with these people, their ignorance is legendary."
1,"High priced, lousy attempt at BBQ.  The portions are skimpy and not nearly worth the price that is being charged.  We tried the ribs.  They were a low end cut of ribs and unappealing with underwhelming flavor.  The brisket tasted ok, but again a pathetic portion for the price charged.  The shrimp tacos were tasty, however again there were only (2) very small ones which were considered a meal.  The one side we purchased, fries were good, but again not worth the $5 charge after spending so much on the meats. I rarely give poor reviews, but this so-called BBQ restaurant is a bit of a joke at this point in time.  Small portions are fine, but you can't sacrifice quality and charge a premium price.  It is good that they have a spot right at the door for Mr ""Q"" as he should probably spend more time there if he is the one with the so-called restaurant knowledge..."
1,"DO NOT GET THIS SERVICE!!

I wish someone would've warned us when we moved here and we were debating which service provider to use for our internet.

When we originally called to sign up we were supposedly paying $60.00 a month for the fastest internet connection possible and we were supposed to receive a $50.00 cash Visa card in the mail for signing up (Obviously that never happened).

Now were paying over $120.00 a month for internet service that goes slower than my 91 year old grandmother. We specifically told them we would need internet that could withstand a gamer and a student who also works from home sometimes and has a Netflix addiction. I wouldn't recommend their ""fastest"" internet for a five year old who wanted to use Paint.

Honestly such a disgraceful service provider. Definitely going to be switching services so any recommendations on a reputable internet service provider would be greatly appreciated."
1,"I was very dissappointed and disgusted.  We saw the Comedy ""On the Fly"" show, which consisted of around 7-8 comedians coming up to the stage and do their own act.   I think they should have had some warnings (or some sort of PG rate) about strong language and sexually explicit content.  They all seem to be incapable of cracking a joke without being sexually graphic or swearing/cursing at a volume level that was leaving me deaf.  And there were people under 18 in the audience, and they knew it! (they asked).  The presenters didn't care even after knowing that fact.   

There was one exception, and I think he was really funny.  He didn't even mention sex at all!  He did some jokes about his life as a model, and he was a great Obama impersonator.  I have to recognize that the host (Filipino comedian) was doing a decent job too, he tried to make a balance between sexual and non-sexual jokes.  But the rest was awful.  To make matters worse, the theater had some audio issues, the volume was so loud (or I guess the comedians only knew to yell instead of talk), that I was really afraid that my eardrum would break.

I have been in Second City before, and well, saw some stand up comedies on TV; and this show was not funny, it was offensive.  And I know that all these comedy shows at some point or another have some sexual content, but they were never that blatantly direct!  And I think it would be funnier if you just hint at it, not go on and describe the sexual act in itself.  I felt I was listening to porn audio the whole night.  Good that I didn't go in a date or brought any kids, that would have been horrible!

About food, it was ok, but the nachos were very cold, and sitting is very uncomfortable as the venue is very small and crowded."
1,"I had my baby there in August. The birth went well until we find out her head is too big so I had to have a c-section. Lost 500cc of blood that never got replaced. The nurse's assistant was rude and unhelpful, she was so horrible i requested she not come in my room for anything ever again. I spent a week there because i got an infection from the c-section. they sent me home after the week and i came back the next night bleeding horribly to find out i had a large hematoma by my uterus. they also tried making my baby go home so i couldnt breast feed. I opted out of breast feeding because of all the medication they stuffed me with. Out of the 20 doctors in and out of my room only 2 were american that i could understand. I went 2 weeks without the 500cc of blood before they finally gave me some and tried sending me home right after they put it in when they are supposed to keep you 24 hours to evaluate for reactions. it was all around horrible. i ended up going to john c lincoln 2 weeks after that 2nd week i was there and they found 2 large cysts on both ovaries that arrowhead somehow never saw even after getting a CT scan there. It's been 5 months and im still in horrible pain. I couldnt walk for about 3-4 weeks after birth. I will never, ever go to that hospital or take my baby there!!!"
1,The worst there is. I can't even imagine anything worse than these guys. In ever single phase. They literally don't do a single thing good or even correct. DONT SIGN UP WITH THEM !!! Your better off with a rotary.
1,"I REALLY wanted this place to be good. The poor reviews kept me away for a long time but  I ventured in today for a late lunch around 3 PM and sat by myself at the bar. I managed to get a 9$ Prosperity Wheat (yeah 9 bucks) pretty quickly but then went unattended for way too long while at least 10 staff members milled around. 

When I finally got service I ordered the Momma bear combo or something like that. Pulled pork (dry and over salted) brisket (dry and flavorless) and ribs (fatty dry burned and tough and apparently boneless?!). It came with a corn and bean salad and slaw which were pretty good and a roll from like Costco. If you want a piece of cornbread that's another $5. I didn't bother complaining  - I'm sure what I got was what they intended to serve. 

To top it off!  Their cloth napkins shed lint everywhere!  So my black shirt is now looking like I have a bad case of dandruff!  Upon alerting the bartender she said ""yeah we know. We are getting some new ones in next week"".   Good grief. Really!?!!? You know!!??!!  This joint is laughable. I will post a pic of my shirt. I can't photo the food since it is already in their trash. 

I used to come in here when it was Fishers and the makeover is spectacular. Great use of the space now. I'm not optimistic that this crew can improve their offering (It really is THAT bad) so I guess I will just wait for their inevitable closing and see what comes next .  I won't be back until then."
1,"First time visit. Ventured in on a Wednesday evening and was seated promptly. Waitress was pleasant and drinks were brought to our table in a timely manner, but that's where the positives stopped. We waited over an hour for our food. I had the beef brisket which was very salty and greasy. The corn bread was basted with too much butter and the red coleslaw was sour tastings. 
My wife ordered the perch sandwich which was also greasy and dark brown in color. It was all breading and very little fish.  The ribs lacked flavor and were very fatty.  The bbq sauce wasn't my favorite, too watery. I was told they had a shortage of kitchen help. I guess we were there on the wrong night.  We were disappointed!"
1,"OMFG!!!! Been a customer since 1995....when it was sprint...I have had major issues with Centurylink for 3 years....it was so bad i OVER PAID over 100.00 a month because I could not deal with spending days on the phone  to get this corrected!!!!   I am SO OVER the AMOUNT OF TIME i HAVE SPENT BANGING MY HEAD INTO THE WALL TO GET THEM TO STOP OVER CHARGING ME!!! I cancelled my service and they did not disconnect, INSTEAD THEY sent 2 technicians out the next day (NO IDEA WHY!!) still could not get centurylink to UN FREAKING BUNDLE DIRECT TV FROM THIS WHOLE NIGHTMARE (I like Direct TV)  stop charging me for direct TV, that was disconnected 3 MONTHS EARLIER...to which not only did i have to pay direct TV, but i also had to pay centurylink for the same direct TV (like 450.00 i paid 2 times) I disconnected my phone, they re-connected it and charged my a deposit and a re-connection fee, then i had to disconnect again, which i was still trying to get credit for the 450.00 and now 2 re-connection fees and 2 deposits (To turn off my phone service). THAT IS JUST THE BEGINNING!!!!!! i CANNOT WAIT UNTIL i CAN  GET INTERNET IN MY AREA OTHER THAN CENTURYLINK.......so frustrating dealing with such ignorance, such lack of communication, this company must be going belly up!!!!   A NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"My stay at the hospital was great. Loved all of the staff and nurses that cared for us.
Unfortunately we don't have anything good to say about the billing/payment process. We received a bill for both my son and I- both had items I questioned on the bills. I tried calling to speak with someone regarding the charges that we were given and I couldn't get through. I left several voicemails with no call back. After talking to billing team they told me I could dispute the charges since I wasn't getting a response back. I was told when I disputed the charges someone would call to discuss each dispute with me, if I didn't receive a call the charges were disputed. A month passed and we got another bill. I called billing back and was told my disputes were denied. Again with no call, no explanation, just another bill. The hospital doesn't mind charging me but will not talk to me to walk through the charges. 
We will be choosing to deliver our next child at Thunderbird.."
1,I wish I could say something good! All I can say is don't do it! We have the top of line as far as modems are offered by them. Not satisfied at all very slow & sometimes doesn't even work! Even if you allow only 1 device it's still slow as heck!
1,Easily the worst experience I've ever has was getting my service switched over to my new place. They didn't show up when they were supposed to and was constantly given the run around terrible service! Not worth the couple bucks you save over cox!!
1,"RUN TO COX its down the street.

century link is dishonest and will cheat and lie to you. 

went into the store to grab the 30 dollar promotion only to find out that it is actually 35 unless your sign up for auto pay when you signed up for the account.... with out ever seeing the bill. 

GOOD THING I DID NOT DO AUTOPAY!  my bill came out to be 162 when i only purchased 30 dollar internet. 

after many calls and store visits i resolved this issue (i thought i did) by canceling service and with the 30 day guarantee i should not have to pay anything. 2 months later (not sure why it takes so long) i get the new revised bill with all my credits. and i see that i have a 17 dollar charge.. for a phone line which i never signed up for... 

Justina helped me and i suggest not talking to her. she doesn't know what modems are or how they work
additionally other employees are not allowed to help you unless you signed up through them so whats the point of having more than one employee if they are not allowed to help the customer. 

century link is slow, poor customer service and worst of all they lie and cheat the customer and billing is a nightmare, not to mention they offer gigabit internet but know nothing about it because it doesn't need a modem.

i switched back to cox, its a little more expensive but i got the internet installed the next day and accurate billing with no taxes with in a week."
1,Pho was okay and crap. Will never ever try again and will never ever go to this crappie place ever again
1,Not even sure why they have stores. You walk in and they cannot help you with anything. If you want to see Century Link home security they cannot help. If you have questions about new services coming they cannot help. It is not the fault of the store reps its the company as a whole.
1,"I REALLY, REALLY wanted this place to be good. It is not. Their motto is ""tender as your mother's love.  Well, the head chef's mother must have hated him.  The ribs were like salty pork jerky, and the brisket was so dry I had to douse it with the only sauce they give you( which was gross). The service was excellent, I just hope the chef can put his ego aside, realize he is putting cheap on a plate, and feed his customers something more on par with the service.  I expected So much more from an overpriced bbq joint. Don't waste your time or money on this place."
1,"Had an overnight stay following surgery and was put in a two bed tiny room.  There was absolutely no privacy between the two beds, I could hear everything discussed about the patient as I am sure she could about me.  Family brought in carry out food which said patient gobbled down and promptly threw up. Bedding was changed and left lying on the floor at the foot of my bed.  Turned my stomach! I got no sleep whatsoever, due to all the commotion and constant visits for labs. etc for the other patient. They always managed to bang their trolley into my bed on the way past and very very noisy. Thankfully I was only in one night. I asked about single room but was told they were only for cases of infection, dialysis etc. I could see across to the single room opposite which had a very healthy looking patient sitting up laughing, kind of blows that excuse out of the water. The only plus was the excellent nurses who incidentally are very overworked but were kind and helpful. I did complain after the event but got a standard 'nothing we can do' letter telling me how they aim to care for all their patients. Failed on that for sure."
1,Indian dude on the grill is very rude. This place used to be great. Now it is a hit and a miss.
1,"Over priced with mediocre food. I ordered a brisket and two beers for my dinner. The brisket was dry, the brioche buns that came along were cold and the beer was $9 each!"
1,Switched over to centurylink 6 weeks ago. Lots of hidden charges on my first bill. The internet service has been TERRIBLE. Very slow! Promo gift card takes 3 months to arrive. First bill $50 credit did not happen. They do not put anything in writing when they come to sign you up. DO NOT RECCOMEND. I will end my service at end of contract.
1,"Kind employee, wrong prices on drive-thru board, overpriced (over $6 for their basic burger), super greasy meat, soggy bread, didn't try the fries because they're shoe-string and I'm not a fan of those in general. 

Bummer, since I live very close by, but I'll continue going to In-n-Out."
1,"Who knew a place that can be so popular can be so disgusting.  I didn't know a beef bowl with vegetables could be made so bad.  The veggies were slimy because they were covered in some glop along with some thing disgusting beef that just smelled.  I've tried it in California also, and it tastes the same here.  I just don't get how it's so popular."
1,This location needs to be removed from Uber eats and Yelp. Lady claims to cancel my order and not deliver it because she didn't have chicken for 2 out of the ten items I ordered
1,If you want food poisoning you should go there. We got so sick the next day after we ate there. the food sucks. Both the burrito and the tacos were kinda soggy. I like spicy sauce but they put a ton of it so it was hard to eat. And the chicken was very dry.
1,"This place has potential but unfortunately the clientele render the shows it completely unwatchable.  Every time I go large groups of inebriated guests endlessly interrupt the show. 

Unfortunately this place is more bar than comedy so they let it carry on."
1,Ordered 2 burgers and a poutine. The Burgers were maybe at best 3/5. The poutine ...well they gave us fries instead. I went back to ask for the poutine/refund. They couldn't find our order. NTS keep all receipts especially to garbage establishments like this.
1,"TRASH!! RUN AWAY!!! 

Centurylink is complete garbage!! Take my word. I signed up for the cheap internet trying to save a few dollars from cox. THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!! They had to replace their equipment 3 times!!! Ended up going back to cox and now stuck with a $200 termination fee. DONT DO IT!! I wish I listened to the reviews."
1,"BEWARE!!! DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! REPEAT DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! THEY HAVE BED BUGS AND ROACHES ALL THROUGHOUT THE APARTMENTS  (The streets are cleaner than these apartments). 

I lived here back in 2013 when I first moved to Vegas and didn't know any better. When I lived here the managers (who are still the same rude, unthoughtful, down right HORRIBLE people and specifically I'm addressing SANDY and DESIREE) would make a million excuses for why things happened but never would fix the issue. 

Leap 2 years forward and I've learned never ever to be associated with rebel place and my friend moves into the complex (even tho I warned him how horrible the managers SANDY ESPECIALLY and units are). Upon moving in they didn't have a storage unit ready for him (which he had preordered in advance) and the apartment was A COMPLETE MESS. IT WAS DISGUSTING. IM NOT BEING DRAMATIC LIKE TRASH ALL OVER THE APARTMENT, floors were filthy, lightbulbs missing smelled horrible. Trash everywhere. So of course I'm there to help him fill out the move in check list and we note how filthy the place was and even his room which was supposedly ""cleaned before he moved in"" literally there was dirt all over his bedroom floors. Took us two days to clean his room alone (then we had to clean the common areas because the manager said it wasn't their responsibility to ensure the apartment was clean when you moved in. Which should have been a sign right away). Next, one of his 3 roommates was being evicted for not paying rent. Weeks go by and he's finally evicted and what does rebel place do you ask, well they change the locks without notifying any of the tenants. So my friend was locked out and had no clue why. Rebel place couldnt take the time to notify one of the three other tenants that lived there that they were changing the locks. BUT BY FAR THE WORST THING EVER was waking up after spending the night to have a pest control representative come in to let us know that they heard that there was a bed bug problem. Did rebel place let any of the tenants know there was a bug infestation Nooooo they only had someone come because they wanted to ""clean"" the room that the evicted tenant had been staying in. The bed bug infestation was so bad that the entire apartment had to be sprayed. Every part of the apartment was infested. You think rebel place would be supportive and try to help its tenants WRONG. SANDY the manager said she couldn't do anything other than call pest control. When I went with my friend to address the issue SHE REFUSED TO TALK TO ME AND THEN SAID SHE WAS ""TOO BUSY"" to help us. That she would call pest control and that was all she could do. She didn't offer any form of alternative relocation in the mean time and kind of dismissed the issue. Further, SANDY SAID ""this is student housing were not held to the same laws"" when I was addressing tenant rights. SANDY IS A LIAR they are not considered student housing and on top of it neither my friend nor his roommates were even students. After staying that night my entire body was covered with red marks ""bites"" and I was itchy for days. I had to throw away clothing for fear of bringing it back to my apartment. TOPPER** so my friend and I go back to the office to speak with SANDY about how he had mentioned how dirty the place was when he first moved in on his checklist (which is also a liability form to address any prior issues to the apartment so that he's not held liable when he moves out) and guess what ""THEY LOST IT."" LIARS!! They didn't want to be held liable for how filthy the place was.  

THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PLACES TO LIVE IN, IN LAS VEGAS. I AM NOT KIDDING, IT LOOKS NICE ON THE OUTSIDE BUT IT'S FILTHY. THE WALLS ARE THIN YOU CAN HEAR EVERYTHING AND THEY WILL CHEAT YOU OUT OF MONEY. THERE ARE BED BUGS THROUGHOUT THE COMPLEX. ITS IN A DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE MANAGERS SANDY** DESIREE** ARE HORRIBLE! I really hope fair housing, the Health department, better business bureau shut this place down."
1,Went in for my first time tonight to get to go. Took awhile to get waited on at the bar. Dinner was over $20.00 for myself. Got home and the order was wrong. Tipped the bartender $3.00 on the order and it was wrong. Called and was told I could bring the food back. I am tired and ordering go food at 9:15 at night after a 12.5 hour shift. I do not want to go back!! Right the first time would have been nice. First impression mean a lot and this first impression sucked!
1,"Food was served cold and we had to returned the food to warm up.
We ordered yougurt and received it after we finished!!"
1,"Service was horrible. Simply way overcharging for their level of service. It was to my disbelief to hear from several servers that they've ran out of forks or spoons. There was a total of 1 spoon for a party of 5. Even a simple request for a bowl or glass of water requires numerous attempts. Ambiance and food was pretty good but service was simply horrific. We were only served half of the food we ordered and needed to ask at least 3 times from different waiters to receive our order. 
I'd never go back to this restaurant nor would I recommend to anyone. Just to be fair, food quality was fine and the ambiance was nice. Washroom was dirty."
1,"What the hell is wrong with foodies in Madison, and how was this place ever voted ""Best of"".  WTF people.  Oh, I'm sorry...I didn't realize Russian Gulag Catering was a category.  In that case.  The food was bland, lukewarm and it had texture.  I can't say enough about the mystery meat since I'm not sure what it was.  It wasn't chicken, and it definitely didn't taste like chicken.  For everyone that gave this place more than one star.  Was there a roofie in your drink and you passed out before you ate?  Or, are you in a Russian Gulag camp, and does Putin make media day trips before elections to shake hands?"
1,"Rebel Place Apartments WAS a nice place to live in. The rates are quite low compared to the rest of the apartments near UNLV. They have a shuttle that gets you to and from UNLV which is very handy for attending students. The shuttle leaves exactly on time based on shuttle schedule so be sure not to be a minute late- you will miss it. 
The security WAS reliable at one point where there would be at least 2-3 security guards patrolling the campus and one stationed at the entrance gate throughout the night. As of right now with the new management, they have settled with a new security company- and a bad one on that. Currently there is only 2 hired security guards. Both of which don't do any patrolling whatsoever. All they do is try to impress girls by opening the clubhouse during late hours and chill in there through the duration of their shifts.
The new management is a complete joke. They are all completely rude and could care less of your opinions especially if you're already a resident that signed a lease with them. They just care about the money. If you're already a resident and have a vacant room in your unit, the new management will inform you a day in advanced that someone will be moving into that room. Whereas the other management would give you at least a weeks notice, giving you more time to clean and organize everything for when he/she moves in.
The campus is filthy. Always seem to find trash laying around in big numbers and still finding homeless people rummaging through the garbage dump in the middle of the night. I even found a used pad just laying in the middle of the parking lot a couple weeks back.
If you're planning to move into an apartment where it's just yourself and you're attending UNLV, this place is perfect for you if you can endure through this hell hole. However, if you're planning to find an apartment with a friend or two, you have a lot of options to choose from that is far better than this place with even cheaper rates, better management, security presence, and a cleaner environment."
1,"Crap. $18 for fried chicken thighs, ham hock & collard greens? Really? Are we at Navy Pier (tourist trap with overpriced food for those who don't know). I've had an incredibly excellent combination of the same for far less. What a joke! Don't get me started on the pathetic pulled pork slider ($8). The potato chips (all six of em') tasted like oil & stale. Speaking of stale, how about the slider bun? Truly, this thing was stale. If it wasn't, then it must have been toasted & sat around for two hours. The pulled pork was, how you say, pedestrian? That's being nice. The first taste of pulled pork brought me back to high school - the cafeteria specifically. It was also room temperature. There was a very teeny-tiny cup of flavorless coleslaw & a deviled egg. The egg was actually the best part of this dish, but let's be real here, a deviled egg is nothing special - not anymore than any other deviled egg I've ever had. What a disappointment. I give this place maybe 2 years & gone. I will hand it to the chef though, as perhaps he is the first person to take the soul out of soul food."
1,Staff was unaware of the difference between lo mein and chow mein...staff was very rude when I said the food was very salty. When I called the owner all she said was we are busy and that's how we do it and if I didn't like I shouldn't come back...I won't be back.
1,"This place is AWFUL. I'm sorry, there's just no nice way of saying it. 

I picked up my food and while waiting for it, there was a man complaining about his meal and asking for his money back. This should have thwarted me but I ended up paying 30 dollars for this crappy food. 

We order the sweet and sour chicken. The sauce has a strange flavor, unlike the traditional red sauce, this was orange and bland. Almost like jello. We also ordered the egg drop soup, which was very thick and had an odd taste to it, seemed old. And also ordered the crab puffs which were bland, room temp, and just tasteless. 

Way too expensive, I paid 30 bucks for food we ended up just throwing away. 

Do not recommend for those who love a good Chinese spot."
1,"If I could give no stars, i would. the manager is a compulsive liar who will try her best to manipulate you and turn everything around on you. rent cost went up this year because they were going to put in new floors. when i showed up to move in, the floors were not done. the manager lied to me and said my carpet was new but it was covered in stains, food etc. i was told 3 different times that either 1. the floors were done or 2. they will be done today. management continually lied to us about the floors being done or when they would be done. maintenance does not respond to issues with the apartment... and if they do, it takes months. DO NOT RENT HERE."
1,"Pls do your self a favor and don't choose to go here. Instead you should go to the one right in front of this  restaurant called ""Kirali Restaurant'.  

I placed an order for Mutton Kothu Rotti over the phone. When I went there and saw the bill I almost fainted.  The cost of a mutton kothu rotti is almost $15 dollars.  The funny thing is it wasn't even enough for one person. I asked the waitress why it is so much for just one mutton kothu rotti , she didn't have an answer for me. I told her this is the last time I am coming here.  She said 'oh thats fine we get enough business from other customers'. 

At Kirali Restaurant it is almost $12 and its enough for 2 people.

I would never go back to Karaikudi."
1,"The staff here cannot comprehend English. We wanted to sit on the outside of a 6 person table instead of the inside as it was tight and crowded. She said no, and then proceeds to sit another couple on the outside. Poor customer service..."
1,"I have bought two cars from this dealer and have also sent two people in to buy cars. My experience was not bad but I was supposed to be getting two $100 referral check for the two people I sent. Never got my first check but that was a few years ago. But this last person I sent in was almost a year ago and I still have yet to see a check. I call every other week to check up on it and I'm always getting another excuses why I have not received my check. Here is just a few of them: manager had a heart attach, check printing machine is broke, lost in the mail, haven't had time, check writing department is closed for the day, and more. Excuse after excuse. I'm sick of it and will never be back. Stinks for them being that I buy a new car every few years and have been loyal to Mazda for my last three. Looks like I'll be going to Berge Mazda. If your curious who I've been dealing with it is Al Lanz and Thomas Michael but I'd avoid this dealership all together. They are horrible and full of lies. CardinaleWay Mazda, I really hope you get your act together. Your making Mazda look really bad."
1,Ordered online ... said my order would be ready at 9:30 ... came up to the cash register to pick up my order and guess what?  Didn't even bother to look at the online orders ... thanks Caps!!  Your the best ...!!! Third time this has happened ...
1,"Ordered takeout for 4 and was told our bill was $84.00.  When hubby went to pick up order they said they made a ""mistake"" adding the order the first time and now the bill was $110.00!  A $26.00 mistake adding!  Just said they were sorry.  Had we not had out of town guests we would have left the whole order.  HOW can they not add correctly as we were on hold for 5 minutes waiting for the total.  Never order from here again."
1,The only good thing about this place is the shuttle to school. Other than that its horrible my room was dirty and damaged when I moved in. At the time of move in you are asked to evaluate the room and if you dont find every little thing that is wrong with your room(which is a lot) you will be charged a ridiculous amount of money to replace it. Dont move into rebel place you will end up broke!
1,"Out of biscuits.  Yes.  Just out.  Not busy on my visit, and yet my simple food order takes a very long time (remember, this is an airport location with a limited menu and no seating).  Then, they got the order wrong and of course it's too late to go back and get it corrected."
1,"I wish I could give it 0 stars, this place had my boyfriend wait over 30 minutes for his food. Apparently there is a usual wait, however the employee never gave notice of that. To top it off the employee cooking forgot to start making the food. How does one forget to make food if it's your sole responsibility?.... 


It was the last chance for my boyfriend to experience the famous lolo's chicken and waffles and the employees completely dropped the ball. I understand things happen, but why not try to correct the problem and try to rush an order, to try and turn the customer experience around?

After working in the food and beverage industry for 11 years, I would expect better. Luckily they refunded his money, but they could have cared less.

Stick to other places in the airport for food."
1,"I called to ask whether I could make reservation, and gave them an estimate arrival time, which I was told that I can walk in to eat without waiting in line. I drove 45 minutes, and was told the last call was passed, so they cannot seat me. They time I arrived the restaurant was 1.5 hour before they closed. Worst in the worst service I have ever experienced!!! Don't even try wasting your time!"
1,"First and last time I'll visit the airport location. 47 minutes for fries & chicken. Too much socializing by cashier and cook. After a couple of selfies, I think they realized I was still waiting for my order."
1,"Second time coming here. Terrible & rude customer service will not go again; happened on Oct 25 2017 10-11 AM . I went to get take-out and I asked (all dialogues in Cantonese) if they accepted cards for payment. She said, ""Wow so little and you want to pay with card"". Then I paid with cash, and then she said, ""Don't play around kid"". After this, she gave me some change in USD, when I asked if I could get a Canadian quarter instead of American, she said, ""USD is worth more than CAD"". I didn't care because I can't legally use it in Canada and it is inconvenient. She eventually took it back and gave me a new one, but I can sense the negativity from her."
1,"I have been coming back here a few time since and each time it's been slightly worst.
My recent visit was the top that has convince me I'm not going back to this restaurant.
I generally have a lot of tolerance for rude service even though I really shouldn't.

We went to the restaurant on a Saturday and it was busy.  I did expect it to be slow (as usual) but not rude.

First strike for me - I asked to sit at the back table and they told me no because it was busy.  We had a party of 4 and the table accommodated 5.  Anyhow, not long after we sat down, someone else (known to the staff) came in (a party of 2) and sat where I had requested to sit.

2nd strike -  Generally you get kimchi & soya beans as starters but this time we didn't so I asked for it.  The first person said they will bring it but never arrived. 

3rd strike - When I asked another wait staff, she said ' do I look like I have kimchi'.  We don't have any & it's too busy.

The food which is really why I am tolerant, did finally came but it was not good.  Everything was under seasoned & had no taste.  The dumplings skin was too doughy and thick."
1,"I frequent the Aliante Sierra Gold and find it near perfect.  My experience at the Henderson Restaurant was the worst I have had,  ever!  Food service took forever to arrive,  was cold,  and not up to par for a slop house.  They did adjust my Bill which is to their credit however I will never go back there again.  This was my second  time there this week.  The first was so excellent that I took my wife there today...
Then I get very slow disservice.  Even the check took forever. So much so I went to the kitchen looking for my server! ""Oh, sorry, we had to get an order out "" was the servers response when I found her.  TERRIBLE, STAY AWAY"
1,"The butter chicken here is good but when we ordered the second one it tasted completely different, it was very sweet compared to the other one that was buttery and a bit more spicy. When I addressed the issue they told me all butter chicken was cooked in the same pot that even if they change it, it would have been the same. I am really confused as of why all 4 of us agreed that it was different and even the colour was different. The food here is ok but the service here is horrible I would not return."
1,"The one waiter we had was great but the manager clearly does not care about retaining a customer base or anything even close to such intentions. I went there for my sisters birthday and I am a vegetarian. They did not have any vegetarian soups, which is fine, except when I asked for just hot water in my pot, they said they had to charge me 2.50 for it. I was completely ready to pay the 23.99+tax for hot water and vegetables, but half of their items on their menu were also not available. When we asked to speak to the manager, he refused to come over and was hiding by the counter. 

With that said, the rest of the party I was with was impartial to the food. The beef was tough, the options were limited, they didnt even have tongs or soup spoons which would definitely help in the cooking process. Overall I miss our go to hot pot place that recently closed and was really hoping for a replacement. I will definitely not be returning and will be advising others to go elsewhere."
1,"*****BED BUG INFESTATION*******

Forewarning! DO NOT RENT FROM REBEL PLACE!!! I was here for not even 2 weeks and within the first week my boyfriend and I found these huge bites on our back that were itchy. It turns out that rebel place is KNOWN TO HAVE A BED BUG PROBLEM. 

First thing we did was call Brandon in the front office that night, and he basically said that because it was a Thursday at 4PM, there was nothing he could do about it and advised that we sleep there. SLEEP IN A PLACE WITH BED BUGS. Also, because we didn't notify Rebel Place that we had an infestation within 48 hours of ""moving in""(even though I had not been living there for a few weeks after ""moving in""), it was not their responsibility.

They said that WE have to pay for an inspector to come out before we could get the place sprayed. HOWEVER, even though we paid for it, we were FORCED to use their company, Global Pest Control. We were not even allowed to contact Global Pest Control to ask about the report or how much the treatment would cost and turns the inspector they used was totally WORKING WITH REBEL PLACE. The report said that there was bed bug feces, YET no bed bugs found, therefore rebel place is not responsible. He basically said in his report that he found evidence and then later stated there was no evidence of bed bugs. 

Finally, we hired a bed bug scientist with our own money to come out and he said that yes there is evidence of bed bugs, as well as a previous infestation and gave us a proper report on his findings. He said that these bed bugs have been here for long before we moved in, and that Rebel Place most likely has more infestations because they can travel from room to room.
 
It is actually against the health code to force someone to stay in their lease when bed bugs are present. After countless phone calls to the regional managers and corporate offices with the help of an attorney we were able to get out of the lease.

The whole time Mandi refused to do anything because ""there was no evidence"". We eventually found one and killed it, and brought it to her office for her ""evidence"".
OTHER PROBLEMS:

-Homeless men dumpster dive daily, and I would be scared for anyone that tried throwing away their trash at night.

-5+ cars can go through the ""secure gate"" aka letting anyone and everyone inside.

-The security guard is a joke, they don't even kick out the homeless people. 

-If you call rebel place ""student apartments"" then these students would be defined as people who are ages 35+. I was terrified of all these residents. 

-If your car is semi-nice it will be targeted. Most of the cars in the lot are 20 years old and beat up. There even was a wrecked car that sat in the back of the lot, and tons of cars are parked in the visitor spots that haven't been moved in weeks. A tow truck would come and tow away cars at least once a week because non-residents would park in handicap spots at night while at the pool parties.

-There was a hole in the fence between the sketchy apartments and rebel place and when I notified the office of this issue it took them almost 2 weeks to fix it. 

-Front desk never answers the phones even during their ""business hours"".

-On multiple occasions police were called and present in the parking lot. 

-Upon move in, apartment was filthy and obviously had not been cleaned. They claimed to do an inspection to ensure all appliances and sinks were working properly but blatantly did not. Kitchen sink was leaked not only on top of the counter but also under the cabinet causing the wood to have severe water damage and pools of water. Washer was broken and shower did not work.

-Random NON-RESIDENT black men(who sneak through the ""secure gate"") throwing parties at the pool while blasting music nightly.

-Was told cable would be installed BEFORE move-in, it took 3 weeks to get cox to come and install cable in my apartment. 

-When moving in Brandon in the front desk did not explain how anything works and not even which keys belong to which doors in the apartment. I never found out what mailbox number I was.

-Keypad at the main gate to the parking lot was supposed to be able to let in guests by calling the resident's cell phone. I attempted to let guests in numerous times and never once did this method work. I talked to the office countless times and was ensured the problem was being fixed A.S.A.P. (Guess what, it was never fixed.)

Whatever you do, AVOID REBEL PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!"
1,"I rarely write reviews, but I am writing this in the hopes of saving other people from becoming a Rebelplace victim. This is THE WORST apartment in town. I stayed here for less than 2 months. I chose this area because it is close to UNLV, however, the benefit of being close to the school is not worth the trouble of having to deal with all the difficulties that come with staying at this place. First, it is located in a very unsafe area. I had to make sure I was inside my place before sun down. Second, the management was not accommodating at all to their tenants' needs. In addition, when the maintenance needs to fix anything, they barrage your unit without any consideration. If you complain to them to have anything done, you are putting yourself at risk of being charged for something that should be covered by the management. I have more complaints to say, but I think you guys get the point! Lastly, when you leave and even after having the room cleaned, they will charge you additional overpriced charges even if you leave the unit clean. And they only give you 7 days to pay the charges and threaten you of submitting the claim to collections. WHAT A RIPOFF!!! Save yourself of headache, DO NOT STAY HERE!!! There are numerous apartments near the campus. STEER CLEAR OF REBELPLACE!!!"
1,"Horrible experience.  I've eaten here numerous times and ordered the chicken Cesar salad and it came with breaded chicken; this time it came with grilled.  No big deal right?  Oh but wait, when I asked the waitress Lisa she insisted that hey NEVER make it with breaded chicken and walked away.  As I was on my lunch so I didn't have a lot of time, so I thought to myself I'd just order a small side of chicken tenders......but when I ""inconvenienced"" this waitress by asking for a small order she said that the smallest she could do was the lunch portion, which I didn't want to pay another 10 for.  So after looking blankly at me for a second she said ""well?"" And I said nevermind, then she walked away.  Very disappointed with this place and would not recommend others coming here."
1,"Worst customer service! Server was in a ""loud voice"" talking to us (feels like she's yelling) We ordered Large soup, grilled pork with rice & a veggie rolls but The server asked us to order more since we were 4 in a table. Eventhough my husband doesn't want to eat! Server still insisted us to order one more. Lastly an insect is roaming around our table while we were eating!! I don't recommend this! Will never come back here"
1,"I am very disappointed.  When I moved in this place was ok.  Over time however, things have started to chip away.  I cannot in good faith endorse this place.  At one time I would have recommended it to anyone I knew moving out here."
1,"Would give 0 Stars if possible.

Regularly shop at King's Vegetarian in this little plaza and decided one day to try the Dumpling Restaurant next door.

We liked the dumplings.  They are good quality.  We initially thought that we are going to return.  Although the place did not look particularly clean in that dirty dishes were not cleared, and service not friendly, we were still going to return until we got the bill.  It was simply a piece of paper with a total amount!!!  No itemization, no tax, AND it was wrong.  Several dollars over what it should have been.  We questioned but got no satisfactory answer so we did not feel liking fighting so we just paid what they asked and decided never to go back.

If you want dumplings, try New Northern Dumplings on SilverStar. 

If you are willing to pan fry or boil or steam dumplings yourself, you can get fabulous dumplings in the 4385 plaza.  The Store is at the far end of the plaza from the Dumpling Restaurant.  You will see three or four staff preparing the dumplings on large tables and it is super clean.  The dumplings are really good.

We will never never return to this restaurant."
1,"Came here last Sunday to celebrate my sisters birthday. 
I'm not going to speak of the expensive prices as I'm okay with paying for quality.
This was not quality food.
I returned the ceviches I ordered as they smelled and tasted rotten. 
This was handed to the manager who with out asking took them from me. I later went up to the manager and spoke to him about the lack of service and the horrible ceviche.
He apologized and said he would make it up to the table.
We were not compensated for the ceviches, however we did incur additional charges of $4 per person for cutting our cake.
I'm completely disappointed and cannot believe the lack of professionalism at an establishment that I've heard so much about. Our group of friends and family won't be returning to this ""restaurant "" nor
Will I be recommending it. The 1 star was given because there was no 0 star option."
1,"I can not begin to explain my frustrations. I bpught a car from these guys 3 weeks ago and currently they have had it more then me with all the problems

I cpuld deal with that part, but I am currwntly waiting for the manager Jason Graves to call back about it gping in again for the third time for the same thing, still not fixed.

These guys have had me buy their loaner cars, 3 tanks of gas, one was so bad it didnt have enough gas for me to get to the gas station to fill ot for them

They tried to have me take it through emissions when they realized they hadnt yet, the original problems are all still going on, they haf me make a list, fixed nothing, took advantage of my wife not knowing, and told her they werent fixing a headlight that was broken when I bought it.

I missed a dr. Apt. Waiting one time for them to get thier stuff together, and traeted me as thpigh I was inconvienencing them having them fix the problems they sold the car to me with.

This isnt even all of it.

I'd give the car back if it was an option with how terrible they have been. They are shady, cheap and dishonest.

I only write this hoping I save even 1 person from having the terrible experience my wife and I have had to endure"
1,"Let me tell you we used to love lamb Briyani from karaikudi, but seriously what we have received today it's not even close to Briyani simply yellow rice with some lamb pieces!!! Why ? What happened to South Indian flavorful taste in Briyani? Not gone order anymore!!!!"
1,"Worst service, and they expect tips? 

Is this sliced lamb?"
1,"New place. Sister of Ming Kee in Scarborough but Methinks not....Tried this place yesterday with famiy and I was extremely disappointed....in service, price, quality and everything else...

I mean how can one screw up on a chinese restaurant aka ""cha chaan tang"" its like quick eats...people come in, they order, eat and leave...simple as 1-2-3-4....

Ming Kee use to be a favourite but I think one of the owners left and the quality started going down the slope....so we just stopped going to that location once and for all...

Now this one opened, like the usual, people like to go and try new stuff and if it disappoints...it's time to let everyone know...

So, I ordered the Porkchop rice with Tomato sauce and cheese, which is something safe and slightly easier to do..it clearly said cheese with tomato sauce and porkchop on it...when it arrived...there was no cheese..whatsoever....so I asked and they said...""Oh, if you order the tomato sauce there is no cheese because we feel cheese does not go right with our tomato sauce"" so why did you put cheese in the menu...thats called deceiving customers...!!!

So I insisted on getting cheese, the plate comes back...and it had ""burnt"" marks over the tomato sauce.....thats what they call adding cheese to it? OMG seriously??? Are you joking me...? Boy; was I upset or what....anyways....the plate and portions are bigger than normal but it taste HORRIBLE...

family member ordered steak with spaghetti, it was tasteless...and black pepper sauce only had the colour...no black pepper sauce taste in it whatsoever...

The pricing is more expensive than some of the popular places in the area like Phoenix and Congee Queen...I AM 100% SURE YOU WILL GET BETTER FOOD there....

After going home, I felt sick and the food felt like it wasn't digesting..even until the next morning....I have no idea what they put in the food but I AM NEVER GOING BACK...

I would be surprised if this business will last over 1 yr...if they keep what they are doing now...."
1,"This place looks nice and is pricy for a Chinese Restauant.  We were staying at the Bouders resort and decided to try this place because its across the street. .

This place is not very good at all.  The food is greasy and portions small.
Please save yourself some money and don't eat there.  We could not even finish our food because its so nasty.  We had to order pizza again
Because we were still hungry."
1,Curry Wasp or Bee on my dinner and ends up almost $50.00 a dinner last night? Why am I get served and ends up not listening to my customer service where I am not going to eat this place where I am not going back there again.
1,"My Mom and I come to this place all the time during the week and have amazing service in the day shift. We come back not because the food is good but because of the staff. They are friendly and outgoing. Thank you to Kristy, Lisa, Brittany. Last night was a different story. We sat in our favorite seat and the place wasn't too busy. I've seen it busier. The waitress that we had we had once before and she was so terrible but my Mom decided we should give her a second chance. BIG MISTAKE!!! Colleen is by far the worse server we have ever had. She wouldn't look at us she kept telling us to wait before we could have her take our order (20 minutes we waited to place an order) . When she did bring our order she slammed the plate down, while looking in the other direction. We tried to make small talk and she would walk away. She obviously doesn't enjoy her job and made it more than clear we were not a priority to her. When we finished our meal we were discussing if we would get dessert when she shoved the bill holder in my arm and stated, ""you weren't getting dessert were you?"" as she walked away without waiting for our response. We should have never left her a tip but we left her less than 10%. Sad for her we tip between 20-25%. Honestly, if I walk in and she is the only waitress I will leave immediately. She is so bad for your business and you should really think about giving her less hours to be near customers or maybe she should work in the back where she has no contact with people!

She won't stop us from coming in because we love it there but we will make sure we NEVER come in when she's the server."
1,"Worst. Place. Ever. It is my personal mission is to make sure nobody moves in here. 

First of all management is awful!!! I'm getting angry writing this review they are so awful! When you sign your lease they are so nice and sweet but once you sign the papers be prepared for attitude they are so rude. 

When I wanted to move in I had to wait 40 minutes to sign the papers because the lady up front was to busy at the moment. I told them I had a time limit because I had to go to work and she didn't care.

When they changed the locks both our keys didn't work so we went to the office and they were on lunch like they always are. We knocked on the door and after 5 minutes of pounding they came out and pointed at the lunch sign. Yes I can read I can see the sign. After they saw we weren't leaving they finally came over and we told them we were locked out with groceries and finally after 15 minutes they got maintenance over.

Also our apartments: microwave, fridge, garbage disposal, and dishwasher have all been broken at one point. 

Our garbage disposal and dishwasher broke at the same time and it broke on Wednesday so we called the office immediately. They said they would come on Thursday so we called Thursday and said they would come. They never did so I called Friday and the worker said: I promise you they will come today. Guess what they didn't come and maintenance is only Monday through Friday. So I called and talked to them on Saturday and they said maintenance couldn't come because it wasn't an emergency. Thanks rebel place I had no dishes and my house stunk for a good couple days. THANKS. 

Also, Mandy is the worst employee I have ever Met. She has no consideration for others. I would love to put her in my smelly apartment for a day because she doesn't care that are garbage disposal is broken. I have never wished someone would lose their job before but she is seriously an awful person. She knocked on our door and was just going to walk in. She told me I didn't pay my rent 22 days after it was due. Do you really think I'm that stupid I wouldn't pay my rent for 22 days? She talked me to me like I was stupid and worthless and didn't believe me when I said I had already paid it.  Well guess what they credited the wrong apartment. Thanks Mandy you're an awesome supervisor and I hope you get fired. Eric you need to fire her she is awful.

I hope nobody ever considers moving in here and Eric don't comment on post I don't want to hear it you have awful employees and nothing you say will change my mind I only put a portion of my issues on this place on this review. Seriously awful just fire them all and get new employees that's the only way you can save this place."
1,"Rude to people with disabilities and unhelpful. They make you feel beneath them.  Will never go again or recommend.
Negative stars."
1,"We went to this place last night and we had a horrible experience. First we tried to access the other dance  floor and we were told that it was at  full capacity , but we noticed how the bouncer was letting in only people that he knew. Therefore I went up to him and his statement was !!! !!! Nothing !!!!!!! He did not know what to say when we asked. Second the bartender did not know how to make a whiskey sour and he was over changing us! We went to a different bartender at the end of the night and he charged us less! Very bad service!"
1,Not any value for your money...run away from the place if you think its vegetarian friendly!! The vegetarian items are so over priced with meagre quantities...i spent almost 14$ on entrees which had spartan snacky amounts...would not come back here ...sorryy !!
1,"Went to this place on their opening week. It was very poorly run. We sat at the bar and watched our food sit there for literally 15 minutes after it was made... Our waitress was just chatting with another waiter the whole time beside the kitchen. The food was cold by the time it got to us and we were sitting 2 feet away from the kitchen. Needless to say, the service could definitely be improved. 

On the plus side, the decor here is great! Unfortunately, food is definitely a pre-requisite when I spend this much on a restaurant."
1,"I come here a lot because its close to home and they have a few good wing flavors, but everytime there is a problem, shorted us a bucket of wings, gave us the rest of the order wrong, they don't make orders you call in and  pick up, apparently they forget they took them, I will continue to go here and never leave a penny for a tip"
1,"I hate this place. It is way too noisy, management is horrible, and it is just like dorm living. The facilities are nice, but that's about the only pro."
1,"I LOVE Lolo's; however the food at this airport location was not representative of the Lolo's brand - not by a long shot. The fish I had was bland, the greens tasted like something out of a can (with no after-market ""help"") and the potato salad was just disgusting. Not happy with my $20 investment."
1,"We just ordered take out and showed up after thirty minutes. The order they gave us was for someone else, lucky we checked ! After waiting another thirty minutes they found our order, now was it going to be cold? We got home and started eating. The potstickers were good, the fried rice was just ok but that might be because with the delay in our order you could say it was like eating leftovers. However the taste of generals chicken left nothing but the sting of salt.  It was so salty that we ate only a bite or two hoping it got better; even with a swig of wine it was too strong.  I wouldn't recommend this place."
1,"DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! These are by far the most disgusting and uninhabitable apartments I have ever experienced! 

Within a month of moving in, someone tried to break into my apartment. Luckily I wasn't home, but I found out later that management declined to file a report with the police. Their ""security"" is one guy standing around on his phone; and that's IF there is even a security guard around. I understand that the apartments are not in a good area, but maybe try to balance that by offering security that does more than check their phones. 

There is no screening process with the tenants they allow to move in, nor is there any requirement to move in, i.e. You don't even need to be a student. One of the existing roommates in the apartment was so filthy that MAGGOTS showed up in the kitchen. When management was called, they sent a repairman who laughed and asked ""What do you want me to do about it?"". 

The grounds are constantly covered in garbage, dog feces, and urine. I've seen other reviews were management says they have signs up that ask tenants to clean up, but offer no grounds maintenance. 

For $550, you get a microscopic ""furnished"" bedroom. Their idea of a bed is a blue, vinyl covered mattress that is little better than a cot. Before I moved in, I was told that I would be moving into an apartment with girls that had been living there for years with no issues. LIES! 

Rebel Place is after your money and don't care what happens to you after you move in. It took two of us to get the nasty roommate out of the apartment (who had been living there for a year... no problem? Right...). There is no buyout option on the lease and they don't show you the actual apartment you'll be moving into. They lure you in with their ""amenities"" but the fact of the matter is that amenities don't compensate for the disgusting, repulsive nature of these apartments. It has been EXTREMELY stressful dealing with the chaos and that's not something anyone needs to deal with while trying to go to school. STAY AWAY!!"
1,"THis place has really lost so much fuel for me. I used to pump it up to those I knew who put it down. not anymore. If you cant beat them join them. j/k. 
Seriously the last time I came in here I met up with my bf who went right after work. I was ignored ... not for 10, not 15, hell not even 20 but for 30 freakin minutes. My guess was b/c I dont have a pair ... well the pair the waitresses are looking for to get big ""tips"" from. 
The sadest part, the manager looked me in the eye, 2x. and never even asked what I'd like to order. you can find the manager but finding the oldest lady there who happens to be the most clothed (she's the one not wearing the vest and shiny beaded belt but rather a buttoned down khaki shirt and slacks. 
I told my bf who loves this place, to count me out - he now sees it the light and started going bk to Rum Runner and Apache Joe's. 

The service at apache joe's is far more courteous.. not always consistently the same people but at least the girl bartenders notice you are there!!!"
1,"This dealership is the worst I've ever been to. They will strong arm you and WILL NOT NEGOTIATE for used vehicles! Even with cash you are ready to hand over. Cash and financed prices are the same. All prices and fees are set and they will say that they have no power to negotiate and that they are making no money off this deal...what a bunch of lies. They pulled us in by appropriately pricing a used car for $6k, but with all their added fees it was an extra $2k! I'm not paying 33% more for fees-the bulk of which are their dealership fees that are non-negotiable. If these are set, non-negotiable fees that are this substantial, then why wasn't that included in the original posted price? I do not appreciate false advertising."
1,"SELLS LEMONS- SCAM ARTIST- DO NOT BUY HERE!!!! This place is TERRIBLE. I feel compelled to blast their b.s. so no others get taken advantage of. Mike of Mazda sold us a vehicle they claimed was bumper to bumper certified and safe, with in 3 months had to drop $1600 to keep the car running, through all troubles called back to Mazda, asked for help, assistance, then just simply to reach management  & got the run around every time. Gave up as we need our ""new $24k Jeep"" fixed and went to the very same Jeep shop they get their ""bumper to bumper"" certified and the garage told us Mazda KNEW the issues we had just paid to fix out of pocket, it was in the garages report back to Mazda, and MAZDA CHOSE AGAINST THE MAINTENANCE AND SOLD IT ANYWAY!!!!! We come from a small town in WI, these people took advantage of trusting people to make a quick sale, unless you are a car person who can pop the hood themselves and know things, stay away."
1,"This place is sooooo SH*TTY!!!!! My sister went to Morals Village tonight with her frds, a total of 5 ppl and she waited 1 hr for a table, but that wasn't the issue. The real issue was the host named SILVER wouldnt give them a table when they were next on the waitlist. Instead she gave it to the 2 groups of 3 ppl that was on the end of the waitlist. When my sister asked why they couldn't get the table she said because the table offers 6 pots so she couldn't just leave that one pot space to waste. She was sooo rude and had such bad customer service!!! Never go to this restaurant!!!! Don't waste your time!!! AND at the end my sister left...poor sis."
1,Horrible service. Quality of food has drastically reduced over the years.
1,"Hi parents!! If you're considering letting your children move here for college, please give me the opportunity to dissuade you from all of you making a terrible error. 

Below is a photo of the new ""parking policy"" - breaking it down, it means they cannot have a visitor over after 6. Yes, 6pm for a college student. They have ""visitor parking"" in the front, however with 480 apartments, you can surmise its well over 1000+ residents - you would think with that amount they would have adequate visitor parking? Nope - they have 12, yes that's right TWELVE visitor spots. 

My personal tale; I let my daughter borrow my car to transport some things to her apartment, she got there at 7:30pm so the office was closed and of course with 12 parkings spots there were none in front, so she figured she'd just park in back for the evening as she was returning it the next day- WRONG!! It was towed at 1:30am. She wakes up for class the next day and panicked thinking it was stolen!!?? Nope, it was towed - $260 cash in the shady ghetto to get the car back. 

I called thinking this must've been a mistake - NOPE!! ""Too bad this is private property, we can do what we like"" which is a lie, but I'm taking that up separately. It was ILLEGAL, and most definitely a horrible business practices 

So friends, DO NOT rent from this shady, scam of a company - please, for your sanity and your wallet, go somewhere else!"
1,"Okay so my last review of this place was based solely on the service which sucked that night but the food was always ok.  Some of our go to dishes were the salt and pepper wings and general to chicken.
They've either changed management or ownership and the new cooks are horrible.  The general to chicken is now covered in an overly greasy sauce and instead of the customary broccoli there were huge hunks of undercooked red onion and pineapple.  Why?
The salt and pepper wings have become half the size they once we're and no longer come smothered in chile's and green onion.  Very disappointed.  I made comment about the change in the dishes and was asked which I liked better.  I immediately told them the old dishes were much better.  Such a shame as we were pretty much regulars here for take out.  Time to find a new spot."
1,"I eat at the LoLo's on Central at least once a month. The chicken there is outstanding!  The airport location, one star.  Service is very slow, the breading on the chicken is tasteless, the  chicken is way overcooked and dry.  I think they pre cook the chicken.
Price is over the top too.  Why can't the airport vendors keep good standards and reasonable prices???"
1,"If i could, I would rate it 0 star! Because YOU DONT EVEN DESERVE ONE! 

My friends and I, were there to get a seat for a table of 5 at approximately 7:35pm. We got a waitlist #22 . We knew it was busy there so we didnt complain on the ONE HOUR wait. Exactly 1 hour later, we checked the waitlist and we were suppose to be the first one waiting on the waitlist. That means, the next table should be ours! BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO they have decided to give the table to waitlist #24 and #28 ! Because there is 6 hotpot burners on that table and they said that we only have 5 ppl so they are giving it to two groups of 3 ppl! Wtf is that man! WE HAVE WAITED ONE HOUR and no table for us and instead gave it to ppl at the back of the waitlist! REtarded HOST named SILVER cause she does not know how to be a host! They should FIRE her! Name is Silver ! I own a restaurant and this should not happen!!! 

In the end, we complained to her and she still didnt giv us the table so we were very angry and hungry and left the stupid hotpot place. NEVER going to be back again, and if by anychance i did... Thats because IM COMPLAINING TO THE MANAGER!"
1,"The food was decent enough, but the prices were high for small portions and the service left a lot to be desired. The host didn't even acknowledge us for a solid ten minutes, even though she saw us while she was watering tables for servers and doing various other things. The restaurant was not busy on a Monday night, about a dozen tables were seated when my party of three arrived. The host sat us and said she would come back with water, which took 7 minutes. The server finally arrived and my friend ordered a diet coke, which literally took 10 minutes to arrive, then the server dropped off the soda and disappeared again without taking our order.  We were seated 20 minutes before being able to order. Again, the place was not busy. We ordered an appetizer, which arrived after the main meal. The food itself was excellent. Delicious cornbread. But I definitely won't be going there again, nor will I recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to pay a lot of money for pretentious food and terrible service."
1,"Ordered prime rib, a baked potato mushrooms and a side of rice. The prime rib was so tough I could not cut through it. I stuck my fork in it and I couldn't get my fork out. I never received my mushrooms. The food was delivered and no one ever came back to check and see if everything was ok. The worst dining experience I've had in a very long time."
1,"I wish 0 zero stars were a possibility! This place is a shit hole. Management is the worst! I have lived here for over a year and a half. I hate this place with every fiber of my being. I regret 

I moved here from CA to goto UNLV, I did not have any family or friends to show me the ropes. So I moved here mainly for residency purposes and the shuttle, which are about the only good things about this place. 

The tanning pool had a syringe in it last summer. Maintenance has told me that people have shit in the elevators and their the ones that have to clean it. While my family was staying me, my little sister actually saw (human) shit on the 2nd floor. (Before pets were allowed.) Usually the parking lot is filled with trash, hallways are filled with vomit and/or blood.  Oh and top of all that luxury, they have nerve to nickel and dime you to death. Not to mention the walls are so thin you can hear other people poop and pee. 

It's employees call it ""ratchett place"" for a reason.  Their gate is bullshit, people sneak in ALL THE TIME. Outside the gate are hookers, pimps and crackheads. This is the GHETTO. 

So if you want to opt into a disgusting, grungy dump with the shittiest management. This is the place for you!

Signed, 
A current resident that cannot wait to get the fuck out."
1,"This place deserves an overall 0-star rating. SERIOUSLY I CAN'T DEAL WITH THEM ANYMORE. I'm not even a resident here and I am still having issues with them. They undergone new management a few weeks ago, and I was calling for a copy of my lease so that I could apply for residency at UNLV. They told me to call Pinnacle (former management when I was living there) because they did not have those files with them and are with Pinnacle's Management group. When I called Pinnacle they told be that they didn't have it because the files are to remain on Rebel Place property by law for at least 7 years. WHO'S LYING? I can't tell but I wasted a lot of time calling back and forth telling them what the other said and I asked if they can contact each other to sort it out but they refuse to help me at all. This business is BY FAR THE WORST I have ever needed to deal with. Do not put your money into/get yourself into their unorganized, dishonest, and horrible company. Save yourself the trouble."
1,the worse food I have had in a long time.  HOW do people like that stay in business.  I was s bad I took it back and left it sitting at the front door.  So much for giving it a second chance.
1,Got here 3 hours before they closed to use some gift cards I got and they were out of bread.  Awesome
1,"I use yelp all the time to find restaurants but have never posted before. My experience at dumpling restaurant was so bad that I finally signed up to share what happened. 

First off, entering the restaurant, the manager is at the counter on the phone, and doesn't even look up to acknowledge the guests as they enter. 

Our server was typical for this type of establishment, so no issue there. 

We ordered 5 items for our family, 2 of which were actually decent. But 1 item was so off putting that the rest didn't really matter, and here's why. We ordered the pork and pickled Cabbage dumpling and was appalled after just 1 bite. It was foul. It left a garbage taste lingering in our mouths that we couldn't get rid of (imagine the smell of stinky tofu, but in your mouth). We waved down the waitress to let her know and she said that's how pickled Cabbage tastes like and walked away... Really? The many other dumpling houses in scarborough/Markham certainly don't taste like garbage or over fermentation. 

I'd like to extend an offer to this waitress and the owner to try the 2 other dumpling houses just beside them and tell me that, that's how pickled Cabbage is supposed to taste like. 

IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO TASTE OR SMELL LIKE GARBAGE! 

After taking that 1 bite, we just lost our appetites and asked for the bill. When the waitress came to our table to collect our money, she didn't even bother saying anything to us about the 13.5 out of 14 pcs of dumplings left untouched at our table. 

There are literally 5 dumpling houses within 5 minutes of this property. Do yourself a favour and venture into one of those."
1,worst service ever. waitress doesn't accept new customers at all when they're busy even there's free table!! Only because they think they're too busy.
1,"Not exaggerating...this was the worst Chinese food I've had. Anywhere. Ever. 

A coworker recommended China Tango a few weeks ago and said it was her favorite Chinese place so I decided to give it a try. I walked in and ordered 1) Hot and Spicy Shrimp, and 2) Beef and Broccoli. The hostess was really nice, polite, and said my food would be ready in 20 minutes. 

20 minutes later, I was back. My food was ready to go so I paid (thinking it was a little on the pricey side for a non-fancy Chinese place, but figured the food would be worth it based on the recommendation) and was off on my way home. Problem number one, the way they packed the food: two containers of rice on the bottom, hot and spicy shrimp (in a styrofoam container) in the middle, and the beef (in plastic Tupperware container) on top. I made a right turn and the dishes on top toppled over and the shrimp sauce spilled right out (into the plastic bag but still...a mess. And now my car smelled like ketchup. More on that later.). Maybe I should have reorganized the food in the bag Tetris-style but I'm not a huge takeout person so the thought never occurred to me. But it should occur to the people at China Tango, no??? Well, it didn't.

Then the food. So bad. So bad. So bad. 

Beef and broccoli: the beef was rubbery and fatty. Seriously yucky. The sauce was completely bland. The broccoli and carrots were fresh and crunchy but I didn't pay $15 for broccoli and carrots! 

Hot and Spicy Shrimp: shrimp was breaded then tossed with onions and like a whole bottle of ketchup.  Maybe two. Even my daughter asked, ""why does the house smell like ketchup?"" when I opened up the container.  This was quite possibly the worst dish I've ever had. Setting aside the ketchup for a second, why would you bread shrimp only to mix it in a thick sauce? It ends up being soggy. Seriously, all around gross. 

Unless you've got a thing for ketchup, I'd suggest staying far away from China Tango."
1,"Used to love this place but we had a pretty awful experience that made us stop going, a couple months back.

So they usually close at 11:00 PM but when we got there at around 10:15 PM. There was around 8 of us, and they still had a couple people inside the restaurant. They were already closing up, as in they were cleaning up and seemed reluctant to let us in, but they let us in anyways, they rushed us in ordering which some of us had no problem with because we knew our order but some of us didn't and proceeded to get mad we didn't order within 2 minutes. As we got our order, they were rushing us and cleaning around us and got mad whenever we asked for more utensils, or for more water. It generally felt like they wanted us out by 10:45 PM instead of at 11:00 PM when they actually close. We didn't appreciate the service so me and my boyfriend paid and didn't leave any tip, but the lady who cashed us out looked at the receipt and proceeded to say, ""Wow, no tip?"". Tip what though the shitty service? Lol no thanks, we haven't been back and found better places than this. The food is good, the service is shit, and it was great when they were cheap but they're just like any other pho place but with shit service. I recommend Viet House, they are absolutely the sweetest servers, and we never got a complaint about our tips there."
1,"Well I love capriottis but this was not the best experience I've had by far. First off i do like the caps on Sahara and my hubby asked if it was the same owner ...the girl told us no and we explained how we go there cuz its close to work ...her response? ""im sorry"" and then went on to bash the owner of the other place...i understand competition but that was just not professional. I was actually going to give this place a better rating but then i found myself getting stabbed in the gums by a turkey bone from my Bobbie...i have a picture but unfortunately i don't know how to post it :( im by no means bashing this place but hope the staff will learn to have some class."
1,"The food is good, but the service here is awful. The servers are rude. Even when asking for water or an extra bowl, they give you a dirty look. They do not let you share at this location and make sure you order enough for the amount of people there. Me and my sister were hungry so my dad brought us here but he had already eaten. They were very rude and said that not enough for three people. My dad said he had already ate. They glared at us until we were done. Never coming back here"
1,"DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!!!! Dubious practices. They will trick you into signing a lease. They take advantage of people from out of town. BBB didn't even rate it!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!

1,"I will never come back to this place.  First off the service was horrible.  We had to ask for our order three times before our order actually came out.  Then our server complained their tip wasn't enough even though he didn't really serve us. 

This place definitely has no morals in my opinion."
1,Great delicious food. Consistently horrible counter service. Needs more training and additional counter help.
1,These people are terrible. Not only did they not pay off my trade in fully and are now saying it is my responsibility. They are blowing me off when I'm trying to find out who my lender is and get the cleaning and buffing of the car that was promised to me done. The manager of the finance area has a horrible uncaring attitude when it comes to things that are their fault. There are not enough words to explain how bad these people are. DO NOT buy from them. Not to mention if you get an option of Santander Consumer as a lender run the other way. Worst customer support ever and most of them don't even speak English that you can understand.
1,"BEWARE DIRTY AND DISGUSTING RESTAURANT WITH LAZY EMPLOYEES WHO CHARGE A SERVICE FEE FOR TEA AND WATER!!!!


I used to live in this area when I was younger and this restaurant was my family's go to place whenever we wanted pho. Service back then was great. Now that I'm older, I decided to eat at this restaurant since I was in the area and I remembered this place as a really delicious Vietnamese restaurant. 

The workers are DISGUSTING. I was seated at the table where I can see all the employees behind the cash (where they make smoothies). The lady was making an avocado smoothie and she was peeling the avocado with her bare hands. NO GLOVES! Did I mention that she didn't even wash her hands first? I was so disgusted by what I saw. 

Service is TERRIBLE. All the employees just chit chat in their language behind the counters. When I asked for some water, the lady had to ask someone else to do it, which I didn't understand since after passing the task, she just continued to chit chat with her coworkers. 

When it came time to pay the bill, I was told a price higher than I expected. I ordered food worth $12.50 and was being charged $15.25 after tax.  $12.50 plus tax is $14.13. When I asked why am I being charged more, I was told that there is a SERVICE CHARGE OF $1 FOR THE SERVICE, TEA AND WATER. I was shocked to hear such thing. Apparently service, water and tea are not free since she said NOTHING IS FREE. I didn't bother to leave a tip. And she questioned where's her tip. I told her I paid a ""service fee"", there's no need to tip."
1,"This property is poorly managed. Management has flat out lied about lease rates. Roommates who went to re-sign a lease were told a lower price never existed when we had e-mails offering the rate.

Management also thinks that they have free reign over your privacy. We literally just had a maintenance worker and part of the ""management staff"" walk into the apartment uninvited, walk half-way into the apartment 
not saying a word to us and talking to eachother, and then walk out.


It sucks that there is not a whole lot of options for students around the university."
1,"took a one-hour drive to Mesa to look at a very nice clean looking Ford Escape for my son. You can see the pictures they posted in the ad here.
Dustin the sales kid was great. But none of the photos on this car showed how a dog destroyed the back cargo area, and I was willing to give the dealer a chance but they weren't interested in working with me to pick it up in this condition. Mind you, I drove from Peoria and I would not have if I saw this ahead of time. (see photo)


The other cars we looked at were ok, but one was missing front light reflectors, another had BIG paint chips on the front dam and black (nail polish) on the door... The car is white. 


Anyway, I go to a dealer hoping those types of issues are pre screened... Otherwise there's not much benefit to going to a dealer and paying the markup. Hope you take this as constructive feedback. 

Thanks,

the above text is basically what I sent in response to a sales manager asking about my experience. Needless to say I never received a response nor will I ever set foot in that dealership again."
1,"Went with my family for a special day out and I was greatly disappointed. We ordered chicken lollipops for starters with the rest of our meal. Gave our entire meal order at the same time cause it was hard to get a server to our table. We realized it would be a while before a server would come again to take our meal order. Well, the starters came much after the meal. Very disappointing! The food was ok but the service - wasn't good at all. People around us were upset too for the same reason. They just wanted to pay and get out after the long wait for food. Thought we wouldn't go there again."
1,We went there tonight to eat dinner and my husbands meal came and we kept waiting on my food to come. I told him to go ahead and eat so his food wouldn't get cold. After 10 minutes I ask where my dinner was he said one minute and went to answer the phone. Meanwhile a whole family of 4 was served their meal while I continued to wait. My husband was finished eating by this time. So I ask for a to go box for his food. Then he brings out my food. I told him I didn't want it now we were leaving. He charged me for food I didn't get. He never apologized or anything! I will NEVER EVER GO BACK! I do not recommend this place at all. Bad service!!
1,"Bad service usually wouldn't make me hate a resto if their food is not stomach-curdling and I'm still decently satisfied after my meal.  I'd come back again in hopes of a more pleasant server next time.

Morals Village though... this is some next level service.  I mean, I've waited more than 45min for restaurants that don't take reservations.. back when Guu first opened, pretty sure it was a more than one hour wait.  At least in the end when we finally got to sit down at the tables, we received great service and even more superb food. 

Morals Village?  My party of 5 was already starving after waiting an hour when we were told the waiting time would only be 20min.  But what really killed this resto for me is the fact that the table sizing situation got priority over the # we were assigned (which was 22) - and #24 and 28 got to sit before us just because their party size was smaller and more flexible.  Fine, it was our fault for not making a reservation on a Friday night.  But did the waitress have to give that much attitude in telling us that the people that came after our party are getting tables before us?

I've heard good things about this resto as it's supposedly one of the better hotpot places in Toronto, but wow.  a) Not coming back here for the next year b) Not coming back here without a reservation ever"
1,"I have lived here for the past two years, and while this place may look ok it is probably the worst ""Student Living"" Apartments in the area. Such a bad first apartment experience, that I am not even going to justify them by calling them apartments.

There are a couple things thiscomplex does well like: having a shuttle, providing some utilities/amenities (even if those amenities are constantly closed), and having a ""gated area"" for parking. The ""gated area"" for parking, which is in quotes because the 24 months I have lived here it has been broken and stuck open for about eight of them, and even when it does close random people will often wait at the gate and sneak in behind a resident. 

But, things are just as broken inside the unit. It feels like something is breaking or bending everyday (like our sink that has been broken three times and once fixed with duct tape). And the management will take their time unless you tell them it is urgent, and even with an urgent tag they give maintenance a 24 hour window to fix it. There are constantly cockroaches roaming around and sneaking in the apartment (more cockroaches here on property than normal in Las Vegas).

The dumpster area is constantly being trashed by the current residents, so much so that management can't keep up the cleaning, and to make it worse every night it seems like there is someone rummaging through it (for either food and stuff, or important things like bills and credit card statements). This is one of the more sketchy neighborhoods in Las Vegas and their security is laughable with a few peoples cars getting damaged or broken into. There is broken glass and broken bottles scattered through the property as well. The hallways are just as bad with trash bags (or dog poop everywhere) littered everywhere, and the elevators will get so bad they become unrideable which means you will need to walk up all four flights of stairs. Just outside of the property are countless amounts of run down apartments. There have been multiple instances of gun shots, attacks, and even murders across the street (visible if you view a crime map), and to make matters worse they can't even keep it away from the residents. On June 27th and 28th there were multiple people who got flashed in the Rebel Place parking lot (behind the ""secured gate"" and ""constant security"").

As a current resident I feel as if the people in the office are only concerned with signing new people up to live here, or are busy talking to each other. But, the people in the office are really nice when they are not on the phone (with a potential new guest), or chatting with each other about their day or future activities. In addition to that the day before move out I tell them I want to be there for the walk through (because who wouldn't when my security deposit is in the hands of a company so incapable) and they said on July 30th that they will do a walk through the next morning (July 31st at 8 am). After waking up early and being there five minutes early I get told that I am not going to be getting a walk through today, and the supposed time for walk throughs had already ended (the manage said an email had been sent out to the residents but it must have been one of the blank ones they sent on accident instead of the real move out information)

I truly do not recommend this place for you, and especially not for your kids they will not be safe. There is a lot better for a lot less available. You will live here for just one year (because you can't end their lease early), dislike every minute of it, and decide to move anywhere else (just like 85% of the current residents now). This place is in bad management, a bad area, and is not getting any better any time soon.

If you read through their page the only ""good reviews"" are either management replying (which shouldn't be counted as a review they just wanted to increase their stars) or it's from people who haven't even moved in yet! If anyone has any questions about this honest review I would be more than glad to answer them here!"
1,I agree with what others have posted regarding this dealership.  I saw the add on Craigslist and went down to the dealership to look at the vehicle.  They apparently did not to an inspection because I got the car with a car wash and oil change.  Never did they inspect the pathfinder.  I have called the dealership to get the extended warranty information and no call back.  I have taken this car to an actual Nissan dealership and I have had all sorts of problems.  In the finance room I was talked into services/warranties that do nothing.  I was totally scammed in the finance room and paid way over what the car was actually worth.
1,"Worst living situation of my life. 
The staff could care less about your safety. 
Disgusting apartments, takes maintenance a week to respond, loud!

They're gonna show you a gorgeous untouched unit and give you a shit hole. Every email sent hasn't been resolved. My 12 months was horrible. Splurge an extra 150 and get your own place. Also this area is known for murders... Look on crime maps LVP
Really safe for students"
1,They have the worst service department! Would never get call backs on a part we needed for car. Stephanie in the service department has the worst attitude imaginable. Won't do business here again or refer others here. Will travel extra distance to deal with a better service department. Our Mazda has had so many issues with flimsy parts falling off. Brand new car not even 3 years in.
1,"I am a huge fan of the LoLo restaurants, both Phoenix and Scottsdale. I've been eating there for about 8 years. Although the service has slipped in recent times, this new location is an all time disappointment.

This was my first and second time visiting the airport location. I had been waiting to see it open for almost a year. But I don't think I've ever been so let down by a restaurant.

First time (10/12/14, 1:05pm) : I had a 20+ minute wait, when I was originally told it would take 7-10 minutes to be ready. They forgot several items, the sweet tea wasn't great, the ""gravy""... I'm not even sure what it is/was, and the chicken was just okay.

Second time (10/14/14 7:50pm): I had a much more reasonable 8 minute wait, but I was told it would only take about 3 when I placed my order. The sweet tea was good this time, the chicken was better this time but certainly not great, the gravy I won't be trying again (pretty sure it's from a can) and the waffle was bland and hard (either it had been sitting around or was over cooked)

My recommendation is to skip this place and go downtown. If this is a franchise then the charter needs to be revoked. If this is owned by Larry then I'm shocked."
1,"My first time visiting to this location. I try to pick our own table but instead they brought us in the corner were they use the table as their refill station. The table smells and it was not a good place for us to have a nice dinner. The food is fair but I may say! If they are going to serve good food they might as well start with good brand for their rice. Asian love rice and I say their rice is like the cheapest one on the market. We didn't eat the rice because of the pleasant smell. We go to pho restaurant and they give what customer ask, but this location is not stoping me for giving them a bad feed back. I think we won't be coming back to this location. The bar/cash counter need some work looks disgusting u won't imagine u get your drinks there. ( Thumbs down! )"
1,"I could not agree more with all of the negative reviews. Once you sign a lease, they keep at you morning, noon & night to extend you lease which will go way beyond the regular school semester. The rents are sky high when you look at the market rate. When you leave Rebel, they will nickle and dime you for months and even charge for cleaning & painting when that is normal wear & tear. 

Run as fast as you can from Rebel (Rip-off) Place!"
1,"I'm really quite surprised at how highly this place is rated. I've been here 4 times now because my family enjoys how cheap it is but I hate it. 

This place is filthy. The floors are sticky and the tables are covered in a layer of grime. Eating here is like playing an hour long game of 'every surface of this restaurant is hot lava'. The photo of the restaurant here on yelp is dated.. Don't let yourself be catfished.

The service is also abysmal. There are usually two waitresses for the entire restaurant and they are quite rude. Tables remain littered with used plates for over 20 minutes after guests have left. I've seen many customers get up to grab themselves utensils and napkins after being ignored by the waitresses over and over again.

If you care at all about the cleanliness and service of a restaurant, I would avoid this place like the plague. You're better off with a rest stop McDonald's on the civic long weekend..."
1,"This place has the worse service ever!!! Server called silver was sooooo rude. Honestly I know it's Friday night and it's busy so we didn't complain about the 1 hour wait time, however when we waited for one hour and you did not give us seat but to other people who came after us simply because we have 5 people and the table you have open is for 6 which you guys didn't want to waste the extra space, therefore gave it away to the people who came after us 3x and 3x. How ridiculous is that! We were starving and waited one hour and this is the service we get! So rude'! Never going back!!!!!"
1,Terrible food. I ordered the volcano shrimp which advertises that they serve it flaming. No flaming & tasted like shrimp with onion relish over it. I asked them why this is & they laughed & made some excuse but never offered to replace the dish. The ambiance is a 5 but don't be fooled. The food is what matters.
1,"If I could give it a negative, I would. This place was an absolute mistake; got there around 7:15 and didn't leave till 8:45. This is not because the food was soooo amazing that I had to stay, but rather that my kids had to wait 45 minutes for the wonton with instant noodles. Yes folks, that's right, I said ""Instant."" Not so instant in my opinion. We've all made instant noodles at some point in our lives; never has it taken me even more than 20 minutes and that's usually because I'm adding beef balls, eggs, or spam. Maybe they had to run out to the supermarket to buy it. In any case, I ordered a Portuguese Beef Brisket Rice, which came in 20 minutes. The plate was enormous but the amount of food didn't quite exactly fit the size of the plate as my kids managed to scarf down most of it before their noodles arrived. My dish was below average as the brisket was very tough and the sauce tasted like it came out of a Lee Kum Kee bottle, but my kids were super hungry, so they ate it anyways. Had to ask for water three times as my kids can't drink tea, but after three failed attempts, I didn't bother. I also noticed several individuals leave before they finished my meal which was an indication that the food was not very good. I also noticed that the table in front of us was informed that they ran out of whatever she ordered, but this was 25 minutes after she ordered. Needless to say, she got up and left. When I was about to leave, I asked to pay with Interac but they said it wasn't set up. They should really take off that Interac sign on the front door if they don't offer that form of payment. So, I had to run out to the bank and get cash; pretty much adding salt to the wound. I guess you pretty much see that this will be my first and last visit. One of my worst dining experiences EVER. If you're smart, stay FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!"
1,Pissed.... Waited for 1.5 hours and Server didn't arrange seats for us. We have 5 ppl. She split the big table to serve 2 small group instead. The server name Silver has very bad attitude and has no manner. Will never go if she is working there.  Server rating 0/5......
1,"I recently moved into a neighborhood near Imperial Garden.  A few people recommended that I give it a try because the food was really good.  I had also seen the parking lot packed full of cars on a regular basis, and noted it has won a Best of Madison award for the last 30 years.

I finally tried it out, about 2 weeks after I moved in.  I had a friend in from out of town, so we decided to check it out.  I could not have been more disappointed.

We started with shrimp rangoon, which was okay, but were not stuffed very full.  We each had an entree, I can't even remember which ones because they were so unremarkable.  My friend ordered a chicken dish that was marked as ""very spicy"" and it was even more bland than my dish which involved mostly green beans.  The shrimp fried rice we shared was pretty good, maybe the saving grace of the meal.

I have no idea how this restaurant wins Best of anything awards on a regular basis.  I was very excited to have what I thought would be a great Chinese food option so close to home... but I've had better meals from a small local delivery/takeout place also nearby."
1,"First bit of advice: If considering Rebel Place - Reconsider and GO SOMEWHERE (ANYWHERE) ELSE!!! 

Neghborhood: 
Rebel Place leads you to believe it is in a good neighborhood.... LIE. Go ten steps up the road from Rebel Place and that puts you smack dab in the middle of an obviously ""rough"" neighborhood. Don't believe me? You don't have to, you can go see for yourself.

Management: 
Like many have already said, the management here is awful. They will lie until they are blue in the face if it gets you to sign the lease then say ""tough cookies"" once your stuck. 
They give you a $25 electricity cap and yet somehow, one person not using the A/C and cooking once a week with no tv can magically go over that cap by $80 - their explanation: ""electricity is expensive"". 
I know it seems hard to believe that any type of management staff could be so utterly inept but TRUST ME, Rebel Place management is as inept, hopeless, and utterly brainless as it gets. I wouldn't wish these people on my worst enemy and as such, I am pleading with those considering this place, for your own good and peace of mind, DO NOT BOTHER STAY AWAY!!! Some of you may choose to ignore my warning, if you do I am so sorry I could not prevent you from making what will undoubtedly be one of the worse mistakes of your life."
1,"My feelings towards this restaurant has gone down. I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap and although the actual chicken dish was decent the lettuce they gave us was absolutely disgusting. The lettuce was served to me in a plate full of water and it tasted gross and bitter. My friend ordered the governors chicken and she was also disappointed. It's like they scattered the food on the place to make it ""look"" like a full dish. $14 for a chicken dish full of liquid? I think not. This place makes me miss the old east side location."
1,"Second bite I had a food had Fat in it.
Waitress can't remember what we ordered. Never asked us our food was.
We had to walk to the front desk to pay her bill. I wanted to run out of that place"
1,"this place is a glorified dorm. Over expensive, unhelpful and the management just wants to snatch up your student loans. They don't use the roommate matching or whatever they want to call it, they are just trying to fill the rooms up. I wish I would have listened to the reviews before I agreed to move in here. It was a constant uphill battle.

everyone complains about the same thing on here (RED FLAG!)....but something that nobody has really said is that the location is right on the flight path of incoming planes. So if you wanted to leave your window open during the day, you cant because it is incredibly loud. And at night? forget it....When the planes come over the building their wheels are already deployed... THATS how close you are. Its awful, DO NOT MOVE HERE!"
1,"We went to this restaurant last Friday.  We ordered one medium size beef pho, and one large size beef tendon pho, and one vermicelli. The medium pho came first, but we waited a long time for the tendon pho and vermicelli ( a very very long wait,  two tables that came after us got their food served before us. )  When we checked with the waitress, it seemed that the chef might have forgotten our orders.
The food was okay, as many other Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto.  However, when the bill came ( and only a total number including tax on the bill, no breakdown for each item ), we felt the number was not right. So we grabbed the menu from a neighbouring table and used the calculator to check the number and it turned out they overcharged about $2.  It's not a big money, but I still went to the cashier and asked. The lady there said that the medium beef pho ($7) was actually a large size ($8).  I argued that we ordered medium size, not large size. She said that when the chef cooked the beef pho, he put all the food left in the pot into our bowl, so medium became large, and because we ate it, we must pay for the large bowl. I was astonished by her argument. So the restaurant served the wrong bowl size and force the customer to pay for it?!  I said that I didn't know it was a large size, and I never wanted a large size, because I could not even finish a medium size..  But the lady just insisted that because that was a large bowl you must pay for a large bowl. :-(
And guess what, even with the large beef pho in the bill, they still overcharged about 50 cents or something.  

I am very unhappy with the experience in Pho Mi Asia and I will never go back there.


PS: I deeply doubt that they might not wash the basil leaves at all, because I found a piece of dirt  on the leaf."
1,AWFUL experience. My mom and I went to several dealerships one day and Cardinaleway Mazda was the WORST. The guys were pushy... seriously 3 guys coming at us at once. Then they showed me every car on the lot besides a Mazda. They wanted to talk about financing before I even test drove a car! I told them I wasn't interested in financing and that's all they talked about. They showed me a Lincoln and Mercury like I am some 70 year old grandma. Ended up buying a car that day at a waaaay better dealership with nice people down the street. I highly recommend you stay way from this place.
1,"You don't come here for the food.  It is a beautiful restaurant with a pretty good vibe. Everything tastes the same. Spicy and dry. Ordered the empanadas. Very expensive. Very dry.  Service felt very corporate, I wouldn't have thought that would be the case. I felt like I was at a keg or cactus club. Also their space Pablo, should not be called that. Very insensitive to the latin community."
1,"Avoid this place if you have choices.

Take out took forever.  If you are not a regular and come in and order for take-out, everyone who is a regular and who order after you will get their orders before you (to take-out).

I spent $13.00 today on garbage.  Steamed shrimps had more bacon in it than shrimp.  It was disgusting and I waited for over 30 minutes.  So-called lemon-grass and garlic.  Also, wait staff treat their customers like children, ordering them around.  I have never seen people treated with such disrespect in a restaurant - and no one said a word.  Horrid place.  I am appreciating my regular Vietnamese restaurant (Forget Me Not) more than ever.  It just goes to show:  stick with tried and true."
1,"Horrible HORRIBLE horrible. If I could write 10,000 ZERO star reviews on this dealership I would.

Why did I go here, despite the two bad reviews? Because they were the only dealership in the valley that had the cars I wanted--or so I thought. 

I had been in correspondence with a salesman, Daniel Maria, for about two weeks. We set up an appointment for tonight to look at the two cars we were interested in. I'd been watching the website and talking to Daniel every day for the past two weeks, and the cars were listed.

When I arrived tonight at 7pm for my meeting with Daniel, for which he said he would have the cars waiting out front, he couldn't be found. Another employee tried to find him but couldn't. We finally stumbled upon him and his greeting? ""Oh, so sorry. The car you were looking for sold yesterday.""

Yesterday? YESTERDAY?! I spoke to him yesterday evening. According to him, yesterday the cars still were on the lot.

The other car? Oh, it didn't exist. They couldn't find it. Wasn't on the lot.

Their excuse? ""Daniel is an internet sales guy. They only go off of the webpage."" Why would you have somebody working for you that doesn't keep up with your inventory? And why don't you keep the website current with the inventory?

And then they tried to sell me a sedan. I want a hatchback. I know why I want a hatchback. I've looked heavily and know what I want. And then they try to sell me a car that was of a different (and discontinued) make.

STAY AWAY."
1,"Poor guy Service 

Tonight was the first time that I visited Morals Village. I was so disappointed with the service. The waiters were unhelpful. No one comes to your to take an order, even we waved at them, unless we asked them to come . I guess we may waited for more than 15mins to make an order.Most of the time the waiters just chatting with each other but not serving the customers. By the way , they never made a correct order as well. We have to order twice to get all the food we need.

What make things worse was the attitude of the staff. My friend and I could not speak really well Chinese but sadly we understand Chinese. When the waiter realised we could only use broken Chinese to make an order , they started to make fun of you in Chinese.It is a pity that we understand Chinese quite well, so we totally know what's going on.The waiters were so rude ,even my friend who can't speak Chinese can feel that.I understand it is quite fun when you see someone could not speak your language well as they may make lots of joke. However, it just silly to tease your customers in front of them.

We came here for the enjoyment of food but we left with terrible dinning experience . I'm so sorry for those unprofessional staffs as they make the customer to stay away from this restaurant."
1,"I literally thought this was one of the most conflicted restaurants I've ever been to.

First off, the restaurant itself was diiiirty.  I'm okay with dirty tables, dirty floors, and dirty walls.  I cannot cannot cannot find hair in my food or I lose my shit.

There was a looong piece of hair in my boyfriend's soup and as I look into the kitchen.. nobody there was wearing any sort of protection against falling hair.

The pho here is average but not fantastic and the rice (chicken, pork chop, and egg) my boyfriend ordered was decent but his rice was sogging into congee.

The waitresses are all about efficiency and it comes off as a bad attitude.
I'm trying to pack up my pho (to go) she's reaching OVER me and knocking into my hand as I'm trying to pour the soup into the container.  Nope. There was nobody at the door and more than half the tables were empty - you can wait until I'm done pouring.  

This makes me sad because I enjoy the Pho Mi Asia in Burlington.

PS. Try Forget Me Not down the street, the only reason I was here was because they're closed on Mondays."
1,"The worst service I ever had, we reached there at 10 and they were suppose to close at 11, I ordered sirloin med rare and my gf ordered fillet med well, I got mine rare and her's med rare. My server took forever to clean up my table and handed me my check when my gf wanted to order the desert, server never bothered to ask us if we wanted dessert. When I called her back and ordered dessert she brought that in to go container saying that I asked her to bring in to go container. I felt so unwelcomed, y would I order dessert to go when we both were there and we live 30mins away, by the time we got back brownie was stone cold and ice-cream melted thanks for to go container. Save your money and time the one in Elyria is way much better."
1,"No!  Just no!

39 minute wait for some $16 beyond edible salty chicken and soggy, thin, undercooked waffle and cold, not cheesy at all Mac n cheese?!  

No!  Just no!"
1,"STAY AWAY!! STAY AWAY!! STAY AWAY!!! HORRIBLE, DIRTY, RUN DOWN just a few words to describe Rebel Place. If there was an option to give no stars this would be a starless location. The rent is overpriced for the run down apartment that you get. Personally had maintenance issues every other week, everything from the door breaking and locking me in for hours, to the door re-breaking and locking me out for hours. Maintenance is slow to respond if they even respond at all. The sink broke and leaked everywhere ruining my personal belongings. Everything is an extra fee or an extra charge. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The apartment staff are completely inept, they don't care about there tenants and hardly do anything to help them when an issue arises. When I moved in my room was dirty and uncleaned, when I asked if it would be cleaned before I moved in they told me it would be only if i cleaned it. The grounds are dirty and disgusting. They call it student housing, but in reality hardly any students live here and those who do are trying to get out of there leases. As an active member of the student body I advise everyone I can to pick anywhere else to live besides rebel place.  If you make one good decision about Rebel place it would be to stay far far away."
1,"I was just at this place. The customer service was good, but the food was horrible. I got chicken biryani and pepper chicken curry where chicken was really bad and rubbery. 
Over priced and poor wu"
1,"Atmosphere : nothing special, table was not well cleaned 

Food : 
1. Bun Bo hue: way too much fish sauce, not a lot of meet, veggies were in fresh 

2. Banh Cuon: flour roll was unfresh 

Overall: won't be back."
1,Staff is rude and the chicken wasn't that great ...they messed our order up and when we brought it to their attention they acted like we did something wrong. I asked to order desert which is clearly on their menu board....yet was told in a sarcastic tone that we don't have deserts here  anymore ..then take them off the board ??!!!!  Not worth the money !!
1,"Their games don't play. I understand as a vegas local that we are going to lose our money but this Place is a joke..... In every sense of the word. As somebody that lives here I would never stop in here for a bite to eat, there are places that are generous and appreciate local business. This is not one of them!"
1,"stoves are slow. Service is bad. Waiters don't even smile. They close at 11:30pm but they do last call at 10pm and start stacking the chairs on top of the tables. Way to rush the people who are already there eating. Won't be coming back here. Back to warden and steeles' ""Legend Pot"""
1,"I'm going to do everyone a favor a post the number for security here, because you will not find it anywhere else: 702-530-5634.  But to be perfectly honest, you're better off just calling the police. It took me two hours and seven phone calls to other tenants to find it, and nobody picked up anyway.  My roommate and I had to call this number countless times because of the noise, threats from other residents, and permanent smell of weed.  Our complaints were not taken seriously, which is incredibly sad considering we lived in the apartment where two former tenants were bludgeoned to death (of which we were not informed when we signed our lease and moved in).  Security doesn't care at all, and management is much too concerned with getting paid the ridiculous amounts that they charge for every little thing to care about trivial things, like the safety of their tenants.

I'm not a cheap person.  I'm willing to pay a little extra to feel safe and content with the services provided to me.  Rebel Place, however, charges a ridiculous amount of money for tenants to live in a filthy complex, be serviced by completely inept management and security, and for the privilege of living in constant weed smoke.  We couldn't even open our windows in the middle of the day without getting a huge wiff of smoke, and whenever we complained, no action was taken.  Living here is absolutely miserable and paying extra for misery is incredibly insulting.  On top of all of that, our apartment sat empty for nearly 3 months (with everything unplugged and the air conditioning off) and we were still charged utility fees.  When questioned, management stated it was because there were charges from previous months that we had not paid, which was a bold-faced lie as we were never late on payments and always paid in full.  My roommate and I also paid different rates, as I signed before she did, but I had to pay for parking every month while she paid absolutely nothing.

And to add even more insult to injury, we were both charged ridiculous fees when we moved out, including charges for cleaning.  We scrubbed that miserable apartment from top to bottom when we left, leaving it cleaner that it was when we moved in.  That was hilarious, considering there was a pile of vomit right outside our door for nearly 6 weeks that we had to step over to leave (which maintenance ""never got to"").  Not to mention the elevators reek of urine and vomit, and looked like they haven't been cleaned since they've been installed.  They also tried to make my roommate pay $25 for a light bulb which was never even in the room when we moved in. Twenty-five dollars.  For a light bulb.  She was also charged for a dented towel bar that was damaged when she moved in, but since she moved in outside of the normal move-in dates, she was never given the correct paperwork to report the discrepancy. 

Seriously, don't live here.  Las Vegas is full of great apartment complexes in nice neighborhoods and staffed with people who not only know what they're doing, but also at least pretend to be concerned when problems arise."
1,"Came in for lunch, looking to order to go.  Stood at the register and watched the worker punch away at the register for 5+ minutes without even looking up.  By the sounds of these reviews I may have been fortunate not to receive any food."
1,"absolutely the worst car buying experience in my life. i was helping a family member buy a car and this was a group of lying, underhanded, people at every turn. avoid at any and all costs. Peoria store is where we bought the car... run !!"
1,The bartender on the third floor (blonde hair Christa) SUCKS. So rude and RACIST. You're gonna lose so many customers if you don't lose her
1,"Overpriced and average. It's been awhile since I went in, so maybe things have changed. Long story short, quality is not the first priority. I was also asked to leave a good yelp review last time in exchange for a lighter tab, but wasn't on the platform then. Wouldn't change anything for me and I find it incredibly sad of them to even ask. More of a morals review here, but I just can't support a place that is both average and desperate. Better places in the town to eat in my opinion."
1,"The airport location gives the stand alone locations a really bad name. We go to the Scottsdale location frequently and love it there. This was our first time trying the airport location. I got the most pathetically small and dry chicken wings. They didn't taste good at all. The rice in the rice & beans was severely undercooked. When I went to the counter to replace it with something else, three employees walked right past me without asking if I needed help. I finally had to flag someone down. I replaced the rice & beans with potato salad. The potato salad seemed as if it was just taken out of the freezer.  

I can't imagine this place will last very long at the airport. If they don't close the doors themselves, I'm sure Sky Harbor will kick them out eventually."
1,"We received a coupon for a free appetizer and invitation to visit their restaurant. Upon going there, we were told they couldn't accept our coupon because their system was down. I found this to be in poor taste when a manager could have easily voided it on our bill. The steaks and service were mediocre anyways, so we won't be going back."
1,"If there was a possibility  to rate this restaurant 0 stars  I would. First I would like you to know me and my boyfriend came here for the first time on a romantic date we ordered 2 orders of the Mac n cheese, cornbread, and the collard greens with hammock and fried chicken. The prices were reasonable but the lack of taste and preparation of the food was ridiculous. The mac n cheese had absolutely no flavor, the collard greens taste like a pile of sugar, cornbread was hard as a rock and again no flavor, and the chicken wasn't Evan fried more like over baked with no flavor. We actually sent almost everything back to the kitchen and choose not to eat it. Me and my boyfriend are from the south and both agreed this restaurant was a Terrible representation of southern food. Highly disappointed in the service we received as well definitely will not return and tell others not to aswell."
1,"Absolutely horrible!!!!  My daughter's apartment was broken into and her laptop was stolen.  It was a complete nightmare and MANAGEMENT DID NOTHING - including the property management.  

And then to add insult to injury we just received a bill for outstanding utility and cleaning, etc.  MIND YOU -- she vacated in July 2015!!!!!  We just received from a collection agency and it has already been reported to the credit reporting agencies.  I have called management 5 times to try to see why I never received the initial bill to at least discuss or PAY.  NO RESPONSE!!!!

Do not let your child move here.  It is dangerous and completely unprofessional.  I hope they receive enough horrible reviews to put them out of business once and for all.  Writing to their management company Pinnacle Properties to let them know what kind of nightmare they are running."
1,"I had low expectations about the opening of another King West bar barn, but decided to give it a try, and the low expectations were met.   I ordered a tequila from their long list in the cocktail bar, and a sangrita to go with it.   Saw the barman making me an an enormous Sangria and quickly had that sinking feeling.  I explained what a sangrita was, and how it's a standard companion to good sipping tequila, but they didn't have it or know about it, and I just thought, what a pity to spend all this money on this pretty place and know so little about what you are doing that you can't get even the basic things right. And since my expectations were so predictably and efficiently met, I won't be rushing back."
1,"Once they have you signed the happy face goes away. They have their favorites. Fortunately they know me enough because of how many times I've gone in and complained. 
-pool isn't always clean
-you can count on noisy neighbors and parties all the time(specially when you have a huge test and want to sleep at 2am, not gna happen) although police activity is quite high 
-not a safe area. always piggybackers coming into the area, even saw a few homeless in the dumpsters 
-if you're not careful they will always try to overcharge you on the bill(claiming electricity went high) I also tried to ask for bulb replacements and they told me I was responsible for paying those... Uh no I'm not, they weren't working when I moved in so why should I pay to replace them?! 
-bullshit to pay for outdoor parking, there's more than enough spots for everyone and they don't even check the stickers. Plus no one parks by their own building so spot assignment would make sense to pay for 
-shuttle is only great when it runs on the scheduled time. Often the drivers make up their own schedule and when they leave earlier and you miss the shuttle... Good luck getting to class on time 
-always trash and empty bottles laying around the parking lots 
-computer area and lounge always closed at the times you need them! 

If you just want to party and get away with stuff this is your ideal place, if you have money to drop. The amount you pay monthly each could get you a much nicer place if you and your friend chose to(assuming they actually pair you up with what you specified on your survey). For a serious student who is only trying to be close to school and have a safe place you're better off looking elsewhere! Even a house with a few friends is more affordable and cleaner. 
Not to mention today I found out the Internet is down for the next few days... YAY"
1,"Very disappointed! I spent $12 on 2 sides of veggies thinking I would have leftovers to take with me on the plane.... NOT! I ordered the collards and maybe had enough for 3 bites! I work for a major airline, and I can guarantee I will not recommend this place! They need to either come down on prices or ramp up the portions!"
1,"Dirk, the manager, is the prototypical power trippin' bouncer. He refused to let us in despite being on the guest list and then proceeded to let a massive group in immediately after us. I really hope that they change the management of this place, because with this attitude they won't last long."
1,"I'm dropping this place another star because of the bullsh*t this place puts you through.  So I moved out, and when I go to pay my last bill online, because I like to pay by CC, it no longer lets me.  And when I call the office, they pretty much tell me tough sh*t, that's the way it is.  I can not believe this place.  You would be better off staying almost anywhere but here I would say, even the dorms.  At least UNLV housing has their stuff together."
1,This place deserves negative infinity stars! They had zero security there even though they pride themselves on that. The only good part was the shuttle to UNLV. I made sure I owed nothing else before moving out and continued to receive bills from them a year later! If you live here expect a call from a random collection agency a year after you've lived there claiming that you didn't pay your last utility bill. I called to see if it was true and they said yes and that they sent me a bill a week before sending me to collections which they didn't because I received all previous mail from them. Spend the extra money to live in a better area and to save your time and money. This place is the absolute WORST.
1,"Been there many times but my recent visit was a big disappointment that I won't be going back unless I run out of options. We went in for a quick dinner and was greet by a server with bad attitudes. We were simply asking if we can substitute a shrimp ball with more of the fish pastes in the same noodle dish because my husband is allergic to shrimps. The server replied with ""no, because it's pointless"". I think she missed the point that there are other non-shrimp things my husband can eat from the same dish. Then she rushed us through the menu, told us to choose something else quick (it was only 8:45pm and it wasn't busy). Food came and realized the same lady put the wrong order in. We finished eating at 9:15pm and was told by the same lady that we needed to pay the bill and wrap up our take away now because they are closing at 10 (yes 45 mins later). Food quality wise, this restaurant is only acceptable, their milk tea is average - on some days they are bad. On top, they increased their price recently."
1,"Came in yesterday late in the day around for 515p looking to purchase a part. I waited around 25 mins for the parts person to come to the desk. The cashier and service personnel were very nice and helpful. When the parts woman came she seemed less than thrilled to have to help. Was more worried about her phone and the game she was playing. When I asked about the part she was rude. The part was only $9 and I decided to go elsewhere to order it. If it's such an issue to order a $9 part, I can't imagine buying a $30k car. We will being buying our next mazda somewhere else."
1,"Can I give negative stars? Is that possible? Yelp should add that feature because of Rebel Place. Living here was the worst experience of my college career. The management are the rudest group of girls and the owners of the complex, Pinnacle, are money hungry leaches. They feed on college kids to help their bills get paid, how unfortunate for them. Anyway, while living there I had a total of 7 different roommates including strippers, prostitutes and professional scammers. But I thought it was student living? Rebel place is also notorious for scamming extra money out of you ever month for ""going over on your utility credit"". Riiiiiight. If you're a student looking for a place near campus there are so many options off of the 215 that are very close to school still. That's what I did and I'm so happy with my new apartments. I've been gone out of Rebel Place for a month and they sent me a move out bill for $130, but my room was spotless (see photos). Bissshh where? If you're thinking of moving into Rebel Place, don't do it!!!"
1,"Came with my family here first of all the food is extremely bad. There is no taste, I do know how Indian food must taste , it was tasteless and very cold. Garlic naan did not taste anything like it. And the worst part was falooda that is listed under dessert is not a dessert but is a cold beverage. My voucher that had wouldn't cover cold beverage and I was told don't believe what's on the menu.  The waitress had so much attitude and told the manager was on break while she was right across collecting bills. This is the worst experience I ever had at a restaurant and treated bad. Never coming back here ever ."
1,"Horrible service. Way under staffed for happy hour. I sat with a menu for 20 minutes and no order taken. Even after I let my server know I was ready, another 10'minutes had passed. I get keeping over head costs down, but wow. Lost a customer for life don't go hungry. Trying to close out my tab took another half hour. I asked for the check and a box twice. Another bartender came in around 7 but he was of very little assistance.  This is probably the worst service I have ever had. Sad really because the food is decent."
1,"No respect to customer at all. Terrible service, never come again. Waiters should be retrained. You should never swear to your customer"
1,"Very disappoint with this place!!! My wife and I went there for afternoon tea with our service dog and they refuse to give us service cause we have a service dog.  We were basically told to leave!   I told the owner that they cannot refuse service to us in an establishment under the Toronto bylaw.  They say they don't know anything about this service dog bylaws.  I even show them the actual laws from the city of Toronto bylaws webpage and they still don't understand. 
Well, I guess they lose us as regular customers from now on.  We will never go there again with that kind of ignorance! 
Too bad I can't give them a negative stars rating."
1,"Absolutely THE worst!  This place won ""Best of Madison"" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! 
Customer service:  Very poor.  The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering. 
Food finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD!  Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food.  Couldn't eat it. 
Manager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!). Should have been 100% comped. 
I'm one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported.  If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they've completely lost their ""mojo""."
1,"I love hole in the wall Viet places. This place has been around a long time. It was never great, but it's really gone down hill. Service is extremely bad. Very rude staff (beyond whats par for the course with these joints), order mistakes. Food is average at best, and there are so many better vietnamese places around. There is just no reason to go here."
1,"Very disappointed. I called in an order for pick up and when i arrived to pick it up the food was not ready and i had to wait another 30 minutes. When i finally got my food, i left without checking it because i was running late due to the long wait, when i got home i realized they gave me the wrong order. The staff was very rude and didn't understand a thing, i had the manager ask me what i ordered about 3 times yet he still managed to mess up my order. I then drove back there to complain because i live so close, and they remake my order, this time i check it before i leave and it is still the wrong order. The manager offered no compensation for this inconvenience and didn't even apologize for messing up my order, not once, but twice. This is ridiculous, i will never be returning to china tango."
1,"Not only did I receive poor service when I bought my car about two years ago, but they still call me and send me stuff in the mail.  I had a salesman call me a few months ago and leave me a message so I called back and left a message for him to call me back.  He called back and I politely asked him to take me off their calling list and told him about my buying experience.  He apologized and explained that they don't do those shady business practices anymore and asked me to come in for just 20 minutes (so that he could try to convince me to trade in my car).  I told him again I wasn't interested in buying ANY car from anyone right now as my current one meets my needs and told him again to take me off the calling list.

They sent me a birthday card and called me on my birthday and asked me to call back (again probably to try to get me to come in and buy another car).  I finally recorded a voice mail for them explaining my poor experience and saying that I would be calling a lawyer if they called again.  They didn't leave a message that time and I haven't heard from them yet.

These people are seriously desperate to take advantage of anyone and must think the previous buyers are dumb enough to buy from them again.    I hope they go out of business soon."
1,"RENTING FROM REBEL PLACE IS A SCAM

Management doesn't care about anything except taking your money. I lived on the first floor for 3 years and we had multiple break in attempts. The only reason they weren't actual break ins was because we were home both times and were able to scare them away by turning on lights and making noise. We reported them to management who said they would replace the windows but couldn't do anything about the security issue. 

We also had a HEART left on our doorstep. We called management, who said it wasn't their problem... ended up calling the police, who connected us to 911, and management still ignored the issue. 

Upon move out they kept my deposit and charged me an extra $200 to ""paint"" my bedroom, even though it was exponentially cleaner than when I moved in. They don't clean anything before you move in - if you have absolutely no option but to live here I highly recommend renting a carpet cleaner. 

PLEASE do yourself a favor and don't live here. They will steal every penny they can from you and let you live in disgusting, dangerous conditions."
1,"The first time I was here I had tofu stir-fried with vegetables, and it was passable. On today's second visit I had minced tofu with vegetables and mandarin pancakes. The pancakes were just right, but the filling was as bland as paste. 

I sprinkled on some soy sauce to give the dish at least sone flavor--which I don't do, nor should I if the cook had done his job--and it didn't sit well on my stomach. I burped lunch all afternoon. My companion had a similar reaction. 

I will not come here again."
1,"DO NOT COME HERE! My mother came to visit me in Toronto and on the last day of the trip she wanted some pho before flying home so naturally, I brought her to the place I go when I crave for pho. They were okay busy on a Friday afternoon and we got our table right away, but just as we put our order in, one XL of house special that the two of us were going to share because we were still somewhat full from breakfast, they sent it back, asked us to order more items and that they won't accept one item per two customers. After pleading our case and they still insisted, I walked out of the place. They would have had to give me the same table had I dined alone anyway, so why make it so difficult for people? Worst customer service ever. Would not go back, EVER."
1,"I ordered the fish and chips which was recommended as a 'best seller' by the server. It was 3 greasy pieces of fish, a couple of very skinny breaded shrimp, a spoonful of cole slaw and a few fries. This meal couldnt even be considered good at a fast food place for a third the price ($11.99).  
Service was fine, nice decor.
Poor Food!"
1,"I think most of these 5 stars are paid to be honest. I was there recently and I have never met a more rude manager across all sorts of services I received in this country. I don't remember his name (some white guy) but Pamela, who works there must know his name, as she was also present there and must remember me when I was there. He refused to answer most of my questions and was making insulting comments and was not at all interested in selling the car. Absolutely horrible. Avoid this place at all cost! Rajat."
1,"Ordered a Cole Turkey with ez slaw and recieved a mess of a sandwich thrown together in about 2 mins. Horrible place, avoid at all costs"
1,"DO NOT RENT FROM HERE- 
-seriously save yourself and don't even look on here, some of the amenities are good. That is the only reason why i moved here but then after everything I've been through don't fall for anything they try to buy you into staying here. 

I've lived here for 2 years and it's been the worst living experience and it could of been better if management did their jobs. MAINTENANCE GUYS ARE AWESOME, and super cool. Every time i had a problem the office basically said it was on my own. I've been taking pictures to prove how awful this place is.  Garbage is always on the ground all over the place. I live on the first floor. When they bring out a 3rd company to do maintenance and start using their blower machine to move things off the ground all that dirt and dust went through my window and got all my stuff dirty. I've tried to call right when they open at 9am and they must not turn their phones on until later which was a big inconvinced  to me, since i'm the resident and was calling on my time when they were suppose to be open. Also living here, I've heard so many stories of people breaking into cars/windows/ and even getting mugged by people on property. This place is not safe and all they care about is money.  Literally every time I see the office people they wont say hi and aren't friendly. I'm living here and they can't be friendly and helpful?"
1,"All around bad, and we love the stand alone locations. Girl at the register was rude, not helpful, and not interested in moving fast at all. Order took way too long to come out, pretty sure they forgot about it as the 3 orders behind us came out first.  Love the restaurant locations, but won't be stopping here again. Cryin' shame..."
1,"Putting the review I wrote for Google places here because I really hope nobody has to have the terrible experience I had. 

My parents are from Vietnam and i've grown up eating at various Vietnamese restaurants around the GTA, and this is by far the most atrocious restaurant we've come across.

Don't expect the servers to give you change even if you put $140 on a $110 order. It is their deserving right to get that tip for having the courtesy to stand there tutting at you while you're deciding on an order the moment you sit down.

They totally deserve that tip for getting your order wrong, charging you for the wrong order, and telling you to suck it up if you don't like it.

They totally totally deserve that tip for impatiently staring down a little girl finishing her food so she can grab the bowl out from in front of her the moment she puts the last beef ball in her mouth.

They totally deserve that tip for rushing you out of the restaurant the moment that little girl puts down her chopsticks.

Is this some new form of efficiency I've never heard about?

If I could rate it 0 stars I would."
1,"I am very torn because Matt S. was a phenomenal sales guys- so polite, accommodating and kind. When he passed me off to Shaun the finance guy- I was tricked into buying a warranty because he said it would only add $13 a month to my payment. When I went home and did the math it was more like $60 per month. I called them back to revise the agreement which they agreed to do. When I went back to sign the new paperwork- Shaun the finance guy badgered me for 30 minutes because I was refusing the warranty. He called me stupid several different ways. My favorite quote, ""I wish I could hit you over the head for being so stupid."" He also said, ""I guarantee you the car WILL break down and you will wish you had the warranty."" That certainly did not instill confidence in this purchase I was making from them. After being repeatedly called stupid and being guaranteed that my new car was going to break down, I complained to the managers who did absolutely nothing and I left very unhappy."
1,"Nice environment, but bad service. A group of 9 of us came in hoping for a great hotpot experience as we were all starving. Waited around 50 mins to be seated, as expected as we came in at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Service was incredibly slow right from the start, took awhile to get our soup bases and pots ready. Most of us eat a lot of beef and lamb, but it took forever for them to bring the portions that we asked for. They only brought one or two plates of meat every 20 mins for our big group when we asked for 4-5 servings at once as we have 5 big guys who eat a lot of meat.. We were paying for ""all we can eat"" weren't we? They never brought us more meat as we requested; we had to tell them many many times and we ended up giving up and filled ourselves with udon instead. they always forgot our simple additional orders like a can of pop as well. Our waitress wasn't in the best mood either, gave us attitude and looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for refills for our 9 glasses of water and when we all wanted ice cream, she stated we are only allowed to have one scoop of ice cream as the dessert per person (not reasonable for the price we have to pay in my opinion). With a drink, this dinner costed around $45 per person including tip, a high price to pay for regular hotpot with very poor service. Most of our group were disappointed. Quality of food was slightly above average, but quality of service was horrible... I will not be returning!"
1,Food is great. Read the reviews please. But the only thing is they ask for 10% tip so be aware!
1,"How do you get voted best of for 31 years when what is served is awful? This is the worst Chinese food my entire family has had in years. We all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals. That was $50 wasted. There was no flavor, or the flavor there was did not match the dish. How do you mess up beef fried rice? I can make it with more flavor. The Mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong. If you want to waste money and still be hungry, this is the place for you. How do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad. I use to trust Yelp reviews but lately, I've been fooled by the reviews."
1,Every time I get my oil changed it makes me think about Cardanale Way Mazda. I purchased my car from them back in 2006 and as part of my contract was a plan for free oil changes as long as I owned the car. However in 2010 they called me and canceled that part of the contract. Last time I checked it is illegal to violate a contract and I just wanted to let people know that they are willing to go back on there word.
1,"DO NOT LIVE HERE. This place is horrible. You pay astronomical rent for a room the size of a closet. The complex is constantly dirty and the management here is an absolute joke. They do NOT care about their tenants, and will take any opportunity they can to charge you. 

I moved out last month, and got my final account statement. They are charging me over $150 in charges for a room and bathroom cleaning fee, which is total BULL. I scrubbed that place inside and out. ALSO, I'm being charged for broken blinds which I did NOT do. 

I plan on contacting management. If they won't do anything for me, then I plan on contacting their superiors, until I get to the president and get this RESOLVED. If not, I have an uncle who is a reporter for a well respected news channel here in Las Vegas who would be absolutely delighted to hear about Rebel Place."
1,"This is the first time I have left a review after using Yelp many times but this  restaurant warrants it. This was one one of the worst Chinese meals I have had...Panda Express is better, and I won't eat that! I should have been clued in when I saw the ""splash marks"" not cleaned off the walls or the hard water stained glasses, but sadly I was craving Chinese food so I overlooked the ""ambiance"".  The soup was bland, the egg roll was greasy and served with  sweet sauce that had the consistency of jelly, the moo-shu was rolled in the kitchen (as opposed to table side) so I had to open it to apply the overly salty sauce, and the beef with vegetables was just gross. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID this restaurant."
1,"I will not be going back to this Capriotti's Shop!! 
First, I made a credit card purchase and one of their employees used my card and charged $140.00. The owner called me and told me how did I know it was his store and I told him that I had not used my card before then or after then. He told me that someone could have written my number down months ago and used it the same day that I came into his store. He then told me why was I upset since I did not make the charges the bank was going to credit my money. I told him it was the principle and then he called me ""sweetheart"" and I told him not to call me that. Then he said what did I want him to do? I told him nothing. I wanted him to know and now that he knew and since he got nasty he could do absolutely nothing and I told him to have a nice day and I hung up. 
I do not know why people think you are always out to get something. Maybe owners need to understand that if their employees take peoples credit card numbers and charge $140.00 worth of merchandise on someone else maybe they need to call you with sincerity in their voice versus attitude and disgust. Instead of acting like it could not have happened or it was your fault for purchasing with your debit card maybe an apology would have been better. But let me be clear I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS CAPRIOTTI'S BECAUSE OF THE OWNER!!!!"
1,"I wonder how do they run the place with rude staffs, it's non of my business to talk but i just wanna share some experiences to people who is going there. I saw a staff who drop a f..king silly fish sauce on a gentleman jacket then she pretend like nth happened at all and she still laugh with her coworkers and may think the guy doesn't know. Thanks god he found out the f..king silly fish sauce is all over his jacket. Be aware of their rude staffs and I hope they should go to a moral training course to change their bad behaviourssssssss.
Overall rude staffs, bad service and dirty place.
They also talked too loud in Vietnamese language and they clean the floor while we were eating. 
Piss off 

Won't go back to see their rude staffs at all. 
ZERO Star"
1,I was having a great time until my check came and things that I thought were on football special weren't. football special promotional card has item that aren't included and they didn't do anything to fix it. Terrible. I'll be calling the manager tomorrow because I am so upset.
1,"I would recommend the UNLV dorms or almost anywhere else aside from this. The leases are not cheap and there is no service or sense of security that comes with living there. There is no responsiveness if there is a problem, just a bunch of people ignoring you and passing the buck. There are so many other choices in the Vegas area (especially in this economy) that make all of this totally unacceptable."
1,"I sent the email requested over a week ago and no reply.
Reader: draw your own conclusions."
1,"This place is utterly disturbing. The fact that I paid almost $7 for the beef curry with pancake (roti) and received one piece of beef (in a bowl smaller than my cup) and a small piece of ""pancake"" is almost insulting. Impossible to see why I paid that that much for something so little."
1,"Terrible experience. It took more than 45 minutes for my order to arrive. My sandwich was dry and they sent me turkey chili instead of tomato bisque for soup. The turkey chili had absolutely no flavor and was very greasy, I ended up throwing it away after two spoons of it. This is probably the last time I'll order from here."
1,"HORRIBLE place to live. The location is easy for UNLV and the strip, but the amount of noise your neighbors make, horrible management issues and plenty of overcharges on rent are not worth it. I did a full year there, I had an amazing roommate, but any time we had an issue or a false overcharge, management was so slow and resistant to work with us. Two years later I am getting debt collector calls, when in fact I paid all rent on time and do not owe ANYTHING to rebel place.. Bunch of scammers that try to make money any way they can, even if it means selling your information and nonexistent debt to pesky debt collectors. Leeches. They don't even deserve a -5 star."
1,"Dang it.  Just went to the one in Red Rock for a quick lunch.  Was ignored standing there. Two people working, one in the grill, the other looked at me and walked into the back.  One guy was waiting for his food....didn't see any other customers.  Went to port o subs down the street instead.  Gave a great review last time.  Disappointed now.  Hope there is another capriottis nearby next time."
1,"on the evening of 12/4  we stopped in and waited for 15 minutes. No waters not even greeted. The bartender watched us come in and never bothered to help us. How ever he did continue to help the belligerently drunk guy who wouldn't stop burping. Seriously, this guy was so wasted he kept yelling ""I'm driving home im driving home drunk!!"" Finally after listening to that and being neglected for 15 minutes we walked out. Never again! lost a loyal customer! I have had the food before it is nothing to write home about."
1,"sorry to say but both the food and service are not good. not very welcoming/nice overall. the imperial chicken was very soggy and tasted a bit uncooked, the ingredients don't seem very fresh, the portions overall are small for the prices. tea doesn't come with a tea strainer inside and all the leaves poured out as i drank from my cup. i had to ask a busser for a separate manual tea strainer! (they charge per cup, by the way per person).. help and service are so slow and every single time i asked for something, the waitress sternly told me to wait or hold on a second after she finished serving others first

very americanized Chinese food, not so authentic, on the salty side
oh and the crispy noodles are like those things you get for free when you order chinese take out/delivery (like those fried wonton chips!) - they said that that's all they have for the crispy noodles, so i don't recommend getting the chow mien crispy noodle dish because they're not like real noodles after all :/"
1,"My girlfriend had her apartment at rebel place. People leave trash outside of their homes. Dogs urinate in the elevators. Homeless people rummage through dumpsters. Management cannot calculate rent correctly. Maintenance takes a long time to complete work. Unless you area 17 year old college student who cannot afford someone else, do not rent rooms here."
1,Too few south indian options on the menu for a south Indian restaurant.. N the sambhar was tasteless..more like tasteless daal.. No south indian masalaas or veges in sambhar..n d idlis were anything but round and soft.. Won't return..!!
1,Dont even think about leave your jacket at that service were you pay 3 $cdn for theyre completely disorganized that systems they have don't work  propertly
1,"Would give this place 0 stars if that were possible. Food sucks, service sucks, the atmosphere as soon as you walk in sucks. Everything sucks about this place. Hopefully it closes down, it's literally an eyesore because I'm reminded of the incredibly terrible one-time service I visited. I'd advise everyone to stay away unless you fancy crap service and food."
1,730 start time is such a lie. Still waiting. Still not open at 8:30. They are the ones who told me to be here at eight.  I was hoping to make it to work on time looks like that's not going to happen.
1,"Terribly slow service. 15 min for a sandwich and nobody else was in front of me. This is an airport, yet the restaurant has faster service. This is the 2nd time, and last time!"
1,730 start time is such a lie. Still waiting. Still not open at 8:30. They are the ones who told me to be here at eight.  I was hoping to make it to work on time looks like that's not going to happen.it is now 9 o'clock and I'm leaving. I never did get my service done terrible.
1,"I came here for the Indian buffet and was sorely disappointed by the limited selection of food available. I've been to a lot of Indian buffets and was surprised to find that they didn't have paneer or butter chicken or any of the masala dishes that I normally see in an Indian buffet. Heck, there wasn't even naan there. Their dessert selection was also disappointing. It had a total of 5 items: a rice pudding like dish (Payasam), an orange mash like dish (Kesari), and 3 trays of old looking diced fruits (cantaloupe, honeydew, apple/fruit mix). I was so sad that I couldn't find the gulab jamun! This is the first time ever that I didn't go back for a second helping in a buffet (I'm normally a glutton, what can I say?).  They advertise their buffet saying that there's over 30 items in there but there definitely wasn't. There was maybe 10 or so that were considered actually food (the rest being sauces). The food also wasn't very appetizing for me to even want to go for seconds. For $12.99, there are way better buffets out there with way more appetizing options. 

The quality of the food there was lacking. The mixed fruits that were available were browned and warm. The deep fried foods were soggy. The szechuan chicken (weird that it was in an Indian restuarant in the first place) was overly fatty. A lot of the food just isn't that great compared to other buffets. Of course, I don't expect fine dining with an Indian buffet but having gone to quite a few of them, this is one of the worse places I've been to. 

It seems a lot of reviewers here recommend ordering a la carte. Maybe the quality is better othere. But given the quality of the food they rolled out for the buffet, I won't be back to try their menu items."
1,"If you're reading this right now, I highly recommend you never sign a lease with Rebel Place. 

I signed a lease about a year and a half ago and rented a room for $700-$800 per month. When I first signed the agreement, I told them I want a girl roommate because I wasn't comfortable with co-ed, and they said of course. I didn't grow up in Nevada so I would go back and forth to see family and friends from my hometown when I'm on break from school. My ex roommate said she had to leave all of a sudden so she found a sublease. I wasn't in town when all of this was happening but one day, I come back home and see a half naked man in my apartment. He said hi and said he was my new roommate. I obviously panicked because I specifically told management that I'm not comfortable with a guy roommate. I went to the office and complained but all they said was ""Sorry. He already signed the sub lease agreement."" And that if I was uncomfortable with it that, I would have to find a sublease and move to another place. It was my apartment before it was his. And it's the management's fault for letting him sign for my apartment when I told them I wanted a girl roommate when I first moved in here. They're making me do all the work and making ME move when I was in that apartment first. All the management workers say is ""Sorry"" and ""There's nothing else we can do anymore"" 

I mean, excuse me? You guys are the ones that fucked up and making me do all the work? Ugh. 

I also have other friends that used to live here but they said the management is crap and when they request maintenance help, it takes days or even weeks to get things fixed. It's dirty and not safe here either. I mean we pay $700-$800 for ONE BED AND ONE BATH in Vegas and they can't even hire for maintenance staff, more friendly management workers, or security at night? All my money is going to waste here and I just can't wait until my lease is over and I'm so done with this place. 

So, I highly DON'T recommend signing with this place. If you already signed or is currently a resident here, ""watch out for burglars and bed bugs!"""
1,"This was one of those cold, dreary and windy night when one craves for a hot, steaming bowl of Pho! We searched for a nearby Vietnamese restaurant. This place sprung up that was close by. 
I am very disappointed with the food and the customer service of this place. The lady at the front desk treated us as if she was giving us the food for free. The flavor of the soup was nothing to write home about. We have tried numerous Pho restaurant and this was the worst in Toronto. Enough said. 
I would not recommend this place to anyone."
1,"Myself and two friends order a light meal for take out from Sesame Inn after a long day - BIG MISTAKE. The food was inedible. The Hot and Sour Soup was orange. I have never seen orange Hot and Sour Soup and if the color didn't turn you off, the taste certainly did. I can honestly say I have never had anything like it. The Mu Shu Pork was watery, poorly seasoned and the pork was just about nonexistent. We also order a chicken dish and to be honest I don't know what it was supposed to be and I don't remember what it was called. We were not looking for gourmet, just someone to feed us a warm meal after a long day. We ended up throwing all of the food away minus about 7 bites. 
Unfortunately the food quality was that bad and for the price (which was not cheap) we expected something at least reminiscent of Chinese food. I can only hope that the night we were there the cook had quit and the dishwasher was filling in. Nevertheless, we won't go back."
1,"So very disappointed in Texas Roadhouse today. We may not ever be going back.

It's Mother's Day, so I called this morning to see if they would take a reservation. The gal on the phone said they do call ahead seating 2 hours in advance, so if we wanted to come at 5:30, call at 3:30.

3:30 rolls around and now we're being told they aren't taking seating for parties over 8 people. If we had been told that earlier, we could have made reservations elsewhere, but now we've been waiting around all day for this! Spoke to a manager who basically said 'I don't know what she told you that'

You shouldn't have people answering the phones on Mother's Day if they're not aware of the policies. They also said they couldn't accommodate us in any way. 'I can tryyyy but you'd probably be at two tables'

Now we're scrambling to find somewhere for Mother's Day and could not be more disappointed with the bad information from Texas Roadhouse."
1,"Reaching the end of my sanity in this place.

- People are definitely not as nice as they are on the phone when you're inquiring about this place. 
- Close to campus but this is just not in a safe area. Literally living in the middle of drug deals, crackheads, and prostitutes.
- The website may say that you're paying 546 for a 4 bedroom, 645 for a 2 bedroom, and etc. but apparently it is a norm here for people to pay around 50 dollars more than their ""assigned rent"".
- That roommate profile you were given? They do not use it to assign you a roommate.
- The property is not secure at all. Strangers, homeless people, and crackheads walk on the property all the time by simply pushing the gate open. 
- What is the point of paying for parking when you can look outside and see someone from off the street trying to break into your car?

I now have serious anxiety issues and the worst part is that I can't even be comfortable in my own apartment because my roommates are the exact opposite of me. This place can make you so miserable. It may look appealing but thats truly all it is. Save yourself some money and headache and go split $600 a month for a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom in a much nicer neighborhood."
1,"Worst Pho restaurant I've ever been to. I've been to at least 30. The beef in the soup wasn't right. It had a strange colour and smell and the broth had no depth whatsoever. 
I ordered a drink. The food arrived first. One server walked by with her index finger firmed pressed into her eye digging for gold I believe. The Vietnamese spring rolls had a flaky tasteless, cracked flour mixture on it exterior and the menu described it came with a ""salad"" when in fact a leaf lettuce garnish was the truth.  3 servers also gathered in the dining area and spoke really loudly with total and complete disregard of patrons. Me and my gf are fairly easy going but quickly agreed we are never coming back."
1,"Can I give negative stars? My experience with this place was HORRIBLE.

- arrived on a late holiday Sunday night pretty desperate for food, staff sweeping the floor with dirt and food residues two hours before closing and half the people still eating. The chairs were flipped upside down onto table so when the staff put chairs down to sit us, we got concerned and had to clean our own table and utensils.

- waitress was VERY rude, she sat us on the inner end of a long table facing a wall where it wAs impossible for my friend to get in and out with people on the outer end. We had clearly asked for a new table, and there were empty seats on other half of the restaurant, but waitress plainly said no.

- now the food: we were praying that food would be amazing cuz we were so hungry that we would just let go of poor service if food was good. But pho soup was very salty, noodles starchy, and beef brisket tough like rubber 

- we asked for our bill to get the hell out, the lady pointed us to cashier, no word. The bill came to be 16.95, we paid 17 (even that was too much tip) the lady looked at the money and said to us: the bill was 16.95, repeatedly. How they thought we were gonna leave any tip was beyond me."
1,"I usually enjoy the vegan options and at most other locations the employees are friendly. 
This location is inside the Red Rock Casino in a pretty busy food court. But on a Thursday night I walked up to order no one in line and no one ahead of me. I order my sandwich,  a few people walked up after I ordered.  I figure my sandwich would take 5mins tops since there was no one ahead of me. 

Well 15 minutes passed by. I walk up to the cashier and ask where is my food. The kid was rude for one and second he tells me there was a sandwich ahead of mine. I look on the counter not only was my sandwich sitting there. 5 more sandwiches were on the counter. I said to him why did you make me wait 15 mins when my sandwich was ready a long time ago. The kid lies and tells me there was someone ahead of me. I said ok that's fine but why did you make me wait while you made all the other customers sandwiches that ordered after me? 

I get no reply, no apology no offer for a discount  nothing the kid was speechless and couldn't answer a simple question. Horrible customer service. I don't recommend going to this location they you make wait a long time for one sandwich mind you and are rude. 

I'm a regular at the casino and spend a lot of money there I don't appreciate some rude kid giving me attitude over a $10 sandwich. Management should pay more attention to the customers and have those employees work on customer service."
1,"My husband and I ordered takeout of Lo Mein Noodles and Shrimp Fried Rice, they both had NO taste.  It had to be the worst chinese food I ever had."
1,"Car is great. Customer Service is not. I should have known from the morning I went in... my sales rep was late to work. Since then, my warranty was incorrectly entered in the computer, the maintenance plan I am paying extra for every month only applies to their dealership, I've called to fix it and was hung up on, transferred endlessly until reaching a voicemail. The salesman who helped me doesn't even work there anymore. And I get calls every other day with reps asking me if I want to buy a car, if I had made my decision yet. I have to tell them, ""yeah, I bought one from you."""
1,"So I had heard from a couple of people that this was the best Chinese (American/Chinese) in town. That is not true at all! I tried a sampling appetizer, dumpling, sweet and sour chicken, among other things and there was simply no flavor nor originality. The decor of the place is nice, that must be what people are mesmerized with, so much so they forget to pay attention to the screams of agony from their tongue! I do not recommend this place.

A good note is the waitress was great and the decor is fun but that's is not what I go out to eat for..."
1,"This place is more about atmosphere than food.  Probably the worst Chinese/American food I ever ate. If you want a romantic Chinese/American dinner this is the place. If you want good Chinese/American food stay away from this place. Will never eat here again. The service was good though. Old, old fruit for my garnish in my drink. For the price, they should have cut fresh fruit."
1,"A Great Restaurant back in Southlake, TX, but the Phoenix Airport Lolo's Food is not good, Service is slow and the Lemonade is Watered down."
1,"Went in at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. Total ghost town. Nobody in this place. Terrible bar service, she seemed to be intentionally ignoring us. We asked for menus. The prices were outrageous for bar food. Who wants to pay double digits for a french dip type sandwich. 

Don't waste your time."
1,"Never had Chinese food this bad. Very bland, came out 3 minutes after we ordered and it was warm which makes me think it was sitting in a pot all day."
1,"You pay for the food, definitely not the service. 

We were a party of 15, went for dinner on Saturday night with a reservation for 7pm. The previous party took longer to leave, it also took them about 15 minutes to clear and set the table, so we started trying to get seated around 7:40. Trying - because there were not enough chairs for everyone. We has to track down servers to bring more chairs since the ones without chairs were standing in front of the table waiting for a while for any server to notice. 

We had maybe 6 menus at our table of 15, half of them in Chinese which majority of the party cannot read. We had one server who was nice enough to take our orders but we had to explain how to order to everyone. Nobody explained how the pot heater controllers worked so we had to figure out which controller was for which set. 

The dipping sauce took a really long time to come. Food was cooked but we had for wait for the dipping sauce. When they came, the waiter dumped the tray of dipping sauces on a folding table behind us and tried to leave, without giving each person what they ordered or explaining what is what. 

We ordered drinks which took maybe 20min to come... Curious since we ordered plum drink or wintermelon drink that came in jugs. You'd think itd be quick since all you do is pour and add ice. 

The food is good quality and fresh, so I think you really are paying just for the food and not the service. The servers seem young and not trained at what they do - the Resto is busy and the whole eating experience is confusing and chaotic. I may have preferred the help yourself type of hot pot afterall since you get what you want, when you want it."
1,"My girlfriends and I came here for our GNO after hearing good reviews about this place and was pretty disappointed with the food and service. Upon entry we were greeted by the hostess who was very nice and seated us at a table in the back area of the restaurant. The ambiance was pretty romantic with dim lighting and Spanish music in the background. My girlfriend and I ordered a bottle of white wine, ceviche and rice and beans while we waited for the rest of our friends to join us. The hamachi ceviche was salty and a bit on the fishy side and the rice and beans looked like jail food or something, pretty flavorless IMO. I just returned from Barcelona last November and had some wonderful Spanish tapas there so I wasn't too impressed with the food at Baro. My girlfriend later on ordered the duck confit which tasted pretty good but looked more like a seafood fried rice in a stone bowl they might have served at a place such as kingyo izakaya or a jambalaya restaurant. The real turning point at this restaurant was when I asked the server about the wine. My girlfriends and I were having a hard time drinking it because it tasted unlike any pinot grigio we've had. It was tart and a bit carbonated on the tongue almost like a moscato without the sweetness. To me, it was pretty disgusting and I was struggling to drink it. I had no problem paying for a bottle of wine that I ordered but I figured I'd ask the waitress out of curiosity what the wine was supposed to taste like in case there was something wrong with it. She then gave a weary look and told us she will talk to her manager. They basically spoke around ten min later in front of our table, and although she apologized for the delay, the manager never once approached our table to find out what the problem was or came to make sure we were doing alright. The waitress came back to our table and took the bottle (which was NOT empty) and said she will get someone at the bar to taste it. She came back and said it was fine and that it was supposed to taste like that. I thanked her for checking and made a mental note not to order that wine again. Although I didn't like the wine, it would have been nice if they returned the bottle that we not finished so one of my other girlfriends could have had it. I found that this was very unacceptable and was insulted that the problem wasn't rectified in a manner that was not speedy or satisfactory. I ended up paying for the wine, which we never got back and still received no word from the manager. I walked out feeling like I did something wrong by asking a question about a shitty 50 dollar bottle of wine that we never even got back. Zero stars for customer service."
1,"Breakfast ""sandwich"" was a waffle with scrambled eggs (no cheese when there was supposed to be cheesy eggs) all on one side and the bacon piled on the other side. Not even touching.  The waffles were soft and limp like they had waited for ages to be sent out. Which they had...the family that ordered immediately after me had already asked for their money back for taking too long. 

I waited another 5 minutes for a total of 20 to get my mediocre ""sandwich.""  In an airport situation you really, really need to let your customers know they can expect a long wait because you have a substitute cook (who was literally asking the cashier what each item was supposed to contain)."
1,This place has changed hands. It used to be our favorite local Chinese restaurant. Tonight was a huge disappointment. Every dish was too sweet. They all tasted the same. There were hardly any vegetables and the few in our dishes  were almost raw. They need a new chef right away.  The help was very attentive. I hope they get their act together.
1,"Chicken biryani was like rice mixed with turmeric, salt and boiled chicken. Don't bother ordering kadhai chicken. Mysore masala dosa was alright. Have had much better chicken lollypop."
1,Food are bad and expensive along with terrible service. Curry chicken rice 11.99 and other place never go above 10. Drink are bad too. Not recommended
1,"The food here is good but the service is extremely bad. I found a white plastic-like piece of something in my dosa which I spent about good five minutes experimenting with my guest to see whether it was harmful or not. While I concluded that it was most probably ok to finish eating the food and that what I found is something that is not non-veg (as i'm a vegetarian!), I was still disturbed by the experience. Consequently, I called the waitress and informed about it. She took the white plastic-like object from me and had a discussion with the mangers and owner right in front of me (everyone made eye contact and/or starred at me while having a discussion, lol!). Waitress came back and said that I could have gotten another dosa but since I finished eating what I ordered i'm no longer eligible AND  that it won't be taken off the bill bc they are already doing their anniversary promotion and so they cannot offer another discount. I was really upset because a) this whole thing interrupted my dinner, b) interrupted my dinner date with my guest, c) caused a lot of stress d) wasted a whole lot of my time, e) and to make matters worse they offered me a deal which apparently had expired because I continued to eat the dosa - this is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard from a restaurant manager!! and I was extremely shocked to hear it come from a restaurant that charges a hefty price!

I went straight to the owner, David, and brought up the issue. He repeated just what the waitress had told me which is that since I finished the food, they cannot offer me anything. I told him how much i'm disappointed and upset by their customer service. I raised all of the above points as well as the fact that all complaints should be handled directly by the manager and the least that could've been done is give an apology instead of arguing with the customer with a ridiculous point!! What was evident from the conversation is that the managers and especially the owner have no customer service skills and they have no interest in looking after customer satisfaction. David was simply using a cookie-cutter approach to the problem instead of looking at it in an individual basis and focusing on customer satisfaction. He said that his team of staff figured out that the white plastic-like object was in fact a piece of flattened dry rice. What they failed to do is inform that to me so that at least it would have put me at ease instead leaving me to feel that i could've potentially eaten something harmful. What was really interesting in the conversation with David is that no where in our conversation he took the ownership for their mistake which includes but not limited to: a) sending a waitress to address complaint instead of  a manger, b) not informing that the object is in fact rice and not something harmful, c) not offering apology, d) offering a deal that apparently expired because i finished eating the last bit of dosa i had in my plate, e) telling me that because they were doing a promotion for their anniversary, they cannot offer another discount for me (which was a very foolish thing to say!).. etc. 

If they want business, they need to start looking after their customers!!! This is a very shocking and disturbing experience esp since this came directly from the owner! I promoted their anniversary deal by forwarding their email to friends and colleagues - I will surely be informing all of them of this experience. at least at the end of my complaint, he should've offered a statement of apology or something to make up for the stress and disturbance caused but instead he was all about wining the argument.

There's a lot for David and his management staff to learn re: customer service! Perhaps go dine at Fabbrica or Joey or auberge du pommier or even cheaper restaurants like pickle barrel to really learn what customer service is all about!"
1,"Rebel place does not deserve a star at yelp! Horrible Place to live, Horrible management, Ridiculous Overcharge. Rebel place is not a place for you. It was not for me. I currently ended my contract now I am facing all these overcharges they are asking me to pay. I tole them that I will pay what I owe RP, all they want is your money. They do not provide a nice living environment (never).
They do not listen to you if you complain. I had to complain more than 10 times about the maintenance and roommate issues. They never gave me a notice for new roommates moving in, they did not get any approval from me. If you have a messy roommate, you have to take them.
I saw 4 street beggars on the property. One of them banged on my door and asked for a glass of water. Oh the management said they cannot guarantee tenant's safety.
The shuttle schedule does not work all the time. They change schedule just because they want to (they do not consider students).
Overcharges you will have to handle after you leave. This is not just my story. All my friends have been handling the same problem. I'd love to do a class action case against RP."
1,The eggs I got at the express airport version were not at all the same I get in the restaurant. I ordered a lemonade and was given no choice in size.  So I paid nearly 5 dollars for a rather large (32 oz) cup. I accidentally knocked it over when picking my eggs up. I had only drank 1/5 of the cup and asked if there was a refill price to replace the spilled lemonade and the employee said I'd need to pay full price. I was pretty astonished.
1,"I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. It deserves negative stars, if possible. 

Absolutely horrible services. Food took 15 mins to arrive. The chicken was dry and the waffle was soggy. My main reason for this horrible rating is because services was that bad, and the food didn't make it any better. So my overall experience is negative. 

If you want to waste your time and money, then I definitely would recommend this place. If not, then I recommend just going somewhere else. Anything is better than this place."
1,Services and food the first time was amazing! But sadly my husband and I came back a second time and it was Horrible. I will never go spent my money here again! Took 20 minutes after I requested to get my check and it was wrong. To start our visit here we waited 10 minutes just to order our breakfast and drinks. When we asked why the check was incorrect the bartender proceeded to get an attitude with me and my husband. I will never be back to this Sierra Gold again.
1,"I bought a car from them, then the guy I bought it from was fired and I got emails and phone calls every day for weeks asking me if I was interested in buying a car. If that wasn't worrisome enough, I went to a closer dealership for my first oil change (which was supposed to be covered in my warranty) and I found out, not only was it not covered, someone had entered it in the computer wrong. When I tried to clear this up and called, Cardinale hung up on me. Called back and was forwarded 5 times to people who told me conflicting stuff about I had to be further than 50 miles away to use a different dealership, how it only worked if I went to their service dept or just went straight to voicemail... left a message, never heard back. 

**Edit: After this mess I started going to More Mazda in Tempe - they cleared everything up, fast, friendly. Definitely go there instead. The car is doing well since the original post in 2012!"
1,"Really wanted to like it, heard so much about the restaurants. The waffles were limp, not crispy. The chicken breast was pink on the inside, undercooked. The sweet potatoes were so hard they bordered on raw.
NOPE, won't go back. But the Joe's Barbecue next door sure smelled good."
1,"Wish there weer less stars avail.  Managers here lie till they turn blue. Will never buy a cat from them again. Josh the sales man was great but supporting cast is just used car sales tactics. Bought a $24000 car wuthering bad brakes. Had to go pay a different dealership to fix after having the car 3 days. Mgrs say your brakes can be minium size and even on luxury cars, brakes are suppose to squeak and squeal. Make them let you take the car at least for the weekend before you buy.  Hope I can spare you guys the headaches and money"
1,"I wish I could say it has gotten better...alas it has not.  This is the second time I come to find someone (staff) in my apartment without my knowledge/notice.  (According to the OWNER'S RIGHT OF INSPECTION AND ENTRY owners need to give 24 hr notice for ""during reasonable hours for any reasonable business purposes."")

Management has no respect for its current residents and main priority is to recruit new victims. 

Don't be fooled it as far from ""student living"" as it could be. In fact it is a hop skip and a jump away from becoming section 8 status.

Inside of the building there only few trash cans so trash is scattered everywhere. Right now the trash area is open and adds to the ghetto charm. The ""courtyard"" is filled with glass, which is great if you want your pet to die. 

I wonder what there criteria is for the qualifying standards. My last roommate was a stripper. Not even kidding. If you have a credit card and pulse your qualified."
1,"Rebel place is the worst place you could possibly live. First they take away the visitors parking and make you get a visitors pass for your guest or they have to park outside the gate where there are only like 5 parking spots which are always taken so get a pass or they will tow your visitors car. Monday I get home and there a note on my door saying that we have to bring our fire extinguishers down to the office to be inspected in 2 days or they will charge everyone in the apartment a $75 fee so I took it down right then and there, then today they called my roommate saying that we have 10 minuets to bring it down or we were going to be charged. Also an apartment should not be without a fire extinguisher what if the apartment caught fire within those 2 days they would try and blame ya when it was there fault for taking the fire extinguishers out of our apartments they should have sent someone up to inspect them then should have never had to leave our apartment. The employees downstairs are rude and the ""managers"" are some bullshit ass people from Craigslist it seems like. All in all, Rebel place is a shitty place to live and the employees downstairs are all rude ass fuck and don't care about nothing but trying to get every dime you have to your name. If it was possible I would give this place a negative star rating."
1,"Other reviewers have noted problems with the service, and indeed the service is some of the worst I've ever had.  We went with a large group, and had reserved a private room. You might think this would make for more attentive service, but the opposite was true.  Once the doors to the room were closed the waitstaff seemed to forget about us.  Long delays in service meant that we had to get up and find waitstaff (can't just flag them in a private room) to ask that plates be cleared, and so forth.  

Poor service should deter prospective diners, but if you do decide to eat here know that this is not Chinese food but American Chinese food, characterized by fried meats and sweet sauces.  As American Chinese food, the execution is decent -- however, real Chinese food is much tastier."
1,"This is a PT's!  Says nothing about PT's on the outside.  On the inside, it is all PT's.  So, you get that crappy PT food when you are expecting something different. I felt swindled.  

I read somewhere that this is a ""high end"" PT.  High end? That is like saying Popeyes is a high-end KFC.  

And the food is overpriced.  

Nothing special."
1,"I don't think there is anything to write about and I need not bother since most of the reviews here do it justice.  Cobbled-together restaurant that I can only describe as a cross between New City Restaurant, Congee Queen, and Firefly Seafood.  

New City feel = lack of service, all-day option menus with drinks, same tea service cup and saucer
Congee Queen feel = lack of service, trying to mash together congee menu, noodles menu, fried rice menu, snacks menu along with New City and Firefly Seafood menu
Firefly Seafood feel = lack of service, overpriced, battered shrimp on menu, spaghetti options on top of traditional rice/noodle/breakfast options, getting annoyed at customer. 

Shameful characteristics that just never go away: sticky tables (even sticky sugar spouts!), dirty bathroom, dry food stuck on cutlery, zero service, customer berating*

Customer berating - you don't have to bark at me twice that if I pay by card I need to go to the counter. I heard you the first time. Use some Sherlocking skills please: If I acknowledged your directions the first bark, but I am still sitting at the table, and you see that across me there is another set of keys and a mobile phone, that should probably help you deduct that I am actually waiting for my dining partner to return to the table from the restrooms before I abandon the table to go pay the tab.

Customer service advice: DO NOT TRY TO GRAB MY CREDIT CARD OUT OF MY HAND. HAND ME THE CARD SERVICE TERMINAL AND TELL ME TO TAP OR INSERT CARD.  If tapping card doesn't have Tip settings set up, DO NOT GET FRUSTRATED AT ME AND TELL ME THAT YOU CAN'T RECEIVE A TIP BECAUSE I DIDN'T INSERT CARD for the tip option.  And then you have the guts to ask me if I have cash.  Because you know what I will do right? I will gladly offer you my credit card again and tell you to charge me on tip 20%. But it ain't my fault you were too gutless to follow-through and agree with my suggestion and only say to me ""next time, bring cash"".  

...Because you know, of course, there will be a next time right?  

I think the ""M"" in Kitchen M. might stand for minus, minimal, missing, marred, miserly, menial, I can go on......"
1,"This place is Lolo's in name only, the food is like all airport food, over priced and not very good.  My problem here is that less than a 15 minute drive from the airport you would be at the LoLo's on Central in Phoenix which is far, far, far and by far good eats.  This airport spot is truly a blemish to your name and food.

i look forward to getting to eat LoLo's whenever I am near Central location and when I seen one in the airport, and I travel for work nearly every week, I was like, YESSSSS!  But when I ate the food I was like. NOOOOOOOOOOOO....   

Let me break it down for you.  When a you get past the point of hungry people stopping  simply from seeing your business as they pass too, people going out of their way and remembering your name because you stand out, that is called brand.  LoLo's name is a brand name but the food wherever that name is served must live up to the Brand you have created.

I continue to go to the Central location but will not go to the airport.  Hey it's your name I went to in the first place."
1,"I'd give them a 0 star but I cannot. Horrible cashier bad attitude and they could care less about going the extra mile. Wanted to order breakfast at 10:15. ""sorry breakfast is over"". We are the only ones around and the grill is fully open. Don't get it. Neither will they when business does not support the high rent here. Good luck won't be back."
1,"Two of us walked in at 9:40 on a Sunday. They close at 11. The waitress looks up from her cell phone, unimpressed, and asks: ""seriously?"". Confused, we ask if they're still open. She says yes and we grab a seat. We were still trying to decide if we wanted to put that rude comment behind us and just order when she dropped and broke a bowl. Took that as a sign.
We said goodnight, and left to go search for food and competent service elsewhere."
1,"This was, quite possibly, the WORST Chinese food (if you can call it that) that I've ever eaten in my life.

We started with the appetizer platter for two.  The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.

Then came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.

My boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.

Apart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  

Plus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?

Skip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.  On Fridays, they receive shipments of Pork Bao in from a bakery in Chicago that are to die for!"
1,"Honestly, I HATE HATE HATE this place.

The management is AWFUL! They are not the least bit accommodating, and don't do there job. I can not tell you how many times I have had to go up to the office again and again due to mistakes on there part.

To begin with, I was TRICKED into signing the lease here, thinking that I was just accepting the rules of the place in order to see what apartment sizes were available and what roommates were on the site (a total falsehood of information.) You have to sign the lease before getting into the website, they lie on the website and tell you that you get to choose your roommates which is a down right lie. They choose for you, and charge you a fee of $100 if you want to move to another apt. if you don't mash well.

People are constantly throwing parties and blasting music at 2am at night and I love the screaming/knocking on your window at odd hours of the night. Not to mention how bad the neighborhood is! My roommate got her car broken into, and I know there also have been a few break ins. The cops are constantly at the apartments around this place, and I have literally seen hookers walking down the street.

 You have to pay an extra $10 MONTHLY for PARKING! Yes, you have to PAY for parking where you LIVE in Las Vegas here. And while Yes they let you pay Rent by Credit Card over the website, and they charge you an extra $20 per transaction to do so.

 The rooms are small, the furniture is crap, the apartments are ridiculously overpriced, ($600 + per room for a two bedroom apt when you can get your own apt for that) and the place wasn't even clean when I or my roommates moved in.

DO NOT GET ROPED INTO LIVING HERE!!!!"
1,"Second time here and the second time it was lousy. We walked in and they said they would seat us in a minute. Then they gave the beeper to everyone that came in after us, and then started to seat them while we waited. I complained and they still seated people that came after us. They did not seat us until after I complained loudly to the manager on duty. Then after we were seated it was more than five minutes before they came to take our order.  I will not come back again and I don't recommend this place just because of the lousy service."
1,Constant garbage and dog feces on stairs and hall ways.  It will stay like that until you call and complain.  Will not renew my lease and wouldn't recommend living here to anyone.  People constantly digging in the trash and maintenance doesn't clean up the property.
1,"My husband and I stopped for take-out.  The first thing I notice is all the debris on the entry carpet.  The menu is set up so each dish (like orange chicken or sweet and sour pork) is served as a ""meal"" which specifically means they come with just rice. $40.00 later we walked out with 3 choices and enough rice to feed the all my neighbors, oh yes and 3 fortune cookies.  And unfortunately the food did not not taste good. It wasn't fresh (the Veges were transparent and limp) and the food was flavorless. Also, I felt like I was painfully dragging answers to my menu questions out of the employee."
1,Average wait time is 1h and the food is served slowly.    Have to wait for food all the time.   Food are always missing from orders.
1,"Ordered the congee with fish balls, beef fried rice, chow mein and a chicken ramen.  First thing we noticed is that the chow mein was the smallest we've ever seen. Quantity wise it wasn't good. The best dish was probably the beef fried rice but quite honestly, Congee Queen or Congee Wong is much better.

The service wasn't there as we had to get our own cutlery from the front.  The bill came up to about $37.  Food wasn't that good either.  The only good thing is that it's not as crowded as Congee Wing and Congee Queen.

We were still hungry.

The existing reviews for this place is accurate.

1.5 stars out of 5


I think"
1,I thought the machine seats were reserved for slot players. At least 50% people sitting were not playing. Management should look in to that losing lots of money.
1,"We walked in intending for a quick late dinner but didn't even stay to eat or even takeout. The rudeness of the waiting staff was unacceptable. We walked, was laughed at for some strange reason....only when we move to ask if we could be seated, we were told they were closed at 1030pm so no. To our confusion, we came in at 10:10pm was told they closed 1030pm but the outside was listed as closing at 11pm. If we were told politely, I would take an issue but I left super annoyed as the way we were treated especially when we braved a storm to get there. I will not be coming back!"
1,"At first it was like, Yes!  Chicken and Waffles....then I saw them slice the cake.  Yes, its airport food, but $7 for a tiny slice of cake?  Come'on.
Didn't even get a real piece... For $7, LoLo you can do better.

Will update the review after I try the chicken, but not high hopes so far.   Was so shocked had to review before I even took a bite.    Poor showing."
1,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!!

I bought a used 2006 Honda Odyssey from these folks with high hopes that this would be a great experience. They boast a ""Christian atmosphere"" because I guess it's owned by Christians. What a joke! 

My husband and I had just had our 3rd baby and our Nissan Versa wasn't cutting it size wise. So we bought the Honda. In the Last 12 months we have had at least $4000 in repairs and it's not over! Now we have an electrical issue and who knows if we will ever be able to track down that mess. Needless to say we were taken advantage of and are very, very dissatisfied with our experience. Now we are stuck in a van that is unreliable with 3 babies. Such a shame. If these people are going to rip off a family with a newborn they will rip off anyone. The only positive was that the service manager tried to ""help us"" by reducing the expense of putting a new AC unit in the vehicle 6 months after we purchased it. I know that there are risks with buying used but we were stuck with a total LEMON! A list of things that have gone wrong: in 12 months Replacement of AC compressor,  alternator, battery,  tires need replacing, bad automatic doors,  power steering, and now some kind of electrical problem no one seems to be sure of. 

I really wanted to like this place and for it to be ""our place"" to buy cars but that just wasn't the case. So, so, so disappointed. WE WERE SWINDLED!!!!!!"
1,"0 STARS.

Despite the negative reviews I wanted to experience a transitional apartment where I am off-campus but close enough to get to school in about 5 minutes. I have went through the tour with a leasing agent named Courtney. She explained that they had everything, individual rooms with bathrooms, cable, built in WiFi, 24/7 clubhouse, and a shuttle transportation to school. It was very convenient and it made it easier for us to have a set base price to pay each month ($531). I am an out of state student so Courtney explained that they were able to decrease my rent pricing if I were to not be present longer than 1 month (but was not true when I inquired leaving back home for 3 months later in the summer - Courtney lied). At the time, they appeared to be very accommodating and understanding. 

Moving in - terrible experience. My friends asked to be signed in a 4 bedroom unit but they put us in a 3 bedroom so before moving in we had to scramble to resolve that situation. I paid my first months rent along with the deposit fee, during the tour they tell you that the shuttle and clubhouse services is free but it is not, after signing the leasing papters, the $150 ""deposit"" fee actually went towards shuttle, club services, and renovation services. During our tour process our leasing agent did not explain that to us at all. There were a lot of things that she left out during the leasing process that we had to find out ourselves and just the first month living at rebel place I felt tricked. First impression of the unit is that some areas around our apartment were still dirty with trash laying around. We had to clean before moving our things in, which was such a hassle!

Living experience - this is an apartment complex targeted for college students, which means that there will be parties every weekend and a lot of loud neighbors. After every weekend the parking lot would be trashed (not blaming the mess on Rebel Place) but I am blaming them for not doing anything about the situation in the first place. They know that it is a college environment but they never thought to have better security or system of controlling the residential area. Cars has been damaged and broken into because of the lack of control, that shows you how much Rebel Place really cares for their residents. Securities are lazy, I used to go to the club house every night to study/ gym and I would see the security chillin inside of the clubhouse. If there's a security chillin all night then where's the protection and stability the residents may need if something were to happen?! The WiFi and service sucked, there were numerous times the internet would shut down and not work within the next 24 hours. Expect to have a lot of dropped calls, you could only have an actual conversation with someone when you step outside of your apartment. The mildew in the sink was so bad that through out the entire year I've put in a request to Rebel Place, they never came in to service it. There's a lot of random people from outside that come into the area and it is a bit scary. The gates are always broken because of random people coming in and out (referring to the security again) if they were attentive then things like that would be prevented. Their water is low quality it always left weird stains and a funky aroma on our dishes. Overall the entire year living here I always had to feel cautious and was really disgusted with the area. The only good part about Rebel Place was the convenience of being shuttled to and from school.

Moving out - thinking I had a relief away from this place, they sent me a move out statement charging me about $200 in cleaning/ touch up fee's. I know for a fact that the condition that I moved in was way more worse than the condition that I have moved out. I have cleaned everything inside and out in my room as well as the common area. Us cleaning the unit was better than the cleaning job that was done when we moved in so I did not understand why were we being charged the extra cleaning/ touch up fee's. This place just continues to charge people unnecessary fee's and it is ridiculous! $120 total for a ""paint touch up fee,"" for what? We left the paint in good condition, it literally still looked like as if we moved in. I called the office to help me understand specifically where in the unit the paint needed to be touched up but the leasing agent was ""not able to disclose that information to me."" I told her that I still had my move in condition form for proof but she said the manager will look over their copy to verify. I find it weird that they can't tell me what areas in our unit was not in good condition. 

Save yourself the headache and do not lease here. You could find better and cheaper areas than RP. If you are already moved in RP, good luck - be sure to take pictures and record the damages/ condition of your apartment for proof because they won't believe you. I don't think $500+ a month is worth it living here."
1,"Ordered BBQ pork with rice, half of the meat were full of tendon that I can't even eat it. When I told the Waitress, she said Cantonese people like BBQ pork with tendon (I spoke Mandarin to her).

In my head I was thinking what are you talking about, but I didn't argue with her and just decided not to come back."
1,"I would give this ZERO star if I could. 

Over priced food items. Inconsistent quality on food. One dish was flavourless while the other was too salty. 

Service was the worst. They give you dirty looks when you ask for a table. They give you 'tsk' snickers when you order your food because you almost couldn't decide between your family on what to get. Sounds like their staff are very impatient. 

Worst of all is they are friendly to regulars. 
Really? The food for a restaurant is only a small portion - don't forget about service and ambiance/environment!"
1,"I ordered 3 meals.I ordered puff Chicken.
 I was told it would take 10 minutes or more. Gave my name went to get coffee.
While I was gone the food was ready and they only gave my wife 2 if the 3 meals I paid for.
 When I return my wife said they did not have your meal. I Went to the counter the girl say what did you order.

I said I already paid. The girl said ok that will be 10 or more minutes.

I thought wow no I am sorry its on us for your inconvenience.

No I waited 10 more minutes.
So thats 20 plus minutes for a meal.
I was done with Ms. Whites and Lolo's for  The lack of being professional.
Ms Whites the cook was stressing out the Server. The server even said

 ""The cook is on one today
BLACK BUSINESSES DO MATTER.

Some of them need to come up."
1,"Same owner as Joe's BBQ,  just stay away and go somewhere better. The service is just as the other reviewers have said: it's subpar."
1,"I wish 0 zero stars were a possibility! This place is a shit hole. Management is the worst! I have lived here for over a year and a half. I hate this place with every fiber of my being. I regret 

I moved here from CA to goto UNLV, I did not have any family or friends to show me the ropes. So I moved here mainly for residency purposes and the shuttle, which are about the only good things about this place. 

The tanning pool had a syringe in it last summer. Maintenance has told me that people have shit in the elevators and their the ones that have to clean it. While my family was staying me, my little sister actually saw (human) shit on the 2nd floor. (Before pets were allowed.) Usually the parking lot is filled with trash, hallways are filled with vomit and/or blood.  Oh and top of all that luxury, they have nerve to nickel and dime you to death. Not to mention the walls are so thin you can hear other people poop and pee. 

It's employees call it ""ratchett place"" for a reason.  Their gate is bullshit, people sneak in ALL THE TIME. Outside the gate are hookers, pimps and crackheads. This is the GHETTO. 

So if you want to opt into a disgusting, grungy dump with the shittiest management. This is the place for you!

Signed, 
A current resident that cannot wait to get out."
1,"Came all the way from downtown. Food is better than the ones in dt. But TERRIBLE SERVICE. Be prepared to WAIT FOR MORE THAN ONE HOUR if you're going. 

By kept telling us someone is making the payment, they kept my group waiting for 1.5 hours standing at the door. Instead of an apology, the manager taught us to understand because it was busy when we were trying to tell him what has happened on us. 

Ok the story is we tried to book a table for 930pm and were told that it won't take long if we just show up at the store. Since there's usually not many large groups at that time, therefore a reservation is not necessary. 
They told us that there was only one group before us upon our arrival and kept telling us someone is making the payment and will leave SOON. We were not seated until waiting for 1.5 hrs. 
Just 30 mins later we were told that it was our last call. When we were trying to tell them what has happened, the ""manager"" came and said it's just really BUSY and you have to understand. When we asked for more ice-cream the manager told us that there is only four left. And those were for the other table beside us. Therefore we kindly saved the dessert for the others and left."
1,"If you want a Lo-lo's Chicken & Waffles experience, do yourself a favor and check out an in-town location. Having tried both the Scottsdale location and this one, I would definitely say that it felt like they were owned by two entirely different entities. 

The chicken was dry, but they tried to cover it up by soaking it up in their gravy. The side of vegetables (string bean?) we got looked like garbage. I have no idea how garbage tastes like, but I'm pretty sure if anything, I got a good idea of it from their side of vegetables."
1,"I originally scouted this place for our son. It's near the school. The buildings facade are recent and nice. It's gated. The tour makes you think it will be a great experience. Then, you move in. You unlock a door not knowing who is behind. The apartment in which you live is nothing like the one you see on the tour. The elevator is worn and smells. The halls aren't cleaned. The whole idea of community is quickly lost. It's more like run and hide, even within your unit. Management is unyielding and uncaring. Coming from LA, rents seemed great initially; but in reality with sharing an apartment with 3 strangers it is very costly past on comps. Concept great. Execution sucks!"
1,"Just a heads up for you soup lover, they are serving spoiled spring rolls and didnt do anything it has this awful smell and all they did is took it back and didnt say a word. WTF we could have been food poison. And still they ask for tips!!"
1,DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. They messed up our order. Then tried to charge us for their mistake. They said 30 minutes. 1hour later food came. It was missing a whole meal. When we called they said they would send one out. Then called back and tried to charge for their mess up. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!
1,"This was the worst place I have ever lived and im coming from a shitty community college. They are out to drain you off all you money and half the time all the ""amenities"" that they offer are broke or out of order. 

I only lived here for 6 months (thank god) and it was terrible. Within the first two weeks of moving in my moped (which was locked up) was stolen out of the parking lot. They said they could do nothing to help me out and the security guard, which is ether sitting in his car or on his phone said he didn't see anything. I wonder why??? lol this place is a joke. 

When I first moved in it was a last minute move in that I thought would be nice since its close to UNLV and didnt really do much research, which I should've. I soon found out that this place was terrible and I wouldve rather lived 30 minutes away than in this shit hole of a complex. 

PLEASE DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Stopped by tonight on the way home after seeing a movie at Red Rock.  They have never been spectacular but they were always okay.  Tonight was a big change.  Walked in and ordered 3 entrees and an appetizer.  Man at the register said 15 minutes.  Great!  walked around a bit with my wife and daughter and came back after 20  minutes.... not ready yet.  okay stuff happens sometimes.  after 30 minutes I start looking around and notice about three other people waiting looking very unhappy.  After I was there 40 minutes another customer who had ordered soup and fried rice started complaining about her 30 minute wait.  The girl behind the counter couldn't be bothered to listen and walked into the kitchen.  At this point i was waiting over 45 minutes and joined in asking for the manager along with another 3 customers.  He finally came out and was no help.  All he did was say "" I'm sorry""  but did nothing to assist any of us.
All of us complaining had ordered take out and one man asked the question ""if we had come in and sat down would it take this long to get served""  The managers answer was "" no""  This of course set everyone off.  finally got my order which had been sitting next to the cashier for 10 to 15 minutes.  Apparently i was supposed to figure out that it was sitting on a table out of view.  Manager just handed me the food like there was nothing wrong.  No compensation or anything resembling a sincere apology

Never going back to this bunch of losers and will tell all my friends to stay away as well."
1,"Went to this highly recommended hot pot place with 7 friends last night. The service was horrible. Only half of the food came. We kept ordering and the food kept NOT coming. At 8pm, the server had the guts to come tell us that it's time to leave (first seating 6-8pm). We told him that half the food we ordered never came and we kept reminding various servers. We were totally neglected. It seems like the restaurant's strategy is to drag on till the time is up and kick you out without providing the food.

This place is more expensive than most hot pot places. We expect better service and food quality. Service ... sucks. Most servers didn't know what they're doing. Unlike other hot pot places, the soup and drinks (most come with basic drinks) cost extra. The menu also lack luster, offering less choices than most hot pot places. If you're allergic to MSG, please stay away from this place. I drank buckets of water last night and so did my friends. 

The only plus is that the decor is better than most other hot pot restaurants. But the washrooms do need attention in terms of cleanliness. Will any of our party of 8 go back again? For sure NO! Do yourself a favour and stay away. On a side note, I have never been to this plaza, there is a nice and quiet T&T Supermarket there which I'll visit again."
1,The restaurant is not busy and they still forgot our order. It's macaroni. It takes 3 minutes to make.
1,Horrible Service!  Javier is a horrible bartender.  We have been to other PTs and Sierra's and have never experienced bad service like this.  Javier rarely came around to our side of the bar....and when he did I ordered a pinot grigio...he left and never came back!
1,"I was so excited to try the lo lo's at the airport! Having been to both locations in Phoenix I know how good their food is! There was 1 person in front of us when we ordered, and we got Yo mama(biscuits and gravy with an egg and potatoes) and a lil jay(a waffle, egg, and meat) and it came out to 35$$$ after drinks. Which was a lot but I thought it would be worth it. Just those took over 30 MINUTES! No other orders besides ours and the one in front of us came out. When we did finally get our food the biscuits were rock hard and both eggs were barely warm and extremely oily. I asked for a waffle as a replacement immediately after trying the biscuits and was told I would have it in 3 min. Another 10 min later it was still not ready and we had to catch our flight so I asked for some kind of compensation and they told me I could not have any kind of refund but I could have 2 containers of gummy bears. By far the worst service I have ever had and I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere from now on."
1,"It makes me really upset to have to write this follow up review, but in light of recent events my opinion of this dealership has completely changed, and I no longer feel comfortable recommending this place. 

So the scenario is, I purchased my most recent vehicle from Cardinale Way in August 2012. On April 13, 2013, I received a letter from a law firm stating that they had been contracted by Cardinale Way as debt collectors for an outstanding debt I owe the dealership. In looking over the paperwork they sent me, this ""outstanding debt"" is a $300 down payment that the dealership was suppossed to automatically deduct from my checking account the week after I purchased my car. Keyword here being ""automatically"". Apparently they never did this, and this entire time I've owned be car (8 months now) the dealership has never contacted or notified me that this debit never occurred. 

On top of everything, it is now 2 weeks later since having recieved this letter, and absolutely no one from the dealership has contacted me back to resolve this matter. I have left a voicemail with accounts receivable, left my issue on their Facebook page (to which someone commented, but they never actually called me to resolve the issue like they said they would) and I even called and spoke with their GM (who said he would get right on the issue and would call me back - it's now a week and a half later and nothing). 

Apparently no one at this dealership feels the need to be accountable for their customer's experience once they've sold them the car. 

I will not be returning to this dealership with my business, nor will I ever recommend them again."
1,"Update: Geena W. Sandy is one of the rudest people I have EVER had to deal with. I won't go in that office because every time I do nothing gets solved because she doesn't care and acts like you're the dumb one and its your fault. 

Also, there was a leak upstairs and it leaked down into my roomates room. maintenance was aware that it would leak down into her room but didn't think that they should notify us at all. So there was two huge wet spots. One in my living room and the other in my roomates room. And she told maintenance she wouldn't sleep here until they could tell her whether there's mold or not. They said they're gonna figure it out and handle the situation. They never came back until we emailed them 5 TIMES about the situation. So not only was my roomate paying for a room she couldn't sleep in they are knowingly putting our health at risk. Thanks rebel place."
1,"Tried to make delivery over the phone, girl could not understand me when giving my address. I would give numbers, she would rearrange the numbers, get my apartment number confused with my street number. gave up and hung up."
1,I have never seen an apartment staff handle issues with tenants more poorly. Do not live here. The place looks nice but a lot of things like towel racks are rickety and many of the pluses end up being a pain in the ass ie. the dish washer and washing machine are pieces of crap. They also charge you like $18 to pay rent online. I'm currently living with 7 people and an infant in a 4 bedroom apartment. I have complained twice and nothing has changed!
1,"DON'T COME HERE, IF YOU WANT TO BE DISCRIMINATED FOR BEING GAY!
I should expect it, coming in on Sunday night NFL. Full cock fest of straight men, what I didn't expect is when the group of guys kept point & laughing  at me and my man. The bartender was laughing & high fiving with them!!!' You obviously don't care about your guests our your life. As a bartender, you pay your bills with your tips yeah? Why take fucking sides? I was going to tip you FAT, as I work in the industry myself. Instead your lucky I gave you $4, my boy had to calm me down the whole time and it was a horrible horrible experience. So disappointed in this company! You were my go to bar, because of the level of customer service I get. 
Not anymore, I'm telling everybody not to come, specifically not THIS LOCATION."
1,"This used to be a go to place for us, but several months ago, we noticed a new manager.  He seems far more interested in hanging out than managing a restaurant.  Today was the last straw.  The same manager sat us, and we waited more than ten minutes.  No server approached us, and the manager was just shooting the breeze with his obvious buddies.  We won't be back.  Sad to say, because we really like the atmosphere.  Please let me know when you get rid of that horrible manager, and I'll be happy to give you another chance."
1,"very slow took 45 min for my dinner,found hair in my food,and the steak was poor,very bad.very unhappy."
1,"CONCERN FOR LACK OF SECURITY:

*Forgive the lengthy review but you MUST READ.* 

Updating my review because I am 6 months into my lease and realized how sucky security is here. I know it's located in the ghettos and that being on the first floor makes it an easy target for robbery and theft. However, I feel that there should be at least a security guard on duty during dark hours. I have seen none so far this winter break, and since it is advertised as a student living apartment complex, then we are at high risk of break-ins during the holidays and school breaks. The decrease in lights, residence on property, and cars in the parking lot gives away the fact that not a lot of residence are home during these times.

I've heard of my fellow residents being robbed during finals week, during christmas, and during the new years week (not just into their apartments but in their storage spaces as well, which are located in the hallways of every floor). Obviously nothing has been done thus far. May I also add that I woke up to 2 male suspects breaking my window screen and trying to lift my window open at 3am in the morning 2 days ago. Luckily I have personally secured it as best as I can and turned on my light to scare them off. Later that morning I found that a lot of the first floor window screens located on the back of the buildings were damaged and bent just as mine was. There really should be more light posts installed in the darker areas of the property.

One of my roomates called the office about the incident and all the guy had to say was to file a police report. How about comforting us that you will work out a better security plan?

Even during the school year when there is a security guard on duty, you can find him or her inside of the lounge area going on the computer or taking extended breaks. They walk around sometimes, and sometimes they're nowhere to be found. So I hope that management can straighten them out or hire more qualified security guards and/or installing motion sensored recording cameras on property.

Side note: Homeless people also do get in the property from hopping over the brick wall (thats probably how thieves try to come in as well), they would beg for spare change or look through each of the car windows in the parking lot. Thats super sketchy to me. 

I have contacted management with my concerns/suggestions and now awaiting for a reply and (hopefully) their plan of action to prevent future break ins. If not, I'm definitely updating my review again. 

Security is a number one priority in my books when it comes to living in any house or apartment. So this is the brutal truth as of right now and I hope that I, nor any other resident, wakes up to a burglar trying to break in or come home to find precious valuables missing. Management should know it's better to be safe than sorry."
1,"I've been having many issues with my vehicle since I bought it in 2015. After multiple dealerships, I thought Cardinale Way would help. Nick was a wonderful service advisor, but they were unable to solve my issues involving braking malfunctions.

They actually told me to ignore my car's warnings when it tells me I'm about to have a collision when it was being triggered sporadically with nothing in the path of the car.

I reached out to Mazda corporate regarding the lack of resolution from the dealer and during a conference call between me, Mazda corporate, and the dealer service manager, Jerry, things got a little heated although no vulgarity or name calling was used in any way. This resulted from Jerry refusing to answer basic questions. Jerry disconnected from the call and now refuses to service the car because he's apparently ""too uncomfortable"" to work with me, even though I've been polite and courteous on all my visits. In my opinion, Jerry is acting inappropriately. I don't think they want to deal with the problem because they'd rather pass the buck. And I certainly don't want to waste my time on a dealership that isn't willing to fix a practically brand new vehicle. Even Mazda corporate expressed disappointment in their supposed ""discomfort"" in working with me again.

Definitely do not recommend this dealership to anyone. Take your business elsewhere. I know I will be."
1,We live in the neighborhood and eat here frequently.  No more.  The service has become so poor.  Nasty women acting like they have better things  to do than take our order  Our last trip to Sierra Gold was to talk about using them as a venue for our Christmas party.  Thank goodness Parkway Tavern opened.  Food is delicious.  Service is incredible.  SIERRA Gold could learn a lot from them
1,"All I can say is bad service. Yes this is probably the cheapest dumplings you can find, but is it worth bad service? I used to come here a long time ago then stopped coming because of poor service. I thought I'd give them a try again and it was a mistake. It's just as bad. I'd rather spend my hard earned money where they treat you better."
1,Over the phone the term professional doesn't exist. What happened to customer service?  Their attitude portrayed to be only in their best interest. I would never consider giving them my hard earned money.
1,"I would not EVER  recommend somebody to live here ! The longer you live here the more you pay! They don't inform you when somebody is moving in, they have so many hidden fees that they will find to charge you with, they have random people walking around that don't live there and my OWN safety was at risk; which management did nothing about. 

Only thing positive I can say about this place is that they have a shuttle to and from UNLV but that is all, you pay so much for a little area that is about a size of a walk in closet and they always messed up the utility bill ! 

And when it comes to moving out expect to be charged for things they are supposed to do when they have new tenants moving in; Ex. painting and cleaning, makes me question if they even cleaned up before I moved into this hell hole! 

OOOOOh ! and most importantly they have the worst roach problem ever!!! They sent a bug guy out bout three times and he did nothing but make a mess and I had to go through my own ways to get rid of the nasty things and when I asked to be moved somewhere else they wanted me to pay but happily moved out two other girls charge free.

NOT fair, NOT clean, NOT a place to want to live ever!"
1,"I picked this hot pot place based on Blog To's listing and I have to say this is my most underwhelming hot pot experience in Toronto. The service is non existent. To give you a few examples I had to keep reordering the same items because it never came, the orders never come in full and always have missing items, the empty plates are left on the table and sat there for the whole duration of the meal, the server would acknowledge you but walk away from your order. Best of all I was given the glass bottle Diet Coke when I asked for ""Coke"" for which happens to be a more expensive item on the menu. I am not sure if it's coincidental but it makes one doubt that action. It would be apparent that the server made an assumption rather than clarifying what's wanted. I had to ask for water when that Is the basic for all restaurants. The only positive experience is that there is one server who is enthusiastic to come around and provide what I would consider a rarity in this restaurant - be attentive to your customer. However that's one server out of the many that works there. 

Aside from that the food was sub par. Everything tasted the same and the sauce were nothing special. It felt like I was simply shoving food down just to get full. It's a 2 dimensional salty or spicy. 

For $73 for two there are lot of other options to choose from. The price is certainly on the high end for a completely lack of service and sub par food. I really don't see what they are trying to sell you. I would expect a certain level of quality with the ingredients but I guess it couldn't be bothered. 

It is evident that I cannot recommend this place. Take your money elsewhere to avoid the frustration and let down."
1,"This ""WAS"" the best Chinese food around but recently Management/Ownership has changed. Food doesn't taste the same. We use to eat here 1-2 month and order the same thing every time so we know when something has changed. Tonight completely different look, taste and different people. Pot stickers were defiantly bought not freshly made. We will never eat here again. Really disappointing."
1,"The 5 of us waited over an hour for our food. My mac n cheese looked like they gave me the scorched part that they scraped from the pan before they washed the pan. The potatoes were actually a grayish color, the chicken tasted nasty. I sent my food back. Didn't eat. Sent corporate 2 emails - they never responded. Smh

Won't go back."
1,"Service is not to the same standard as the other locations. For the setup of this location, one would think that the quick order walk up bar implies a faster meal. Nope. The staff should alert travelers who order anything that would take longer than 5 minutes to prepare (like the 'Fat Azz Sandwich') as it's located IN AN AIRPORT. 

After the dry, flat, uninterested girl at the register took our order, she read it back (as she was clearly new, which I appreciated) allowing us to correct her...again. After waiting 10 minutes, we asked about the status of the order and were told the sandwich takes 15 minutes. While our other 2 dishes say waiting... 

Finally, the food arrives... aaaand was incorrect. They swiftly made the change but looked at me like I had 3 heads when I asked for honey. ""No, we don't have honey...?"".The also-frustrated patron behind me said ""you have cornbread, how do you not have honey?"" An employee lingering near the counter/employee door said rudely ""who puts honey on cornbread!?"" (He may have not been a Lolo's employee, his black hat and shirt had white logos. Clearly Lolo's management didn't mid him being there) 

The Joes BBQ looks to be a faster alternative. And they have honey."
1,"I wasn't in a big hurry to board my plane home so I decided to try this instead of the barbecue place next door. I suppose, in retrospect, the lack of a line should have been a clue. 

Food wise it was decent. The chicken was actually very good but could have used some more spice to it. Then again, this is southern style. It was crispy and the meat juicy. The waffles were soggy and nothing to write home about. 

The service was atrocious I ordered and gave them my name, paid (too much, but airport fare so it's acceptable) and then waited, waited, and waited some more. The counter clerk came out and called for another name repeatedly but it wasn't mine. I drank my drink and read FB and waited some more. Finally I realized that my plane was going to board in 15 minutes and I still had to clear security and had no food. I walked up to the counter and asked if my food was ever going to be ready and the clerk told me it had been ready and why hadn't I come and gotten it. I told her they never called my name and she blamed the cook in back. She obviously recognized me and I was sitting about 15-20' away. She could have tapped me on the shoulder or called out what the order was but she didn't. I didn't have time to complain to the manager, but I somehow suspect they wouldn't have cared either. 

Avoid if you don't want crappy customer service."
1,"Food was ok, drinks were good, but when I ordered a Mint Julep I was only poured about a third of a drink. Not like, ""less than a full drink to allow the ice to melt"", but a solid two or three sips worth. When I brought it up to my waitress she assured me ""that's how we pour 'em"", despite the fact that my three friends were later poured FULL glasses. Drink wasn't comped, wasn't offered an apology. Poorly handled. The two sips of julep were pretty good though."
1,"This place is definitely not student living, they'll take anyone who offers to pay up. Some of the worst management around. Maintenance request are a pain in the ass, mind they took over a month to get dryer fixed. Extremely dirty, once you get through the gate it's a whole other story compared to the first building and front office! And be ready for all the unknown charges at the end of the month. Lost mail. Cars constantly get towed. There's countless thing that make me regret living here. If they didn't lock you in with the lease I'd say you'd be better off staying at Siegel Suites for almost half the price!"
1,Update: our air conditioner broke today. They didn't come fix it today so I have sleep in heat thanks rebel place .
1,"Decent Americanized Chinese but Rude ""Service""

We live very close to this and it's one of the only Chinese places in our area, so we stopped in to eat in or takeout a couple of times with so-so results. For dining in, the food is usually pretty good but the service is extremely casual and slow - and there is a major language barrier as English is not the first language of any of the employees. Takeout, pretty much the same. The last two times, we ordered delivery and had such a poor experience that I will never patronize this establishment again.

The first delivery, the food arrived quickly, but they forgot the white rice that comes with one of the dishes. We called and they said it would take at least 45 minutes to get the rice to us (bear in mind we literally live 3 minutes from the restaurant, and we are talking about WHITE RICE, which they scoop up already made from a giant vat), and asked if we would prefer to get a credit for the order to use next time. We said OK since we didn't want to wait and figured it would be easier to make our own rice. I asked if we needed anything to get the credit and she said no, it would be in their system.

The next time we called, we asked about the credit and they had no record of it (and did not honor it), even though they were able to pull our name and address info up with our phone number. Ok, whatever, we were hungry so we ordered anyway. The food took forever to arrive - probably over an hour. The food was quite dry and fairly cold, but my expectations for delivery are never very high. I then pulled out my Hot & Sour Soup to find that it was actually Wonton Soup. I was disappointed as I figured that at least that would be good (and I do not care for Wonton Soup), so I called to tell them. At first, the incredibly rude woman said, ""Are you SURE that's what you ordered?"" I said, ""Yes, of course. I have never ordered Wonton Soup in my life."" Then she says in a snarky tone, ""Well, that's why we always read the orders back to you, to make sure it is correct."" And I said, ""Well, it was my husband you spoke to, but I heard him order Hot & Sour, and he says you DID repeat Hot & Sour back to him. AND, the last time we ordered from you, you also made a mistake and..."" she then cuts me off ""Well see, it is your fault then, it is your husband if this happened twice, and I cannot take responsibility for that!"" Obviously at this point it is getting heated, and I say, ""No! YOU forgot the white rice last time. There's no way that's our fault.""  So this bickering goes on for several minutes until I finally say, ""So are you saying you're not going to take responsibility for this?"" And she responds, ""No, I am not going to take responsibility."" And I say, fine, I will never order from you you again."" And she actually replies with ""Fine."" And then we both hang up!

Let me just say here, I am not a difficult customer. I worked in foodservice for 10 years when I was younger, I always tip very well, and I am quite forgiving when things happen that are out of people's control. But I have NEVER in my 38 years been treated so poorly by someone who is in the SERVICE industry. I did not get her name, but I can avow, I will NEVER eat at China Tango again."
1,"I do not take writing poor reviews lightly, but this was an absolute disaster. Ordered takeout. Sesame Chicken and Thai Chicken Curry.  You would think with a place called SESAME Inn the Sesame Chicken would be delicious. It was inedible. It was a DRY (NO SAUCE- and I mean NONE) breast of chicken sliced into strips with about 10 sesame seeds on it. We live about 35 mins round trip....I call the restaurant and try to explain. Put on hold for OVER 6 minutes finally hang up call back. No apologies. NOTHING. Have to drive ALL the way back to get something else. Again. No apology or any type of compensation. Any goodwill gesture would have been appreciate as I have eaten Sesame Chicken at dozens of restaurants and never has it looked like Dry Sawdust chicken fingers.  This was a complete fail. We will not be back."
1,I have been here since 500pm.  It's almost 630pm.  Food order taken one hour after I got here.  The waitress just came by.  She forgot my order.  So we have to place the order again. Never coming back. By the way the beers are $20.
1,"My husband ordered chicken, and it was raw in the middle.  The waiter apologized and got a new plate made.  But this kind of health risk shouldn't be tolerated in a restaurant.  The other food and cocktails  were ok but definitely not worth returning."
1,"Our group of three came here for lunch since we were in the area. 2 of us ordered the all day special that includes a sandwich, noodle soup and a drink. The third person opted for a rice dish on their menu ( pork chop and chicken steak on rice with a cream sauce). 

The first sandwich came before we got any tea or our drinks or even any cutlery at all. We had to ask for them before they gave it to us. Even then, they didn't even give us the correct cutlery for our meal. Both the noodle soup came before the second sandwich got here. The drinks for our meals finally came afterwards. 20 mins later we were still waiting for the rice dish. By then, the two noodle soups were already finished. I should mention that there was another single customer sitting next to us. When the rice dish finally arrived it went to him first. We told the server that we ordered a rice dish too and we were pretty sure that was ours since the customer just arrived 5 mins ago. She asked us if we ordered this dish in Chinese and we asked for a menu to tell her. She ended up getting the receipt saying it's for table 19a (our table). Then she told us to remember what we ordered next time to avoid the confusion... The service was terrible and the food was mediocre. The soups were bland not worth mentioning at all. The one star is for the milk tea which was pretty decent.

$30 for 3 people. We had to ask for the bill twice and they kept confusing the tables."
1,"You should change your website then to ""fill out a profile and we choose for you"" instead of telling us that we get to choose our roommates. You also might want to get your paperwork in order instead of canceling someones entry card because they have two out when it was your office that failed to document giving them a new card since the first one didn't work. So they don't come home at 2 am and can not get in. Or every time you go down to the office there is a sign on the door saying out or party without any notice to the residents. Everything is a charge. 

As far as the neighborhood, how about something called noise control? And for all that security you hire cars are still getting broken into. Oh and if you don't pay a parking fee you have to ""sign in"" as a visitor.   Seriously, get over yourself Rebel Place."
1,"If you see a used car that seems like a good deal, BEWARE.  It's going to be trashed.

What you will get is a banged up car that has no business being at a car dealership.

They need to accurately disclose the condition of the vehicle rather than wasting everyone's time."
1,DO NOT LIVE HERE. Everything about it is terrible. They just try to get your money. Terrible management. It's seriously a joke. Don't waste your time or money
1,"I won't be coming here again.  The prices are ridiculous and that older man is rude.   23.00 for 3 pieces of chicken and fries, with a side of mac & cheese. Can't forget the kool-aid!   The mac & cheese cost 4.50 and it's in a little cup. It was dried up and maybe from the day before.   Such a disappointment."
1,"I literally just walked out of the establishment. I was willing to give it a shot. The moment I walked in, I was not greeted, so that was the first red flag, they basically looked at me like ""what can we do for you"" I had to basically say the first word and said it's just me. Second the place was somewhat full so I expected that they may not have a table, the hostess didn't catch her name but she look to me like she's foreign like Sri Lanka or India. She grabbed a menu and just started walking towards the dining area, I requested a booth she said there's non available and before I can point at a table which would of been perfect instead she was out of my sight and was in another section of the restaurant with just the tables... I noticed she tried to put me crammed in the back next to some random group of over weight woman. Plus the table was next to a window with the sun glaring through it. I then asked her politely if I can just sit at the main dining area even though it's a table for 4, I get it that they may want to save that in case a bigger family shows up but I fought it because the close Lunch at 2pm and this happened around 1:15pm and they still had plenty of bigger tables available. The way she responded when I asked her if I can sit some where else is the main reason I walked out. She was hesitant to give me a straight up answer. she said ummm not really! Are you serious, if a guest of your restaurant request a certain dining seating you do it if it's available. Too bad I didn't get to try their food, I'm sure it would of been great. To the owner of the Restaurant please discipline this individual and have her clean dishes rather than be a hostess. She needs more training in customer service. Maybe I may try out the restaurant with a date next time but for now, I'll just try this other restaurant that serves Dim Sum."
1,"I've had packages delivered to the office but the office failed to call me to pick it up (this happened on four occasions). Also they don't give warnings to when they will be doing fire alarms for buildings or high water power cleaning outside of our doors. When they did the water power cleaning, the water seeped through our door, getting our shoes wet. Also when you put in a work order for your home (e.g water leaking from your kitchen sink, ac vent leaking) the maintenance workers will not come until the following day because they do not deem it as an ""emergency."" However, if this service is included in my rent then EVERYTHING should be deemed as an emergency & should be fixed right away before any damages occur in the apartment complex. Also management did not print out a copy of my lease; I had to ask for one. Most apartment complexes give you a copy of the lease for your personal use and I found it strange that they didn't give one without being asked. I also question where the money goes because I live in a three bedroom apartment and each of us pay about $600-640 and that's PER bedroom that's about 1,800 for the whole unit when a two bedroom apartment around this area is about the price of just a single room at rebel place. Rebel place lures us in with all these benefits but once you're in, you'll see that the so called benefits aren't even that worth it."
1,"Disappointed.  Always enjoyed the Jones location and was happy to see a Henderson location open.  Went in tonight for the first time, around 9:30 pm.  We were greeted by the bartender, who told us we could seat ourselves anywhere we liked. We did so, at a table clearly visible to the bar. We sat there for over ten minutes, watching the staff walk around, chat and socialize...and we weren't acknowledged again. No menus, no ""I'll be right over""...just a few glances in our general direction but no effort to provide any sort of service. No one said a word as we got up and walked out.  Drove over to Hash House A Go Go,  and were acknowledged by four or five different staff as we waited for our order.  Someone had their act together tonight, and it wasn't Sierra Gold :("
1,"ALLLLRIGHT I honestly gave CardinaleWay 3 chances. 

September 2012, I bought a used Mazda at another dealer. Since previous services were done here at the CardinaleWay Mazda Mesa store, I thought what the heck, lets get it checked out. I called them up and emailed them asking about how much it would be to inspect the car as if they were going to sell it and tell me any problems that needed fixing. Fine and dandy. The gentleman in the email replied with we can do that for free. Cool! I bring my car down, and ask the person (whose name was the same man who emailed me back on his shirt.) just to be sure I'm not going to pay anything for this inspection until I get a repair. The man says, it's $100+. I don' remember the exact amount at the moment... He quotes me this price, and I leave. Strike one.

Fast forward to this past month. I emailed CardinaleWay Mazda Peoria (i know this isn't the same one, but it's owned by the same people.) The man and I go back and forth about a car I'm interested in. I express I know I have negative equity and would be willing to buy a car if they could accommodate my current payment amount or lower. I get an answer which sounds positive, appraise my car blah blah blah... I'm getting ready to come in... And I get told my payment is super low for a 11 year old car, and I'd be hard pressed to get something lower on any car? Okay what? Strike Two

Strike three comes when I visited this store tonight. They were eager to sell this car to me a 2008 mini cooper S. I had been approved for several other cars at a little higher prices than I wanted to pay. I knew what I could afford and how much it would be. I go in with decent expectations knowing they may turn me down for what I want... but they didn't even want to work with me. As I said, I had been approved for more expensive cars (including another used mini). The guy pretty much tells me they can't do anything... at all... two dealers were able to pull strings and get me within a few hairs length of a deal on other cars including another used and comparable mini which is great... this dealer couldn't get me anything at all... They told me at the beginning they had a second buyer lined up, and after a few minutes of talking I could tell they didn't want to wheel and deal... It's clear they thought they'd get more for the car out of someone else... and treated me like a number on a paper..."
1,"READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE GOING ! ----------   AGAIN... PLEASEEEE READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE ENTERING THIS PLACE! Now that i have taken the time to yelp the restaurant i realize I should have read the reviews first, before entering this place. 

I wish That i hadn't gone in there with my family this afternoon. Worst Viet restaurant ever. This place is filthy and the service is horrible. Take into consideration that I was in a good mood walking into this place. Walking in i saw dust bunnies- all around the first set of doors but I figured hey, leettss see whats inside, Im hungry. My initial reaction was - Cool not dirty at all.. again were hungry, lets eat !

-Portions are good.
- Chicken fried rice turned into fried rice with chicken on top COOL BUT the rice was very moist in oil. 
- (L)arge Chicken pho; broth was actually not bad at all BUT barely any chicken. (mostly just skin and fat.. ewwwww) 
- Spring rolls were alright..BIG but just alright
- Chicken wings were horrible. Way too much flour was used. 7/8 wings weren't eaten. I'm surely glad i didn't get a (L)arge bowl, like the waitress told me.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Didn't get to pick our own seats; lady quickly hollered for us to go where she pointed -_- 
- Waiter did not greet us after hollering at us where to sit! No eye contact at all.. but did however serve us WARM TEA--
-Table of 6 got 2 menus .. OKAY that's interesting.
-  After getting our food we asked for 2 small bowls and 2 forks. I swear that task took the life out of our waitress like it was to much of a trouble to do. We were even hesitant to ask for a small plate so that the rice could be shared. GOSH
- When we told her our wings weren't good she seemed so defensive. LIKE CHILL! We'll pay for them but remember THE WINGS ARE NOT GOOD, TOO FLOURY and PALE IN COLOR!
- Oh yeah did i mention that they don't know english or even try. They were all just so rude and continued to talk amongst themselves, especially after that complaint.
- What a horrible meal.. As I went to the front to pay I told the lady I had had a terrible time being there.. she said in a very rude tone ""then don't come back if you don't like it."" WHAT? like I can hear a friend blunty saying this but the cashier?? the face of the restaurant, really? 
UGH NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK! WORST $53.60 EVER SPENT !!"
1,"This place has everything; sandwiches, baked rice, noodle, congee, dim sum... you named it, they have it ........... Was it good?!  Nope........ I came here twice.  I had a beef brisket noodle the first time.  The beef was not tender,  the soup was bland and not hot.   Came here again for a late lunch and had a pork cutlet with fries.  They served me the thinnest, driest and toughest pork cutlet.  I don't think even a Shun knife would have that cutability to cut it into pieces.  Would we go to a restaurant that serves everything but don't have anything good?"
1,"Ordered takeout from Sesame Inn.  Food was horrendous.  Lettuce tasted like it had dirt on it.  Frankly, the only thing edible was the egg roll.  Way too expensive for the bad food you get."
1,"I've been working with Zach for the past month on locating a vehicle. Understand that I work a lot, in between the office and home it is hard to go down to the dealership in person. At first I was hesitant to run my credit because of it lowering my score and not having all the specs of the deal in order first. So this morning I ran my credit, got approved. We finalized the deal over the phone. I have texts to prove it. As I'm logging out of work and literally on my way to finalize the deal I get a text from Zach, ""turn around vehicle sold.""  Talk about being unprofessional, and screwing me over it is ridiculous. Their excuse was someone walked in and they beat you. Um excuse me?! They beat me?  Did you run their credit, have all the figures in order?! No! You didn't. This is the most unprofessional experience ever. On top of that they sold the vehicle without completing the Honda Air Bag recall. I will never do business here.  Management is a joke. Bunch of liars."
1,"Racist place to go for hotpot. If you are not from China and cannot speak Mandarin , don't expect to get a table to sit until every chinese has been served. Waited for 2.5 hours to complain and they kept telling us that it's too crammed and that there's no table for us. 

Confused and very unimpressed .."
1,"Busy, but seated quickly. Unfortunately that was the only good thing. Took over an hour for food to arrive and it was not hot- tepid at best. Waitress was absent. Dropped off salads and left. But we couldn't eat the salads because we were not given silverware. Had to wait for server to finally come back and she made a snarky comment that the hostess should have given us silverware. Finally dropped off entrees after an hour and left. Didn't come to check on us or the food or get drink refills. Hungry so ate a bit of the food. She came back with the check, which had items we ordered but didn't receive. Had to have her correct the bill and tell her she would have known about this and the food temperature if she had come to check on us. Paid over $60 for food we boxed up to bring home and will give to our dogs."
1,"I have been going here for over 10 years , during the last two years I have noticed a difference in the service and the food  has deteriorated . I used to boast about this place , not any more the food quality has gotten poor not worth the price and is either under cooked or greasy . The bartenders are 90% female who have obviously not been trained in customer service and just expect to be tipped for just being there . ( occupation ornaments) . Your just gonna stay thirsty ..... Good luck trying to get there attention ."
1,This past week was my first time in Sierra Gold. I thought it was nicer than your average PT's or anything like that and I actually enjoyed it. I sat at a table with a couple of friends but the server wasn't present for at least 15 mins after I got there so I obviously went up to the bar to get numerous drinks. Didn't think too much of it and got my second round at the bar as my friends payed their server who wasn't present at all. Then as my friends and I were going to play pool the server approached us about not tipping her well. I felt that was very inappropriate especially in that type of place. We decided against playing pool and left and now I don't plan on going back because I don't want to be set up for failure again. Such bad service and I won't recommend going to any of my friends.
1,"Wish I could warn everyone individually by giving 0 Stars. Worst experience ever. Nightmare on Elm Street. Please do not buy a used car from this company or you will be screwed. Two days after buying my car I noticed my brakes were squeaking extra loud , manager tells me this is normal for Arizona even on a luxury car. One month later my car is in the shop getting a brand new transmission. For the price I paid I could have bought a new one"
1,"I took the risk of moving in after reading the reviews as the property is now managed by Peak Campus, and I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt.

It all started a week before move-in day, where we received emails demanding first month's rent a week earlier than the date listed on the lease because no one would be on site to take payments that day. Then on move-in day walking into an unfinished apartment with pieces of furniture and appliances strewn about. 

While management did their best to rectify the situation, with my roommate (they continually tried to exclude me and hide the situation), it was a sign of things to come. 

Despite having a half-full parking lot on the busiest of nights residents are still required to pay a parking fee, and we are not allowed visitors unless we get them passes during business hours. So, make sure you plan all visits far in advance, and be prepared to be harassed by staff about how many visitors you've had recentaly. Just say no to spontaneity! 

We were originally given gate codes and access badges. Then all our gate codes were deleted and we're forced to have $75 access badges on us at all times. They sent out an insensitive letter vaguely referencing the October 1st shooting, and citing our safety for the changes. That's right folks, they used a tragedy to increase chances of profiting off of students more than have. Also, this means NO food deliveries unless you want to walk to the front gate.

There's a lot of ""24-hour"" notices about things like inspections that only show up on the door a few hours before happening. The latest is threatening a large fee if management has to come check your extinguisher if you don't bring it down to them which you can only do during times most of us are at school or work. Sure, skip a final this week to make sure Peak Campus doesn't get another dime out of you. But when has a breach of contract ever been an issue here? Make sure you save those notices and document dates they were received and keep a running document of all the times they have violated their own lease!

The washer has been broken for months, roof in the bathroom is leaking, maintenance requests have no meaning here, and staff gets defensive when it's brought up.

There's usually a party in the hallway at least twice a week. So if you hate quiet, this place is perfect for you.

Peak Campus has no problem exploiting struggling students and will continue to do so. They care about one thing: Profits.

And when we're paying over $1,400/mo for a two bedroom (two rooms at $680 + parking fees + high service fees), I would kind of like management to do better.

If you're a struggling college student, you can do better for the price. The proximity to campus isn't all that worth it."
1,"Went there the other night with friends in the beginning the service wasn't horrible but it seemed as soon as the rest of our party started to arrive the server seemed less present and more irritated. Only two of my friends ordered food and the other three of us only had about two drinks each. Two of my friends were waiting so long to put their drink order in that they gave up and just ordered at the bar and brought their drink back. Also right before happy hour ended we put two drink orders in and the server responded with ""okay I'll put your order in but it probably won't be happy hour anymore"" my other friend stated we still had like 5 minutes and she replied ""well I guess I'll run"". With a very unpleasant attitude! Of course when it came time to bring us our tabs she was very pleasant in that moment. We all payed separately so we each tipped accordingly keeping the service we received in mind. She probably got a fifteen dollar tip total for the whole table which I think  is pretty good for the service we received especially since it was just a table of 5. Well after paying we headed for the pool tables almost immediately after she approached us. She actually had the nerve to ask us what she did wrong and why we didn't tip her more! She told us she was really upset that we tipped her so low.. I was so shocked it was ridiculous and unprofessional It really made me wish I hadn't left a tip which was just a courtesy really. In the end we felt uncomfortable because all the bartenders and servers were staring at us  so we ended up leaving and most of us agree that we won't be returning to that location."
1,The service department at this dealership is awful. We purchased a used vehicle from Cardinale in April. Last week I called inquiring about getting our free first oil change that they promised when we purchased the vehicle which they now refuse to honor. Today I tried to bring my vehicle in for an oil change and was greeted by Nick. He told me they couldn't get an oil change done today and was irritated that I even showed up. Why do you offer express services if you just tell people to go away? He was short and rude and I will not be bringing my vehicle back here in the future.
1,"Usually I do not expect much service from a ""HK Style"" tea house but this one is exceptionally bad, to a point I felt irritated. Food was just ok. The only thing worth mentioning is a cleaner than normal bathroom.  Many good choices close by that I will definitely by-pass this one."
1,I called right away to the staff and they told me how they were on lunch. Even if they were on lunch it should of been taken care of before. Trash is constantly flying around this place. Pictures don't lie
1,"Yep, they are still calling. I called back and talked to someone who claimed to be the general manager.  Told him I would be calling a lawyer if they called again and also filled a complaint with the BBB asking them not to call and for an official apology for their harassment.  Got a note back saying that they wouldn't contact me again. No apology. Guess that will have to do."
1,My chicken was bloody and they told me that all of their roasted chicken is pink and has blood. Do not eat here.
1,If I could give this place no star I would. The customer service as absolutely awful. They are rude and lack the ability to be professional. They bill you for things that you put down as a problem when you did the initial walk through. The living space you get is smaller than a hotel room. The furniture is not up to the standers they advertise in the tour. I could go on and on. Don't waist your time or money. Also it's in the ghetto my apt was broken into the gates don't make it safe.
1,"This place doesn't take credit card as indicated on their page. Our bill was $261 before tax. I gave $320 cash. The cashier had the nerve to come over and asked for more tips. (Who does that?!) I said I would definitely be happy to tip more if they would take my credit card but of course they refused. 

For their price, there are much better hotpot restaurants in Richmond hill that come with lobster. I would never return to moral village again and will not recommend it to anyone."
1,"Ewwwww this is an update to my previous review, but I am NEVER going back here because it was actually forced CLOSED for a period because they failed their Dinesafe certification: 2 crucial infractions including failing to protect food from contamination and food promise maintained in manner permitting health hazard... and their service really sucked anyway"
1,"Overpriced items and small portions. Unfriendly inattentive waitresses. Manager made me and my friend leave the bar saying we had to gamble (even though he did). 10 mins later her and her friend have lunch in our spots and the manager didn't gamble at all. Bad customer service, expensive mediocre servings, and boring older local crowd all around."
1,"My best suggestion is that if you are looking for good Chinese food, this isn't the place to go.  The tip off should have been when arriving just before 7pm on a Saturday night, the throngs of blue hairs leaving from their dinner.

Waited 20 minutes for a seat (not the worse by any means), but then was promptly seated in the bar for dinner by a cold drafty window where everyone else waiting for their tables congregated.  Essentially not very nice ambiance nor were the hosts very accommodating to the request of a place elsewhere.

The meal was very disappointing to say the least.  Appetizers took 45 minutes to reach the table and when they did they were cold.  The wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food.  Mind you the initial waitstaff disappeared after the appetizers were served, then followed by 3 others who too were nowhere to be found when needed.  The main courses were completely bland and calling it Chinese was a very loose interpretation.  What was supposed to be a sizzling dish, sizzled for approximately one minute and then lost heat  very quickly.

In a nutshell, if you have every eaten Chinese food outside of Wisconsin and in a large metropolitan area such as Chicago, New York, etc.,  this is not the place to go. The restaurant appears to cater to those who most likely have never traveled 20 miles outside the town they grew up in and find cheese curds the ultimate appetizer."
1,"Been there a couple of times at the urging of friends at work.  This last time going there will be my last time.  The waiter was especially rude today.  I ordered the hot and sour soup.  

He brings me a egg drop soup and I said ""oh I ordered the hot & sour soup"" and he replied ""No you didn't"".  Both my friends fired back and confirmed that I did in fact ask.

He begrudgingly swapped my soup.  Then when the food arrived my plate was suspiciously late and last to be served.  After the meal my stomach immediately began to gurgle.

Back at work I was in the restroom for awhile if you catch my drift.  I know that waiter did something to my food because my stomach only gurgles when I get food poisoning or when I have the flu.

This place is a joke and I expect a new food establishment there in the near, near future."
1,"Honestly, Rebel Place is the worst experience of my life. My friend and I did read the reviews prior to signing our lease & moving in; however we decided that we would give Rebel Place the benefit of the doubt considering it was under new ownership. 

Obviously, changing the ownership made no difference. The new management team working under Peak Campus are all incompetent, inconsiderate, and negligent individuals. Of the many horrid experiences we've endured, I think the worst so far is the situation I am currently in. It recently rained in Vegas, and I was awakened at 6am to rain drops on my arm. The rain had somehow found its way in my room and was gradually ruining my walls and eating up the wood.

On the day I moved in, I noticed there were stains and chipped paint in the same corner that the current leak and occurred, but when I told management about my findings they assured me it was ""old paint."" Now that I realize that this rain issue has probably occurred before (which will explain the stains and chipped paint) I decided, along with my roommate, to confront management about the issue. They reacted by sending maintenance to put six loud, heavy duty, industrial fans in my tiny room. I was instructed that these fans must remain on and running for a series of days to prevent mold. 

Once they've decided that the fans were not working a week later, they decided to knock out half of the walls in 
my room and a piece in my living room. I am currently forced to sleep in a room with barely any insulation, and a window with no blinds, as well as a huge and loud dehumidifier.

I just left the office to ask where they expect me to stay until the repair is complete and the manager literally said ""this is not our fault; there are FIFTEEN other residents going through the same thing. Bare with me."" I was also told that I was still responsible for rent regardless of the fact that half of my room is missing and my belongings are spread throughout this little apartment. 

Rebel place does have its perks, like the shuttle bus, or the fact that it is fully furnished. I know that sounds convenient; but when you take into account that you're paying about $700 for a BEDROOM per person, barely have access to guest parking, deal with rude and inconsiderate management, live in filth, and get charged for simply breathing, the shuttle bus and 1982 furniture just doesn't seem to suffice.

My advice is to NOT lease with Rebel Place. Please read reviews and do yourself a favor. I've heard even worse stories and also witnessed several negative situations with this place. The rent is overpriced and not worth it at all. Do not do it."
1,"This place is going downhill and needs to be closed down. This hotpot use to attract people for its individual pots rather than shared pots. Now, a group of four has to share one pot. I'm not saying that that's the only reason for this low review. The service is horrible, the waiters stop coming and stop bringing food after one round just to try to push you out. Unless you speak fluent Mandarin, not even Cantonese, you will not have a good time

I will not be coming back to this restaurant ever again regardless if there is a change in management or not. This place is clearly slowing down because of many new hotpot restaurants opening all throughout Markham. Good luck trying to compete morals.  Worst hotpot place ever.  

Don't take this review lightly. I will not be giving this restaurant ""another try"""
1,This apartment complex will face a lawsuit very soon or later.  Im currently living in a cockroach infested room and nothing has been done. Thry just don't care.
1,"I would seriously give this place 0 star if that was an option. My parents and I have been very loyal to this place for years but over the years, their service has truly gone down to shit hole. The servers are very rude, loud, gross and have no consideration for diners. They organize their chopsticks with clanking sound on the table very loudly while diners are still there, talk very loudly with their coworkers in their own language and they never thank your business with them as if they're doing you some kind of favours. My parents always order the same kind of pho but few times, they didn't have any basil and they said they don't know when the delivery is coming. We let a lot of these incidences slide but not anymore! Today, they didn't have any bean sprouts then my parents looked slightly annoyed/disappointed. Instead of apologizing or offering other kind of ingredients, the server just shrugs her shoulders and says they don't have it as she walks away. Somehow, only 2 minutes later, they magically had their bean sprouts and the server said it's coming in a few minutes and said ""you're lucky!"" as if that ingredient isn't supposed to be in the food and we somehow got it by luck. No such server has ever managed to flabbergast me with a comment like hers in my life. I found that very strange, like they somehow don't want to serve certain ingredients if people don't ask for it but do if people ask for it, even though the ingredient is listed on their menu. It seems like they wanted to save what they had from the long weekend to make it last until the next delivery? Who knows but I just found it very fishy. Also, when you ask them for a cup of water, they seem to do it very reluctantly, pass off the task to someone else so they could chat with their coworkers and still expect good tips. When you look annoyed/disappointed, they seem to be on their toes and change their act a little but otherwise, the service changes for the worse time after time. In a world with so many other options, PLEASE do yourself a favour and go somewhere else!!!"
1,"We bought a 2013 Ford Mustang from this lot and it has been in the repair shop 3 times in under 3 months. After the car broke down in the middle of an intersection last week i called to find out what kind of presale inspection they run their cars through prior to selling on their lots. Got a brief call back from someone who said he would look into it for me and call me back. Still waiting. They also promised to call and set up window tint- since they charged for it in the used car price- but we are still waiting on that as well. First and last time Ill ever buy a car from this dealership.


** broke down AGAIN. Four times. Stranded daughter. Required tow. Worst used car purchase ever."
1,"Okay, I take back everything I said in my last review.

I came here last week for a quick lunch during my break at work (1 hour) and I wanted to get in and out.

The place was probably 1/4 filled on a Saturday afternoon and my boyfriend and I were seated quickly.

I ordered a baked cream ham and chicken rice and a ham & egg sandwich (toasted).
The one thing was absolute negative service.  I'm okay with the ""Asian"" service i.e. efficient, quick, no effort at communication besides taking your order - that I have 0 problem with. But if I'm getting attitude while ordering for no reason then I am 100% unhappy to be there.
While ordering the lady had 0 idea of what I wanted from the menu while I even pointed at the menu and I do speak fluent Cantonese.  When I told her I wanted my bread toasted for the sandwich she literally looked at me like I was insulting her and told me it would cost extra.  
WHY DOES IT COST EXTRA TO TOAST BREAD???
I said it was fine and I'd pay.  
The sandwich came with the bread untoasted & this waitress literally dropped it off and cross-countried to the other side of the resto.  She avoided my table for the rest of my meal.
The baked rice was 100% tasteless.  They deprived the entire dish of salt.  
They took half an hour to bring everything out.

I am so completely unhappy with their service, the time it took to cook, and their food."
1,We live in the area and have visited several times. Each time the restaurant has been light traffic. Tonight we entered during shift change and our waitress did not show up for 20 minutes. I asked to speak to the manager but she never showed up. Passed by us multiple times but never stopped. Food was average and service was poor up front. Too many choices in the area so we will not be back for food or drink.
1,"Incompetent. 

We took our leased vehicle back to this location and bought a new CX-9. When discussing the details, we showed that the car had damage on the passenger side and wondered if it was best to take care of it in advance or just allow the assessment. The guy at the dealership said they may forgive the damage entirely, and that it didn't look that bad -- at most, it shouldn't go over $1000, if they do say we owe anything at all. The mileage was over, so I knew that I would at minimum have to pay for the mileage overage charge. They assured us that Mazda leasing is really good to their customers, especially when buying another new Mazda vehicle. 

Well, not only did the door damage get charged for over $1300, but they charged another $1500 on random dings etc.... that didn't exist!!! The car was in great condition, minus the one door panel that had gotten hit!! I even paid $100 to have the interior professionally cleaned!! The extra mileage charge was $1661.25... so for a car we could have bought out for $21,000.... and was worth MORE THAN THAT!!!! We now have to pay almost 22% of the buy out cost to these bogus overage charges!?!?  This should be illegal. 

If there is even a RISK of these kinds of amounts coming back to lessees -- the DEALERSHIP should 1. Warn clients to NEVER LEASE A CAR, and 2. BUY IT OUT, if you do, because you'll get royally screwed at the time of buy-out.

If the dealership, or Mazda, or the leasing company does not make this right.... I guarantee we will NEVER buy a Mazda again.... we will warn EVERYONE to stay clear of Mazda and their inept / shady business practices, and stay clear of Chase leasing as well -- the banksters strike again -- such a corrupted world we live in! Logic alone says these companies are screwing us over -- 22% of the car buy out!?!? Give me a break!!! I'm basically buying a used car at $4500, with NO CAR!"
1,"This place has the best wings in town and great food, but no longer allows anyone under 21...even though that is not the majority of their business, this change is going to cost them business not gain."
1,Very poor customer service. Made a booking and went 15mins early. Didn't get seated untill 1.5hrs of waiting.
1,"There were two problems: slowness of processing my order and the food itself. I ordered a chicken cheesesteak with mushrooms. My friend and I ordered at the same place in food court of the Red Rock so our orders would come out the same time.  It took an extra 10 minutes longer for my food. When I asked about my order they blamed the provalone cheese. Then they started cooking it.

The sandwich itself was missing the meat and cheese from a third of it. The chicken was dry and over all it was extremley salty.

If you are at the Red Rock don't go to Capriotti's."
1,"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.  The management is such a joke.  They tell all kinds of lies to get you here.  Don't believe them when they tell you the apartment ""will be exactly like the model unit"".  That's a HUGE lie.  This place is nasty.  There are homeless people going through the dumpsters and throwing the trash on the ground.  The breezeways look like they haven't been cleaned in years.  There is always trash laying around.  A girl who just moved out left milk sitting out, food on the bar which leaked everywhere and then molded, cases of beer bottles at the front door which leaked through causing the cardboard box and plastic bag to stick to the floor, red Kool-Aid stains in the refrigerator where it leaked down 2 shelves, and we are told that it is up to the rest of us to clean this nasty scum.  The cleaning people came in yesterday and said they were told by management to ONLY clean the bedrooms of the people who just moved out, and nothing else.  Our icemaker leaked nasty yellow liquid in the kitchen for 2 months.  It was tracked through the entire common area because we had to walk through 1 inch of this stuff to get into the kitchen.  We were told that we would have to pay to have the carpet cleaned.  I was fined a $100.00 late fee for rent which was paid 10 days in advance, according to my U.S. Bank Bill Pay.  Rebel Place said they never received it.  U.S. Bank called Sandy and told her that I did, in fact, pay, and the check was mailed to them on June 19th and to please refund me the late fees.  She refused.  I have all the paper work showing that I did my part.  I'm not sure what is wrong this Petticoat Junction type establishment; however, I am contacting my attorney today regarding this late fee and the cleaning being refused.  DO NOT MOVE HERE!!   It's like the Hotel California.  They only want your money ... that's it!    I would suggest reading the reviews from Gerry, Ana, and Caroline ... everything I didn't cover, they did.

I have to write an update on my previous review.   I don't know if it is because school is just starting and it is a once-a-year project or if it because of a new manager, but ... last week, the walkways and steps were all power washed, the parking lot was repainted, and all the trash was picked up around the place (till the students started throwing it wherever they happened to be standing again).  My kitchen was thoroughly cleaned by a cleaning crew, and the carpet was cleaned.  Again, I don't know if it was just a once-a-year thing they do in August but it has been very nice for about a week and a half.  I presented all of my bank statements regarding them saying I paid my rent late, and the new manager refunded my late fee.  I'm really hoping everything that's been happening good is a permanent thing.  If so, I would definitely raise my rating.  We will see."
1,"Today will be my last time coming here and here are the reasons 
- Poor Service, waitresses were unfriendly to the max
- The Pho broth was super salty and they were cheap with the portions 
- Witnessed with my very own eyes how the waitress made short trips to the WASHROOM to ""wash"" the sauce bottle lids......... disgusting ...disgusting 
 
I don't understand how some people are giving this place 4-5 stars ..... absolutely ridiculous. There are many pho restaurants in the city that are WAY better so don't waste your time and money here."
1,"I called yesterday and made a 8am appointment to bring my car in for A/C repair. I got there early and waited until 8:20am until I left. They never opened. Unbelievable.  Plus their website claims they open at 7:30!!!!! Before leaving I called them, left a message and asked them to call me once they opened. It's now 9:20 am and no call back. 

Just from this experience, I wouldn't trust these guys with ANY car."
1,"I dont even like the fact that I had to give them 1 star. To make a long story short. 

1. buy car.
2. they agree to fix things on car but need to order parts should be done in a week. 
3. week comes and goes and another and another and another all while i am making calls asking where everything is. i constantly get the ""we will have it shortly""
4. FINALLY after a month and a half, i take the car in and guess what...THEY DONT HAVE THE RIGHT PARTS!!!! 
5. get fed up speak to GM, yup the big guy
6. he works out a great deal, i take loaner car for a week while they work on car and they will have it delivered to my house (BTW: I live an hour and a half away)
7. get car after a week and, there are added scratches, bumper looks same as before and paint job looks like it was done with nailpolish! 

Staff sucks. I had someone walk away from me as I was talking to them. I had another call saying I need to go pick up car since I didnt want to trade in the car I originally bought. And another  tell me I was being ridiculous when I asked to speak to their manager."
1,"If you love cockroaches, please feel comfortable to move into rebel place. First thing you move in, cockroaches will welcome you from the door step to the kitchen and to the living room and finally to your bedroom and bathroom. You just can't miss them. I found eight cockroaches partying in the kitchen in wonderful morning. They also say good night to you in your bed. I just felt loved living in rebel place. Overall, you never get pest control when you ask them. it takes FOREVER! you just end up finding your own and paying to kill your loved friends."
1,"Gorgeous space, the service was fair, the food was shockingly bad.  Of my family of four, all of us thought the cornbread too salty and unremarkable.  All of our entrees were below average, the fried chicken was flavorless and the collard greens were weirdly sweet, greasy and oversalted.  The risotto was unremarkable.  Overpriced.  The staff seemed edgy.  Disappointing."
1,"My man and I are in the processing of moving so we decided to grab some to go food from Sesame Inn. We ordered about $60 worth of food (we love leftovers) - BAD MISTAKE! Waste of money. The Mongolian Beef had zero taste, didn't even taste like what Mongolian beef should taste like PLUS the meat was ORANGE! What the what??? The short ribs were so dry it tasted like beef jerky on a bone. House fried rice was ok but the lack of protein in it was next to nothing. Crab puffs were dried out, almost like they were sitting out for awhile. The white rice was filled half way, like they ran out and didn't want to make more. 

Do yourself a favor, locate another place to eat. I do not recommended this place. It was disgusting."
1,"Had great pre-sales/sales support, but what they told me in the dealership WAS NOT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY DELIVERED. 

I tried to resolve the issue by speaking with the salesperson and with the ""new car desk manager"".  Both made a lot of promises to get back with me to resolve the issue, but NEITHER OF THEM DID!

I tried to call the manager over the entire location, but ""Lucas"" at the ""new car desk manager"" refused to transfer my call.

For a minor issue of bad information, they sure are skating the issue!

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP.

After my initial posting:
I sent Donny the manager a direct email - he was in on my issue early on in the process.  Immediately after notifying him of my negative posting (in my email), I received an email from my sales person who informed me that they were not going to do anything regarding the misrepresentation he did on my vehicle.  So Donny's response to this review is purely for public image and is completely FAKE!!!!"
1,"this restaurant is a total embarrassment to any chinese restaurant.they have been in the area for 20 years and charge for noodles, rice etc. the new trend is updated chinese where you serve the customer. $28 for two small buckets and soup. everything is an add on. in the next 12 mos, these people will go out of business and deservedly so. they are leeches.they are living in a 1990 world.they should not be operating"
1,"The WORST hot pot, if not meal I have ever had. I will NEVER come back here. Zero star review. 

The food is poor quality and tasteless. They never come to clear the dirty plates so they just pile up all over the table. The service is horrendous. They forgot half of what we ordered and it was like pulling teeth trying to find a waiter to order more food (or to ask wtf happened to the stuff we ordered 45 minutes ago and never came). It takes AGES for anything to come out. We asked FOUR times for them to add more water to the soup that was now an inch of murky sludge in the pot before they came by with a jug. When you asked for something they would say uhhhh one sec and never come back. The initial utensils we got had dried food on them.... I can go on.....

RAGE. I feel robbed paying for this meal. For two of us the bill came to $70. On a weeknight! (The only extra we got was one Diet Coke - the best part of the meal). For this price or just a little more we could have gone to a good joint downtown for delicious food and amazing service. For this price we didn't even get mediocre food and service. What a joke. 

Do NOT go here. Stick to Hipot (which until now I thought was so-so but it's like Michelin star compared to this shizzzz) or Hopo or the world bowl hot pot place. Seriously. Don't eat here. Ridiculous."
1,"Service was terrible! Sorry Courtney, it is managements responsibility to train you. You didn't even take our dirty plates away from us so we could have after dinner conversation."
1,Chicken taste bland and not roasted correctly.  Rib sauce was spicy n not listed as spicy.  The shrimp was over cooked and bread was gross under the shrimp.  My 8yr old nephew didn't even eat his burger because it was dry.  Service was great but not the food.
1,"Vietnamese restaurants are known for efficient service but this one has gone overboard. I arrived around 9pm on a Saturday night and they had a bunch of chairs stacked up and a lady was sweeping. The restaurant was half full. So I went in and asked if they were closed. They said no and seated us at a four person table. 

My table ordered cha gio, bun bo hue, and two rice dishes. While we were waiting for our food, they asked us to move to the long table. We were a party of three. So they picked up our tea cups and teapot and we moved there. None of the dishes were good! I had to add extra fish sauce to my bun bo hue because it was so tasteless. The meat also tasted odd. 

Before we finished eating, they sat another party on the outer section of the long table. It was impossible for me to get out so I had to ask the other customer to get up first. How inconvenient. I know that some restaurants do seat different parties at the same table but only when they are packed. The restaurant was only half full yet they sat the other party at the long table with me because they were now cleaning and sweeping the back section of the restaurant. 

There's a bunch of other pho restaurants nearby. Take your pick and avoid this place."
1,"This place is called a Latin American bar/restaurant but we spent the night listening to hip hop music (like any other place nearby) because the only place with Latin music was the restaurant downstairs which closes at 12am. Fail! 

So if you are looking for a cool place with Latino vibe and great service do not waste your time there. A friend had high expectations to celebrate her 30th birthday there and we she got was an unpleasant night

The service was the worst, rude and disrespectful. I don't like to share bad reviews but this is something that I need to share with everyone interested on this place to eat and party."
1,"Food is good but not worth going for because service is terrible. Just plain mean servers. Was told once for not tipping ""to go home and cook, instead of coming to dine in"". She made it clear so I no longer buy from here. If customer service improved, food would be a whole lot better too! :/"
1,"**I've been living here since April*
Model rooms look nothing like the room you'll actually get. Moved in and the tiles are covered in stains and the couches and walls are scuffed. My move in checklist looks like a grocery shopping list. They constantly find reasons to go through your apartment on a regular basis, with bogus reasons such as ""key checks"", a week after they did a room inspection (be prepared to be treated like a child, this isn't your room, it's theirs). 

AC has been broken for 4 days, I've put in 3 Service Requests:
-First Service Request: AC guy didn't even come into apartment, assumed it was fine and checked the Service request as Completed (STILL 80+ degrees).
-Second Service Request: AC guy claimed to clean filter and defrost coils, said to turn AC on after an hour (did so, forgot to place AC unit switch to ON, still sweating at night, it's July with NO AC) 
Third Service Request: Called office, they told me the AC guy told me to flip switch (he should have done that himself), I told them I did and it still doesn't work, she told me she'd check in with him...hours go by, it's now 4AM in the morning and 80 degrees in my apartment. 

*REMODELING*: Was given a heads up that carpets and our disgusting tile would be replaced between 9AM-6PM on Friday, told me put everything that was touching the floor in the bathtub or under the sink. Inconvenient, but hey, new flooring. Did it. Nobody comes by all day. No email, no written letter, nothing. When are they coming by? Not sure, because nobody has told me yet. Did they expect the flooring to be done in all of the apartments in one single day?

Did I mention all of the homeless people that wander around nearby and the constant sirens and airplanes? Or that some guy had a gun pulled on him and now they have a security guard at the gate? If you still think it's worth the convenience of being close to school, go for it. I should have gotten a two bedroom apartment elsewhere."
1,"I am absolutely fed up with Rebel Place!! They deserve negative stars! They are thieves, and play too many games. I moved out of this complex in July, and still have not gotten my $300 security deposit back!!! It is impossible to get in touch with their ""corporate office "" and when I call them, they just keep telling me, ""any day now"" that is absolute bullshit! I am so tired of them, that I am giving them until tomorrow, and I am speaking to my lawyer. I should have had my money THE DAY I MOVED OUT!!! Keep playing with me Rebel Place."
1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would.  Terrible salesmen.  They are the type that hold your keys until you buy a car from them.  Ended up buying the car, but will not do business with them or any other car dealer again."
1,"Please young college students stay away from this place . It is convenient to campus and they have a shuttle to lure you in to a lease. We moved here from New York, it looked good online. This company misleads the consumer. The place is filthy and not maintained at all. They are taking advantage of college kids !!! My son met wonderful friends and roommates here, we are grateful for that . None of them got their security deposits back in addition each had several extra charges . When your lease it up they push these kids out the door at 930 in the am and than charge them for the rest day of rent .. Young people trying to get an education and better themselves! Really, not on this mothers watch. I'm am onto the better business bureau and city codes departments in Las Vegas. After being in town 6 months there are decent places for college kids to live .. NOT REBEL PLACE ..none of you belong in a place with rats in the dumpsters.. College life should be a positive experience for you .. They are using young adults as an easy target .. Unsafe living conditions and taking your money .. ZERO STARS REBEL PLACE 
As a business owner in this town I am headed to the UNLV housing office to discuss my concerns with this company ...."
1,"I am Asian and this has got to be one of the most expensive and overrated Chinese restaurants in Madison. This place don't even have bahn bao, and they call themselves authentic? This restaurant is equivalent to your typical Chinese Buffetts in Madison."
1,"I'm not quite sure where to even begin in regards to my experience living at Rebel Place. If I could give this place no star, trust me I would. Despite reading the horrific reviews, me and my roommate still decided to take the risk of signing a lease in hopes that the living and management quality would improve under PeakCampus, but boy were we wrong! From the incompetent management, inhabitable living ""units"", and their fanatic shuttle bus drivers, this place is completely not worth the 1,400+ rent. Do yourself a favor my friends and trust in these reviews, take your money elsewhere and invest in a better complex.

Firstly, on move in day I couldn't help but feel cold chills sparked by fear run down my spine the moment I opened my apartment door. Tenants are paying 680+ PER BEDROOM for the tiniest, filthiest ""furnished apartment"" loaded with 5 pieces of furniture that appears to be inspired by the Medieval Renaissance. The bed doesn't even have mattresses, unless you consider a hard navy blue block hard as a rock desirable sleeping spot, then sure.Totally not worth the money! Prior to moving in, we have called the leasing office several times in regards to our rent but these imbeciles continuously hung up on us. UNACCEPTABLE.

But before we get into the worst management team to exist, let's get into maintenance. If there is one thing that isn't true about these horrible reviews, it is that maintenance doesn't respond to service requests because they sure do :). If you enjoy a comfortable sleep, you can completely disregard it living at Rebel Place seeing that maintenance enjoys banging extremely loudly on your door at 6am and proceed to enter your bedroom while you are naked. The office never even calls to give you a heads up. I'm not completely sure who constructed this building, but I'm on the verge of believing it was the 3 little pigs, because a huff and a puff will blow your apartment down. In recently rained in Vegas and a plethora of water seeped through our walls! Fearing there would be mold, which was probably already there, they decided to place 7 large heavy duty fans in our apartment and a dehumidifier for about a week, I couldn't even hear myself speak but we were told they must stay on. After completely wasting our time with those useless fans, they decided to knock out half of our walls, leaving my roommate without a bedroom and her furniture and belongings sitting in her bathroom tub. 

Before I conclude the Las Vegas Rain Chronicles, this is where I'd like to bring up management. Rebel Place management is completely negligent, rude, and incompetent. The staff looks like they are all fresh out of high school, they childish and irresponsible. When complaining to the office about our situation, they told us it was our fault, we still have to pay rent, and they will not give us another place to stay in for the meantime. The head manager, blondie with the glasses, was completely rude and said we could sleep in the living room. Last time I checked I was paying $680 for a bedroom, not to sleep on some old dingy couch. Maintenance were loud, obnoxious, inconsiderate, and left their drinks all over our apartment.

This list goes on, but I'll finish off with security and the shuttle drivers. If you are already late to class, man will you be even more late! Rebel Place has done a fine job at hiring drivers who love to drive to the grocery store on the way to school and buy themselves personal items. Road Rage Regina loves to scream out the window on your journey to class and causes accidents. They are nuts. Security is an absolute joke, he jumped and was frightened as I was walking my puppy... what a tough guy.

There is so much more I have to say about this place but I simply don't have the time seeing that I'm currently working out a civil court case against PeakCampus... DO NOT MOVE HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN."
1,"I agree with jj b.... These guys are like hawks just waiting to come up and swoop up their prey. 
I made the mistake of going here without my dad it at least a male figure to help me out and whatdya know? The pretty much screwed me. I have had nothing but problems with these guys    and I can't even begin to tell you the crap we are going through right now as our transmission has gone kaput. The service techs try as they can to be nice and friendly, which they are, but still money hungry!
I really wish I could say I was happy with this place cuz I doo love mazda vehicles...but honestly I would get out as fast as I could!"
1,"If I can give no stars, I would definitely do it!  But that one star that we have to compulsorily give can be for the ambience maybe.
I can't begin to tell what a bad experience I had in this place. It was my first time here with my family. We came here to celebrate my brother's bday. It was in the afternoon around 2 pm on a Sunday that we walked in this place. It was not busy and it looked like a huge group of 10 people were about to leave. We waited to be seated and after a 10 mins wait we were shown to our seats. 

When we received our menus we realized it was in Chinese. We politely asked for English menus and they gave us just two English menus for a group of 6 people. Anyways, when the server came
To take our order, he was talking in chinese. We answered in English but he didn't seem to know much of it or maybe acted like he did not know??

We ordered our first round of food with a lot of actions and pointing. But when we ordered the second round, the food did not come for a good 15 min. I mean how long does it take to bring raw food on the table? Especially when there were no customers at that time ?

The service was so slow. When we asked for water, it did not even arrive until the end of our meal!! And I saw a big group of servers just sitting around in the corner of the restaurant chatting away.

After all this almost at the end of our meal we asked for an ice cream cone (tiny ice cream cone) for my niece which they serve as dessert.They obliged. But when we asked for one more ice cream again, the server came back and told us that they were out of stock. It's ridiculous coz it said in the menu that we can order dessert of an ice cream cone (1 for each person). We flipped out and told him that it's just not done and that all of us in the table did not even get our share of ice cream. The server then said we have to wait for 10 mins or so to get the ice cream. We said that it is fine coz we already waited for so long. The server went back to his group of servers and started laughing. Seemed like they planned to tell us about the no ice cream story just to see our reaction. Looked like they were jus testing us. 

Eventually the ice cream was not served, we then stopped another server and gave him our ice cream order again, he obliged. Which meant that the server who was dealing with us was lying. 

By the end of the meal our mood was completely spoilt that we did not feel like staying any longer. I really don't have any thing to say about the quality of the food, it's coz the experience was so bad.. we din enjoy our food at all. 
 
End of the story - I guess they treated us this way coz we dint speak Chinese ?? That's the only reason we could think of coz we were a pretty reasonable group who did not even order heaps and heaps of food. We were not even demanding. 
So a little bit of advice to you folks who do not speak Chinese - stay away from this place. 
And in general to everyone - STAY AWAY. 

No customer should be treated this way. If they treat their customer this way, they really don't deserve customers."
1,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They talked shit about me while I was there thinking that I wasn't Vietnamese. 
They never took the time to listen to me and the fact that I wanted take out. They forced me to sit down and didn't even give me a pen! Then they proceeded to talk about how disrespectful and stupid I was. I will never ever eat here again! And I urge you not to either."
1,"This is my third time going there and will be my last time.  We have 3 people and I don't know why they only give us one pair of chopsticks. OK,fine I ask 2 pair of chopsticks. I have no idea what did the waitress said when she is turning her back..Fine. 
We order 3 dishes and ask the waitress how is the taste of one of the dish like.she explain to us and said the dish is popular.   We order it but she want the code number of the dishes.  OK I told her the no.  When one of the dish come,I said this is not the one I order.  She said you give me the wrong number.  I said you tell me the dish is good ,how could you get it wrong.  Her attitude is so bad and shout out that is my fault right in front of other customer.   I am really mad and OK,now I decided not going there anymore.   I think this restaurant won't last long."
1,"I would not buy another vehicle here, not even for $1. I refuse to do 'business' with people who cheat and manipulate customers. Friendly, service oriented staff; UNTIL YOU SIGN. Don't call expecting your friendly neighborhood Mazda dealer. Once you get past the front desk ladies who are usually sweet, the people with offices and cubicles in this building could care less about your questions, comments and concerns. The lies they tell are countless, and worst of all, these people are just downright rude.

My recommendation; buy private, or go to another dealer. Whatever you do, do not go to Cardinale Way Mazda Mesa."
1,Awful food and even worse food. Over priced garbage. The server was rude. Don't waist your time going there
1,"Horrible horrible horrible! Shaylne at the front whom seems to be the office manager was completely RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL!! Rather than helping or remedy a situation that only needed a few seconds of her time assuming that's what she's employed to do she made a huge sene embarrassing a tenant threatening to call Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in front of other people that were in the office. Just make the call, do you have to make threats?! Ridiculous that someone would pay to be treated to like this! APPALLED!!!!"
1,"I think it's about time I write this review.

First off, I often don't believe Yelp reviews because sometimes a restaurant that others say are bad,are good. 

But this time, I should have trusted reviews about this place...
We moved here a year ago and chose this place because it was close to UNLV and because they have a shuttle that runs each semester (not summers). Back then, I didn't have a car so it was the most viable option since my roommates worked and could not give me rides.

When we first moved in, we had problems with our grinder, our previous resident had dropped bones inside and the thing was clogged and would not work. We asked them to come and fix it and THEY LEFT THE DISGUSTING BONES on our counter!!! YUCK!!!! Next, our dishwashing machine  was gross so we asked them to come clean it for us and so the cleaning lady came and turned in on, well, guess what?? THERE WAS A LEAK!!! it had flooded the cabinets under the sink and THEY NEVER FIXED IT!

A few months ago, I got a puppy. I was at first unsure if I was going to keep her and had not registered her yet under the lease. (It had been less than a week and 'SUPPOSEDLY') The maintenance men came in without notifying us and told the front office about her. They demanded I pay $400 for the fine PLUS her rent and deposit (which is non-refundable) too. I eventually kept her and was able to drop the fine but how is it that maintenance can come in and just decide how we should live?

After that incident, a few months later, (because I'm still in school) I ordered a book from e-bay for class which of course would have to picked up at the front office because of its size. So when I went to pick it up, my book was WET! and was water logged!! (Good thing it was not rented) BUT what if it was?? They are irresponsible with your mail and do not care if it is damaged or drowned in water.

A few weeks ago, we had a leak in our bathroom from upstairs and we called them in the middle of the night to come and stop the leak, but because we called on a friday night, they said they would not take care of it until monday. SERIOUSLY?? What is the use of the emergency line if they can't even clean up a leak?? What if it got bad and flooded our bathroom?? Coming from the upstairs was gross enough but we had to wait a whole weekend to get it fixed!! 

Then today! I had recently applied to forward my mail at the post office and as someone here previously stated. I got a mail saying they were unable to process my request because it was ""place of business"" so I went to the front office and asked if they could write me a letter or something for the post office and THESE PEOPLE DO NOT CARE! They said, ""Oh yeah, because we are a business attached to a residential, we can't do anything"" SERIOUSLY??? They OBVIOUSLY don't care about their residents, we are just BUSINESS to them. Instead, they told me I had to personally go through my mail and make sure I update EVERY SINGLE ADDRESS ON EVERY SINGLE MAIL!! WTH!!! Isn't that why they have mail forwarding in the first place?? SERIOUSLY!!! (Save yourself the trouble)"
1,Thoroughly mediocre Chinese food. Could have gotten the same thing from a random mall food court.
1,"I've given this place multiple chances and am not going to waste my money any longer. They never seem to appreciate my patronage-- can't ever get a ""thank you."" Skimpy portions too-- does not filling the white rice containers full or giving soy sauce without having to ask for it really save that much money?  But the real deal breaker is continuing to get my take-out orders wrong. Two times in a row I got the wrong tofu dish. Too many other options to not consistently get great food and service."
1,"this place used to have the best wings in town before they changed the age to 21 and over ONLY.

We decided to go there because we happened to be out without the kids and get some wings.  The lemon pepper wings seemed like the cook dumped the entire bottle of pepper on the wings.  The garlic parmasion wings were greasy and very vingery.  

I don't know if the cook on this particular day was having a bad day, not on his game or ever had a game.  Needless to say, another place which used to have GREAT food and decent service now hit the SUCKS category and is no long a place we will visit.  It is sad to say that wings are also becoming a hard item to find in this town.  

You had a great place why did you have to change????  You used to have great chefs, why did you have to change???"
1,"Worst Chinese food ever!  What a wasted opportunity on their part with the population of at least 5 upscale communities. And the $$$ for what you get ridiculous.  Sesame beef floating in bad tasting oil, Kung Pao chicken w/barely any chicken and just plain bad. Thankfully ordered string beans so ate on the brown rice that we paid extra for. This whole experience cost $50.  Do yourself a favor and go to Pei Wei where you can get food maybe a little better and at half the price!"
1,"These guys are a bunch of asshats!!!  Test drove car, did application ... never heard back. Left several messages for finance guys/manager  Sam... Calls not returned. Very bad way to do business. Guess they have enough money, they do not need to make a sell... felt like I  was settling for a Mazda anyway."
1,"I placed an order to go last week of chicken lettuce wraps, pot stickers and Mongolian beef. The order was ready on time and I brought it back to our condo to eat. Unfortunately the pot stickers were cold and chewy. I then tried the lettuce wraps that is supposed to have chicken to put in  it but it looked like some sort of mystery meat instead. The taste was so bland that I wasn't sure what animal the meat came from. I was hoping that the Mongolian beef would save the dinner but unfortunately it had no taste and was as tough as shoe leather.
I have come to the conclusion that since most Asian restaurants do not use MSG anymore to enhance the flavor that the items on their menu are no longer tasty or juicy anymore.
I suggest skipping this place and go to PF Changs."
1,I would certainly be skeptical of the service department.  They do not loan up to anything. Oil has been changed from this dealer from new.  The lower engine shroud was dragging on the ground so I removed it and found all the bolts loose.  They told me they couldn't help me out since it was several months since the oil change.  When you take your car in for service they will come up with several service items that aren't necessary.  Had a couple of other reputable autoshops check the items and said the car was excellent condition and no other repairs needed at this time.
1,"I currently live here and I'm ready to leave. I chose this place because it is ""affordable"" and conveniently located near UNLV and the strip. The people at the front desk are okay with me because I built a rapport with the staff, but it can be at a better location (contradicting,  right) for the price. I could live in Henderson and get way more for my buck. Also, it is weed central and too many people making unnecessary noises. I am done."
1,"Well I wanted to write this review a week ago but unfortunately multiple sclerosis has been beating me down ever since my visit to Lolo's at the airport. 
Let me start by saying our visit to the airport was to see my boyfriend off to attend a funeral for his 13 year old nephew, so it was very under unexpected tragic conditions. I thought having dinner at Lolo's would be a good idea since he had never been there. I'm a big fan of the downtown Lolo's and frequent it often. I've never been let down by the downtown location in all the years I've been eating there. So I hyped the place up to him and thought I would send him off with a delicious dinner.
I'm embarrassed for Lolo's to be associated with this airport location. This is NOT true Lolo's. 
First of all let's start with how they were out of fried green tomatoes. Ok disappointing, but not a real big deal, I went with the cheese grits instead. They were also out of the banana pudding. The cashier Brittany said it would be about a fifteen minute wait for our food. Not a problem since we were there early enough for my boyfriend to eat then catch his flight. 
Twenty five minutes later our food was ready, but it was missing one of our children's chicken tender baskets. The cashier asked us if we were sure that we didn't receive it. We literally had to show her our receipt and the food we received even though she had just taken our order not even thirty minutes earlier. She swore they had made it, even though it clearly wasn't there with our other food, but said she would get another one started. Twenty minutes later we had our missing chicken tender basket. 
Now the chicken was great, but the waffles were soggy. Fries in the chicken tender basket were also soggy not at all crisp. The cheese grits were more like cheese soup, just runny and not at all good. But worst of all was my sons chocolate milk bottle had MOLD growing in it!!! 
I was horrified. Took it back up to the counter and Brittany offered to go ""find"" the manager. She came back a few minutes later with the manager Bill. Bill looked at the moldy milk bottle and offered another drink. I told him at this point I'm not interested in another drink, my concern is the mold growing in their milk bottles. Bill then offered to refund the $3.29 we had paid for the milk, mind you our total bill (for subpar food, service, and MOLDY milk) was $61.61. I explained to Bill again that my concern was not to be refunded $3.29, that doesn't not at all make up for our poor experience, my concern is the milk bottles they are selling have mold growing in them. Bill then tried to say maybe it was ""an ink mark inside the bottle"". At this point I literally had to let Bill knows that any idiot with any common sense could clearly see this is mold as it was hairy, white and green, clearly not at all an ink mark, not even close and how insulting.  I literally had to ask him to remove the other milks on the shelves and make sure they were not also moldy. 
I am so disappointed and embarrassed for Lolo's food and service at this location. Super bad experience, and after I had told my boyfriend how great this place was. I would give this zero stars if I could. I can't believe this is how they treat customers or run their business."
1,"Poor management!  paula ,shileya .....all are unprofessional, rude and untrusty ! They will treat u good until u sign the lease after that u will cry !"
1,"It says a friendly thai. The foods are good and tastes great but the crew members aren't that friendly. We ordered one big bowl of noodle so that my friend and i can share because my friend won't be able to finish a small bowl of soup and ask if we could have two empty bowls. then the crew member who serves us said ""one bowl for one person"" rudely. Never going back here again."
1,"The food usually is pretty good but if you get take out, you better watch out! I used to be a nearly weekly take out customer, but over the last several months, probably 1/3 of my orders have been incorrect when ordering more the two things. Mostly it's missing pieces of the order, often a full entree is forgotten but of course these items are NEVER forgotten from your bill. 
Calling back to say the order you received is incorrect is usually not met with the apologetic, 'how can we fix this' attitude however. The staff have seemed somewhat annoyed with a simple request to refund the order left out or huffy about making the missing item for to pick up -- again. 
I always double check my take out orders now before leaving, and the staff seems annoyed I'm taking up counter space to dig through the often already leaking big. 
I received no 'thank you' on a recent pick up, despite my repeated verbal gratitude, but our most recent, and likely final, take out order was an extra large mess up. I generally order the same entree for myself (chicken fried rice, extra spicy) and used to order this nearly weekly. As I was eating my order, I though things seemed a little off, then realized instead of chicken, I was given shrimp. I'm allergic to seafood!
When we called to complain, we actually had to ask for a refund. The manager was apologetic, and I understand that sometimes mistakes happen, but imperial gardens mistakes are to frequent to allow for enjoyable and confident take out."
1,This place is horse shit. Don't even waste your fucking time and money at this place. I want out of my lease.
1,"I'm typically a VERY tolerant and diplomatic person but this apartment complex drove me up the wall. Trust me. You could find a much better place to live within the same radius for probably much less than what you pay here.

I remembered paying about $600 monthly for a SINGLE ROOM of a FOUR BEDROOM apartment. It was ridiculously priced and I didn't know any better since I was young and idealistic about where I live. The utility bills are fixed no matter the actual usage. Also it just doesn't add up to pay that much.  I had three roommates so that's $2400 we were all paying total. For that money you could rent a house and live with people you actually know and like.

The walls were PAPER THIN. I could never EVER study or sleep because my neighbors (including people in OTHER units) would either be having a dance party or having sex. It was miserable.  

Sure, the furniture was included but trust me. It wasn't worth it when you could buy your own stuff and keep it or sell it later. The carpet was cheaper than the carpet in your hand-me down car. The customer service was stupendous and more importantly, it was unsafe.

Rebel Place had open gates so anyone could wander in and out of the complex. Sure, within reason, I understand ultimate safety can not be guaranteed. But when we would get random banging on our front door and my roommate's cars would be broken into, I think the situation has exceeded reason.

If you're checking yelp to see if this is a good place to live, it seems you might be wise. Hope you make the right decision for you! Good luck!"
1,"My husband and I were there for dinner Monday around 6 pm.  I walked up to the desk to give my name so we could be seated.  Four girls were there engaged in heavy conversations. Eventually one of them turned around and said, there will be a 10 minute wait and asked for a name.  When it was our turn to be seated, a girl grabbed a dish of rolls and said follow me.  We were seated back by the entrance to the kitchen. She dropped off the rolls and walked away without a word.  We sat for a few minutes waiting for a waitress.  She eventually came over and asked for our drink order. I had a free coupon for an appetizer and she took it.  We ordered our dinners.  My husband likes his steak well done.  I ordered a ribeye and asked that it be cooked medium well.  Usually the waitress will ask you to cut into your steak to see if it cooked as ordered.  She did not.  She said I will check back with you and walked away.  I cut a third of the steak and it was clearly way over done and also looked and felt like it had sat around.  The waitress could clearly see I was not eating my dinner.  I did tell her that it was overdone.  She hesitantly said she could get another but at that point I was totally disinterested.  Also, the music was soooo loud, we could not carry on a decent conversation.  Multiple times there were 3-4 fairly young girls gathering at the entrance to the kitchen.  While standing there, they were playing with their hair.  Our waitress had shorter hair but was also playing with her hair.  You just don't play around with your hair and serve food.  That is a no no.  We also had asked for more rolls.  The second batch came out and was not fully baked and very doughy.  I also sent a message to the headquarters and got a message back stating they got the message and will pass it along but if I wanted to pursue it further, to contact them myself and look up the contact info on the website.    So disappointed in the restaurant.  We used to really love dining here."
1,"Came for the clean bar, the TVs and good food. Left after 1 drink because of the terrible service from Dawn. Will avoid her shift and leave when she's working. Rude and leaves you to basically get your own drinks."
1,"Most sleezy car salesman I've ever met.. they will 100% try to bait and switch.. they held a car 1 day for me and I just drove 30 minutes out of my way to sign the rest of the papers and pick up the car.. I arrive and Roe tells me the car was just sold. Complete waste of time. The manager loves to jump in and tag team as well. They try to make you feel important and ask for your favorite drink order (like some Starbucks is really going to convince me to buy a car?! Lol guess they are sexist and think I'm a dumb girl at a car dealership) ... at the end of the day they only care about themselves and their commission. I said I wasn't interested in other cars they were offering they said ""ok bye"". There's a reason this dealership has such low ratings... 

(Btw I've never written a bad review, but I've never had a worse experience than this...)"
1,Been here several times as we live right across the street. Food is decent for Latin American food in Toronto. Service is not bad. Bigger space than Valdez used to be but the speakeasy at Valdez was better. It used to be hip hop and more chill in the back. Now it's electronic with more douches. Their concept of hand picking customers to let into the back is pure discrimination. Surely they'll drop this practice after a year of being a newish spot. Was excited for the new Valdez now just disappointed.
1,"As a huge fan of chicken and waffles, I really wanted to like this place.

Service was slow and inattentive. Kitchen staff appeared to spend more time sitting around talking that cooking.

The waffles were soggy and unappetizing. They looked like they were pre-made and had been sitting under a warmer.

The syrup they gave me was fake. Really fake.

The chicken was the worst part. It was greasy, overcooked, and the furthest thing from friend chicken I've ever encountered.

According to the other reviewers, this location gives the brand a bad name. If I'm ever in Arizona or near another one, maybe I'll give it another shot."
1,"I only wrote one other review on Yelp - a positive one.  This is a negative one, that I hope spares at least one person the problems of renting here.  I've owned 4 businesses and know things can't go right all the time, but this was systematic and will not change.  Their problems fall into two categories:   maintenance of utilities/cleanliness, and financial trickery. 

I put my daughter into UNLV, and my searches led me to rent either at Rebel Place or another apartment.    On the phone, I pushed clearly for, ""What is the exact amount required to move in for a foreign student?""   I was told $998.00 exactly, which included a $100 a month discount since it was a week before the rush of tenants, making rent $499 not $599 -- but only if I sign up within two days, and that if I do, we get a $1,000 gift card to use anywhere in LV.   The alternative apartments were $1,300 to move in, so I went for Rebel.    In the office, they were very nice.   But upon signing the contract, told me that there was an additional $1,000 deposit for any foreign student. I said they should have told me, but wrote the check anyway.   She had to go to orientation, so I viewed the apartment room.  There was a huge pile of bedding, clothes, and junk from the previous tenant in the living room, which they promised to remove before my daughter moved in.   The next day, it was still there, and still here 70 days later when we moved out.    Two days after moving in, her bathroom sink slowed, then clogged completely.   They sent a handy man to snake it, but in 5 days it stopped again.   It then began to churn up black goop like a toilet.  It never went down, it was a full basin, as I saw when I drove there to move her out. It stunk like sewer water.  She had to do all her toothbrushing and other face cleaning in the shower.  

But the real problem you need to watch out for is their financial tricks.  Late September we were told there was an additional $275 they ""forgot to add into our move in fees"" that covered a year of cable or something, and another hundred for I never could figure out. Then they tried to charge my daughter a big fee for not having her gate pass key. I had to remind them that the day they moved in they did not have any, and finally they remembered and gave her the pass key she had asked for for  weeks. Before this, I had alerted a top finance person in the office that we might move out early due to some UNLV grant for foreign students being delayed until January.  Then we would return to LV.  So we did not pay September rent, knowing we had $1,500 in deposits.    They gave us a 5-day quit or pay and we moved out before the 5th day.   I wrote emails that never got a reply. Then finally I called the office asking about the deposit. This is where it gets truthful and ugly.   

They told me that I am responsible for filling her room, not them. To do that, I must put an ad in Craig's List, suggesting at least 6 people but maybe more to see it.  I asked why so many? They said that even if people want it, if they are not compatible with the roommates, they are put into a different apartment.  Sounds sweet, but then I asked what percentage of rooms get rented out this way if someone does not live in LV?  She said she doesn't know, but ""sometimes"" it works.   I asked why they don't show it, they said our job is to rent rooms that do not have any rent being paid or deposit.   Only after our deposit is used up, do they show her room.    The chances of me remotely finding a replacement is near zero.   I'd be sending them tenants they are given orders to put in other rooms if at all possible.   They would not fix the sink until it is rented, by the way, saying there is no need to, and said they are not sure about the old crap that still sat in the living room.   They did say that upon inspection we left the room without a mark and totally cleaned up, aside from the sink.    So 100% of the deposit other than pro rated rent would be returned to us usually.   

Before moving out, my daughter said that every single person she talked to at Rebel Place ""would not move back there"" and most had had at least some problem with maintenance or the office.    

You'll lose your deposit there, if you try ending your lease. For sure.   You will have terrible maintenance problems and a staff that is nice to you but the top execs in the office only care about taking money as fast as they can.  BTW, we never ever got our $1,000 gift card, which they said was delayed indefinitely.     So overall, we lost $1500 in deposit, were charged an additional $250 after our total was figured, and never got $1,000 promised. This is how they roll.  Beware, especially foreign students, they know you don't know how to get your money back, or what you can demand from them in health standards."
1,Talk about high pressure geez. They tried relentlessly to talk me out of the vehicle u wanted and to get something brand new then harassed me via phone and email days later. Shame because I was really interested until the pressure came.
1,"Stay Away!

I purchased a Certified Pre Owned (CPO) Mazda from this dealership and my review is a reflection of my experience with the three employees I dealt with.

I saw a car listed online and of course the description did not describe any of the flaws with the vehicle (I understand this is standard practice in the industry and I am not holding this against them). Normally this is why you see and inspect the car in person before pulling the trigger right? Being an out-of-state buyer and not being able to do that. So I relied exclusively on my salesperson Brett to give me the details on the car.

I asked him three separate times by e-mail, on the phone and by text message to be my eyes for me. I asked him specifically if there were any small nicks and chips on the front of the car. The car had less than 7k miles AND it's a CPO, so I figured there wouldn't be any major damage, but small ones can be missed and are hard to see in photos. Each time he assured and reassured me the car was ""SPOT ON"" and that I can trust him because he is personally very ""anal"" with his cars and ""cleans (his personal) car with a q-tip"".

Cleans his car with a q-tip? I don't even do that. So, naturally, I gave him my trust. Despite using some casual / off-colored verbiage in small-talk, Brett was very responsive to all of my inquiries and then passed me on to his manager James.

James told me that they ""mispriced the car by $2000"" but would honor the listed price if we came to an agreement within 24 hours. He also mentioned there was ""another buyer looking at the car"" but since my credit was better, it would be no problem for them to close this deal for me. 

I paid my deposit and booked a flight to Phoenix the very next day. I asked Brett if they can send a courtesy shuttle to pick me up. He told me he would personally pick me up from the airport. Brett picked me up curbside as promised and on-time. He is going above and beyond for me by doing that.

We arrived at the dealership and the car was waiting for me outside office. It had just been washed and detailed. The car looked great from a couple feet away. But then I started inspecting it more thoroughly and found the following...

The hood had paint chips down to the metal (aluminum).
The windshields had pits all over the surface and a couple of small tiny cracks that is on the verge of turning into a spider crack.
There was a curb rash on the back wheel 1/8th length of the circumference and a smaller rash on the front wheel.
There was a small dent on the passenger rear quarter panel.

I felt MISLED AND DISAPPOINTED.

Brett set my expectation high with his description of the car but there is no way that this car was ""SPOT ON"" by anyone's definition. I was disappointed with Brett but figured I will talk to his manager James to renegotiate the sale price. We agreed on the purchase price based on Brett's ""anal"" description of the car. And since his description was absolutely false, I figured there's a chance they can make it right by reducing the price of the car. Wrong.

My experience with James was nothing short of frustrating and downright insulting. In my 10 minute conversation with him, he looked me in the eye twice, maybe three times, at the most. The rest of the time he was staring at his computer trying to convince me how great of a deal I was getting. He questioned my intelligence and was very dismissive of my feelings about the whole situation.  He used classy lines such as...

""I just don't get (why you're making such a big deal about this)""
""It's such a great deal, even if you paid to have the paint fixed you'd still come out on top""
""we replace windshields every day here in AZ, it's normal to have pits like that""
""too bad you don't live here, my guy can fix the paint chips for $100""
""the hood is aluminum so it won't rust (even though the chips have gone through the primer)""
""if you're asking me to take anything off the car I can't do it""

I never heard the words ""I'm sorry"" during my time there. I could tell Brett was in no position to reduce the price and James' smug face told me he knew I was a long way from home and that he was going to exploit my circumstance.

Was the price I paid still a good deal despite the flaws? Yes. Would I live through that ordeal again to buy the car at this price? Absolutely not. I'm going to give Brett the benefit of the doubt and believe that he simply didn't inspect the car as thoroughly as an anal person who cleans his car with a q-tip would. Brett gets a 3 star from me. James gets a solid 0. The finance manager also wasted my time trying to sell me his extended warranty/service plan and for insinuating I was financially irresponsible not taking him up on his offer. So 1 is an honest rating based on my first and absolutely last experience with this dealership.

I really wanted this to be my first positive experience at a dealership but I guess I will have to wait a little longer."
1,"I see everyone else gave this restaurant a high review, so perhaps I got them on a bad day.

I ordered the Tamale combo. It was obvious that it was microwaved and thrown in some sauce. The beef was extremely dry, it was refrigerator cold in the center and scorching hot on the ends. Very little flavor.

The rice wasn't cooked all the way so I kept getting hard rice chunks, then finally the beans were so watery that I couldn't eat them with a fork at all. I thought maybe I'd mix the beans and rice, maybe it would make it a consistency I could eat. 

Don't think I will be going back, the whole meal was bland, and lacking in flavor, but all had the same dirty grease taste to it, and how you get that with a tamale is beyond me. I didn't finish it, and didn't save it for left overs. Had I not purchased it as take out I would have returned it immediately after my 2nd bite, I even considered taking it back to the restaurant and telling them how bad it was..

Good to see that other people had good experiences, but I took a chance on a little place and it did not work for me at all!"
1,"I don't know if it was an off day or the time of day or what the issue was, but I didn't like these pretzels. I had been wanting to come by here for years and finally made it in. The amount of salt on these things was ridiculous. I like salt on pretzels, but this one had too much. After scraping off most of the salt, I went back to the pretzel. It was rubbery, cold, and difficult to get into manageable bites. Think of those microwave pretzels you get from Sam's or Costco. Now overheat one of those pretzels and put it in the refrigerator for an hour. THAT is what my five pretzels were like. I disposed of most of what I bought as inedible.

I am going to try one more time and stop in at opening time to see if that makes a difference."
1,never again will i ever purchase from this barney's.  i would rather order online or call another location to place a purchase.  the sales associates have no class or sense of customer service.  i originally purchased a pair of shoes that i discovered were a size to big.  so i called my sales person to try to locate another size.  he said he would try to locate a pair a size smaller and he would call me back.  me being impatient and the shoes being limited i decided to go searching myself.  i called beverly hills and they immediately located a pair in new york and shipped it the following day.  2 days later my sales person decides to call me back and lets me know he is still working on it and to let me know he has not forgotten me.  i don't understand the incompetence!!! it was understood he forgotten me....  not informing him i found the shoes myself i decided to already return the bigger size i purchased from him.  when i arrived he was not in so another gentleman helped me who was unbelievably rude.  he was wondering why i was returning the shoes as if he didn't want to help me so i vented my story.  he then says it's not right that i purchased it through beverly hills because now my original salesperson loses the commission.  i was PO!!! how dare he be so unprofessional.  if you want to do some real shopping go to la or ny barneys' not las vegas!! and bottom line Barney's las vegas needs more selections.
1,"This is usually my go to place since it's in my neighborhood. The same ladies usually work here and make the best drinks and are super friendly and attentive. Tonight was absolutely horrible. I walked in at the same time as another couple, sat at the bar and waited while the bartender presented them with menus AND made their drinks, never getting an acknowledgement at all. Finally, she comes over and asks if she can help me and I have to ask for a menu. Now, I typically order a mixed drink of theirs that has a smoked peach in it. It's pretty much the star of the drink. She looked at the menu multiple times because I don't think she knew how to make the drink and guess what? She dropped the lukewarm drink WITHOUT THE PEACH!!! I asked for it and she said they were out which would been helpful to know BEFORE she made the drink. What a huge disappointment. Maybe that's why I'm the only one here right now..."
1,"BEWARE : FOOD POISONING 




I went here looking for a good burger but what I got was disappointment on top of disappointment.  First the sweet potato fries were cold and soggy, the caramalized onions tasted burnt and old. The burgers were stale and hard to chew... Staff on duty behind the bar was rude and very cheap on giving ketchup packets. Last but not least I ended up getting food poisoning from here. Would I recommend or go back here again? NEVER !  You're better off going to baton rouge and paying the same price for AAA quality burger that won't disappoint."
1,"I usually visit this chick-fil-a at least 2-3 times a month because it is the closest to my house, but may be driving farther to go to a different location in the future. The last three times I have visited (always through the drive-through) the cashier has gotten my order wrong (either something completely wrong, or made incorrectly), even when they say it correctly back to you when you're ordering. 

The last time I was here I had ordered a milkshake with no cherry as I am allergic to them (which I also said), drove up to the window, and was handed a milkshake with a cherry on it. When I gave it back and let them know it was supposed to no cherry, I watched the cashier through the window pick the cherry out with a napkin and cover up the leftover juice with whipped cream, then give it back to me. After asking if it had been remade, the guy didn't know what to say and didn't answer me until I told him it needed to be remade and I had seen him just pick it out with a napkin. 

Fast forward two weeks later, my husband and I are at chick-fil-a again, and we order a grilled nugget meal. Pulling up to the window, we are now given a regular (breaded) nugget meal. When we asked about it and gave it back to them, the cashier (who didn't apologize) informed us they would need to charge an additional $0.80 for the price difference. Seriously? So now we're again waiting for several minutes for the correct food after getting the wrong order. The service as this chick-fil-a used to be great, but lately is seems like all of the workers are high school kids wanting to gossip and hang out without paying attention to helping customers or doing their job. Judging from the other recent yelp reviews, we're not the only people this has happened to. The service/management at this store really needs to get it together."
1,"Every single time we have an issue especially in the drive thru.... they rush you when taking your order, cram all of your food in 1 bag, make your order incorrectly or forget parts of your order before pushing you through to get to the next person.I have tried to give them the benefit and go back but its a reoccurring issue.

Last time I stopped and checked the order and with no surprise we were missing a sandwich - I went back in and spoke to a manager who was unapologetic and rude demanding a receipt when I had just pulled off the drive through, I explained this is a reoccurring issue and he directed me to the wall to get information if I would like to let the operator know.

The management needs to get it together - Don't waste your time go to somewhere that cares about your business. Plenty of other options in that area."
1,"I have been a loyal discount tire customer for many, many years. Because of Kevin, the manager here, I will never go to this location again. My mom purchased new tires on her car a week ago after getting a flat. They never gave her an invoice, yet the  TPMS light was still on so she brought it back today to have it fixed. The guy there gave her the run-around and she came back with her light still on. When I talked to Kevin, he told me he couldn't diagnose the problem with the car not being there. Frustrated, I told him we've already been there twice and still no answers. At that point he started giving me attitude but finally calmed down after speaking with his associate. I confronted him about his attitude with me and reminded him as a manager, it's his job to maintain professionalism. He told me that his guy said the two rear sensors were bad, but to bring the car in and he would replace them for free. My mom brought the car back for the third time, Kevin acknowledged her and told his guy to bring the car back and replace any bad sensors. When the car was done, he told my mom it was going to be $97! He then embarrassed and belittled her in front of the whole store and told her ""nothing is for free"". He then lied and told her that he told me he would give me a 40% discount, not free. That was a complete lie. Why wouldn't he have given her an estimate with a dollar amount prior to doing any work if that was the case? Regardless, the tpms light is still on and  he now says that the problem is with the dealership."
1,"Bad! Our second visit and we were just as disappointed as the first time. Maybe even worse. My hamburger must have been cooked and reheated several times because when I got it, it was burnt all around the outer edge. The only part that was edible was a loonie size circle in the middle of the burger. I sent it back and of course my family was all done eating by the time I got my new burger. Tried it twice, never again!"
1,"I decided to try this place because it had many high scores from people. My daughter found this place. We all were craving Menudo with toasted, buttery bolio bread.  Walked in and several people were eating the menudo. Ordered my menudo with iced tea and my toasted bread. Served us some salsa and chips. Those tasted good. Then I received my food. Looked good - then my first taste was okay what is that taste. It wasnt spicey. So I added more crushed chili and salt. Then tried it again. Yup, I was very disappointed.  The menudo had a smokey flavor to it. Not smokey like burnt taste. But it was made to taste smokey. Yuk! I couldnt finish it. My tea was horrible.  Tasted like it had been sitting in a dirty pot that hasn't been washed. We thought it was the sweet n low sugar. But it wasn't. I give this place thumbs down! :("
1,I've previously gone to this place and it has been very good but I went today with the family and the drinks were tasteless and mildly cold. My tea latte was bland and did not originally have steamed milk in it (duh that's what a latte is!) My husbands chai tasted like hot water and my kids hot cocoa was just steamed milk with a dribble of cocoa. Very disappointing! Clearly the women working totally did not give a darn because when I asked for milk in my latte she didn't even bother to steam it. She just poured it in from the fridge. We won't be back. One bad drink I could handle. But 4? Come on people! Get it together!
1,"I walked in to Barneys last Saturday with the Chanticalle counter in mind. I have purchased all my Chantacalle products through Barneys as this cosmetic line is rather upscale.  I tried on product as i waited for the sales associate to finish with a customer. I wanted to purchase the Vital Essence Serum which is a fabulous face serum smelling of roses and to ask the price of the Stress Repair Concentrate. I was dressed down, (110 degrees in Vegas) and not a soul would come to me at the counter. After 5 minutes of looking over at the black booted associate and her buddy chat, i simply walked away, mentioned to one of the men working a tie counter and said--""those women just lost a commision for ignoring me."" His jaw dropped, (long-haired Asian man, extremely nice) and said, ""Please let me walk you over there"" to which i replied, ""No, I am not going to make such an easy sale for them.""
I happily went to Sephora and spent my money there. Discrimination anyone? I say yes.  So, I shredded my Barneys card when I got home."
1,"they tried to tell me I needed 4 new tires when I hadn't had the tires on my truck for a year yet tread was fine, said they couldnt let me leave with my tires in the state they where in, it was unsafe, I just went in for a balance and rotation, I ended up going to another discount tire and they said my tires where fine, I have been buy the same tires for my truck for teh past ten years and never had an issue, I wonder how many other people they tricked into buying tires that didn't need them."
1,"Nasty, nasty place. Don't go. The atmosphere is such a cute vibrant idea but that's where the thrill stops. For and service and price are all"
1,"Incompetent, rude, offensive, and zero responsibility. I've been a discount customer for a long time but this location is horrible."
1,I am very upset as I write this review.. i ordered my Food to go and I get home and it is nothing I ordered and the food looks and tastes reheated.. i won't be coming back ever! Service was horrible.
1,We have purchased tires here for a coUple of our vehicles and experienced great service and honesty up till today.  My son took his truck in for balance and a leak repair on tires he bought there.  He called first then dropped off the truck.  He calleda couple hours later and they returned the call that his truck was finished and good to go.  When he got there no work had been done.  He asked and was told it was all done but when he questioned them the rep  said the tire with the leak had an issue and they couldn't do anything l. They never called and they led us to believe it was fixed.  Then told us we could buy new tires.  We won't be back.  Too bad the current employees lost sight of customer service.
1,Worst service ever. Dined in and got no straws after ordering two drinks and also NO napkins . Won't drive thru service is better I definitely won't Dine in again.
1,"I used to love Jukebox but after today's meal, all I can say is ""it was nice while it lasted"".

That was the dryest, most flavorless burger I've ever had. The cook didn't even bother getting the patty all on the bun, but just slapped everything together in a sloppy, careless mess.

The fries were way overcooked (it used to come with curly but those are now an extra $$).

The bun was plain, untoasted and there was no tomato (there was supposed to be).

$18 for overpriced cardboard."
1,"I always give this place a chance in hopes to get a better service.. but it's always a disappointment. Their food is usually really good. Except today, we got a side of fruit salad and all the grapes were moldy and rotten. We mentioned it to our sever and she just said she will let them know. Manager didn't even come out to apologize, our server didn't even apologize and gave zero care. She was very short with us and very miserable. I was being polite the whole time but she just gave us a terrible service. Also, they told us they took out the grapes out of the fruit salad.. I said ""well, the grapes were covered in mold and you're going to just take the grapes out and serve rest of the fruit?"" And she ignored me and left. Someone is going to get sick... Will not be going back to waffles inc."
1,"I have had ALOT of bad experiences at this location but this is ridiculous. Ordered a #2 chicken sandwich... I get this?? How do you forget the bun?! Honestly I'm just going to start driving the 20 minutes to the Deer valley location because between this stupid shit, last time I didn't get my fries and paid for them (with NO Return phone call from the manager), and the terrible ATTITUDES from the children that work there (I thought maybe I was being petty but apparently this is a thing here)... I'm over it. Get it together Chick-fil-A, or at least learn ACTUAL customer service when you f up."
1,"Btw, it's been 2 years and never heard anything from corporate or the store. They just don't care about customer service. They have not address the issue of being profiled. At least have the courtesy to respond."
1,The staff does not follow proper sanitary guidelines when washing dishes and preparing food. I've seen different staff members neglect to wear gloves while preparing food on multiple occasions. There are cockroaches everywhere. Staff is condescending
1,"Always to go this Chick-fil-A location since it's closer to my place. Ordered through drive-thru spicy deluxe sandwich, they read me back the order at the pick up window and my receipt also shows spicy deluxe and label on the sandwich box also shows spicy deluxe. Came back and opened the box and it's grilled sandwich, how come the order go wrong at three different check points. Is this way u run a successful franchise with bunch of folks who does not know how to run the process flow for delivering a simple order. Management needs to wake up at least now, also see bunch of reviews the same way.

Got to drive back again and change my order...staff inside have no clue how this happened and they apologize just because they got to say something.

Bunch of lazy folks with no focus on customer service are running this location. Stay away !!!"
1,"We have been here a lot, but on Friday night (April 22)  we went, all three of us got sick right after when we got home. We had a few sushi/maki and the orange and teriyaki chicken. Something was off on the taste that day, maybe they served us old food. We have been there regularly and never had this experience. But unfortunately we won't be going there again nor recommending it like I used to. Such a shame, their food was really good, but not worth it if they have chosen to lower their quality of food."
1,"I waited 3.5 hours on Saturday for them to change my tire and they said it was done, then charged me $200 and not one thing changed on my car the same tires were still on there!!!"
1,"I called to place an order. The lady who answered the phone was very rude and kept putting me on hold , not completing my order. I came in person to place my order and the server was extremely rude.  The food is good here. Unfortunately the service is not"
1,"I was very excited about a new place to try on Taco Tuesday.  I found their FB page and a beautiful flyer featuring their 3 options for the $1 Taco Tuesday deal.  At the bottom of the flyer, it lists take out as an option.  This made La Unica my choice for the day over the other taco spot I go to.

Unfortunately, when I arrived, I was told that the tacos were dine-in only.  Since I'd found the flyer on line, I had already made plans to just grab tacos and meet up with someone else after, so we couldn't dine-in this particular day.  That being said, we often do dine-in at places around town, and we love patio seating. We would definitely have come-back to La Unica in the future to sit down and eat, had they handled this differently. 

The waitress looked at the flyer I was showing her, and called her manager. The manager agreed that the flyer I was looking at was very confusing as it did list take out on the fire. She went to speak with the owner, and returned briefly after. She agreed that it was a confusing flyer, but restated that the tacos were in fact only dine-in for $1.

I decided to just go back-to my usual taco spot where I can get them take out for $1 only.  This threw a wrench in my plans and set me behind, timewise, for the rest of my night.  I am disappointed in the way that they handled the situation, being in marketing and the service industry, myself. I know it isn't always great to have to discount something, but if they would have handled the situation differently, they could have made a patron for life out of my friends and I."
1,"Haven't been here in a while and boy did the food take a turn for the worst. I ordered the Franky it's a reg burger with poutine as the side. The burger was over cooked and dry/tasteless I had to drench it in ketchup and a bit of mustard to be able to eat it...spoilers I didn't finish it. Did the poutine come to the rescue...No! It was just awful, fries were mushy and the gravy meh a bit on the salty side. As for service our waiter was ok had a few jokes but no drink refills or anything like that. There was a ton of kids tonight and they were playing with the Jukebox, couldn't really hear the music but stuff like that doesn't bother me for those who are allergic to kids beware."
1,"This was my favorite place for breakfast. However today, I ordered the benny. It was ice cold. I asked for my bacon crispy, but it was also cold and limp. The potatoes were good, but cold.  My friend told the waitress she doesn't like oniond but the dish she suggested was filled with them. And cold. Our dishes shoulda been warm.  I have had better meals for less at dennys"
1,"After a long day at work and didn't feel like cooking dinner so I decided to pick up some Chick-Fil-A on my way home. I get there around 6:30 to a FULL drive-thru. After waiting almost 15mins in the drive-thru line alone I get to order and quickly get my food. I pull out of the plaza and stop less than a block away at a red light so I decide to check my food. I clearly noticed I had someone else's order because it was not even close to mine. I make and immediate u-turn and return to the still very long drive-thru line. I finally get to the order speaker and explain what happened. I'm asked to pull up to the window and a very youth and confused teenager tries to make it seem like I'm wrong because that's what I ordered and paid for like it said in the receipt. By now I'm steaming mad and ask for a manager. The manager with plenty of attitude takes the wrong food back and gives me my correct order. I ask her what about the difference between what I paid and what my correct order was because I noticed my correct order was less expensive. I told her I didn't need the change and asked if I could get a brownie to make up the difference they owed me + the hassle. She quickly responded something like ""the brownie is $1.39 and the difference we owe you is only $.38 cents so you will have to pay the difference plus tax."" I was shocked and lost for words at the awful customer service I was getting from one of my favorite fast food places. After a few seconds of feeling like I was going to have a stroke from the anger I finally managed to ask for my $.38 cents back which she quickly gave to me. Since I have yet to eat at any Chick-Fil-A
because my pride don't let me give a single penny to that company. I tell this factual story to any one who will listen because I cant believe Chick-Fil-A lost a life time customer over $1.01+tax."
1,"I hate to give a one star review. The servers were very nice; unfortunately they were very inattentive. They got an order wrong and barely checked on us; I was parched all through our Wednesday night dinner. I got the arroz con pollo, and it was more than disappointing. After searching for the chicken and rice in my meal, I was left with an actual half a plate of just onion. I won't be going back."
1,"Gross bathroom, and dirty play area. I go to many locations, never seen one that makes McDonald's seem clean. Until now. Play area had chunks missing in floor.  Changing station looked to be on its last leg.  Over disgusting.  
Had to ask for sauces, never at any other location. Just seemed odd, kept behind counter. .unlike other locations.  Sauce theft an issue here? I won't return to this location ever."
1,"Went in today intending to buy something for my birthday only to encounter the most indifferent, rude and ridiculous sales staff ever.  Having been a long term customer of Barneys New York in New York, I was shocked and angered by the attitude of the staff in a completely empty store.  No wonder no one wants to spend money there.  I took my money and spent it else where!  Never again."
1,"We were really excited to try this place ever since we found out it would replace Loco Lime (which by the way was pretty decent). We arrived on Monday night and realized we were the only ones in the restaurant (never a good sign). We were greeted and asked immediately if we wanted drinks, so we ordered a Jalapeño Margarita and a house margarita, which were on special. We were also given some chips and salsa. Let me break down our experience:

Margaritas: The Jalapeño did not have much kick to it, but it was drinkable. Unfortunately, as mine (house margarita) was being made I noticed that our waitress and another waitress were sampling different combinations and looked very confused about how to mix the ingredients. Needless to say it tasted like coconut water, so they definitely did not get it right. 

Food: Chips were extremely greasy, salsa was sub par. We ordered the cheese dip, which was pretty good but again could not take down anymore of the extremely greased-up chips. We ordered the steak quesadilla and no lie, within 2 minutes we received it from the kitchen. I have to say we make better quesadillas at home. The cheese wasn't even melted inside and it was extremely small (was also not cut).

Service- our waitress was really nice, but it was interesting to note that the other waitresses were sitting at the bar, chatting and on their phones. 

We will never be back here. Azteca brings much more to the table and it's worth the drive. I hate to be a pessimist, but I can't imagine this place will stay open very long."
1,"Wow this place is bad! My dad ordered a waffle with fried egg on top. Seems pretty simple. Instead he gets an omelette with fried egg on top (wtf). The server didn't apologize once. Everybody at the table ordered toast and they didn't pre-butter it. No problem, so we asked for butter. Server brings 2 cups of melted butter (wtf). I guess you pour the butter on the toast? Or dip it? Either way the food was a glorified Denny's. I almost never give bad reviews but this was just horrible. Stay far away"
1,"Really poor service. It took way to long to get our drinks, foods, and checks and it wasn't even crowded. The food was greasy and clearly not well made.

Honestly, it gets worst.
We were seated in a booth by the kitchen, and it smelled disgusting. On top of that, the booth was too high off of the ground and I was wearing a cashmere sweater and I had to lean forward so much that my back ached, and combined with the incredibly long wait, my elbows started to burn because the cashmere was creating a rash from learning over so much.

Also my legs began to ache because they were disproportional to the ground.

I feel like crying."
1,"This is extreme to have to yelp. But it's that bad. Simple problem: wife is allergic to pickles. 3 out or 4 visits had pickles on her chicken sandwich. Wasted money since we live 5 mles away. Called the 3rd time. Mgr Said too busy to talk to me. I left my name and number. No call back. Called again, no mgr available. Placed an online complaint. No call back. Just received an email asking how my complaint was resolved. Filled out survey saying it was never resolved. No call back. At all. From anyone. You turned a simple complaint that was your fault into a loss of $80 a week on sales. Good job chick-fil-a. I'm completely done and so is my family. I hope you reprimand and terminate your terrible regional and general manager. They don't care about their customers obviously. I tried 5 times now, with not one call back. The survey asking how my complaint was resolved ess the biggest slap in the face. Not cool."
1,"In a half empty restaurant, we were told that even though we could be seated, it would probably be at least 30 minutes before we would be served because they only have 6 waffle makers. How does a WAFFLE restaurant only have the capacity to make 6 waffles at a time, when that's essentially the only thing they serve?  That might get you through on a Tuesday, but Saturday morning during brunch time you're basically turning away customers who will never come back given the plethora of options."
1,"After being open for a month, obviously still a lot to be improved. it took an hour to get food! The cappuccino was mostly milk, not even drinkable, blueberries used in waffle were likely canned. ""House made syrup"" was just sugar water. Eggs and tomatoes were tasty, but not worth the hassles.  They gave us coupons for free meals at the end because it was such a disaster, but we won't go back. Also be aware that there is no diaper changing station."
1,"So good, I love the popcorn and milkshakes with a poutine!

1,Decided to try a new place today . This establishment is run very poorly . From the moment I stepped into the restaurant until I left I was very unhappy . The greeting at the door was very unfriendly . The waitress took awhile to get our drink orders and seemed bothered to take care of us . Once the food came it was ok but the atmosphere just made me want to hurry up and get out of here . This is not a place I would put on my favorite list too pricey for the less than acceptable service . I won't return not worth the aggravation .
1,Had a horrible experience at this location. Was given wrong order at the drive through. When we got home we realized it. Called the restaurant and they wouldn't acknowledge their mistake. Asked to speak to manager and they wouldn't connect us. STAY AWAY FEOM THIS LOCATION!!!
1,"This work order says it all! I told them exactly what I wanted. They failed! I had to argue with them to cross rotate my tires like the work order said and told them to leave the air pressure alone, I just set it to the OEM spec. Two days prior but they inflated my tires 5 psi over what the damn paper work recommend! This has happened multiple times with different locations! This job isn't hard! I've done it for a few years a while back! Not hard to read!"
1,Someone pease tell me why is my cheese over my sandwich instead of inside the sandwich? Did someone missed that part of training?
1,"Worst service I have ever experienced. I had to ask for my check before the food came out that I asked to have boxed up to eat at home. Server walked up after we walked to the bar to get drinks after waiting for 15 minutes to be greeted. I know it was cinco de mayo, however this is the third time I have been here and it is never ""decent"" service. I will never come again and I would not recommend anyone coming."
1,"We've been there a few times; willing to give the place another shot but, that's it.  The sweet potato fries were a disaster, the burger was nothing special and I'm sorry but the milkshake was average, at best, but the real problem is the noise level.  Intolerable; we couldn't have a conversation .  Not worth the money."
1,"Went there a few weeks back and they forgot to put my sandwich in my bag. I called and let the manager know who took my name and advised me she would replace my meal for me. I go back today and guess what,  she made me Pay for my meal...she gave me a free sandwich..lol..I told her it wasn't FREE because I had already paid for it....now were talking a kids meal..nothing outrageous....but was rude and didn't care if I am getting screwed....I told her I was going to call Corporate and she told me go ahead she didn't care...Well they not only lost my business at this location...I will post this so people will go somewhere else. What a liar for a manager!"
1,"This Barney's is pretty sizable and has a decent selection of clothes, bags, cosmetics, and accessories. If it weren't for the terrible service, I would've given this place 4 stars. When I was here on a Saturday, it was completely empty and there were about 3 salespeople available near the handbags. I came in knowing the exact bag I was going to drop some major cash on, but I guess my appearance didn't impress the salespeople enough for them to give me their time. I'm positive they saw me standing around the bags too. Hello?! I'm not feeling up handbags for 20 minutes just for sh*ts and giggles. 

I've been to other locations with staff that were far more helpful and friendly, so I'm super disappointed with the customer service here. I ended up just going home and ordering the bag online from a different stockist."
1,"The chef pretended he knew what gluten was. He did not. I have Celiac Disease so this went horribly. I asked him and the waitress 5 times about the ingredients. They verified it was only rice, avacodo and cucumber with salmon. The chef decided to add in tofu with soy sauce for some odd reason without disclosing it to me, despite my continual asking of verification. He did not know that wheat contains gluten when I mentioned the soy sauce. He was surprised. I even brought my OWN gluten free soy sauce from home to avoid this problem as a condiment. Wasted effort. Sigh."
1,"Bad survice and bad experience. Much lower than my expectation, the cook is not dedicated at all, so the food is not what good veggie food should be like."
1,"We have been taking our vehicles to this location for years without any problem.  On our last occasion we came home with a broken spare tire assembly.  When told of this the store manager, Frank McLaughlin, said the service that changed the tire broke it and his store were not responsible.  That would have been fine if we'd been told that up front.  By not finding out about it until after we left the store led us to believe Discount had damaged the assembly and was trying to hide it.  The store offered to pay half.  We told them that was unacceptable and if they want our continued business they'd take care of it all.  The difference was $100.  The store manager, Frank McLaughlin, declined.  So, he's now lost 3 vehicles worth of continuing business over $100.  Mr. McLaughlin can comment on this post all he wants but he blew it over a measly $100.  I'll never set foot in another Discount tire shop and I urge all who read this to do the same.  I'm letting everyone I come into contact with know as well."
1,"In response to the owners response...I deleted my original review of the E. Carson downtown location and moved it to the Wexford location which is where I dined. We ordered what we wanted, clearly stating a waffle with fried egg on top. Never once mentioned ""the carnivore"". The server placed the order wrong. You making more excuses for bad service verify's my original 1-star review. I am clearly within Yelp's guidelines as well"
1,We are regular customers at this establishment and the wait staff and ownership are very unpleasant. We have a recurring issue where we prefer to have a 1/4 pound hamburger patty with a whole wheat bun. We offered to pay a supplement but nevertheless they  continue to refuse our request. We will stop coming here and spend at other restaurants who appreciate our presence.
1,"Probably the worst customer service experience I have ever had at a restaurant. Service was extremely slow. They were busy. Food was mediocre at best. I've had better Eggo waffles than what we had. The waffles had absolutely no taste to them. It was like eating soggy bread. We got one refill of coffee while there for an hour. We each got a half a cup and they were full of grounds.

I would have complained, but there is a story behind that. One of the servers whacked my wife in the back of the head with a heavy serving plate. It left a large welt on the back of her head and was very painful. When the ""manager"" finally made her way over to us to ""apologize"" once she was done talking to her friends, she left. Not that I was looking for anything, but she sent the server over later to tell us she was giving us 10% off our meal because of the trouble.

I was more insulted by that, than the accident. What if this had been a senior citizen or a child. Maybe you shouldn't seat people behind the serving pick up line where they are in danger. We only think you were a little bit hurt, so here is $3 off. We will not return.

I did forget to mention that the manager brought us a fruit bowl about 30 minutes later.

I did speak with the owner, and he offered us a do-over. Over a week has passed, I guess he is not going to follow through on his promises, as the gift certificate he said he would send has not arrived."
1,"I'm never coming to this location again.  The lady literally burped the second she opened the window to give me the food. She also gave me the wrong order and I didn't get a chance to look at it until I got home. I called to let them know they gave me the wrong order and the manager offered to fix the order if I drove back to the location,  but it wasn't worth my gas money to drive back."
1,"So I had a barney's gift card and it turns out that there was fraud and that someone? (maybe who knows) had used my card so I had a balance of $0. The staff were helpful but they couldn't do anything about it so they called the manager, Jack Smith. I must tell you Jack is the worst possible human being I have met in retail. He looked pissed the entire time and he didn't even greet me. The first thing he told me was to move out from the cashier section (Which I was invited inside by the staff to look at the computer). He than proceeded to tell me that I have to contact the New York store (remember we are in NEVADA) to resolve the card problem (how? the card is with me, so I should fly all the way to New York?). So I asked him if they can help me call the New York office and he said no he will not. He was an absolute jerk the whole time and almost ruined my Las Vegas experience. Will never shop at Barneys anymore (I used to shop a lot here hence the gift card) Would give 0 stars if possible. Go to the Neiman Marcus store on the same street, service is 100x better."
1,"I am extremely disappointed with the customer service!!!! After a stressful blow out on the 202 freeway, my first instincts was to call Discount Tire for a replacement, since I had purchased tires from them twice before. I was quoted one price over the phone, which had convinced me to drive down to the shop on my donut. When I arrived I was told that the total price was going to be an additional $50, not including the warranty. Not only was I floored at the increase in price, but I was also told by Joey that I needed to replace another tire ASAP, since the tread was at a 4. I walked outside and started to shop around to other local businesses. I did end up going elsewhere, where they charged me the actual price quoted, which was in turn cheaper than Discount. In addition, the competitor informed me that the thread on my other three tires were just fine, none were even close to a 4, but instead all an 8. I will not be returning due to the dishonesty when I was in a vulnerable state. Big O Tires surpassed your customer service 100%!"
1,"El restaurante tiene  buena comida pero es inconsistente en las porciones y servicio. Era una cliente semanal al menos una o dos veces. Pero después de ser ignorada mientras dos parejas q sentaron después de mi, fueran atendidas con  bebidas, salsas y chips es imposible  q no nos vieran. nos ignoraron totalmente a tal punto q nos levantamos y salimos sin nadie q se nos acercará a preguntar q pasaba. No vuelvo a ir y tampoco lo recomiendo."
1,"This was probably the absolute worst service experience I have ever witnessed! I work in the service industry and am a forgiving person that's gets you may be busy or having an off day but my experience tonight was so bad all we could do was laugh. 
If I could give multiple ratings I'd give the food a 3, it was actually pretty tasty. 
The drinks, a 2, for an authentic restaurant the obvious lack of fresh juices in a margarita is a bit beneath you, yea?

Service a ZERO! We sat and weren't greeted for about 5 minutes, that's forgivable. The server then took our drink orders and appetizers. We then sat without drinks, alcohol and water included, for at least 15 minutes. No exaggeration required. Our food was then brought out, nothing of which we had ordered, so the food runner went back to the kitchen and minutes later our server brought the correct dishes. After the drop she NEVER came back. Literally. NEVER. My boyfriend, beer empty, finally went to the bar to get another round. About 10 to 15 minutes later, meal finished, still no sign of her. What appeared to be a manager came by and picked up a plate. We asked for our check, he said ok he'd be right back. That NEVER happened.... About 10 minutes later I finally went to the bar and asked the bartender for our check. He went looking for the waitress and he couldn't even find her... He finally came and sat down at the table and wrote down what we had ordered then re rang it under his name at the bar. 

What makes this story even crazier, I ran into a friend on the way out and before I could even speak he said that was the absolute worst dining experience he'd ever had. Not sure if we had the same waitress...

We will not be back."
1,"Bait and switch- twice. On my first trip, I ordered a tallboy beer $3 off the menu. She brought me a 12oz draft that cost a dollar more. I told her I wanted the large can and she said they didn't have it and walked away. I didn't complain. 

Fast forward two months- decided to give it another try. I ordered the chicken soup ($10). On the menu above the dish, it said the items come with salad, fries and rice. Mine did not, and when I brought it to my servers attention she said it did not come with that. I argued, pointing out it said in the menu the dish came with sides. She did not concede. After graciously accepting the check, I told her we would never come back. She spoke to her manager about it and he offered to give me 10% on my next visit. I declined their offer and will not return.

Overall the food is pretty good, but portions are nothing to brag about and service is abysmal. There's too many other very good taquerias nearby to waste your time with this one."
1,"Here's the truth. There is no inside seating, and the outside seating is limited to two small tables on a noisy, high traffic street. The pretzels were all cold - even the ones we asked them to heat. Service was also ""cold"" and unhelpful, and the cashier seemed as though we were bothering her by asking questions.

I had a chicken salad sandwich on a pretzel bun ... Nothing special. My husband had a cheeseburger roll that was cold, even though he asked that it be heated.  We had to ask for dipping sauce as it was not offered to us.

This is a place to maybe pick up some pretzels to take home and heat up ... Definitely not a lunch place as some have suggested."
1,Made me leave my beer to go to the bathroom. Been roofied by so many bartenders and employees not a good look. Prob won't be returning
1,"Definitely not a place to go for food - maybe for drinks but this food was tasteless, bland, and not something I want to experience again. Just go to Azteca on Woodlawn."
1,"Definitely not a place to go for food - maybe for drinks but this food was tasteless, bland, and not something I want to experience again. The ambience is very cool, they have a nice patio area and the inside is spacious but still intimate. Unfortunately the service was not as fast or attentive as what I am used to and didn't know much about the menu. Again the food was the worst I've had while in Charlotte. The only thing that was worth any time was the spicy salsa and chips which you could buy at Walmart. The area that the restaurant is in is in a growing neighborhood of Plaza Midwood which is great but this place does not hold a. Andre to other restaurants in the area. Just go to Azteca on Woodlawn."
1,"The service here is just lousy.  I came here looking for a pair of tights because I didn't want to go to the Fashion Show mall and Barney's - in my experience - has great quality and helpful service.  Not here.  I wandered around downstairs and upstairs before I found someone to help me.  She said, ""Well, we only have Wolford.."", and I said "" Great, I love Wolford"", and she looked at me like she doubted I could afford it.  Here is where my real complaint arises.  I said I needed a black pair of tights and tried to find them while the salesperson just opened drawers and left it up to me to find anything, all the while asking if I was done.  Long story short I ended up with a nice pair of tights in the wrong color.  Must be nice not to need repeat customers."
1,"Cinco de Mayo at La Unica-Plaza Midwood was, hands down, the WORST dining experience of my life.

We were going with a fairly large group (10 people), so my friend called and made a reservation two weeks in advance. Whoever she talked to said ""no problem"" and gave her the impression that a reservation was scheduled. She later emailed La Unica to confirm the reservation and received no response. Therefore, she went to the restaurant in person to confirm the reservation and was told no reservations would be taken for Cinco de Mayo. I don't know if the original person she talked to had a language barrier or a policy was not set in a timely manner, but that should not have occurred. She asked what we should do to get seating and they told her just arrive 15-20 minutes early.

Our group arrived at the restaurant at 6:15 and were not seated until 7:45. By that point, we were starving and in bad moods. We were also annoyed that our original reservation was not honored. The reason it took so long to get seated is because there were only specific booths that would accommodate our group (which ended up being 7 people) and other customers were lingering. Restaurant staff should have politely explained the situation to those guests to motivate them to stand up or leave. We also presented alternate options to get seated faster such as pushing other tables together or splitting our group up and our suggestions were brushed off by the hostesses.

Once we got a table, some of us had to stand and wait while they scrounged up some chairs for us. Our table was also slanted and only stayed straight if I leaned on it.

Once we were seated, it took 45 minutes to get our drinks after asking about them 2-3 times. We asked the waitress approximately 3 times to please take our food order and she kept saying ""in a minute"" or ""please wait."" So, we did not get to put our orders in until about 8:45 p.m. People who were seated after us got their food before us. By 9:45, we had not received our food and just asked for our food to be boxed and for our checks to be brought.

At one point, I presented the above facts to a manager. She did not seem particularly concerned and did not do anything to remedy the situation. Talking to us or comping some of our food would have been nice. Instead, the overworked waitress muttered some half-hearted apology.

After waiting an obscene amount of time for food and checks, we eventually got up and left the restaurant. We did not want to just walk out like that, but we felt we had no choice, having lives and jobs to attend to.

So, in sum, we were at La Unica nearly four hours and were seated for over two hours with NO FOOD. I understand it was busy and a holiday, but it was beyond ridiculous! It left a bad taste in my mouth. 

We left extremely disappointed, woozy, and hangry. We would have been better off with some lime-a-ritas and Taco Bell in a parking lot."
1,"So we ordered food from here via a 3rd party delivery service. They delivered our food promptly and within the suggested time. However, they missed some items. So we called the restaurant to let them know of the missing items. The staff member who answered the phone said that they can fix and properly fulfill our order. To do so, we would have to come by the restaurant to pick it up which doesn't make any sense since we ordered for delivery for a reason. In response, the staff member then tried to blame the error of not fulfilling the order on the delivery service. So, instead of trying to fix the problem, the staff member thought it would be better to not fulfill what we ordered and tried the blame game on somebody else. Denying accountability when it is clear that the error lies with you, is not what I would call even decent customer service. We will be ordering from here again."
1,"Avoid! Went with my sister, waited almost 30 minutes to be seated (because ""the kitchen was behind"", there were plenty of seats available) even though we were told 5-10. Host never returned even though more people came in after us. 

When we sat down we were greeted by a rude waiter who was also covering the drink / milkshake / sundae station. We both ordered Pepsis. He came back about 10 minutes later with a Pepsi and a glass of water. Took another 5 to get that fixed.

By the time we ordered I had finished my drink and decided to see how long it would take to get a refill without asking - timed 35 minutes, after which I ended up asking another waitress because our waiter was MIA. Shortly after we got our food. 

My burger was barely edible - the meat was decent but the bun smelled and tasted too gluten-y, I ended up not eating the bun. I also ordered a poutine for an extra $3. It was the Susie-Q fries, cheese curds and sauce. It was so cold it seemed like it came straight out of the walk in. Because our waiter never returned to ask how everything was, I ended up asking the first person I saw for a new one (ended up being the manager or something) and got the replacement in about 5 minutes. The poutine was bland. I didn't even finish it.

As far as the restaurant itself, my sister had a broken seat (akin to a rocking chair, the seat of her side of the mini-booth wasn't bolted down). The music was a mixture of modern pop (top 40) and Christmas (even though it has already passed). The bar area is too close to the mini-booths - a large group came in and were practically standing on us while waiting for their seats. 

All in all I paid 18.17$ after tax. The food was bad but the service was worse. Even McDonalds is better."
1,"I put in an order for pickup at 7:50p and was told it would be 10 minutes and I didn't receive my order until 8:30p. I stood and waiting by the hostess stand for 25 minutes waiting on my order and before I could even speak to a manager, the hostess ran away and didn't even offer an apology. Poor customer service."
1,"There are a lot of food choices in the Valley. Moreover, there are quite a few Chick-fil-A's to choose from. That being said, I would highly recommend you NOT spend your money at this Chick-fil-A. I ran through the drive thru one day with my kids and ordered lunch (I hadn't been to this location in years). We asked for 3 ranch and 3 chick-fil-a sauces with our meal. When we got up to the pay window the girl informed me that we'd have to pay for the extra sauces (they only give you 2). Ok, no problem. But then she rolls her eyes and gives me the snottiest attitude about it. She says ""yeah, it's because, you know, people like this (me) who order to much sauce"". Ummmm....sayeth what?! Chick-fil-A is typically the Ruth's Chris of fast food but this location is more like a dirty Burger King. Take my advice and Spend your hard earned money at a different Chick-fil-A."
1,"I have to travel to Vegas for work at least twice a year. One of the things I look forward to is stopping by Barney's (I don't gamble). Anyways, on my last trip to CES earlier this month my buddy and I had the worst, and I mean the worst, experience. Let's just say I'm never ever ever going back to this store. 
The two of us decided to go and when we got there the place is empty...I mean we were the only customers on the men's floor...no one else (at the time of arrival)...yet there were about 3 workers standing around...and guess what? They decided they did not want to help us...at all!! About 10 minutes in to shopping my buddy wanted to buy his pomade. He stood at that counter for at least 5 minutes before he had to walk over to the register, which was in plain sight of the counter, and asked for help. Well, let's just say she was not helpful and rude. After he pays, I'm looking at some pomade as well and there was samples for some and not for all. Well, since I was just being watched like a hawk, but not being helped, I decided crack it open to see the consistency. After being in the store for at least 25 minutes the same rude girl that helped my buddy rushes over to me and asks, ""are you going to buy that?"" WHAT THA F***!!!??????!!!!! These are the first words out the mouth of someone that is suppose to be there to help you??? 
I take a deep breath and calmly say, ""oh, no...just wanted to see the consistency and smell of the product"". Well, little did I know that hidden in the back of the bottom shelf was the sample for this product...not in the right place...but if she was doing her job then this would not have happened. I then ask her about another product...""do you have a sample of this one?"" She looks, can't find one, then opens the box and cracks open a fresh one...omg!!! So I calmly ask her, ""are you going to buy that?"" My buddy started cracking up of course...and she looked dumb. I said, ""doesn't feel good going the other way huh?""  I walk away from her and continued to shop. I grabbed the original product I was looking at to purchase and a bag that I was interested in buying and decide to go to the level below because I did not want to work with this lady. I had no desire to work with someone that's lazy and rude. Well, as my buddy and I proceed to walk down the stairs she literally stops me and says, ""you can't take that stuff down there""...I said, ""what??? Are you serious??"" And she was serious...so I told her she was rude and explained to her why she was rude and proceeded to the next level despite what she said. I make it to next the sales register and ask to speak to a manager. 
After all that happened in NYC with racial profiling this still happens...even in Vegas????!?!?!?  I'm black and buddy is Mexican...I'm the last guy to play this card, but I have no other explanation on why this would've happened. I will also be taking this complaint to the headquarters and see what they have to say too. Such a bummer...such a bummer..."
1,"I was a hankering some Mexican food, basic fare ya know!  Well, YELP listed Mucho Taco...so why not!  My first impression walking the through the door was somewhat mixed.  The tables were all stacked with dirty plates with the exception of one table.  Now, one could suppose they had a busy lunch time and the food is good, or not.  I chose to think it was good food and a busy location.

I placed my order and was provided chips and salsa to snack on while waiting for my meal.  My dish arrived shortly and the food was OK, nothing memorable as I cannot even remember what I ordered.  What does stand out is the counter help was cleaning the tables and the following was observed.

My first few bites were OK, nothing special except for the hair in the salsa bowl.  Maybe a forgone warning!  I asked for another salsa bowl before my observations noted below.   As I sat there the counter help was cleaning the tables with a dish rag which we see and most likely do at home, right?  Except the food debris she swept off the table was landing onto the seated benches, large chips, small chips and whatever else was very noticeable.  She neither cleaned the benches or attempted to pick up the large food debris from the seated areas.

The green and red sauce bottles were collected and placed on the servers counter along with what perceivably was a full bowl of salsa as she cleaned the tables.  Other salsa bowls collected from the tables were taken to the kitchen along with the dirty dishes. The green and red sauce bottles along with the full bowl of salsa was taken back to the kitchen...follow me, the full bowl of salsa on the table was most likely placed back into a larger vat for reuse later to other customers....if not, then why separate this one salsa bowl and place with green and red sauce bottles??

So, I said all that to say this...

YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN...I WON'T BE BACK!"
1,"Everything was cold. A pool of juice came out of my sandwich. Everything was so bland. Overpriced. The bun is fatter than my ass , bye"
1,Terrible......Do not go!!!! McDonalds is north just up the road on the same side. I suggest you go there.
1,Poor customer service from the manager even.  Instead of hard work he choose to delegate.
1,"Honestly, the service just sucks. It's consistently awful. Food is OK at best. There are much better places to get Mexican food than this here. Seriously don't put yourself through it."
1,They made an appt for me at 1:00.  When I arrived they said that it would be 45mins.  After over an hour they had still not started.  What's the point of having an appt?  Why tell me 45mins when you would not have even started over an hour later if I hadn't said  something?
1,"I'll put this on my list of never coming back to. 2nd time I tried it. 
Poached eggs poached in oil? Weird. I've had poached eggs at over 60+ breakfast places and never have I seen this. 
Crepes filled with marshmallow fluff (almost non-existent)! 
The waiter had to comment on everything we ordered, coffee we drank, water we drank. Here is a tip: just wait on people and don't comment on their every move."
1,"First time at a Chik FilA  ever.
In a pinch for food while running around town.
Ordered a cool wrap.
Paid six dollars.
This ""wrap"" tasted worse than what I imagine the sandwiches in gas station coolers taste like.
Salty, non food bright orange cheese shreds with cold grilled chicken by-product pieces and lettuce all wrapped in a dry tortilla. 

Truly disgusting. 
I thought about returning it for my money back.
Threw it away instead."
1,"Teen girls goofing around in the window, not doing their job. Messed up about 50% of the order: gave us the wrong drink, then gave us the wrong thing again after ""fixing"" it. We were also charged for extra items that weren't asked for; however, we expected more from Chick-fil-A and trusted them enough to drive away without checking. Hire more mature workers who don't stick their nose into other people's business that are outside of the window. I don't think it's necessary to have 5+ teen girls in the window."
1,"Johnny Rockets in Canada?!? Not too impress with Jukebox. We ordered appetizer - Mac & cheese with meatballs... Waitress came back and said they had ran out of meatballs?!?! Burger joint running out of meatballs?!?! Does not make sense?!?! Thats a first!  We ended up ordering Mac & Cheese with hot dog... we we got our appetizer, the waitress asked us ""did u need plates?""... DUH?!?! OMG!!! did she want us to use the paper table mats?!?! This Mac & Cheese was  THE most salty dish I ever!!!!

I had the Elvis burger.... It was avg. I had better burgers that this. When the waitress was refilling our drink, she spilt the drink on my friend! When she spilt the drink the waitress and didn't say a word! WTF?!! She finally came back with more paper towels. 

You'd think they'd comp something, but NO!"
1,"I've used Discount my entire adult life (23+ years).  I have always been very satisfied with them as a company.  Very competitive, great sales people, etc.  I did have one incident at a store in TX where they used a screwdriver to remove my center caps and gouged the aluminum up on every wheel.  Discount made it right.  Every wheel got professionally refinished and I was satisfied. 

This brings me to my first and last experience with this particular location.  

I brought my truck in for a rotate and balance. The guy at the front desk was awesome.  I explained to him that I am on my second pair of black lug nuts because the first set rusted after they were removed and installed with an air gun.  I had no problem with that - lesson learned - I bought a new, better set that consisted of 24 black locking lug nuts - not cheap.  I asked him if he wouldn't mind having the tech do them by hand so I don't have rust streaks all over my black lug nuts and wheels.  He gladly said ""of course!""  Sweet.  This guy understood. 

I pulled my truck in and I waited.   As I'm sitting there, I can hear the tech talking loudly.  After all, my truck was in the very first bay next to the waiting room.  He said things like ""What the hell?  Is this a million dollar truck or something?"" and ""Oh!  Don't hurt my lug nuts!"".

When it got closer to them being done, I stepped outside.   Now I could hear him really good.  He made several more rude comments and then, once I could tell he was done, I said ""that's mine"".  I said to him ""so, that was a pain in the ass, huh?""   He said ""yeah. Why did I even have to do that?""  I told him ""I heard every word you said"".  He handed me my keys and said ""sorry"" in the most condescending way possible.  It was the first time I was made to feel like an a-hole by this company. 

In a nutshell, I'm never going back to his location.  No wheel purchases. No tire purchases.  Nothing."
1,I used to love eating here except yesterday I went to eat and right off the back a customer was handing there food back to the lady at the register saying how it's the second time that there food had hair. The service was horrible and rude! And when I did get my food it looked like my tacos didn't have the meats in it I basically had to combine 3 tacos to make one! And the price for what I got was a joke. Not sure what happened but I'll never go back there again nor will my family and friends!
1,"My first time in Las Vegas. Went with my husband and another couple. We were told to go to the staff guest list and that we will get in for free before a certain time. The event was at Encore pool party 8/2/2017.

We got there and as soon as we got towards the front, we were told it'll be $55 a person!!! That's over $200!

We ended up leaving as that money would've been better off towards gambling and drinks.

Our ""promoter"" was MICHELLE. Thanks a lot for wasting our time and Uber money. What a waste and so unprofessional. Give us the details instead of half-ass. Geez!!

Never again!"
1,"Service poor, menu weak with very limited selections. Dark, poor lighting and big tables that are uncomfortably. No hurry to ever return Eve though it is very close to home.  I think they need to expand their menu and improve their presentation. Service needs to be worked on. 
Maybe it is strictly geared to be a drinking bar, not a restaurant/bar."
1,Once was enough.  I  thought the salsa was bland and the food followed.  My husband  enjoyed his meal more than I.
1,"This place is a total shit show. They're more concerned with asking ""is everything okay?"" repeatedly rather than actually addressing issues. If you're eating here, go ahead and plan on having to ask 4 different people for the same thing before its brought to you."
1,"I've been here for a few Taco Tuesdays, and I kind of think they need to get it together. The first time we arrived early in the evening and they were somehow already out of all salsa other than the hot stuff. Service otherwise was decent at best that visit. Second and third time not so much. Took a while for our server to approach us. There was a lot of confusion between whoever took our drink order and who our server was, thus delaying it even more. Chips came out before any plates or drinks were on the table, noticed this was a pattern across the restaurant. Maybe having a simple water and chip runner when the table is seated would be a good idea. The server forgot to put our appetizer in... I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt being that I have worked in the industry, but the queso app (it's queso, it doesn't take that long) came out after our entrees and when she brought the check she told us that she hadn't added the app to the check yet (I'm assuming she remembered it, told the kitchen to make it, but never put it on the check), took our check back, and added it. Oh and they took our entrees to the wrong table too. The food is good but under-staffing on a popular night is a no-go for me."
1,"Got there an hour before closing and they had NO regular pretzels. PATHETIC! How can you be a pretzel shop and not have pretzels. Drove 30 minutes to get there and no pretzels, not cool."
1,"Awful!!!! Will not be going back!!  

I'm a pretty relaxed, forgiving person until you do something thats industry unforgivable.  Like making a table wait for an hour... at a fast food place for their food. BAM!! DONE! NEVER GOING TO GO BACK! You do have the option of sitting down, but even the people getting their orders to go were waiting 30+ minutes.

And with all of the other AWESOME mexican places around.... what the heck??  An hour... a true 60 minute hour. AND the worst part... we were not the only ones who waited a LONG time for the mediocre food. In fact, the entire place... EVERY SINGLE TABLE(~10) were full. It took 10-15 minutes just to get our drinks which were diet cokes... you have a soda fountain, just take the order, fill the drinks and let the people sit with their drinks.  And when they did serve food, it was one plate at a time... took a good 5 minutes in between when I and my boyfriend received our food. 

I place every other mexican food restaurant, including taco bell, in the phoenix metro area, ABOVE this place. It cost $19.20 for a two taco combo(2 tacos- street style with rice & beans) and a taco and tamale combo(taco, tamle + rice & beans). ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? And the beans... AS RUNNY AS WATER!!! So gross!!!  I tried to mix my rice/beans together but that didn't help anything.

We went here on the recommendation two friends of ours... both are older... probably don't like as much spice and flavor as we do but the burnt meat in the El pastor tacos- unacceptable. BLACK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MEAT. The tamale tasted like it had cinnamon or allspice in it too.... totally not mexican and very gross! My reccomendation, go to Los Favoritos."
1,"My sis and I went here looking to get earring stoppers for our earrings... that were purchased in Barney's NY in SF... the kind folks of SF said that we could go to any Barney's and get some... since they ran out...

So since we were in Vegas... we decided to stop by. 

I guess my sis and I are just so used to the friendly folks of SF Barney's that walking in here was night and day. The old cougar that decided to help us was such a B that she didn't even want to help us. She wanted to help this guy that was looking to buy something for his GF... obviously making a sale instead of helping us.

My sis's BFF decided to look for a purse and fortunately... had a male customer service help her and we told him our issue and he took it upon himself to go the extra mile to look. I unfortunately forgot to take his name but he was the token friendly guy from this store. 

Lesson learned: only shop at Barney's SF ... where the sales folks knows us by name!"
1,"Ew lol It's edible at least, but very low quality. It's good drunk food, because you want something greasy when you're crunked. We went sober though. He ordered some kind of greasy burger with thin curly fries, and I got the salad and a vanilla milkshake, and we split a pulled porc nacho apetizer with 4 chicken wings ontop.

I'm happy the cheese stayed gooey the entire time for the nachos, but there was hardly any salsa. I'm happy the chips weren't too salty, but everything felt very ""out of the can"". Didn't feel like restaurant food. It felt like they went to a local grocery store and bought everything pre-made and threw it all together. Very disapointing. The guacomole side dip was totally bland. The pulled porc was wierd, but it's sauce was yummy. The chicken wings were yummytoo but all different sizes. Ate the 2 large ones first, and the 2 tiny ones 10 min later, which hardened from the air conditioner blasting ontop of us.

The Vanilla Milkshake came with whipped cream and a candy cherry ontop, and they gave me the a the metal cup with the rest of the milkshake in it on the side which was nice of them. The milkshake itself was fine, but very little for almost 10$, I finished it in a few gulps. The whipped cream was warm and gross, and I personally hate candy cherries unfortunately. I wanted the smores milkshake, but when they told me the marshmallows were raw, and not toasted, I dismissed it.

The salad was a joke lol SO MUCH LETTUCE! and they compiled my 4 selected ingredients all ontop to make it look good, but there was nothing underneath besides a tone of lettuce. Avocado was one of my selections, but they only gave me 1/5th of it and left it whole on the side of my bowl. The bowl shape was very cool though, it was tilted up, I think that was my fav part lol the havarti cheese was thinly sliced and not flavorful.

My date looked nausious from all the grease from his burger, and he didn't touch his fries. I was afraid to even try one, they looked like very sad curly fries... so thin. 

I really liked the way the restaurant was decorated, but the air conditioning was way too much, we were freezing cold x,x Gave me a serious case of nippleitis which forced me to slouch my back to hide them behind the high counter cause I didn't want to embarass myself on my 1st date with that guy... thank god my shirt was black! The person sitting behind my date kept on hitting the bench seat and jerking my date forward lol The waitress was incredibly polite, but there were way too many people there. Once it got crowded, it took forever to be noticed and leave."
1,"This place ALWAYS get orders WRONG!. I ordered a CARNITAS burrito and I get CHICKEN. I say CHEESE SAUCE they give me SHREDDED CHEESE!. So they put shredded cheese inside the burrito and then send a bowl or shredded cheese on the side. IT WASNT A HARD ORDER TO GET!. Second time I order from this place, my coworker was going to go and I forgot my lunch at home so i had no choice. I called and they said to bring it back and ill get a refund.. well it is now completely out of my way and the whole reason my coworker went was because I obviously couldn't! NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM THERE!"
1,"I was excited to come into this store because I was looking for a new pair of heels and a bag. I went in there last Wednesday afternoon.

If you want to go into a place that's quiet like a library, come here.

A couple of associates passed by me in the women's shoes department and they just looked at me. No greeting and no offer to help. Then one guy said hello, but still didn't ask me if I needed help. He just went on to do whatever he was about to do. I was picking up a couple of shoes to try on, but no one was there. It was like a desert. 

I gave up on shoe shopping, so I went over to the sunglasses department. I forgot my glasses at home( I was on vacation) so I though, what the hay, I need some for this scorching Vegas sun. There was an associate there at the register, but AGAIN! Just looked at me and no greet, no assistance. Not even a smile. Didn't even ask if I needed help.

So I gave up on that. I was about to go down to the handbags section, but I didn't want to waste anymore time in that store because of the awful non-existent customer service. I know I wasn't dressed luxuriously, but you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

I left the store with nothing and I don't think I'll be going in there again."
1,"This place is horrible! I gave this place the key for the wheel locks and waited almost two hours when I had an appointment in the first place and they came out and said that they had to drill out the locks because they didn't have my key? I told them that I gave it to them when I paid and gave them my car keys and they said ""oops, it's in the folder"" and no sorry or anything. I paid extra to have those wheel locks put on and I didn't even get an I'm sorry!!!! And frank, the manager is a very condescending person to try to talk to. I'm very disappointed and I've been to many discounts before."
1,"This is a very overpriced place, with the burgers costing as much as a steak dinner. Also, they sell ""KOBE BEEF"" THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT CERTIFIED AND IS AN IMITATION. Shame on this awful place NEVER going back."
1,"So I order a chicken sandwich with no Pickles. At the drive thru I check and it has pickles. I point this out and ask for a new sandwich. Was a quick turn around and I though nothing of it. I get home, take the top bun off and its covered in Pickle seeds. They didn't make me a new one, just took the pickles off. Now how a restaurant should handle an issue like this imho."
1,"I come here quite often, but after this experience I may not be coming back. This place doesn't have the best customer service, but it is usually okay. I support veganism and local so this is why I come here. There were about 4 customers in the building today so it was not really busy and 2 women working. I looked over the menu and was ready to order and stood there waiting I was the only person in line. The women working didn't even look at me or say, ""we will be right with you"" so I waited some more still no acknowledgement. I walked out. Don't think I will be back. Food and drinks are decent but not worth that treatment. Those employees should be fired!"
1,"Premium products, not-so-premium service.

My girlfriend and I were shopping at Barneys Las Vegas at 2pm on a Friday afternoon and she found a pair of Christian Louboutins she wanted to wear for Saturday night. The LV store did not have her size, but the SF store did. However, we were told that Barneys cannot overnight Fedex merchandise for Saturday deliveries.

Over at Saks we told the saleswoman what happened at Barney's and she said that Saks no doubt would be able to Saturday Fedex. Granted she's a competitor, but a Saturday delivery does sound reasonable.

We called our guy back at Barneys LV. Apparently, he could have Saturday Fedexed them to us if it had been before 4pm. That is their cutoff time for Fedex pickups. At the time we were first in the store, it was 2pm, well before the 4pm cutoff and he hadn't given us the option. At this point, it was 6pm, so Saturday delivery definitely couldn't happen. The guy said ""I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to have your shoes for Saturday night.""

Maybe it was just having a salesperson tell me that that made me determined to figure out a way. I called the Barneys SF...yes, they had the shoes. No, they could not Fedex them to us because it was past 4pm and their pickup was already gone. Now, I do know that the Fedex cutoff for next day delivery is 8pm. At this point, it was 6pm-- plenty of time for a salesperson to drop the shoes off at Fedex on their way home from work. But no, apparently they can't think outside the box like that. Very disappointing that a store commanding such premium prices (we are talking about an $800 pair of shoes) in this economy can't get a little creative for a customer.

We ended up calling our friend, who had a SF-Vegas flight out the next morning. She went down to the store right when they opened, purchased the shoes, and we had them in our hot little hands in time for a Saturday night out in Vegas. Sad that we could make it happen, but Barneys New York could not make it happen."
1,"I'm not from the area but where I'm from our chick fil a has good customer service, and isn't stingy on their sauce. They give our handful. 

But I came here twice, employees looks to be in their teen years or early twenties. They have some attitude. Seem to not care. Second time coming here I wanted to make sure everything was in the bag and they replied so rude as if they wanted us out of there. They weren't packed like the first time we came here. The first time a young man was handling our drinks, thank god we caught how many he gave us because he forgot one, his fault because we witness him conversating with other employees. Asking for sauce and not give us a lot. 

Overall the food is good. Just they need to work one better service and positive attitude!"
1,There was a male manager who was especially extremely rude. If something goes wrong they don't have to take it out on the customers. They could say it nicely even if something went wrong. They could also use trash cans at there drive thru just like all the others.
1,"If I could give it -10 stars, I would! This is perhaps THE worse Barneys store as far as customer service goes! Every time I step in there, I was ignored. Even when I approach an associate with a question, their attitude is extremely dismissive, lazy and unmotivated. It's such a shame, their buys are always good but due to the lack of service; I will never drop a dime there! No wonder more and more people and shopping online nowadays. It's no wonder the staff changes faster than the seasons! The entire management team should be fired as far as I'm concerned! Tragic."
1,"Not the greatest service, that's for sure. They quote one timeframe, only for it to be triple that amount."
1,"Invest in some wine glasses.. Not everyone is a craft beer drinker and drinking a glass of bad pinot out of what looks like a baby food jar didn't make me want to stay for another drink. The bartender had a nasty attitude and disappeared right after pouring my wine and sat in the back talking to a waitress the rest of my visit...horrible customer service skills..I was excited their was a place on my way home I could stop for a drink after work, but I won't be returning."
1,"Wish I could give 0 stars. We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night, waited 25 minutes before our food order was taken, and another hour and 20 minutes to get our food. There were empty booths all around, so the kitchen wasn't slammed. It's typical mexican food, should be quick and easy. We had to flag down random waiters for more drinks, more chips & salsa, etc. It was just absolutely terrible service. After speaking with the manager, he did nothing to resolve the situation. Definitely won't be going back or recommending this place to anyone."
1,"Was not satisfied with my food yesterday. Found a piece of eyelash hair in my chicken taco... And my boyfriend told me to be quiet about it, or else I would have raised hell. Definitely wasn't happy about it. So I just hurried up and downed my strawberry margarita. Never again will I come here. Big nope."
1,"Unfortunately, Michelle did not come through for me last night. She told my group we could all get in free at XS and then when we got there we only had outside access. I would have rather gone to another club and been able to get inside and use the actual dance floor instead of being stuck outside in 90 plus degree weather. In the past, Michelle got my whole group in to the inside of XS which is why I asked if we could go there again. When I texted her, she never responded.  She was SO unprofessional and I will NEVER use her as a promoter again. She was not up front with me at all and I am disappointed that she got credit for my group being on her list at all. The worst thing is that it was the last night my out out town friends were here, and I was talking about how much fun the club would be since they had never been to anything like it before. It was such a major disappointment. We ended up leaving and going downtown which was actually fun, I just wish we didn't waste two hours getting to the Encore to wait in line and not even be allowed to get inside of the club.  DO NOT USE THIS PROMOTER!"
1,The customer service was terrible and the food made my friend sick. We waited for our drinks for 30 minutes and then didn't get our food for an hour. The food was nothing special and my friend threw up the tacos she ate later that night. I will never go again.
1,We finally had the opportunity to try this place out this past Sunday morning.  I checked the website for opening time and it said 8 AM.  We got there at 7:55 AM the parking lot was empty and there were no lights on inside at all.  The time on the door said 8 AM so we waited but there was no sign of life.  We were so disappointed and mad because we had just gotten off of the night shift and were so hungry!  Won't go back there again since it is clear they do not know how to run a business.
1,"This location has poor management ESPECIALLY their dictation of when things need to get done. this location had my mom waiting for more than two hours to get her ONE tire replaced, when it shouldn't have taken that long. I am heavily frustrated with this location and it's poor time management. Especially if it's just replacing one tire, come on guys."

Comments:
I waited like an idiot while a party of 3, who came at the EXACT same time as me, ordered, ate and left before a waitress even greeted my table of 2.
I wanted a grilled chicken salad. 
-No chicken.
-Ok, sub for tilapia. 
-No tilapia. 
-So much for options.
Got a shitty spinach salad with a half sliced asian pear and a turkey patty plopped on top.

1,"The food was honestly 4.5/5 stars and was absolutely delicious. The decorations and restaurant itself was gorgeous.  The problem was the service.  I was highly disappointed as noticing that I was getting treated worse than a biracial black and white couple with their daughter.  The waitress smiled so friendly to them and used a nice,friendly tone and handled things very politely.  Then to me,as another Chinese,she just used this casual,aggressive tone. This has never happened to me before.  When asking for something,she rudely asked what? But to the biracial couple,she was like yes? With a pleasant smile. In the beginning,we asked to sit in their nice unreserved private area. SHE IGNORED OUR QUESTION AND TOLD US TO SIT IN THE NORMAL TABLES. Later on,there were two white women who asked to sit in that same area and the WAITRESS SAID YES WITH A FAKE SMILE. I was feeling that she was trying way harder to treat the white people better.  She treated us Chinese people as if we weren't customers.  She even smacked the bill out of our hands when we payed.  I have never had someone so rude to me in my entire life as me being a customer.  Amazing food. Expensive food. TERRIBLE SERVICE."
1,"On first impression, the new location in Wexford was at most a one star. Doubt I'll visit this place again or any of their other locations. 

After being seated, it was 15 minutes before we were greeted. We placed our drink and food orders and received the drinks a long 10 minutes later. The waitress apologized and told us the restaurant could only make one latte at a time and there were several drink orders ahead of ours. As happy as I was to finally have a hot drink after freezing in the cold weather, I was instantly let down because the coffees were nearly cold. 

The food came shortly after and the waffles were soft, definitely pre-made and had been sitting under a warmer. On a better note, the food still tasted good but the background noise of the waitress continuously apologizing to other customers was a pure indicator that this place was a terrible mess...at least this particular Sunday afternoon. 

Won't go back...Totin's down the street is a better choice."
1,Usually good service but not today! I forgot to exchange out my daughters fries for fruit and when I went to ask they said no. I've never had issues with the customer service until today! Pretty disappointed by them. Maybe the person who took my order should have asked fruit or fries but his service was lacking as well.
1,"The smallest lunch chimichanga portion I've ever come across in my life. The price was in-line with other places but the size was ridiculous.  I actually ate more chips at the end just to fill up.

My chimi was understuffed, came with almost no toppings except the bottom quarter-sized tomato slice that most people throw out, a laughable amount of beans, and some  lettuce shreds on the side that had a distinct chemical-flavor ...maybe cleaning solution from a counter? and no rice. 

My co-workers Lunch-sized Quesadilla did come with rice...and was a normal portion-size. I was just the lucky one who ordered poorly.

Service was very quiet. We did receive our meals quickly however there wasn't a whole lot of follow up on how anything was.

I did like the salsa and I thought the place itself seemed clean/comfortable."
1,After eating here since the beginnings of this place - I will NOT be back. I should have noticed how the restaurant was practically empty. The prices are INSANE!! Everything has gone up 3 or more dollars and they charge xtra for salsa on TOGO's. I asked for salsa for my taco and she told me it was extra. Too many other Mexican restaurants to put up with overpriced and rude! Bye!!
1,Don't take your car here!  They broke my one month car and said all well.  The store manager didnt even care or say one thing to me.  I was standing right in front of him
1,"We waited until 8:20 and still no sign of life!!  Soooo if lights in front are the last thing you turn on then ""whoops!""  You forgot to turn them on and unlock the doors!  Smh"
1,"i picked this restaurant for lunch with my wife and the staff was the most rude and disrectful on 11/02/2018.  I've heard so many good things about this restaurant and  before even ordering the food i'm dissapointed.  The host was very rude.  I'm guessing he assumed the worst when he first laid eyes on us. If you check the cameras  you can see.  My wife and i diplomats in your country and we what we experienced was definitly not canada like. We will not be visiting any time in the near future and will not recommend this place to anyone else.

The restaurant adjacent  has better service."
1,"Horrible customer service. The Asian kid who works there is completely clueless. He's given me the wrong nicotine levels, wrong flavors and today he sent me home with the wrong cartos. If you have to go here, only go when the owner is here...otherwise you'll be left to feel ignored and not given what you need. I'd recommend going to The Vapery across the street or Pink Spot right up the road. With so many vape shops in the area you would think these guys would step up their customer service game."
1,"Came here for the first time for a lip and eyebrow wax. She was very nice and did a great job but she didn't wear gloves, and would blow on the wax before putting it on my face.. maybe it's just me and my germ paranoia but I don't really like having a stranger's bare hands (and possibly spit particles) all over my face."
1,"I don't normally write bad reviews but this I feel is necessary. I've been going here for awhile but after awhile I feel as though all they want from their patients is money. They would ""suggest"" different oral care toothbrushes like the Sonic Care and then a prescription mouth wash where they didn't bother telling me the price of it until I got to the front to pay..which was about $50 not covered by my crappy insurance. And then they told me I have a cavity but didn't show me the X-ray of it and asked me when I would be available to get that done. What?!? Show me the X-ray. Then they proceeded to send me their acting sales person for Invisalign and showed me a sales pitch video of Invisalign without me giving them a confident ""yes I'd like to see the video"" and silly me being too nice at times, proceeded in having them take photos of my teeth for the first stage of the Invisalign process. I get it I need braces but I felt hounded and I feel as though they will do whatever they can to make a profit. I'm still bothered that they didn't show me the X-ray of that cavity. Needless to say I won't be returning and hope to find another dentistry who actually cares for their patients."
1,"The mac and cheese here is str8 garb. What was going through their minds when they decided to put potato chips in it?  Whenever I eat mac and cheese I always think, ""You know what this is missing? Potato Chips."" Who's mans is this?!?!"
1,"Nothing offensive against older people however when I walked in and it looks like a nursing home scene I should have gotten a clue about the food. Bland, powdered mashed potatoes and gravy, undercooked - doughy dinner roll and canned gravy... I'll pass."
1,"I came here with a group of 17 people for lunch.  We got there at 11:45am.  We asked for 2-3 minutes to decide on our orders.  The waitress did not come back for about 20 min.  We had to flag down a different waitress to get help.  After placing our orders, it took over an hour until the food started coming out.  During this whole time, our waitress did not once come to our table.  No updates on the order, no apologies for the delay.  There was no apology at all during the whole visit.  Other patrons came in and left before our food even came.  I have never experienced such slow service before.  The second set of patrons were waiting a long time too as everyone was waiting for our order to be completed.  The food was good, but not worth the wait.  

I would have understood if the service was just a little slow, but it was REALLY slow and receiving no feedback over the course of an hour and no apology whatsoever prohibits me from giving more than one star."
1,"I came in looking for a particular product and could not see 5 feet in front of me when I came through the door. The whole place was so smoked up it was crazy, to make matters worse there's a couch in there and there was a family with a young infant hanging out in the store. I was appalled. Not the best way to run a serious business, and those parents should be ashamed of themselves exposing that baby to all that Vape/smoke/whatever it was.."
1,Unless you're 70 or older don't come here. They're very slow and if you're under 70 it seems they don't want you in there. They say on their menu they have fresh pie baked everyday... We went in for pie... She said they have Minnesota slop and Apple raisin... Wtf? Gross. I suggest going to village inn instead don't waste your time or money
1,"I drove across town to try this place my friend told me about. While I was there, I decided to purchase a whole new ecig  system and ejuice. Not even a week later, one of the batteries that I paid a good amount for stopped working. and within 2 months, so did the second battery I bought :(  Also while I was there, I observed some remarks made by employees that I felt were inappropriate. I witnessed some employees making fun of customers and laughing. A young lady said ""I only offer the needle tip ejuice to people I like. If I don't like them, I don't offer it to them"" and she laughed. Also they seemed to be so involved with personal conversations, customers are getting neglected. The owner that I met the first time I went there seemed really nice. He was awesome, but when he isn't there to monitor his employees, I think the whole demeanor changes :/  unfortunately, I will not be returning to make any further purchases after my experiences. They do have some good flavor of ejuice though. :)"
1,I had a very bad experience. Perhaps it was unusual as I was going to be a new patient. I called and made an appointment only to be rescheduled by phone for later in the day. And then when I arrived at the new time made to wait until I was told the Nurse Practitioner was too busy to see me. I would have to return the next day. I have never been refused a visit in Phoenix before for an actual appointment while actually waiting. I am still a bit shocked by how unprofessional their office procedure was. Very unfortunate. If you have a choice -- go elsewhere.
1,"We went to yogurtology one evening for a quick yogurt to-go, we had a full ten minutes before they closed. When we went in they were finishing mopping the floors, the toppings were all put away , and the yogurt machines turned off. We found it so unprofessional for them to close everything before they were actually closed. The workers looked at us as if we were supposed to just turn around and leave. We proceeded to get yogurt and they had to bring out the toppings we wanted and it was terribly awkward. I give it a one star for bad service and mediocre yogurt."
1,"I was looking for some where to go that was new, I figured I would go here to give a whirl. I got 2 pizzas that lacked flavour and taste. The crust was hard and there where hardly any toppings on the pizza. The pizzas cost 50 dollars plus tax. I would rather eat Peiwei off the floor than eat at this place ever again. The pizza took about 30 minutes. If you so anything in life DO NOT go here ever."
1,"WORST experience ever! We ordered a small pepperoni pizza and a pasta dish. The order came with a free dessert. They got here on time, but only with half the order. After the driver told us it was all there. He drove away so we called the restaurant and they said they had ""just realized it"" 5 minutes ago so it took another 15 minutes for them to come back with the pasta. They didn't offer any coupons or anything either! Pizza was mediocre, pasta was super bland, the breadstick ends were so hard you couldn't eat them, and there was hair in the free dessert! Definitely will not be eating here again."
1,"My wife heard this place was fantastic on the news. I really hope this is not the best Chicago has to offer. 
We ordered an Italian beef sandwich, a Tomboli and a thin crust cheese pizza.
About 5 mins after we ordered, we were told there was no more Italian beef. Its Friday night.....why don't they have a full menu? I changed my order to a Chicken Parm sandwich. 
The Chicken parm had about two oz of breaded chicken and the sausage in the Tomboli was way under cooked. The pizza wasnt bad, but nowhere near as good as Sals or Casanovas. 
Pretty bad experience and probably because there was no leadership there what so ever. All kids and one older man that just looked confused were working. 
Worst $47 meal in a long time!"
1,"Had high hopes after reading online reviews that Sanfratello pizza was going to be real Chicago deep dish pan pizza. So we ordered one last night. Sadly it was mediocre at best. Gino's East Frozen Pizza from AJ's is much better and half the price! Sanfratello sauce was VERY salty and the crust is tasteless. It's about 1"" high so not what we consider ""deep"" dish. Side dinner salads were a rip off at $3.85 each. Their menus says the salad is ""lettuce, tomato and cheese."" It should say ""half lettuce leaves and half lettuce leaf ribs, 1 grape tomato and too much tasteless mozzarella with ""Italian"" dressing that is either original Wishbone or a perfect replica."" Who uses Wishbone dressing on salads? It's only good for marinating chicken or shrimp! Russ said: at least the lettuce is fresh. We are still looking for REAL Chicago pan pizza in Mesa/Phoenix. ( Lou Malnati's or equivalent). Phoenix friends, if you like real pan pizza, don't waste your time and money at Sanfratello's."
1,This place needs a lesson in customer service.   I went in and ordered a pizza and was told 20 to 25 minutes and then in 5 minutes I get told it will be 30 to 35 minutes as more orders came in.  No more orders came in but the fact is that they let them go first.  The pizza is not that good and is expensive for what you get.  The Manager was rude and she said that is the wait and that is that.  Natalie the Manager was very rude
1,"After being shipped RANCID juice from this place, and absolutely no response from any of the emails I sent about it, I will NEVER order from here again.  Their product used to be amazing... too bad."
1,"so the trevor kid? what a pube!!! But the girl who works there, Kim, she's lovely."
1,"I used to love you, Al-Hana.  I have fond memories of enjoying good food and good company while sitting at your little wobbly tables and chairs.  I fell in love with your babaghannuj.  Yes, you had a lot going for you.

I was disappointed, but kept coming back, when you decided to raise the price on Every Single Item I Like, while making all of the portions smaller.  I understood that you have to pay for those new glossy menus with the pretty pictures somehow even though I liked the old menu board with the plastic letters just fine, thanks.  I settled for slow and sometimes surly service from your staff.  Why?  Because I loved you. 

Well, I think our one-sided relationship has come to an end.  That last visit - you know, the one where you gave our food to another customer (uh, you were confused?), and left us waiting for over 35 minutes without an apology while fulfilling orders for people who arrived and ordered much much later?  That will be my last one.  

I especially will cherish the charming way in which the 'manager' grudgingly provided a refund for the food I never received.  ""Do you want to return the water as well?""  Um, no.  Since I had to get it out of the cooler myself, I actually received that portion of what I ordered.  Thanks.

Keep your rising prices and shrinking portions.  You are no longer worth my affection."
1,"I actually did a search for best pies in Phoenix and this place turned up. Ugh. Well the best place isn't actually near Phoenix, but I wasn't about to drive up 65 miles north to Rock Springs for their apple crumble, and THEN drive back here.

So I took a long drive to Mesa, which is a larger city than I thought. And I entered the late morning breakfast crowd of tiny Iowa Cafe. 

This is a very small place. I sat next the register. I had had breakfast very early that morning so all I came in for. So really I wanted a slice of their ""famous"" pie and a cup of coffee. Mistake: I got the ""cherry supreme"", which was a gloppy, thick viscous cream that had bits of cherries in it, whipped cream on top. It was not a pie as much as it was a gloppy pile. Also it smelled and tasted like it had taken on fridge odors overnight.The coffee was stale and not very hot. Oh, and I added a side order of scrambled eggs and they were cold and rubbery.

I suppose if you advertise that you sell Midwest traditional pies Iowa style you should probably have your best pies out there. But this was not the case that morning."
1,"Im dining in the restaurant as we speak- note to self- don't come here again. 

When you walk in it's confusing- everyone is cramped into the front or in a little door entrance 

It took the server 10 minutes to approach our table and take our order

Food took 20-25 min to get to us, I ordered the biscuits and gravy and clearly the gravy was from a can with about 2 specs of sausage in it. I sent it back and they offered me some more toast or home fries. No thanks. 

Price seems kind of high for a breakfast place especially since the food sucks. 8.00 for biscuits and gravy with toast and hash browns. 

Go somewhere else before your disappointed like I am."
1,Waitresses bus tables and do not wash hands. Love the food but saw this way too many times.
1,Does not honor appointment times-- I made an appointment for 6:00pm and after waiting 40 minutes had to leave. Another person with an appointment time of 6:15 was still waiting when I left as well. Highly disappointing and waste of time.
1,"I came here based on the Yelp reviews. Was okay at first couple visits. Referred a bunch of ppl from work to them since it was on our side of town. Since, I've had issues with most of my fillings they have done. I've also been changed for services they claimed to my insurance. Didn't care for the sales pitch for add'l services such as invisalign. Back to searching for a great dentist."
1,"The wait is the first thing on the menu. Unless you are a Senior Citizen. If you a not, well. Just sit back and watch the waitresses serve them first. After waiting and watching others get served who came after me, I left. Interesting enough the young couple who we saw at the door showed up at the Applebee's 10 minutes later. If you are not a SC the only thing on the menu you can order is WAIT!"
1,Great juice....horrible customer service. Everyone tells me the owner is awesome but I've never met him. Every time I'm in the shop it is a few employees and all their buddies chillin and blowing clouds. Not a good environment for the over 25 vaper.
1,"Our first time here.  Had to wait about 10 minutes. Sat at a table and told us our server would be there soon . We waited another 10-15 minutes before I asked for a server. The person I asked did take our order and was going to bring us water and coffee, another 12 min goes by and I ask another server for coffee and water.  She brought it one minute. Our server brought my hubbies food another 15 min. Eggs undercooked and French toast without syrup and Never brought him his toast. Over charged us for the meal, which she did correct.  First and last time there.  If you are with a bigger party you get service. A party if 5 who were seated after us,received their food before we did! I do not recommend their buffet.  One day we my try another day.  Very disappointed."
1,"Worst customer service ever! Wasn't even that busy and didn't get greeted at the door. Was getting gossiped about by employees. My friend ordered bottomless mimosas. I attached a pic so you can see the actual definition. And it took 20 minutes for her to get another mimosa. Wasn't given napkins, and when seated first time they were putting us to a occupied table so had to wait another 20 minutes. They try to make it seem like we were the problem, actually it's the way you run your restaurant. You have 6 servers doing the same thing, when there should be a system worked out to do things. I NEVER wrote a review for anywhere before but this was just unacceptable!! But the food was good."
1,"Had pork chops dry over cooked briquettes pkg gravy left nasty taste in mouth, not good"
1,"This place is a joke. I paid $52.00 for two pizzas that were in no way related to the city of Chicago. The only thing worse than the pizza was the service. I understand that the place just opened, but the staff seemed incompetent. The cheese has a sour taste and the guys in the back must be cutting back on the topping because they only put  8 pepperoni on a family size pizza. Oh and it took 45 minutes to make a two pies. My family and I will not be returning and I will not be recommending this place to my friends and family."
1,"The service was horrible. We sat down, waited 39 minutes to get menus, another 30 minutes to get water. They didn't take our orders until we were there for at least an hour....and we waited almost 45 minutes to eat breakfast. We were very disappointed because we went our ways to go there since we are from Midwest. Very disappointed."
1,Went for lunch today. OMG it took over 45 minutes to get our food. Everyone around come in after and received there food before us. Not sure if the guy was new or not. But my order was completely wrong and not complete. I order the chicken salad sandwich on wheat bread with French fries. I receive chicken salad on white with potato salad. I wasn't going to dare say anything. I was so hungry. There was no I'm sorry or how did everything come out. I was very disappointed with this cafe. I will not be back.
1,"Horrible!!! Canned mushrooms, stale crust, bland sauce and EXTREMELY overpriced. $52 for 2 pizzas and a salad, honestly one of the worst pizza's i have had and after 40 years i have had every pizza in the valley. Better off getting a frozen Red Baron and saving yourself $45 and 50 minutes of waiting."
1,"My son is a high school athlete and we have been to a couple physical therapists at a different office in the past. The office was a little farther than I would have liked to travel but they were highly recommended by his coach and we always had great care and customer service. Our insurance changed so we had to find a new place,   I tried to find something a little closer.  I called AZ spine asked if they took my insurance- they took my information and called me back the next day to say they did and we discussed my copays.  My son had 3 visits in Oct 2016- he wasn't impressed the first time but gave it two more chances.  He said they did nothing for him but exercises he could do at home so he stopped going.  Then in Jan I get at bill for $166.  WHAT???  This is not what we were quoted.  I dont think offices should be able to hide behind, ""well its your insurance and your responsibility to know what is covered"".  How about I rely on YOU to tell me the truth and get approval from me before you do things that are going to cost more?  I have been to multiple offices (medical, dental, eye, chiropractic and hospitals) all who can tell me up front what their charges will be and what my portion is.  Our other PT office could figure it out as well.  So why cant AZ spine figure that out??  Its a SCAM.  No other business operates this way- can you imagine going to the store with no prices on anything,  you find out at the register what you owe?  We will never go back and we have told everyone on the team and the coach to never go there."
1,"Is Zero Stars an option? 
Went on a Saturday morning, 930am. Hostess sat us at a high top table, we asked for two waters... Then nothing. 

Crickets chirping. 

People that came in same time as us all ready drinking coffee and placed their order. 

Nothing. No one brought the drinks.. no one came by to say ""Hi, be right with you..."" Nothing. 

After probably 10 mins we got up and found the girl that got our drink request..  She says .. ""sorry.. I forgot to tell your waitress"". 

Great...  Even so, in the course of 10 mins a waitress with eyeballs should be able to see someone new sitting at their table looking around for help. 

Nothing. 

Maybe the food is good? I don't know. We never got any. 

That's Zero Stars. It's the worst thing a restaurant can do.. completely ignore a customer until they give up and walk out to go somewhere else."
1,"Well the first few times is okay.  After that, the place goes down hill.  The staff there seems friendlier to Iowans, or those who are not NYers.  Had 2 bad dinners there..quit going after that.  The pie is good.  Go for dessert."
1,"Just ok.  I came here because of all the outstanding 5-star reviews and wasn't as happy as I had hoped.  My first time getting acrylics and I asked a lot of questions.  I asked if most people get regular polish, and I was told yes, that regular polish would be just fine.  Well, I did not like how it turned out: very dull, with lines going through it, and uneven.  Also I asked for almond shaped nails and they came out very round with no point at all.  I got a pedicure too, and it was faded and not solid looking, with some spots missing.  I came back 2 days later for the gel polish instead, (on my acrylics) and they charged me full price to switch.  I think that upset me the most, because it was 2 days later, and because I had never had acrylics before (which they knew) and they advised me to get regular polish, that it ""should look just fine"". I didn't even mention the crappy pedicure.  I mean, *sigh* I think it should've been at least discounted.  The girl at the front desk was extremely sweet.  The décor and atmosphere was decent.  They offer free soda, wine, and water.  I felt like ""just another customer""  when I expected more.  I like to feel like the only one, with special treatment,  which is how I believe most women want on a special mani/pedi day. Blah........**per the owner's response to my review*** NO ONE fixed my toe polish because I NEVER MENTIONED IT.******* Won't be back."
1,This place is the rudest dental office I have ever called. The woman on the phone wouldn't give a rough estimate of what the exam or the dental work would cost even though I already had an exam and quote at another place. She was so terribly rude by stating to me that if I was shopping around then they would be considered the most expensive place of them all and that if I am shopping around then I should go somewhere else. She didn't want to answer my question about the dental plans they offer. Finally she hung up on me after I was so nice to her.
1,"I have been here twice and everything was sub-par (at best). The drinks and snacks are nice as something complementary but I still did not feel relaxed leaving the place. My friend and I agreed that the pedi's were nice, but our manicures were AWFUL. We both got gel on our nails, and by day 5 two of them were coming up and messing up around the cuticle. Since it's after their policy, it was a waste to even try and contact them since I would know their response. My friend's gel polish was uneven and was thicker by the edges of her nails, and when she commented on how they looked, they said it was the polish but didn't say anything else about fixing them. So moral of the story, our manicures sucked and we had to go somewhere else before the wedding. And since then we have yet to come back and found a place we love."
1,"I really want to like this place but every time I go there it gets worse and worse with every visit.  Recently I went to get breakfast after church and after a 15 minute wait for a table which was expected I noticed other tables were crossed off their ""wait list"" that came in after us.  I get it that they would like to sit 4 people at a 4 person table but I really do not want to wait until one of their little 2 person tables opens up so we can be jammed into it.  Once again, I get it... I do not expect to be put at a 6 or 8 person table because that would be weird for 2 people.

After being seated we waited 5-10 minutes for a waitress to stop and take our drink order which she brought promptly back but would return to take our breakfast order.  Fast forward 25-30 minutes (I eventually put a timer on my phone as I was getting aggravated) another waitress stopped by and told us that there must have been a mix up.  We ordered 4 over easy eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and toast.  Fast forward a second time for another 30 minutes; we have not been checked on, I ran out of coffee, and the table seated at the same time we were had received their food, ate, and were signing their bill.  After the strenuous feat of flagging down the waitress that took our order but was not her table, we asked for a bill for the coffee and told her we were leaving because we had a prior obligation we needed to attend.  She seamed very put off that after spending over an hour to attempt to order 4 eggs (only half cooked so it should have been easier), a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast; she told us ""its fine, don't worry about the coffee bill"".  And no apology offered.

But seriously...  This is average breakfast food.  4 eggs, a couple strips of bacon, hashbrowns, and toast???  Why didn't that just take it off of the buffet?  We could see giant piles of this in their roasters.  But then again it would have been $15 per person if it came from the buffet.

This is the first time we have ever walked out of a restaurant without eating."
1,"Large, clean space. Good selection of O.P.I. colors. But the woman doing my manicure cut beyond my cuticle and made one of my fingers bleed. She didn't apologize and just put some blue liquid on it and then painted the cut with clear polish which I thought was weird. She then did the rest of my cuticles and when she buffed the nails she wasn't gentle with the one she cut and painfully reopened the cut. Again she painted it with clear polish to close the wound. The manager didn't ask me how my visit was either.  My finger still hurts 6 hours later."
1,The worse breakfast place for kids they don't let you sit in booth if you need high chair they say it's health code which I know it's not then what breakfast restaurant does not off box cereal for kids wow 1 breakfast and 2 kids pancakes $30 lmao I will stick with wild berry but they were closed today
1,"Was excited to try this place based on reviews. Was told the patio was full, without hostess even checking. Half of the patio was empty, which we saw when walking in from the parking lot. I've worked good service and could understand if wait staff coverage was thin, but as we waited 15 min for someone to seat us, I noticed there were only 4 tables seated inside and about 8 waiters running around-so no problem with coverage. This is lousy service and I wouldn't give my money to place like this. Never going back and would not recommend to anyone, unless you want to me made to feel that you aren't allowed to go here. If I could give less than 1 star, I sure would."
1,Leaving one star because zero is not an option! Left after watching a roach crawl across the counter toward the open display of pies
1,"What is the hype people????I went here for lunch after seeing all the awesome  reviews, but I was disappointed. First, the menu is very hard to understand (see the pic that someone posted). I ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and hummus platter. There isn't much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge. For soda, all they had was the cans and they charged $1.00 for them. Later, while I was eating I noticed a lot of people were buying their drinks from the market, then coming over to order their food (pain in the ass if you ask me). Anyhow, so I was only 1 of a few people there and the food took quite a while. When they finally called my order I went up and asked for the ""garlic sauce"" that I heard so much about on here and the lady said it would cost $1.00. I said nevermind because I wasn't going to pay that for a small container of condiment! I was surprised at how small the sandwich was. It wasn't  impressive either. Just a grilled flatbread with a few pieces of  chicken, a few tomato slices, lettuce, and a little sauce. In my opinion this wasn't worth 3.99, but more worth 2.50 or something because of its size and how little filling there was.The hummus was good, but  nothing spectacular. This place is also in a dodgy part of town right across from project housing...literally right across the street. The market was pretty cool though and I'll prob return (during the daylight of course) for some olives, olive oil, and pita. BUT will skip out on dining here."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE! For 5 months my  wife and I went to Dr Dee for various services she recommended. We ended going at least twice a month. Our previous dentist never mentioned all the work Dr Dee wanted and said our teeth were fine. My wife's cousin said the same, but she's out of the area. But now our teeth were in need of several cleaning processes, cavities and root canal. She told me I needed an implant. My specifically asked about her root canal an the quality of the crown. She was assured everything would be high quality. About 8 months later she was eating spaghetti and said something is in her food. It turned out to be her crown. This was less than a year after putting it in. She went back to Dee and was told if she wanted a new one it would be $600. She said we both have crowns from the 80's which were fine and this one broke on spaghetti? She left and went to a different dentist who told the material in the crown was a very inferior material and was surprised anyone would use it. She got a new crown for $400, not $600. I also went to a dentist about my implant and was told the tooth had good roots, wasn't loose and said no implant was necessary. This place is all about the Benjamins. I was to say disappointed and my wife felt terrible as she felt we were taken advantage of. My wife had great hopes from Dr Dee.."
1,"Pretty sure my comment got deleted if that is possible... but terrible service! They forgot half of our order and I had to call and tell them once the delivery driver left (food was tied in knots in bags so didnt realize it was gone until he left) and then they said, ""Oh! we forgot! We're sending it out now."" Keep in mind this was after an over an hour wait for the delivery in the first place. Pizza was bland, pasta was even more so. Go across the street, MUCH better service and food."
1,ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE. You're better off eating at Wendy's. The restaurant wasn't busy and my table of four had all finished our drinks AND appetizers and we still waited 10 minutes. Afterwards they messed up our entrees and only when we were about to leave did they offer to buy us another drink instead of cover any drinks we already had purchased. Not only will I never return but I will let everyone know not to bother. Please do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.
1,"Very disappointed tonight in the food here. As my husband said, ""It's obvious who ever created the menu and does the daily prep put in a great deal of effort and care. It's a shame the night shift doesn't give a damn. Only thing the night shift knows how to do is run a deep fryer. Everything else is either prepped too fast for the wait staff, then dries out under heat lamps, or it was half assed and it shows they don't pickup where the daily prep left off."" Not sure we will come back even though we had good experiences before this."
1,"Charged me for an ipa when I had a bud lite. Hmm. Half way thru making my salad informed one item was unavailable. Wanted to change my order. Barmaid kept saying ""I can change it, but they've already started making it"" after 3 attempts I said ok.  High price for a salad and then I tipped her well not realizing how much it was. I won't be back."
1,"Went in at 7:50pm and tried to order 4 pizzas, I was told that it was too late and they were closing. WTF it said they were open till 8:30. Forget this place, go somewhere else."
1,"I'll start by saying that I stopped in here because it's close to my home and I was completely out of Ejuice.  I needed something to get me through until my next big online purchase.  This review is based on the customer service I received.
I was greeted by a nice young man, who showed me to the ""tasting table"".  I was then promptly left alone for my entire visit, and not helped again until I made my purchase at the register.
I understand that many people simply want to be left alone to look around in a store and not hassled by employees.  I totally understand that.  However, there is a difference between making sure your customers are taken care of (whether they want to be left alone or not), and completely ignoring them.  That's how I felt when I was there; ignored.  I would have appreciated someone stopping by every now and then to see how I was doing, to see if I needed anything, to maybe ask me how I was finding their flavors.  Trust me I would have had a few questions for them.
There were at least 5 employees during my visit, and maybe 5 customers.  Any one of the employees had every opportunity to check in on me, but didn't.  I understand that I could have gone up to any of them and asked a question, but they seemed so involved in their own conversations, it didn't feel very comfortable.  There's something to be said for acknowledging your customers, for shooting a smile or a nod their way, and for occasionally asking them if they're doing ok.
When I found a juice I liked, I told one of the sales associates and they said all they had left was either 0% or 2.4mg nicotine.  I said I usually vape 1.2mg or 1.8mg, and he left to go fill the 0% with some nicotine.  He came back, rang it up at the register, and said it would be about $17.  I paused for a moment, as all I wanted was a $10 15ml bottle.  I wasn't informed of any specials, deals or discounts, and when I tried to check the Facebook page for a discount, the guy informed me that because it was not their own Ejuice that I couldn't use a discount anyway.  That would have been nice to know beforehand.  He didn't really offer me any options or try to engage me to try and see if there was something else I might be more interested in.  I felt inclined to make the purchase because he had already adjusted the nicotine level of the bottle.  I paid for the juice, walked out, and felt sort of bamboozled.
Later at home I checked out their Facebook, web, and Yelp pages, and found all sorts of discounts, deals and check-ins.  On their Yelp page, for example, I saw ""Receive a Free 15ml E-Juice with Any $20 Purchase!""  For an extra $3, I would have loved to get a free 15ml bottle of anything!  That would have been a very easy way to get $3 more out of me, and I would have happily paid it for a free bottle of juice.  I would have liked to have been informed of all these in the store, and at the very least told about how the frequent member card worked, what it was, how to sign up for it using the in-store tablet, and what it gives me.  He could have at least informed me that because the discounts don't work on this juice, I might want to try some more of their own mixes to get a better deal.  
Having worked in retail, I saw so many customer servicing opportunities for a sales associate to offer me assistance, inform me on their products, up-sell me on an item, or even just ask how my day was going.  Nobody asked me if I currently vaped, if I knew how any of this stuff worked, if I was a current/former smoker, or if I was even looking for something in particular.  If I wanted a 0% level of customer service I could have just stayed home and made an online purchase where I got more for my money.  I feel like people go into brick-and-mortar stores instead of the Web exactly for that reason, to receive some customer service.  I'm happy with my vape, and that's fine, but if that's the level of service I can expect at Puff Vapors, I might not be inclined to go back.
I'll say that I was really expecting a lot more.  I felt like I was in a self-serve shop, and that even upon my exit that I was more of a nuisance to be checked out real quick instead of engaged into learning more about their products and deals."
1,"We went to their new location this morning (they have moved to the SE corner of Higley & Brown, behind Applebee's).  We went right at primetime on Sunday morning, so it was busy/crowded.  We were so put off by the behavior of the hostess/owner, that we just left:

1)  When we first arrived, we entered through the first set of doors, which leads into a very, very small waiting area that has a second set of doors into the dining area.  People were crammed everywhere into this little waiting area.  The hostess (which I believe was also an owner) was windexing the little windows on the 2nd set of doors, which prevented us from entering the restaurant!  At 9am on a busy Sunday morning, in March in Arizona (it doesn't get any more prime time than that!).  Apparently this task cannot be done at a slower time when people will not be inconvenienced.  So there we are, trapped in this tiny little waiting area, in everyone's way, and we can't move - she is not stopping her cleaning to let us in.  When my wife goes to open the door, the hostess gives her a look like ""wait till I'm done!"".  Finally the hostess/owner finishes her little windexing chore and we enter the restaurant to put our names in.

2)  Before putting our names on the list, I ask this same snotty hostess/owner ""how long is the wait?"" and she replies, ""don't worry, the tables turn fast, it won't be long"".  I ask a second time, she says again, ""not long"".  She won't tell me how long!  So I respond, ""more or less than 20 minutes?"" and she says ""about that"" in a very unconvincing way.  

So at that point, we were out of there, totally put-off and annoyed.  I have always heard the food was very average, but we were in the area and thought we'd try it out.  This behavior however, was unbelievable.  If they are making so much money that they do not have to treat customers properly, then good for them.  They need me more than I need them, and I will not give my hard-earned money to a business that acts as if I'm doing them a favor by showing up.

I will never set foot in this place again, and I will tell as many people as I can about my experience."
1,"The hour and a half Breakfast... I'm sure the food would've been good had it been warm.  I'm sure our visit would have been pleasant had we not sat waiting for our food for so long that rigor mortis was setting in.  Was impossible to get a refresh on our coffees. I think because the server didn't want to come to our table anymore. If there was a problem in the kitchen, it would've been nice if the owner had come over to our table and let us know. Some were getting up and leaving. And then there were some who came in long after us who were served and done and gone before we were served.   Not the Iowa café I remember."
1,"This is an updated review: 

I write this with mixed emotions. Let me explain:

I have been to this location several times. The first time, I got a pedicure from a very nice woman. It may have been the best pedicure I've ever had. The second time, I got basic nail polish on my fingernails and it was poorly done. I posted a review with pictures and the owner contacted me and offered to fix it. I took him up on the offer and came in and he redid my nails. They looked great when he finished but as he painted them, he made comments about not doing designs because his clientele is high end and high end people don't like designs (another reviewer posted that he made similar comments to her, as well). I left and later texted him that my nails looked much better when he redid them and thanked him. I even increased the number of stars I gave the business because I felt like he had given me good customer service in fixing something that was wrong. 

When looking at other reviews on here, I can't help but notice that whenever there is a negative review, the business owner replies with a passive aggressive (or even directly aggressive) public message where the initial reviewer is either insulted and/or accused of being dishonest. Are there dishonest reviewers out there? I'm sure. But I think as a business owner, it is so important to treat people kindly and respectfully. Forget even being a business owner, as a human being this is important. 

Despite the customer service I received, I won't be going here again for the simple fact that I think all people should be treated well.

Note: I initially rated this business 3 out of 5 stars but based on the response the owner left, I have lowered it to 1 star. His response proves and reiterates the poor interpersonal skills I mentioned in my review."
1,Wow 30 mins for a pie thine crust is undercook 23.50 for large pie Brooklyn vs across the street 10x better just plain old ok pizza def not worth the money
1,Like I stated before. Dr. Wolfe is amazing. Her staff however is concerning. If my pharmacy was an issue I would find myself a new one. The prescriptions are NEVER called in from the staff. I had to leave several messages and finally an on call doctor mentioned he did not know why the strips had not been ordered like he had requested a week ago. Update due to comment.
1,"Save your money and pass on this experience... I had food delivered and all of it was tossed in the trash! Fried Ravioli, Cheese pizza with Ham and Cheese pizza with Jalapenos, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions and black olives... This was a $48.66 meal with a Tip of $9.73 so a $58.39 Meal that was so disappointing! The Vegetarians in our home ended up with sausage on the pizza not just one piece but many!... Nice touch when your guest are spitting there food out!!! The Ravioli was just bad I can't think of a way to describe how bad it was.. I would think maybe this should not be allowed to be delivered as it was so sub par... The Ham pizza was burnt and over cooked and the veggie pizza was under cooked and of course had meat on a veggie pizza. I can't even think about giving this restaurant a second chance. I looked at the reviews prior to ordering and thought this could be something wonderful. I was wrong!"
1,"I could've made a better pizza with a can each of pillsbury rolls and tomato paste. Worst I think I've ever had. I'm from Chicago (so I really do know good pizza), and frozen pizza of any variety is better than this mess. To their credit, they refunded it-but not before the manager acted as though he couldn't BELIEVE we didn't think it was great. Do yourself a favor and go to Rosati's at Ray & Mcqueen."
1,"We visited the new Iowa Cafe location at Higley and Brown on Feb. 13th, 2012 with friends and were looking forward to having a good time, especially when we had a short wait signing in and saw that the place was hopping--it has to be good with people streaming in! That was the end of the excitement: our booth was ripped and very lopsided, then we waited over an hour to get our food which was mediocre at best. When we finally caught the waitress to mention the long wait and we needed to make an appointment, she managed to get our friend's food out and they started eating. I think we finally caught her again about 10 min later to ask where our food was. It would have been nice after that long wait to at least get to eat along with our friends! My patty melt had soggy bread, as though it had been sitting for awhile and I was given fries rather than the cole slaw I chose as my side. My husband's corned beef sandwich had cheese and sauerkraut  in it which wasn't listed on the menu. He felt it was a strange combination but we were so glad to finally get our order, we just ate and got out of there. We felt the wait staff was not just busy, they were quite lax. The food was poor and the wait unbearable and not excusable or even understandable. From what we hear, this place is usually very busy. If so, why not prepare, have more staff and definitely get a new cook! We will never go back."
1,"I had to say I have a really poor treatment with Dee for Dentist. 

The treatment did by Dee caused me 9 months root soreness and additional $3000 as well as the days I had to take off for another dentist. very disappointed

Oct of Last year, I went to a hike and broke my two teeth, at the time I needed emergency treatments, my friend took me here, Dee was very very nice and did the root canal for me. I was truly thankful at the time. 

I had to do the crown after back to Shanghai, here is the nightmare, after I did the crown, my teeth were sore for 9 months, what caused the soreness was because Dee put the root too long. 

I had to take off the crown, redo the root carnal , the whole thing was a nightmare

I really appreciate the fact that Dee took time to show up on an emergency call but all the suffering and additional cost and additional time i had to spent on this  after the root carnal treatment was a nightmare. I didn't expect that I had to take off my crowns and restart the whole thing after I spent $3000 because of the root carnal treatment. and what worse was my health insurance doesn't cover the re-treatment because it was out of 3 months window so I had to pay from my own pocket

I hope in future Dee can do better with whatever treatment she does, and what happened to me will never happen to anybody else"
1,"On July 10, 2015, my family and I were looking for a new place to eat breakfast. I found the perk-cup cafe online and thought it would be great to try a new place for breakfast. The place was pretty empty and we still waited for a seat...it took a long time for our waitress to even make an initial visit. We have two daughters and the one is two years old so things can get hectic at times. Our two year old daughter had peed herself in her pull-up diaper. The seat got wet so I quickly rushed to the bathroom and retrieved paper towels. While I cleaned the seat and placed our daughter on paper towels the waitress finally showed up and asked what we needed for drink. Meanwhile my wife said to save from any further embarrassment we should wait after we place the order to take her to the car to change her. Thinking it should be quick for the waitress to return with our drinks and to take our order we started to get uncomfortable when she took a while. Our thought was that she noticed the accident and was talking about it to the other staff. When she returned to our table it was very awkward when she rudely asked about the accident and said ""I wouldn't want to sit in that seat after that."" Instead of asking if we needed help or even being understanding that two year olds can have accidents, she decided to make us feel terrible about the entire incident. She was more consigned about the chair than offering to assist with this embarrassing moment. The mess was cleaned off of the vinyl chair and I had placed paper towels until my wife went to the car for another pull-up diaper. I then asked for the manager and she was also the owner, at first she sided with the waitress. After hearing my side she said that she will talk to the waitress about the incident. My wife and I took vacation to relax and not experience any stressful or unnecessary drama. We are both educated professionals and also manage people for a living, after seeing so many infractions on this visit, it was determined that we will not be visiting this establishment ever again. After reading other negative  postings and one about their two year old child that had to sit on his father's lap for breakfast due to lack of service, obviously this place is not a family friendly restaurant. What a let down. We did however went to another restaurant in downtown Olmsted falls, the waitress was delighted to assist our family! She was very polite and gave attention to our kids! What a difference it was and we were generous with the a 40% gratuity tip. We are people that usually give compliments to assure good service and it takes a lot for us to give negative feedback. Please reconsider this place if you are looking for breakfast as a family with kids. Business need to realize that all the customer wants is good service and to be understood when needing assistance. I really hope the staff and owner gets training in customer service."
1,I wish we could give them a half star instead of a full star.  Glad we made it out alive.  Service was horrible they forgot our two cinnamon rolls and coffees.  Just a terrible experience.
1,"Went out for breakfast on a Sunday morning and decided to give the Iowa cafe another try.  We were sat and ignored.  Other patrons came in, sat, water and drinks served and still no one came by.  We waited ten minutes and walked out.   Done with this place."
1,"Do not waste your time. The website clearly states dinner seven days a week from 3 pm to 2 am. The last time I checked, 11 pm falls within that time range. Upon my arrival at this restaurant the hostess/waitress/maid didn't bother to greet me.  The floors were sticky...so much for cleanliness. When I requested a seat to have dinner, she informed me that the kitchen was closed because they close early during the week. Why have a website posting for dinner seven days a week until 2am???  Don't actually expect any breakfast at 8 am. The entire restaurant staff will still be in bed though they claim breakfast is available at 8 am. They have the audacity to have a human interest segment showcasing their establishment on a local news channel! They may have the largest patio in the area yet they have the smallest and worse ambiance and customer services! Deuces and good riddance!"
1,"Food was good and my burger was cooked perfectly. My mean was ruined by an off duty employee who came in by himself and sat right next to us at the bar. He continued to have loud conversations with all of the employees. We tried to eat with them gathered around us. They were literally standing at the end of the bar having conversations across my wife and I who were in the first 2 seas. People kept coming to ask him to cover shifts and ask about his upcoming vacation in Vegas, bro... I have never worked at a restaurant that let employees come drink on their day off because it alienates the other customers. Oh... now he is sharing his fries with the bar tender as I am writing this. Thanks for ruining my meal. Now they are having a conversation ab trying to bang some girl one more time before she gets married next week.... Incase you we're wondering, she didn't say ""yes,"" but she didn't say ""no!"""
1,"I love trying new places so I gave this place a try. So, I ordered 2 pizzas, fried zucchini and breadsticks and the pizza Fritz.  My total cost was approximately $80 and it was the most disappointing pizza and sides I have ever ordered. The pizza cheese was rubbery, the crust had no flavor with the texture of cardboard, the breadsticks looked  like they were from Olive Garden but were dense and flavorless. I could go on, but I have already wasted my money, time and a meal on this place. All I can say DONT DO IT!"
1,"Placed an online order,  never received package even though tracking stated deliveried. Contacted via email to verify address was correct. No response. Emailed again, no response. Have to now report to my credit card company, stay away from online ordering no customer service"
1,"This place is overpriced, management is super unfriendly, not happy about the food either. If you are in Berea you're better off going literally anywhere else. Takes forever to get recognized when you walk in and when you sit down you're not even greeted for another 15 minutes, and as a waitress myself, that makes me cringe. Would not send friends this way. Only to maybe grab a cup of coffee through the drive through so you don't have to go inside and actually receive the bad service."
1,Wanted to try this place since it opened and finally got the chance. Extremely disappointed....canned mushrooms? Really? With a full service grocery store right behind you? Too pricey for canned ingredients. Save your money and your taste buds and go to Brooklyn V's across the street.
1,The food here stinks! I will never go back again! Don't waste your time and money there are other restaurants with better quality food!
1,"I read the reviews here on Yelp and really thought I had found a place to help with my constant neck and low back pain. However....
Called them in the morning and asked if they accepted my insurance.  They said that they did accept my insurance. Made an appointment for that afternoon.  Took time off of work, showed up 30 minutes early, filled out the new patient forms and was then told that I could not use my insurance for the chiropractor.  Since the chiropractor was not in my insurance's network, they wanted me to pay $100 (my normal copay is $35).
When the appointment was made they specifically said two things:
1. They accepted my insurance
2. I would see the chiropractor on the first visit
If they knew that I was going to see the chiropractor, they should have also known that the chiropractor would not be covered by my insurance.  This is extremely frustrating.  I am not quite sure if this ""mistake"" is just plain incompetence or actually unethical business practice.
Either way, I do not think I will be returning to this facility.
I can't speak to the efficacy of the treatment staff, but i can say that I do not trust the administrative department (the people that will communicate with my insurance and actually facilitate my financial ability to receive treatment).
Unfortunately, I am still in pain, and still searching for treatment."
1,"Apparently Kim the woman who answers the phone also runs the business in Maricopa High anyway.
I showed up for my appointment and explained that I wasn't able to get their forms to download on my computer.  She reacted like I had just slapped her in the face.
Her response was that there wasn't time to fill out forms before the appointment so that even though I had called the day before and expressed that I was in some pain that I wouldn't be able to keep my appointment.  
The doctor walked out from the back and she repeated the whole thing to him.  He had no response one way or the other.
So it seems that in Maricopa anyway.... paperwork is more important then their patient who is in pain.  There was no offer to reschedule just that I couldn't be seen.
I won't be back.... with or without paperwork. Lol"

1,"I came here with a friend to get a gel-manicure. I was expecting a relaxing and quality experience, but this was not what I received. The lady doing my nails seemed to have never done nails before. She filed my skin which was very painful. I decided to suck it up, and hope that she would be able to paint nails better. She ended up only painting the top of my nails, not getting any of the sides. I asked if she could please paint the side of my nails and she stated ""only one more coat"". One more coat did not fix my nails as they were still not painted all the way. When I asked if someone could fix my nails, one lady tried. Anyway, I left extremely dissatisfied. My gel nails chipped within one day. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Service was terrible and a very low quality nail job."

1,"Ok here it goes. When it comes to my teeth, I have ALWAYS taken care of them. I brush and floss at the very least 3-4 times a day. I recently moved to Vegas, but before I did, I saw my old dentist. I had X-rays, exam and a cleaning. He gave me a clean bill of health.
6 months later I made an appointment with Dee for dentist. Again I had X-rays, exam and Cleaning. Dr. Dee came in and informed me that I had 4 cavities and I would need a replacement crown because the tooth underneath was completely rotten. At first I said ok, so I tried to make an appt to get work done. I was informed that I had to pay in full when I made appt.
So I said I would call. The more I thought about it, the more I felt this couldn't be right. I called my out of state Dr asking him to look at my X-rays of 6 months ago and asked him if it was possible for all of this could happen in 6 months. He did and called me back. He said to get a second opinion beforehand because he saw nothing in my X-rays.
I went to another dentist. I said nothing until after his exam. He saw 2 teeth he recommended to replace filling and showed me recent cracks in those teeth. I asked him about the tooth with crown. He said he saw absolutely NO DECAY. So, my advice to anyone? Which leads me to believe they were trying to make money, rather then giving me good dental care!Go to another dentist! If you choose to stay? At least get a second opinion! I will be reporting her to the American Dental Association!"
1,Don't like.  Cramped. The help is rude and loud. The waitress dressed like a tramp and the food was average.  Loud TVs.  Too many people.  Heard the waitresses personal life to other staff.  Won't go back. Like ever ever again.
1,"Lets just start out by saying....years ago when you saw the word Cafe, you just knew the food was going to be great, the waitresses would greet you like they'd known you for years & the owner would be right there helping & making sure everyone felt welcome! This is not the case at this Cafe!!!! The older lady that seated us, was gruff, extremely rude & was very nasty to my husband & I with her tone of voice. Why would you own an eating establishment if you were not a people person? Doesn't make sense at all. This owner & I'm being more than polite, is an ASS!! I felt sorry for the staff & yes she spoke down to them too. So, the ONLY reason the Iowa Cafe even gets one star, is because of our waitress (Katie) who was soooo sweet & spoke to us like we were real people. THANK YOU KATIE, you are an angel. The Iowa Cafe should have a sign on the door that reads ""WARNING....ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK, OWNER HAS HER HEAD UP HER ASS""!!!!!"
1,"Over weight locals and their fat kids flock to the Sunday brunch.  But unless you like gorging on all you can eat bacon and sausage patties while sitting in a dance hall I'd just hit a Bob Evans.  Oh, the coffee was extra at the brunch.   Just an overpriced Golden Coral Sunday Brunch.  I don't know what's on their menu cause they never gave us a menu.  I was happy to see others going up for a third plateful, since I never got close to shoving $12.99 worth of bacon into my mouth, at least someone was getting my money's worth."
1,"Scotty what's going on at Puff? Usually get really good service not sure what we got today. Walked in for juice, asked a couple questions and just got an couple shoulder shrugs instead. Kids behind the counter talking about a transaction not being completed and how the register was going to be short. Seriously??? Charging a dollar to try juice now?? We asked about a promo we saw online kid working the register was completely unaware of any promotion. Finished the transaction and wasn't offered a receipt. Used to have a shop full of knowledgeable people working."
1,"Sorry, but our experience was a total let-down. Expensive and it didn't taste any better than a frozen pizza."
1,"Unfortunately, Yelp does not allow for zero star ratings.  If I could, this place would be at the top of the list.  I wanted to order a pizza and wings for the Super Bowl.  Since this is a place I have not been to in Chicago or Phoenix, I wanted to look at the menu on line.  However, that was not the case.  Each time I tried, I got ""This page could not be displayed"".  On top of that, the results were the same on all three browsers I have installed on the computer (Chrome, Firefox and IE).  

However, the worst was calling the restaurant.  Just imagine you call a restaurant to place an order and you receive a voice mail message that ""the mailbox is full and cannot receive new messages.""

Being originally from the South Side of Chicago where this restaurant is from, I take personal affront to any restaurant being from my home city and providing subpar customer service.  Fix your website so your customers can see what you offer and get some kind of phone system that actually works!!"
1,Too expensive. Portions too small. Zero food quality. Iowa Cafe gives chains a great name. Go to the Cracker Barrel!
1,Waited an hour with an appt (albeit made earlier in the day) only to be told that they only had me down for a gel manicure. I left- complete waste of time.
1,I ate there bison burger yesterday and it was the nastiest burger I've ever had Well not eat there again
1,"The food here stinks compared to when the prior owner operated it.  The previous location was scary looking and the kids were afraid to go in and eat there but the food (and especially pies) used to be fabulous.  The new location is a much nicer place but in no way makes up for the food. We have gone to the new location twice now and none of us want to go back.  It is just not the same food at all. Although the staff are friendly and the service is great, they basically yell.  We were seated way in the back and all I could hear were the staff constantly talking, yelling or laughing.  It was very annoying!  Acting that excited to see a customer is just a little too much and doesn't feel sincere anyway.  The food is overpriced for the quality in my opinion."
1,"Dr. Dee is a fake greedy hack.  She has been remanded by the NV Dental Board for the amateur hack job she did on me.

She was in such a hurry drilling out a cavity (during first appt.), that she cracked a tooth, then LIED to me about it.  She was hoping the 3 mm crack would somehow heal itself (it then needed a root canal by Dr. Gatan, and now needs an implant - still causing extreme pain).

She then doubled down on her LIE by immediately ordering me NOT TO CHEW on that side of my mouth, then proceeded to work on me over the next 3 months, while continually telling me to not chew on that side of my mouth.

I now have a more severe collapsed bite, and a tooth that is killing me and needs an implant. I live with a tongue depressor as a stint, and I only eat soft foods.  I have been crippled by Dr. Dee.  

STAY AWAY FROM HER!  SHE IS AN EVIL GREEDY HACK!"
1,So im just leaving this place and not only did both of my garlic cheesebread have wax paxer stuck to them but the pizza was also all over the top of the box. And then when u drove the 7 miles back to return it. They were closed at 820....this place sucks
1,"Wort customer service I've had in a long time. In addition, toppings were stale and my daughter and I were treated poorly. I will not be coming back to this place."
1,"Extremely slow service and HAIR in food!

4 out of the last 5 times I've been here, the service has been terrible. August 21st was our last and final time.  We were sat down in the corner. And yes, they were busy for a Sunday. But not completely packed.  It took 11 minutes before we were seen by anybody just to order drinks.  11 minutes may not sound long, but that's completely unacceptable in the restaurant business. So of course we ordered our food as well after we saw our waitress for the first time, cause who knew how long it would be before we saw her again. 
      The food was always good.  It's what kept us coming back.  Hoping they could get a handle on the abysmally slow service. But this Sunday after my girlfriend finished her plate of biscuits and gravy, she found a HAIR in her gravy! Buried right at the bottom. Disgusting.  We'll never be back there again."
1,"Unless your over 60 don't go , waited to be seated , people got seated in front of us . Order food came out bland and tasteless . When we got the bill it was someone else's bill, finally got ours and it still didn't seem right . Finally just paid and left to get out of there . Won't be back ."
1,"30 minutes for breakfast. Older, thin, dark brown/reddish haired waitress seemed to only be able handle one table at a time. She had blinders on the rest on her tables needs. Didn't look up to glance around at her other tables. Didn't refill coffee. We had to physically get up and track her down to ask for the check. Grease stain on the wall of our booth. Food was so so."
1,"After dining at Iowa Cafe for over 20+ years I, along with my extended family & friends, will no longer frequent this establishment. I have had 3 disappointing visits in a row. It is apparent Iowa Cafe has lost its ambience and graciousness to its customers. Reading the other reviews on here I see others feel the same way. The current employees are destroying the image of the cafe which in turn results in loyal clientele no longer wanting to dine there again. 

I came last week with 2 of my friends. Sat down for lunch at around 11:00am. Beverages served right away. Only one other table was in there waiting for their food. 3 other tables had already eaten and were finishing up. We ordered around 11:05am. Another table sat down beside us. 10 minutes passed by. My side salad was served. By 11:35 still no food. The table after us was served their food. Their entrees pretty much matched our selections . So why were they served first? Why didn't a waitress come to our table during this whole time and check on us? We would have liked to have refills beverages and updated about our food. My empty salad bowl and empty iced tea glass remained ignored for at least 10 minutes. It wasn't as if the 2 waitresses were busy by all means. I noticed our waitress went outside twice to smoke while we were sitting there. When she came back in from smoking and touching the front entrance door handle she never washed her hands. She was also playing with her cell phone a lot. Which I know has to be filthy too. Needless to say, with the wait, the feel of being ignored, and the disgust of our waitress's filthy hands we decided to leave. I did put down $8.00 on the table for the 3 iced teas and side salad. I'm sure that money never made it to the cash register. As we were leaving, the waitresses good and well knew we were leaving disappointed, acknowledged our movement and said in a sarcastic voice ""Thank you! Enjoy your day!"". This confirmed to me that this was no longer the Iowa Cafe that my entire family would gather to for special lunches over the years. The cafe my grandmother enjoyed the Giant Pork Tenderloin and the cafe my grandfather use to compare the Country Fried Steak to my grandmother's is now tainted with heavily tattooed and disrespectful employees. I can go on and mention the other last 2 bad experiences. One with my father that he never got to eat and the other with my mother where it took over an hour to have lunch with being the only table there. But I think I have expressed enough with what I have shared so far. I tried to reach out to the owner to share my experiences before writing this review. Five days have passed without contact.

I can no longer recommend this restaurant. If comfort food is what you are looking for these types of diners are a dime a dozen in this area of Mesa. You can Google or Yelp the word ""diner"" and find a restaurant that truly values your patronage."
1,"I'm so sorry, but I couldn't give this place more than 1 star. 
Let me first start by saying for almost 2 months I've been trying to get my workman's comp situated. I work for the federal government, as you can imagine, everything moves slowly.  I chose to go Arizona Spine for my PT based on reviews.  I wanted the best place and I thought this was it.
I was in contact with AZ spine for several weeks, trying to get everything in place. I noticed every time I called and spoke to (I don't want to mention the name) X, she always seemed eager to help and was very, very nice, but she never called me back even though she told me she would call me back ""either way.""  I let this slide, every time, since they had great reviews. 
The workmans comp was just taking too long so I decided to just start PT and pay for it myself. 
I made an appointment for yesterday for my initial consult and exam. The physical therapist was very nice, did a few things to ease up my pain, and showed me how to use the foam roller. She showed me 2 ways to use the foam roller and then she handed me off to the tech to show me the rest. So I hung out with the tech for awhile, but I didn't feel he was helping me like I needed him to and he just wasn't very friendly. 
The physical therapist knew I was an avid gym goer and I wanted to be shown things that I could do to build up my strength using proper form so I could get back into the gym ASAP. 
So, after doing some stretches with the tech, he said my session was over and showed me the exit sign and said you can go out that door to the front. So, I go to the front to make a follow up appointment. The clerk, is busy, scattered and just can't handle answering any questions. I asked how much follow-up sessions were and she said it's anywhere from whatever to whatever and then the additional fees based on what other services the therapist adds to my sessions. I've heard that a few times by now and I stated I'm not sure what that means since I wasn't given any recommendations or any type of real treatment plan. Mind you, my workmans comp hasn't been situated, so I'm paying for all of this out of my pocket, so I have to be pretty careful and know exactly how much this is going to cost me so I can determine how many times a week I can go.  So after getting a vague answer from the front desk clerk, having her hand me a price sheet of services that they offered with the cost breakdown, I was scheduling my appointment. I asked her how many times a week is recommended for me to come and she said ""didn't she tell you?"" I said no, she didn't tell me anything. I never saw the physical therapist again since she handed me off to the tech. I didn't even have a treatment plan. So, after talking to this frazzled, too busy to really help me and answer questions, i ran out of time and had another appointment to get to, so I never did find out how many times a week I needed to come in. 
This happened on a Saturday(9/19/2016). Maybe some of the staff aren't very motivated. It did cost me $100, out of my own pocket and I'm not really sure what it was I paid for. This appointment was a disaster. I work in healthcare and I couldn't imagine just dumping a patient on a tech and never talking to them again. I've actually never had an experience like this before from a medical provider. I'm incredibly disappointed."
1,"Where to start. I love this food but now prefer my original location on 43rd Ave. I buy the entertainment coupon book every year and use it to buy the same torta paquime combo I like but today they wouldn't accept it. Don't advertise in a coupon book who's coupons your not going to accept! Tables were dirty and service was not great like the location on 43rd Ave.
Also we asked if they could wipe out tables.. They wiped other surrounding tables but ours. We waited a bit and asked  again. So the woman came to wipe it.. Didn't say anything to us. We said thank you, because we appreciated that she cleaned it, there was pozole on it. She stormed off not uttering a word. Just rude!"
1,Some of the worst service ever at a Waffle House. Seems like a bunch of kids working. They are just messing around and talking while customers are in store. They messed up my order. I got part of it and then had to wait for the rest of it.
1,Price gouging at its finest. My son took his girlfriend there for lunch today. She ordered an eight dollar lunch item and asked for a side of sweet-and-sour sauce to flavor her rice. The charge for the sauce was four dollars. This was more than my son's egg rolls. So her $8 lunch became $12. Nothing was said about the extra charge when she asked for it. Be careful for this crappy way to make more money.    Food is good but this sucked.  No different than if McDonalds charged $4 for ketchup to go with the fries.
1,"Discovered this place about a month ago and tonight was my 5th and LAST time ever going. Ordered pizza and wings. Out of an order of wings 4 of them were so small that they should have been thrown away instead of served to customers. I uploaded a picture for you to see for yourself. Look in the photos and you will see a chicken wing next to a sugar packet. The sugar packet is bigger than the chicken wing. In my entire life I have never seen wings this small. Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!
Never have I been victim to such awful customer service in my entire life. This place could have had a customer for life with my wife and I, now I can guarantee I will never step foot in the House of Pizza ever again."
1,"The absolute worst example of piss
Poor customer service one very well might experience anywhere.  Unfriendly, slow, and cavalier. Deplorable."
1,"Quality of food in no way matches the over priced menu. 
Not kid friendly. Service was awful yet 18% was included in the bill. Never eating here again."
1,"This place was so horrible that it's comical. I came here on a Saturday morning with a total party of 8. One star goes out for the friendliness of the staff. Otherwise, nothing good from it. This may be my first 1 star review on my whole yelp account!!

1. Ordered 6 mimosas and there was a huge layer of pulp on the top. My friends hated how bubbly it was (I tolerated it though). No one drank more than five sips.

2. We waited for over a half hour for our food. Mind you, all of us either got pancakes, fruit salad, or eggs Benedict. It's not like we all had different orders. Now, the wait would have been acceptable if it wasn't for point 3 that I will discuss next.

3. Pancakes were straight up cardboard and burnt. One of my friends pancake order was missing the sausage and bacon that came with it. We later found it hidden in between each pancake. Now that was absolutely hilarious. The pancake stack went like this: pancake 1(bottom) - hidden bacon - pancake 2(middle) - hidden sausage - pancake 3(top). How does that even happen???! LOL

Thankfully my eggs Benedict order was tolerable. We ended up spending a little less than 2 hours there. Honestly, we could have made breakfast at our Airbnb, saved money, AND have a better tasting meal. 

I guess the only good thing that came out of this was an insanely good laugh. I really wish I took a picture of the hidden bacon and sausages though. That was seriously priceless."
1,"Went thru Drive-thru today at 9:45 am. Note says they can only accept cash, debit card & dd perks. 5 cars in front of me. I got to the payment window only to be told Cash payment only but cashier says I can pay debit card & dd perks in the front inside store. So i went inside and waited in line again. 3 people ahead of me. Then I was told their system is totally down and manager told me they have been having issues with card payments all morning.

So I left at 10:15 a.m with nothing. A total waste of time. If you are having ""issues"" with payment - SHUT DOWN the restaurant until you are fully functional. Worst Dunkin Donut ever.

 Come here if you want to wait & never get your order."
1,"Just moved to NoDa this week and decided to try out The Dog Bar. Parked in the parking lot for the dog bar and bar next door. The entire parking lot was a mess and people were parked behind cars not in spots. I parked next to a dozen other cars (of note, there were no marked ""spots"") all of which were facing the train tracks and not blocking anyone. There were no international towing signs. 

We went in and instantly smelled the dog urine stuck in the plastic astroturf (terrible idea for an area exposed to rain and dog urine). It was fine overall. 

When we left, my car was no longer there... we looked around in the parking lot and finally found an obscure sign with words that said you must be a dog bar or blind pig bar customer... which we were so we were still confused. There was still no international towing sign/symbol. We called the towing company and they said our car was ""too close to the track"" which is ironic because there was no sign saying anything about being towed or about the train tracks and the distance you needed to be. We went into the bar and told the bartender, she said ""oh no! Yeah you can't see any spots they just come in and tow everyone, that sucks"". The cars that were illegally parked behind people and not in ""spots"" were not towed because I recognized the same cars backed up behind one another not in spots.) I am very frustrated with The Dog Bars response as well, if they often tow people for being too close to the tracks there should absolutely be a sign a few areas has a cement block but much of the area where people were parking did not. We were not closer than other cars to the track. Again, there would need to be an international tow sign. 

Needless to say, even though we relocated to NoDa we will be driving the extra 15 minutes to Lucky Dog Bark & Brew, where they have clearly marked parking spots and they don't tow. On top of that the facility is amazing and doesn't have old soiled AstroTurf. I highly recommend skipping this place for not only the parking inconvenience since they tow for unclear reason but also the place is a dump. 

Also the tow fee was $200, ridiculous. I'll never return and will make sure to warn people about this place. Not worth it."
1,"I have been wanting to try waffle house since I moved here because we dont have them in San Diego to my knowledge.  Well, really, my gf has been telling me how great they are ""after a night of partying""... and we don't party all that much so Saturday night, after a LONG night we decided to go with our neighbor, and it must have been about 3 am (technically Sunday).

So we finally get there and we go ahead and have a seat because there is no sign telling us to wait to be seated.

There are no menus and the only table available is dirty with dishes left over from the last patrons. But we figured, its late and they probably just left.  So we sat and waited to be greeted/drink order taken/table cleaned?  Something?  Anything??  HELLO!?!?!  

Meanwhile the waitress is waiting on people sitting at the counter, truckers I guess? -she's chattin it up and having a gay old time.

Finally after about 15 to 20 mins ( felt like an eternity, especially at 3 am) we got up and left and shouted a big THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING as I left. 

Wow... It will have to be a seriously long night before I ATTEMPT to eat there again.

I'm told ""the other locations are not like that"".  I'll believe that when and if I see it.

PS, IHOP is so good at 3:30 am!!!  I dont care if its a chain... it hit the spot  and they don't pretend that you're invisible.

And if I could give this Waffle House NO stars I would."
1,I love DD but today was the worst service. I had to wait 15 minutes before someone even saw me inside the store and they weren't even busy! I usually get the same coffee and today it was just not very good... Very disappointed....
1,"seriously what is up w this location?!? 
A few weeks ago they were running a special for card users for $.99 large dark roast iced coffee. The guy charged me full price. Tried to refund me the amount on my DD card n rang it up again and still full price. He proceeded to tell me that the system was down and gave me two free drinks. Well at full price that didn't amount to what it wldve been w the discount so I called customer service and they gave me 3 free drinks. She said he wasn't ringing it up as dark roast which is why price didn't change. 
I go today bc there is another special for any size espresso drink $1.99. Ive been going all week. Rings up $2.15 after tax. Today she scanned my card and nope, the price didn't change. I said it's supposed to be $2.15. She scanned card again and then once more. After waiting about 5 minutes she said w an attitude that the system is down and it probably didn't charge your card anyway. I asked for her name and drove off. So help me if my card is charged 3 times when it updates Im gonna lose it. That location needs to get their ish together!!!"
1,The staff and manager kept gossiping and ignoring customers. My donut tasted bland and raw. My coffee was given to me cold. My coworker's order is always wrong every time she goes. The counters are all sticky. Just avoid this place.
1,So I'm conflicted  with giving this place a single star but I had to for the terrible treatment by the manager KAT to one of her employees BELLE. When on vaca my family always comes to this Dunkin because the coffee is always good and the service is fast.  This is the first time I came and was totally disgusted in how Kat was yelling at her employee. Belle was ringing out the customers the line was long out the door she was also making drinks the only one at the front. The manager KAT comes with her bullying yelling out what's the order I'm taking to you interrupting the customers and Belle taking the order causing confusion. She then begins to bang the sugar container instead of filling it up. I feel she was rude to her employees.
1,"Was really looking forward to checking out howl at the moon. I'd been to another location years ago. Singers tonight were terrible, I've heard better karaoke... Left before finishing overpriced drinks."
1,"Short version: worst massage ever. 
Longer version...
Things started off with them 20 minutes behind schedule. Not a big deal for me, other than the thumb twirling, but this was not a good first impression. Went upstairs to a room to get started. I was asked what kind of massage I wanted, to which I said deep pressure. I was asked if there was an area I needed extra time on. Okay, we're in the  zone here. I said back and shoulders. Then it started. The relaxing music was fine, but was interrupted by incoming phone calls to the device. No biggie...it's not like I need to reset the Enya to get my relax on...but the masseuse tried to keep massaging while messing with her phone. Weak. Actually, what was really weak was the level of pressure. Even though it was supposed to be deeper pressure, it was more like when TSA pats you down...but with lube. I will say that the hot stones were nice, but the primary thing I was looking for was to work out some knots. That did NOT happen. And the stones kept falling all over the place. *rattle* *clang* A highlight was the 45-second foot rub, which did feel good. *crash* (another stone falling) Overall I left feeling tight and disappointed."
1,Security guy was pushing me...I told him to don't act like that and he called other guys who pushed me away to the entrance sence I told them I brother to live then move for security...place has no respect
1,"Servers are surly. Jennifer is not friendly at all. Really disappointed in the service.

Hash browns all the way are good. But two eggs are $2.75?! Wow.

Need to update the prices and service."
1,"This place is awful and overpriced. The gravy was cold and all the other food was mediocre. We essentially paid $80 for a terrible meal. I would suggest going to another spot. Dennys is better than this place. Also don't order anything from the lunch side of the menu
Stick to the eggs"
1,"What happened here?  I used to eat at this location two or three times a week a few years ago.  Lunch, dinner, drinks - it was excellent!

I stopped here at lunch on a Wednesday in October 2017 on my way home from Columbus.  The thought of Asian cuisine urged me on as I circled Medina square (lol!) twice in order to find a parking space.

I was greeted nicely by a familiar long-term hostess.  I was seated promptly and had a bit of a wait before Cristie came to take my order.  I was very aware that the restaurant closes between 3 PM and 5 PM.  I was there before 1:00.  I ordered a drink and requested a dinner menu (I wanted to order take-out for hubby).  

As an app I ordered shrimp chips - these are fresh, warm, crispy, salty pork rind-like morsels that melt in your mouth!  They were everything I remembered them to be!  I also ordered edamame.  I was presented with mushy grey-green oversalted cold seed pods (with brown spots).  I left most of them on my plate.  How can you screw these up?  Microwaved fresh soy beans would have been better.

For lunch I ordered the Seafood Nest; this is normally a spectacular presentation of lobster meat, scallops, crab, shrimp and veggies in a thick clear sauce, nestled in a hot, sizzling, deep fried, shredded potato basket.  My lunch today included a half-tail lobster in its shell.  The meat was grey in color and when I grasped it to remove it from the shell it was slimy.  I smelled it and it was fishy... I put it aside on my extra plate.  There was NO WAY I was eating this!  The potato basket was cold, chewy and stale.  The seafood mixture was not fresh.  The (fake) crab meat was unnaturally shredded like tassels and laid over the lobster tail.  

I ordered a General Tsao's Chicken dinner for my husband as take out.  The jury is still out on his dinner.

Cristie didn't ask how my lunch was and was non-plussed by the un-eaten grey lobster tail on my plate.  She must have been in a hurry to vamoose - I heard her giving the ""bum's rush"" to a table of four men as I left the restaurant at 2:30.

Bill: $66.00; tip: 15%.  I will not return."
1,"So I must say, I am insanely disappointed in House of Hunan. I always make it a point to eat there every time I am in town. Usually each experience has been pretty good. However, my mom and I ordered take out a couple of nights ago. While we were eating the ""minced chicken and lettuce"" she got a piece of metal in the chicken mixture. It was so disgusting, not to mention she is lucky she didn't break a tooth. We couldn't even bring ourselves to finish the meal we had ordered. Skip forward to today (Friday 4/05) and I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves. (Plus I was craving sushi and I had heard decent reviews.) So I ordered a nothing special avocado roll, a California roll, and an order of edamame. So I went to pick it up and brought the receipt from the previous night (along with the piece of metal) and mentioned that this was in our chicken the other night. The hostess (white male) simple said ""oh yeah, the cooks clean the woks after every order with a stainless steel brush and that happens sometimes."" Not so much as even an apology. I wasn't expecting anything out of this ordeal other than an apology and making sure it doesn't happen to some other poor person who may actually break their tooth... Ok so bad to the sushi that I ordered today... By far the WORST sushi I have ever eaten (and come on it's a freaking avocado and California roll, how hard is that to mess up?!?!) so for beginners, I ordered the sushi to be made with soy paper (which they charged me $2 extra for... Really?! I just moved back from Columbus where I are sushi ALL of the time and they never charged for this and I always had amazing sushi which was also not as pricey.) then they jammed a bunch of nasty pickled ginger in the to go container so the entire row that was next to it tastes like disgusting pickled ginger. Next the rice was so incredibly awful... It was so sweet. Which could only mean it is so insanely processed (yay!!) Do dispite those two issues, I was starving so I attempted to eat a piece or two, which proceeded to completely fall apart. I'm pretty sure I can roll sushi better than they can... I was so ridiculously disappointed with the entire experience. I do not think I can bring myself to spend another dollar there again. Pretty bad customer service coupled with metal pieces and crappy food? No thanks!"
1,"By far the worst persian restaurant we have ever been to. My wife and I were visiting Vegas so we thought it was nice to have persian food while there. We ordered couple of major dishes. lamb kabob and the combination kabob. my wife and I could not even eat the lamb and it went straight to the trash. The other dish was dry, tastless and low quality. $15 dish looked like a $5 lunch special dish! but we finished half of it anyways. We suspect they purposely gave us a low quality food becasue of restaurant.com certificate we had. But why would anyone do this? Just horrible quality. My wife was so mad we didn't even complain and left to eat somewhere else. Complete waste of money. Shame on the owner of this business for runing this joke. Gives persians a bad name. Not recommended at all."
1,"Fatal, i had another perspective about buffets, grease meats, old and raw fishes... and it wasn't sushi.. and if we talk about the sushi no taste at all..I decided to go this place cause was close to my hotel, but definitively I should effort myself better looking for a place  to eat...now I understand why is so cheap!!!! But I think for the quality of food this restaurant is really expensive. Never again  ( go to a buffet restaurant)"
1,"I booked this massage as a tester of the facility through Groupon. When I booked the appointment the receptionist was confused as to how Groupon worked and couldn't imagine how I booked two massages through one Groupon voucher. As my friend and I entered the door we were greeted with a warm welcome, a still baffled receptionist and the smells of aromatherapy. The staff/patrons were running late so we were placed into a relaxation room for 15 minutes on comfortable chase lounges until we were called upon for our time slot. Once inside the room, my massage therapist asked a few questions then soon after the massage began. I will have to say one of the worst massages I have ever had, yet the massage therapist was nice, yet too chatty ( including politics, aliens & cancer). The massage did last the full hour but did not impress. Lacked imagination, a lot of warm towels were applied, and I booked a full body massage which did not happen. Overall, I will not be returning to this facility."
1,This location is horrible! Wait is always minimum of 20 minutes! They always get something wrong with the orders and once I even found a long piece of plastic in my coffee!
1,"So I was in the area visiting a friend and I saw this place and decided to stop in. As soon as I opened the door I was met with a foul odor. I was greeted by a lady. I wasn't sure if she would seat me or if I sat myself(never visited a Waffle House before) after an awkward silence she said ""ok"" and walked off. I sat down at the bar stools and looked at the depressing placement menu. The same lady can back and asked if she could get me something. I told her I'll just look at the menu for a while. Again this place smells. So I'm already not liking it. From where I am sitting you can see the whole kitchen line. It was a mess. I've been to culinary school and I know how to keep s kitchen. This was dreadful. Dirty pan and utensils thrown about. This place looks outdated, dirty, and it smells terrible. After taking a fake phone call to get out of there I wrote this review. I never got close to trying the food. Maybe I came on a bad day, but I'll never be back anyway because I don't live close. Over all bad atmosphere, awkward service, and food????pass"
1,Every time I go here I regret It.. the food and coffee is great but the workers hate their life and they show it! They are slow on purpose !
1,"Mediocre tapas. Also, the inside of the restaurant was uncomfortably hot on a scorching day and when I complained to the waitress, she told me that's how they keep it.

We ended up eating outside. Servive was slow. A potato dish with no fish tasted fishy.

It seems that Las Vegas still only has one tapas place -- Firefly."
1,"We went to Dunkin Donuts tonight. It says they are open until 9pm. We pulled up at 8:55pm. All the lights were off, everything was locked up tight, and trays were in front of the door. No cars around.  It looked like it had been closed for some time. Update your hours if you aren't open that late ."
1,"Last year, I was dining here and a rat ran out across the dining room floor. All of the customers were in an uproar and yelling. The managers tried to act like it was an Oreo and like we had not seen it. They also still made people pay for their food even if they left. I used to love this place until them. Today I viewed a news article about them violating health standards by preparing food outside on the filthy ground. DON'T EAT HERE. Find another Chinese buffet."
1,"Came here with some good people from the firm. I've been a to a few of these dueling piano bars around the country and this place is an epic fail for one reason and one reason only - it is way, way, way over priced. Three beers and three shots of Patrón tequilla ran us $50. This is ALMOST New York prices...but we're at Charlotte (it is located in the downtown EpiCentre)! Don't get me wrong, Charlotte is a nice town and all, but there is nothing really happening there that can command that price level. 

Other than the price, service & performance were just so-so. This won't be on my repeat list."
1,"This place is so frustrating. It's the only Dunkin Donuts on my way I to work so I have to goto this location. The drive thru makes you repeat your order multiple times. I swear they are not even by the register when they ask you your order. Then they just keep asking you to repeat yourself u til they can get to the machine. I was born and raised speaking English, so it's not like they are having a hard time understanding me. Then god forbid if there is other cars in the drive through. I just sat 15 minuets to get a coffee with only 2 cars in front of me."
1,I ordered something of a Long Island iced tea sort of drink and what I got was literally a watered down version of what it was supposed to be. I feel like they literally put a dash of tap water in my drink to fill it up. Very disappointed. First time there. Live music was okay.
1,Love dunkin and will never stop visiting but 15 minutes in a drive through is a bit much.
1,"After seeing wait and cook staff behind the restaurant throwing ""snot rockets"", wiping their noses, and then wiping on their aprons, I just could not find it in me to step a foot in that place again.  While some of the food is okay, what I had wasn't that tasty.  I asked for spicy in my dish and it barely tasted like they added anything.  The interior is nice and the doors open to the square, very nice touch.  
If I could give them a zero I would...just for lack of being clean.  Just plain gross."
1,"Dirty,Dirty ,It's not kabab ,it's junk ,they add lot of food color to cheap meat,very oily ,low quality rice , I been there 2 week s ago ,after the guy bring the food ,I ask the owner to refund the money ,He swipe the credit card  and give me the receipted for refund but after 2 weeks no money back to my account ,beware if you went there make sure ,they don't give you fake refund receipt,This is baddest experience I had in restaurant,Don't put your Health on risk."
1,"The quality of food was awful, I ordered soltani kabab there. The meat was overcooked and so tough !! Also the owner gives costumers low quality plastic fork, spoon and small plates which made eating that hard meat even worse! The amosphere of restaurant was dark, cold and so depressing with old dirty curtians that reminds me Miss Hawisham's house in great expectation movie. Do not burn your money by choosing this terrible restaurant!!!"
1,"This is a great place if you get off on rude service. Yeah, I love the dogs and their owners are pretty cool but the the gal that works the bar has the personality of wallpaper. The only thing this place has going is that they are the only game in town. If there were another, they'd clearly be the loser. Last night I was swindled for $20 when I was told I had to register my dogs (I have two). Oddly the place was crowded but I was the only one who had to pay the $20. The Dog Bar bites big time, even my dog had a poopy time."
1,"I went there for a custom facial. If the girl who did the facial was well trained, she hid it well. I guess the skin analysis they go on and on about on their very professional looking website consists on merely the question ""do you have any skin conditions"". She just started doing stuff, no info, no questions and she didn't keep me posted even after I initially asked what she was doing. Right after the cleansing, she did a really long ""massage"" which just didn't feel very good. When I asked her what she was putting on my face she said ""oh just massage oil"". It was weird to me, also because this took very long and when I go for a facial I want attention paid to my skin and not a 15 minute face/ arm rub right in the beginning, not even if it would be a very good one. I can go on and on about different little things that all amounted to the impression that the whole thing was rather amateur like- for 85 bucks (had appointment misbooked, kept forgetting to not touch/rub my one arm bc of injury). The girl was personally friendly though, I have to say that..."
1,"This place was/IS disappointing. Bought some tacos and as soon as I bit into it I spit it right back out! Possibly the worst tasting food I've ever bought. Will not be coming back, trust me there are like 3 better Mexican food places near this one."
1,Worst kabob ever! The kabob was spicy and didn't come with a grilled tomato. Persian kabob is not spicy and always is served with grilled tomato. The portion was small and the price was too high for what they serve. They also serve their kabob in a plastic container. This is NOT Persian food.
1,"This is a great idea, but run by really cranky people and antagonistic patrons.  Like everyone is just pissed off and waiting to scold another dog owner.   I've gone a few times, and someone is always getting yelled at for some reason or another.  The dogs are happy, but the clients and wait staff are incredibly UNfriendly."
1,"If you come here to hear the live music, I'd skip it. The singing is better at a karaoke bar."
1,"I went to this restaurant just once...
the quality of the food is not well enough for the price, actually it sucks...
you will serve the food in plastic dishes and utensils, with a little bit of rice, yogurt and salad.
 ( I emphasize that food comes with ""little bit"" of these sides )
The decoration of this damn place doesn't look like a high ranking restaurant... subway or chipotle decorations are much more better ...
I don't recommend it at all. 
compared to the other Persian restaurant which I've tried before, Flame Kabob in Las Vegas cause a very bad memory of Persian restaurant for me."
1,"Party and Event Planners BEWARE!!!

I was attempting to plan a party for 50 people, 8-11 PM, $5,000 budget for food and open bar.  I do this same party in cities all over the country.  The ONLY time I pay a room rental fee is when I book a bowling alley space, and it is typically about $1,500.  This place wanted $3,500 in ""room rental fees"", and they let me know this 3 weeks after I reached out to them initially with all my event specs.

I called Corporate and really didn't get anywhere with them either.  All in all, I lost about a full work day and my sanity dealing with this.  Do yourself a favor and book at Strike City or Whiskey River, you will have a MUCH better experience!"
1,Sunday morning spent 15 minutes waiting in the drive thru before I finally decided to stop waiting for coffee and left. I'm not sure how anyone gets coffee here the wait is worse than Starbucks and it's not anywhere close to as busy.
1,"This is not the best Dunkin Donuts location in this town. They have continuously got my order wrong. 1st. I ordered a set of dozen donuts and they gave me 6 instead. When I got into my car I barley realized it and I had to wait another 10 min in line.

2nd. I ordered a medium ice coffee hazelnut coffee, but instead the barista gave me a coconut small. No big deal I got the issue solved.
 
3rd. I was the only person in the drive thru lane, and it was dead inside the store. I ordered my food and ice coffee, and I was in line for 10 min. The gentlemen took my money and didn't give me my order until the manager came out and apologized for the delay.

4th. This is my last time coming to this location!! Today I ordered an ice coffee and the barista didn't put cream in my coffee, it was so bitter. I didn't get time to taste my coffee because I was heading off to work."
1,"The past 2 times I've eaten here I've gotten sick. When they first opened, they were on point but that went downhill very quickly. The sushi is always warm and I used the term ""sushi"" lightly. It's mostly fried with creamy stuff squirted on top. Either way, should be served cold in order to not spoil. The service is ok but the experience is miserable. It's always loud with screaming kids running around. I wouldn't mind paying a premium to keep the riff raff out and improve the quality of food but as is, I won't be back."
1,"The WORST customer service! Slow, dumb, and rude people work at this location. Only come here if you want to wait in drive thru for 28 min, have some screw up your order, and then get snippy when you tell them they screwed up.
Won't be back ever again!"
1,"My wife's massage last year was fantastic and was the reason I bought it for her again while in town for the holidays.

 Only giving one stars this time because of their flexibility in showing up late. Not sure if the masseuse was certified for pregnant massages, but my wife didn't even have her back massaged (not because she didn't want it), was jerked around on the table, and she was unfocused throughout. Overall, the experience wasn't relaxing at all. I'll probably give Evolve another shot next year, but this experience was not worth the hassle of driving there, let alone the cost."
1,If you are looking for a dueling piano bar this is NOT the place. It is 1 musician at a time singing a song. How is that considered dueling?  There is no comedy in the show just basically someone singing an entire song. Will never come back.
1,"bought a groupon voucher for this restaurant, as soon as my wife and I entered there  was a strong odor of sewage like smell, which explains why the restaurant was completly empty of patrons other the the owner sitting on a table. 
Our groupon voucher was declined by the cashier stating that we had to use it at their other location at Henderson which is about 30 miles away, although the groupon voucher did not state this, the cashier admitted that the goupon voucher was valid but not at this location as he put it, "" we have two stores you have to go to the other one"" I informed the  cashier that this was not stipulated in the goupon order and the restaurant is empty anyway and why not just take our order since there is no one in here at 2;00 pm? , nevertheless he said no cant take it.
Then on my way out the owner sitting on a table even attempted to add insult to me by saying: ""DONT FORGET YOUR PAPER YOU LEFT ON THE TABLE"" he was referring to a flyer that my two year old had in his hand and left it at the table.
      I did however inform the owner that he can just go ahead and keep the paper."
1,"My lady and I visited this restaurant to grab a gyro on my way to work. She went to the restroom and saw a huge cockroach twitching around on the floor. 

Once she returned to the table the food arrived and we took it back to the counter untouched to get a refund. The man at the counter ""Das"" refused to give us a refund. According to him having ROACHES in your building doesnt affect the food in the kitchen. 

Don't eat Gyros with ROACH meat."
1,"One star is generous...we have, more than once, had bad food here; but our most recent visit went beyond poor cuisine. First let me say, our server was a pleasant person, and I believe she did her best...that being said, the service was atrocious. I'm left with the impression that it's due to poor training, rather than lack of personal effort on her part, but I could be wrong. It took Forever to even be greeted once seated and all items ordered took forever to come out of the kitchen; even soups, which were salty and lukewarm, took until just before our entrees finally came, how does that make sense? And this seemed to just be run of the mill, no apologies for the crazy long wait for food, or for the fact that temps were way off. At the end of our meal, we let the manager know we were disappointed in the experience, and he seemed, not only nonplussed, but annoyed to have been disturbed from running his mouth with members of his staff. We were a large party, and we never tip less than 20%, so one would think there would be an effort made to simply retain the customers...but not so much. Won't be back and will continue to tell people what a disappointing experience this place offers..."
1,"This was quite possibly the worst breakfast experience I've ever had.  I ordered the ""angus"" steak, egg and cheese bagel sandwich with hash browns and a non-fat vanilla iced coffee. 

Let's start with the steak (more like a Salisbury steak) that tasted disgusting.  The bagel was close to breaking my teeth with the staleness.   The only thing that saved the sandwich was the egg.   

My coffee was repulsive.  No flavor and it actually looked more like a iced tea than a iced coffee.  

I'm leaving a 1 star review only because the hash browns were somewhat tasty.  Even tho I took them home and cooked them longer in my own toaster oven."
1,"I wish I could give ZERO stars. The underaged bouncer at the door made up for his lack of experience with his abundance of bad attitude.  As they say, ""A first impression certainly lasts.""  This one sure did.  We entered, despite the unwelcome we felt...enjoyed a few minutes of music without -- intentionally WITHOUT BUYING DRINKS, then went to a bar next door where we were made to feel most welcome and bought drinks there.  This place does not have a bright future with employees like the punk who works the door."
1,"I overheard a girl talking about House of Pizza one day... she was RAVING ON AND ON AND ON about how it was the absolute best pizza hands down in the whole wide world and ""since she's from connecticut where they have the best pizza, she should know"".  

I admit, it spiked my curiosity enough to try it, even though we've passed by it regularly over the past few years and never had the urge before.  We walked in, super excited to try out this amazing pizza.  The prices seemed a little steep, but for the best pizza, it must be worth it... so we ordered a medium all veggie pizza.  

When it came out and we saw the way the cheese looked and smelled, we just looked at each other in doubt, but still had high hopes and took our first bites.  After all, the cheese was soooooo thick it must be good.  After the first bite, Ben immediately exclaimed, ""was that girl HIGH when she ate this pizza?""  I thought it tasted frozen... like something from a high school cafeteria... and the cheese had no flavor.  The mushrooms were canned and there was hardly any sauce.  I have no idea who would ever think this pizza is the best in the whole wide world... maybe it's all a matter of taste... but we are completely flabbergasted.   After discussing for a while what we were eating, we looked around and realized that no one else in the entire place was eating pizza.  The subs looked super popular and everyone seemed happy.  I don't think we ever even finished our leftovers.

I hate giving a place 1 stars, and recently I read on a friend's facebook update that they had just discovered HOP and couldn't believe that they had gone their whole lives in this neighborhood without having ever tried it.  They also thought it was amazing.  Again, we were completely baffled!  So, apparently it's a taste preference... but be warned."
1,I was here for breakfast today on a school trip and the waiters completely forgot about my order and we had to wait over an hour to get our food as we watched others eat around us. The one star is because my pancakes were pretty good.
1,Worst place ever for food service don't waste your time or money.The staff does not understand when you want something specific. The food was horrible main dishes were cold and sushi was hard and old. Hibachi grill wasn't very clean and the bathrooms smelled like hard urine. Please don't waste your money
1,"I came here with my family just a few hours ago. Even though we only eat halal, I expected a lot more out of this place. My mom had a voucher from restaurant.com for 25$ and we had to buy a minimum of 37.5$ to use it which was no big deal for the 4 of us. But when we went to go order our food, the owner told my mom and I that in order for us to use the voucher, we had to each buy our own drink or water ($8.00 total) and then added another 15% gratuity tax. I looked at the receipt after I read some other post just a few moments ago, and the cashier did charge us 8.99$ for a gyro that is listed as 5.99$ on the menu. Even after eliminating the voucher, we handed another 36$.

As for the food, it was okay. Nothing spectacular to make me go running back in there again...ever. If you are looking for better priced and AMAZING food, I highly recommend Kabob Express (Eastern & Tropicana) and Kabob Korner (downtown LV). The service is amazing, the food is even better and it's all worth it for the price!  

No offense to the owner, but you are running a BUSINESS. Do not tell me that you opened up your restaurant in front of the university so that students such as myself who are looking for halal food will have a place to eat. If you aren't willing to work at keeping your customers happy, we will find another place to eat."
1,"This is probably a fun night if you just happen through and have no expectations.

I made a reservation 3 weeks in advanced for a birthday party for a party of 12. I talked to the events manager who was very nice and responsive. The fee was 25$ per person and if I went over that number by less than 5 I could pay for the add on there. We also had to arrive by 9

The day of the event , my party had dinner at roosters (very nice and very able to accommodate ). We walked the few blocks to the epic center . There were 15 of us and we informed the hostesses upon check in of the increase of parry. No problem I was told. 

That's will things started to get crazy.

Afte  she checked us in, we kind of just stood there in the way for a few minutes.  I asked another employee what should we do and she left and came back a few moments later and took us to our seat. About 20 mins later our waiter came by and I asked him about the three additional  seats. He , with much attitude  rudely informed me that there was no way the could find 3 extra seats (even though it was 8pm and there were hardly filled to capacity ). I began to state what I was told about the event manager and began to pull out my phone to show the trail of conversations between the manager and myself from early in the week. Again, he with much attitude  didn't want to hear what I had to say and in fact abruptly  cut me off stating he did not care what evidence I  had, and the manager I had communicated with was no longer with the company . I calmly asked for the manager and he said you can ask for the manager but it won't change anything. I said that's fine, please ask the manager over anyways . 

Here I am , coordinating a birthday party with 15 folks...sir I really don't want to get into a argument  over 3 extra seats 

There was more back and forth with the manager . She stated the seats would cost and I let her know there was no problem so the seats were brought over

As apart of the package , the birthday guest get to come up on stage and do a little dance and have some fun. We were there three hours before finally my husband had to ask someone when our guest would be called off. He was told, if you don't pay extra you don't get called up. WHAT ??!! 

In fact, it all makes sense now because we must have put in ten song request and not one was played.  

All in all, it was a bad experience . The waiter was rude, the birthday ""experience "" was poor and if I was anyone reading this review I would ignore this place completely .

Thanks for taking the time to read my review ."
1,Racist had an incompetent waitress who couldn't remember to bring my drinks and then they had the nerve to send and unwoke black security guard to tell the party I was with we had to leave because we did not order drinks for 45 mins Really?? So the drinks I did get was not enough and you want me to leave here intoxicated.Had to go to the bar to order drinks.  Dont worry about me spending my money here no more. I know it wont hurt you much but it will hurt enough if my sisters and brothers believe that the are racist and don't spend your money there..
1,"You can not believe how terrible is this place food !
Not fresh meat, no tasty !!
Worst experience ever!! 
Never ever try it"
1,"This place is dirty. There are roaches in the dining and restroom areas. They refused to refund my order. The people who work there are rude and useless. 

There is no reason to waste your time or money on eating here."
1,"Wasn't a good kabob experience. Ordered a wrap, it was filled with rice, with a thick layer of bread, with a piece of meat. The taste wasn't as good as many other places for the money I paid."
1,"I arrived at the parking lot for this dog bar at 11:45am with the intent of exploring the bars near Salud. My girlfriend has a Jack Russell / Chihuahua that I have contemplated bringing to this bar for awhile and I had the intent to stop by the bar to learn about the process for admitting your dog in person.

As soon as my girlfriend and I got out of the car the owner pulled up and told us we had 15 minutes to get out of the lot or park in the adjacent parking garage in aggressive tone without asking a pre-qualifying question of, ""Are you parking to come to the dog bar?""

I have been in the Charlotte area since 2010 and even after graduating from UNC-Charlotte since 2014 I have always viewed every local in NoDa from Abari to Cabo Fish Taco to Salud as part of a collective community that was warm and welcoming of all denizens.

This experience has forced me to not even attempt to go through the process of introducing my girlfriend's dog Vixie to this community. If you are considering joining this bar make sure you do not park in this parking lot 15 minutes before opening because you are more likely to be told to move your car than you are to be asked if you are interested in learning about the bar and how to have a prospective puppy join."
1,I have been frequenting this bar going on about three years now and have always enjoyed it.  I have never once been asked for any type of membership until recently i was asked to leave since i did not have one.  I was utterly confused and embarrassed. I have not once seen any dog with this elusive dog tag membership? Don't think i will be a regular here anymore which is unfortunate since it was walking distance from my home.
1,"Not sure why ppl like this place so much. The minute my wife and I walked in we were stared at like we just cussed out the whole restaurant. Keep in mind this was our first time there. The waitress was young and hated her job. I ordered eggplant parm. The wife had a small veggie pizza. Both if us got salads. This was quite possibly the most underwhelming meal I have ever had. The price was overwhelming. Over 36.00 is what they wanted for 10.00 worth of food. As George Bush said ""fool me once shame on you, you'll never fool me again."""
1,"Hands down the worst bar/dog experience of my life.  

#1. It's Astroturf that is visibly wet from dog urine and feces, which is just watered down with a hose maybe once a day.  
#2. Nobody checks vaccination records. Not even rabies, leading to a serious health risk. 
#3. There's not enough room for the dogs to run around, so it can sometimes turn into a hump fest with irresponsible owners that aren't paying attention
#4. The staff is almost nonexistent.  They don't monitor or supervise, check dogs, or keep anything close to clean.  
#5. There is a douchebag there that owns a 220+ English mastiff that is known to be aggressive toward puppies that aren't neutered yet, and yet will act like a Greek god and say its your fault.  Hope I don't run into him again.  
#6. If you have an older, calm dog, and don't mind hanging out is a cesspool of dog piss, it may be alright.  But if that's not you, bring a beer to the dog park, or check out the Cornelius dog bar Bark and Brew.  Its a much better, cleaner spot with more room and better management.  
#7. I will die before I go back to the NODA dog brothel."
1,"Even though the service here wasn't rude I'm still going to give Eggspectation 1 star since my friend got wretched sick from food poisoning here and it was a complete waste of time and money.

My friend wanted to go to Eggspectation, since she and her husband had such a great experience at a different  location around NYE. We were seated quickly and from there the service slowed down a snail's pace. We waited a looooong time to have our orders taken. Our server wasn't intentionally rude but she was clearly overwhelmed and inefficient. We had a birds'-eye view of the kitchen and we could see our orders drying out on the shelves in the kitchen as we waited a ridiculous amount of time for our food. My friend was starving and ended up eating one of the little packets of peanut butter sitting on the jelly caddy. 

I got the American, and it was evident that I should have ordered Canadian bacon as my meat because they did NOT know American bacon. The bacon was nasty, it looked like that precooked bacon that buy at the grocery store and reheat in the microwave. Our server initially brought me a wrong order and had to replace it with my correct order. The scrambled eggs were dried out, however the Lyonnaise potatoes were tasty. The pancake I got as a side for $4.50 CAD was a joke, I hated it, it was cold and rubbery and dry. 

My friend ordered the French toast side and come on we were around French Canadians, the French toast shouldn't have looked so nasty! She also had the Salmon Benedict...and was deathly sick right after eating it and for the rest of the day. Not awesome. 

It. Took. FOREVER AND A DAY to finally get our check and then another day to get to pay out. DO NOT waste your precious tourist dollars and limited time at this nasty place. Too many other food options to go to."
1,"I've never had a bad experience at a salon, but this was just terrible. My husband saw good reviews and bought me a spa package here, but it actually left me more stressed out than when I arrived. My husband, who came with me to the spa, requested a female masseuse for me. When I was given a man, I told them this. Instead of apologizing, the man got upset with me and implied that it was our fault, by saying we must not have requested a woman. He then left me in a room, naked in a robe for at least fifteen minutes only to return to tell me I couldn't get a massage and that this was a 'deal' since they wouldn't charge me for it. So I ended up paying for a sub-par manicure and facial I never would have bought without the massage. Then after being pressed by my husband, we were told the manager would call us to resolve the issue. Nearly three weeks later, no call. Aside from all this the place was generally dirty upstairs, the receptionist didn't know how to use the system, and the employees looked unkempt. I hope others avoid the experience I had and go elsewhere to relax."
1,"First of all the service was extremely bad and unpleasant;I ordered my food and it took too long and I also ordered soup they didn't bring it to us and did not refund us,when I came to ask for some cups the cashier took too long to see what I wanted as he was talking on the phone for too long.
Secondly the food portions were bad as the meat(kabob) portion was bigger than the rice's portion. 
I do not recommend this restaurant for anybody"
1,"ZERO STAR, if they had it!  I haven't been here in a year, cuz every time I ordered - they forget my coffee; I run late for work!  Today I paid them a visit and ordered my regular; they forgot my coffee again!!!  Really bad service!!  Iys just a regular cup of coffee!  Wish they could get their act together!!  ZERO STAR FOR YOU!!!!"
1,"I thought people came to Las Vegas for good food but I was extremely disappointed by this Tapas bar. Yea sure the happy hour is good but the food sure isn't. 

All I can say is PASS. And go to Mi Luna in Houston, Texas."
1,Just walked into the W. Sahara Dunkin Donuts as the drive thru was not accepting debit cards. When I walked in there were two people having conversation amongst themselves and never acknowledged me. Another employee walked from the back looked at but also no acknowledgement. I walked out after standing there for close to 5 minutes.
1,"My family went here for dinner. We have heard lots of good thing about the best Chinese restaurant in town. As we stepped in, the tall hostess didn't even crack a smile.  She was even wearing super high heels, towering over people. Stuck up was spelled across her forehead. My husband ordered Khing chicken, which was ok. Mine was Gulf of Siam, a combination of variety seafood. Food was very bland, not a typical Thai food at all. Since there was no kick of spice to my dish, I asked for some sriracha to help the food taste a little better.  Guess what? We were charged $1 for this. I have been eating at restaurants  all over, north, south, east, west but I never heard of being charged for hot sauce at a semi fancy restaurant. Overall, service was ok and the food wasn't all that great. You just have to deal with Snoddy attitudes when you eat here."
1,This is a joke..... After purchasing 65$ worth of food for my family it was a freaking joke.....so the young guy forgot to mention that there is no rice available at the moment and it was disgusting.....you get 6 tiny pieces.....coming from Afghanistan this is completely a joke.....the chicken breast are suppose to big and thick slices and no ends to the breast.....but we got cartilage and tiny burnt ends.....I will never come here again and none the less you would think you would compensate for not having rice....but the guy gave us a few more pieces of chicken breast and said there was nothing else....and the refund would take 5 business days instead of just giving us a cash refund. ugh I'm done never again
1,"Extremely disappointed  The bachelorette party that I was a part of was having such a great time on Saturday night, the music, bartenders, bathroom attendant, etc. were all wonderful!  Then the female piano player was unnecessarily rude to my bachelorette.  When we called her on it she responded with nothing but attitude.  It was bad enough that we felt it was necessary to speak to the manager Jim.  When we spoke with him he didn't really seem to care...wasn't even apologetic until we called him on apathetic.  We promptly left and have no intention of going back.  This location really gives the other locations a bad name!"
1,Service extremely slow and place poorly managed . Coffee is sub par...food mediocre . Would avoid
1,"Coffee and Donuts are great, but the workers are something else. Tried to apply for a job, manager said to give her a sec. 30 minutes go by and she ends up saying that I could just go online and print out one to bring in. Doesn't even apologize."
1,"Food was not good, price extremely high, insult to the injury there was mandatory 15 percent gratitude for no service. Had to order at the counter from menu on the wall, the food was delivered to our table on paper plates and plastic utensil, a food court type of service. Buyers be aware, ask for itemize bill before you pay."
1,"Im persian i know what a persian food taste like. What they serve here has nothing to do with persian food. Horrible food, very cheap and low place. Expensive menu for the worst food. We will never ever eat at this place again. If you claim the taste of persia you better be at least close, what you serve here is very very ordinary arabic type kabob.
Very disappointed."
1,"Nastiest coffee I've ever had! I ordered a mocha and all he did was drizzle chocolate syrup to the bottom and add extra burnt coffee inside the cup. The sausage egg & cheese croissant was good though. They should really teach their employees to make better coffee, seriously."
1,"We waited about 30 minutes to be seated... no biggie... waited another 30 minutes for the food only to have the wrong order brought to us. So instead of waiting longer, we left without eating... Probably a good thing as I had ordered steak and eggs and caught a glimpse of what I think was their ""steak."" It resembled a Jack Link's kippered beef product in both size and texture... Oh, did I mention the B rating from the Dept. of Health... I feel a need to point out that the dynamic I observed with the employees indicates management issues and not necessarily an issue with the staff. My recommendation... stay away from this one.. far away."
1,"I have been to this location 6 times now. Different times of day . And each time i tried to purchase 14 jelly filled donuts with no success.  
They are out completely or have 1 or 2 left . 

How is that acceptable?!?

Bad for that particular store and really damaging to the brand . 

get your preorders right and stop wasting your customers time"
1,"I've visited this place a few times before but will no longer be returning. The only reason I give one star is because there isn't an option for none! 

First, as many people have already stated, there are no requirements that must be met for dogs allowed in the place. Typically at daycares, etc dogs have to have all their shots and pass a temperament assessment. Here....that does not exist. 

And secondly, the reason I have NO desire whatsoever to return, is the staff. My credit card was charged for another persons tab...close to $100. Rather than discuss that with me in an apologetic way, I was handed a handful of cash with no explanation. Then my card had been run AGAIN for my purchase which was only ONE beer but it included a pitcher as well. I tried to get some explanations from the bartender and told her I did not order the pitcher. She nonchalantly told me that there were others with my name and got mixed up, but the pitcher was definitely asked to be put on my tab. So she would not take it off. 

So to sum things up, if you choose to visit this place....don't expect anything awesome and pay in cash so your card won't be charged by ""accident"" and for items that you don't order."
1,"This place can only be described as awful and disgusting. I came here based on it's proximity to UNLV (I always see the sign when I drive past) but it is UNACCEPTABLE on so many levels. Go to Kabob Express on the corner of Tropicana and Eastern instead, it's not that much further.

I should have had a bad feeling when the place was deserted at dinner time on Saturday night. It looks gross from outside - really no frills, under a creepy walkway, across from an abandoned store. When we walked up and I still wanted to go in, my friends joking said, ""Wow, you're feeling adventurous!"" which can give you a better idea of how gross this place actually is.

The inside was no better. Everything was covered in filth and it looked like nobody had cleaned in a week. We moved several times and couldn't find a table without remnants of food, rice and dirt. The condiments on the table were old, crusted over and just looking at them made me sick to my stomach! This place needs an inspection ASAP. It is definitely not up to health codes by anybody's standards.

We ate in and the owner refused to give me a glass of water. This is an immediate red flag for me at ANY restaurant. He clearly had cups and there was clearly a soda fountain with a water spout. Is making an extra dollar off a plastic water bottle that important to your business that you can't properly serve your paying customers?

All the plates, cups, utensils were styrofoam. It felt like we were eating at a homeless shelter, except the food was overpriced and I was denied water, which I'm sure homeless people are allowed.

I ordered a chicken salad and my friends ordered shish kabob plates. All the portions were TINY!! My chicken salad literally had ONE SQUARE of chicken. One, single (think like 1 inch square) piece of chicken was on my salad that I paid $6 for. There wasn't even a good amount of salad but it was all drenched in a greasy cheap Italian-like dressing.

Don't ever go here. This place should be shut down. There is better food in the area."
1,We were going to go here for bfast this morning.  However when we got there we saw a server out front rushing inside with a cigarette...she put it out in the dirt and left it on the brick ledge by the door...I popped out to go inside and the smell of smoke was so strong I told my family not to even get out of the car. This has completely turned us away from wanting to eat here. We won't be returning.
1,"You would think I learned my lesson a long time ago. Buffets are a no no, unless its $40 pp.
I'm not a germaphobe but fahgetaboutit.
1- The carpet is disgusting.
2- The patrons are all sneezing and coughing into their hands and using the serving utensils.
The chicken dishes i.e. Sesame- General Tao's all breading.
The food was just not what one would call good. If your not fussy about quality the huge variety is there to stuff yourself.
I say- ""nay-nay""!"
1,"Amending this due to both my moms boyfriend and I getting food poisoning that I'm still dealing with 36 hrs later :( Will definitely not be back. Didn't notice until I was leaving sanitation score was 90, not saying that is why the food poisoning occurred but generally I dont eat at places below a 93."
1,I have never had bad service at Waffle house until yesterday at this location. It started with us having to ASK for coffee not being offered a drink when we sat down not even water. Then we had to ASK for refills  twice once when a manger(who was very nice) asked us how our food was. We asked if we could get more coffee our waitress heard us ask and with a look of disgust brought it to us and were ignored by her only food came (which was lukewarm at best..
1,"So I called in an order tonight and got a confirmation for 20 minutes later. Arrived on time, and they had no record of my order. I showed them where I had called and they said I would have to wait again because they had no record of the order. Not even an apology. Other people's food looked good - too bad they didn't want to serve me."
1,"This place is a freaking rip off. 12 dollars for a meal in a crap hole like this. The food quality and portions suck, I wouldn't mind if I left there satisfied. I could go to a nice sit down restaurant in Dearborn, Michigan and eat like a king for 12 dollars and have food to take home. Oh, that's right, in Dearborn the food is cooked by Arabic people(Syrian, Labanese, Iraqui) These so called ""Persian"" people who try to mask the fact that they are really IRANIAN because the general public is too stupid to catch on."
1,"The place looks like a dump from outside- like a fast food restaurant and the food is not much better. Went with my wife- she ordered a flauta and tostada, myself a carne asada torta. We shared a junior nachos to start.

The nachos were literally movie theatre nachos. I didn't mind this as movie theater nachos are actually quite yummy, but this I not regal cinemas- I wanted Mexican nachos.

My torta was good- a little on the small side but tasted pretty good. Now the chips that came with it were another story. STALE, literally chewy and I had to spit the one I tried out.

Her tostada had parchment paper in it cooked in with the meat. While it had good flavor, once we noticed it we lost our appetite.

The flautas had minimal flavor (if my wife were writing she would say no flavor whatsoever) and were extremely dry.

Needless to say I will not be returning."
1,"I dont like putting 1 stars. But this place was nasty. The AC was not working the employees were all sweating. It was dirty everywhere including the tables and chairs. Food is NASTY. We spent $35 for 1 plate one hummus and dolma ""Rip-Off"". It doesn't make sense for a Mediterranean restaurant to serve plastic cheap utensils with hard to cut kabobs. Oh and before I forget, they put oil on the meat during the cooking process so people can eat it. Since its so dry and bland. I will NEVER go back !!!"
1,"I got here at 4pm on a weekday in Dec 2006 and maybe I had the skeleton staff because service really sucked ass. No smile. No checking back. Wrong orders. You gotta be kidding me.

The gazpacho was good but not extraordinary and to my surprise, the waiter didn't even know what kind of olives I was being served. The sangria was good but... honestly... my glass was more ICE than it was DRINK.

So sad because 4 years ago I ate at Babareeba in Chicago and had such an amazing experience. Fun, lively, great food, and very knowledgeable waitstaff. I talked about it for the following week!

Going into the Las Vegas restaurant and asking a simple question about what kind of olives are in the olive appetizer and getting a blank stare as an answer was just the beginning of a disappointing experience."
1,"I am updating the below review after eating there tonight and being mortified in finding out they have changed their beans as of last week to include meat which means there are now no good vegan protein options! The chips, salsa, and veg tacos ate still good but there is no well rounded meal option left and we will have to give up what was one of our favorite places to eat. Bummed!
My old review for reference.....
This place has such good food and as a vegetarian/vegan family we love the amazing flavors. The guacamole and salsas are top tier. Today we tried the new vegetarian tacos, 2 on jicama and two on corn tortillas, and we were elated! And the fresh fruit drinks and frozen treats are always delicious. The staff is so welcoming and helpful - you can tell they really have a great family team feeling and it is contagious. And to top it off we love how clean the restaurant always is."
1,"Walk into this place and the little girl that was seating the guests looked like she hated her life. She attempted to sit us at the bar stools and gave a shitty face when the guests behind us also wanted to sit in a booth. As she went to clean the table from some guests that were leaving, she noticed another guest was walking in and made the motion of blowing her head off. You need to be fired... I cleaned my seat since it wasn't done."
1,"Customer service is always more important than the food quality, that's why I give it 1 star. I was in the drive thru, had asked the worker to take ice out of my coffee (there was more ice than coffee) and she walked back and came back with the same amount of ice. I guess she thought I was stupid and that I wouldn't notice. So I sent her back to take out more. Do the job right the first time and you won't have to do it twice. I guess she didn't think I would notice that she didn't even take out any ice."
1,"I've never experienced such bad customer service until I stepped into Waffle House and met Audrey.

As soon as we walked in, so rude. When we sat down waited to be seated she asked us how many and a name. After we told her 4 people and our name she rolled her eyes and said ""I'm suppose to be off the clock"". And asked our name again, so rudely.

Our server amber, she was okay. She seemed more occupied with literally everyone else in the restaurant except ours, even as we are ordering. 

The food was good but if I wasn't craving waffles, we would have left. The online menu is nothing like the actual menu. False advertisement!!! For a Waffle House, they only have two kinds. Pretty pricey for the quality.

Waffles were mediocre at most for a Waffle House."
1,"Arrived 12.20 on Monday ... today.... when driving by and looking to park saw a gentleman and his two boys entering ...

4 minutes or so later we entered and there was no-one at the front reception area except for the man i had seen enter a few minutes earlier..  we waited another 2 minutes and enough was enough.. we left never ever to return.. 

The staff behind the counter/ kitchen saw us there waiting... no one came...

The place had 3 tables occupied at most...  what a waste of effort... Mr. IM NEVER GOING BACK THERE"
1,This shit looks Nasty. I will never ever eat at this place .. I didn't know Japanese restaurants serve pizza and Texas toast along with Mexican foods..smh
1,Very unorganized never have anything in stock.  Store needs  to be managed a lot better stock up on your ingredients and anticipate your rush hour times.  Staff is excellent and friendly.   But the store needs  a lot better Manager.
1,The subs are good but the pizza is terrible. We had a medium pie. It is mostly cheese and they are very light on the sauce.The sauce has NO flavor at all. They have to do better than that. I would take a bite and have to double check to see if there was sauce on it because you  can't taste it! I would recommend their subs and salads.
1,"This is the worst Waffle House I've ever been in. The food was undercooked and doughy, and another waitress told us to go easy on our server because he was new. I know that you don't go to Waffle House for the service, but I would never recommend this place to anyone."
1,Big fan of Dunkin in east coast but this location sucks. Inside is beautiful but literally last 3 times i came here no one was manning the register. Had to wait 5-10 mins for anyone to notice I'm here despite yelling hello a couple of times. If you want coffee just go a couple of blocks down Sahara towards the Starbucks there instead.
1,"We bought tickets for the Nye party and was really disappointed for $90pp. It included a table, 3 drinks, half glass of champagne and food. We arrived about 6:45 and only a few tables have sat. We went to get food and they clearly did not have enough. They ran out of meatballs and chicken which meant zero meat left, only pasta. Not enough at all. Then the drinks said online anything but their speciality and shots. Then the tickets you could only use drinks under $7.25...when you add it all up, wasn't at all worth the money. The entertainment was ok. Only two of the six had good voices. Also, they really didn't duel like I have seen at many other dueling piano bars. Needless to say we won't be returning. Place was a rip off."
1,"I am downgrading my review. The service hasn't gotten better in the drive-thru or walk-in. I am going to take a bet and say it's the fault of management because turnover has been a constant since it opened. I really wanted to like this place because it seemed like a convenient location, but I can't recommend it. I will spend my money elsewhere."
1,"Not shocked this place closed.  The paella was HORRIBLE.  Actually they said it was paella, and I ordered paella, but I've never had what they call paella.  It sure didn't match what I know as paella and what they even showed on their website.  Good riddence!"
1,"This place is abhorrent in almost every way.  I had previously been twice with friends and I wasn't too impressed with the food and thought the service was a bit slow.  Also the location is a bit skeezy.  Recently I've been twice and now this place is one of few restaurants anywhere that I will never ever go back to.

I bought a couple of Groupons a while back and they were about to expire so I wanted to use them.  I went on Monday in the afternoon and had to wait about 5 minutes for the cashier to get off the phone to take my order.  I presented my Groupon and then he informed me that if I bought certain items while using the Groupon, the price would go up.  For example one of their meals that was $12.99 without the Groupon would be $16.99 with the Groupon.  I guess partnering with Groupon and then overcharging is one way to increase business without losing money in the short term, but you do it at the expense of pissing off new customers.

Anyway I ordered a two kabob plates without salads (just meat, bread, and rice) and some dolmeh to go.  The place was entirely empty when I came in but a couple of others came in after me.  After about 10 minutes the dolmeh was brought out to me on a plate and I had to remind them that it was an order to go, so they took it back.  After over 20 minutes my order was ready to go.  However both plates contained salads so I had to spend another 5 minutes dumping the salad out.

As far as the food goes, the BBQ chicken kabob was repulsive -- the chicken itself was OK but the sauce on it and the rice was disgusting.  The beef kabob was really fatty/gristly and I had to spit half of it out.  My girlfriend, who I gave the dolmeh to, said that there was a weird red sauce in the dolmeh she hadn't seen before and she thought maybe the tomatoes were bad quality and dyed red.

I still had one more Groupon to go, so I went on Wednesday.  This time the cashier from Monday was there, but the main cashier was an older man (the owner perhaps?).  I got my Groupon out and he said that I could not use it for take out, it was dine-in only.  I showed him the details of it and that it was valid for take-out and he said ""OK well then if you use it we have to charge you 15% gratuity.""  At that point I just left.  

So, long story short, the people who are here are trying to drum up business by partnering with Groupon, Yelp, Restaurant.com and then when the customers arrive they are being charged more up front for many menu items, possibly being restricted to dining-in only when that's not stated ahead of time, and then being charged gratuity on top of everything, possibly even for take-out (if they allow it!).  

I love middle-eastern food and kabobs but you can do a lot better than this.  Bad food, bad customer service, and screwing customers on prices.  Who would want to take their business to a place like this?"
1,"Considering the amount of 4 and 5 star reviews I am reading here, I would have thought that this was a good place to go for a couple of beers....Not so much. With that said, it has been a while since I just sidled up to a bar, sat down and drank a couple, so maybe things have changed drastically in regards to service, pricing and general  enjoyment of ones time.

I had to drop off my youngen at his school dance downtown and had 2 hours to kill. I thought a drive over to NODA would be fun to see what's up and have couple of beers and wings while I worked over a menu I was writing for a Mardi Gras party. Parking in NODA is a bit of a problem when you don't know the area well so the open spot in front of the sign proclaiming that only patron's of the Dog Bar could park there or be booted (I am no fan of the BOOT!) I decided that, being a dog fan, I would get my saunter on and have a beer there with my 4 legged friends. 

The place if fairly dive-y (Me like-y) and there are dogs running all over the place. It's what I would expect. They have numerous beers on tap including local faves so I pulled up a stool and, though there was a big old spill in front of me, I figured the young lady tending bar would get that taken care of when I ordered. This is where I should have decided that a one and out would be my best bet. I ordered an OMB Copper which took a long time to get due to the changing of the keg halfway through the pour. She plopped the cup down and went to turn away, so I had to stop her to ask if she would be kind enough to wipe the bar down. (I had a notebook and my tablet at the ready to do some work) she gave a half-hearted swipe of the mess getting about half and then tossed a small stack of bev-naps on the bar near me, apparently so that I could do it myself. SUPER!

The lovingly made Copper does wonders for one's soul and I happily ignored my disdain and worked on my menu. The bartender was a loud and boisterous soul (which I have no problem with as long as you are getting your work done). I finished my beer, during which time I found out that she was having decidedly too little sex with her not-a-real boyfriend,( just a FWB), watching her drop a case of beer on the floor and other fun stuff. She saw that my cup was empty and took care of the business of a fresh beer. That was pretty much the end of my personal service for the evening.  I finished the beer in about 20 minutes and placed my cup in front of me while I worked. She sat/stood about 4 feet away from me on the other side of the bar and told two guys all about her life, her website, all her hopes and dreams, about how cheap it is to have your Mani-Pedi done by Asians, etc, while my cup sat there in plain view. I even made eye contact and yet at that time she was not ready to finish her role as talking person and it sat. Then more people walked in (about 10) she walked by my empty cup and got to serving the crowd. At one point she served a couple of Jagerbombs and knocked a fat shot of Jager back herself while I sat there and watched. This operation took anther 10-15 minutes. At this point I had enough and just wanted to pay and roll. Finally she deigns to give me the time of day and asks if I need another. No says I and I hand her a $20 to pay my 2 cups of beer. $9.50 later (for a beer made down the street) and I am on my way. 

In the last 20 minutes of my stay, she lost sales for her employer, stole liquor, broke the law by drinking behind the bar, and lost a good tip. Not a good performance by a long shot.  I feel no need to ever go back and really rue the fact that I didn't take the time to get out faster and try another joint.

Eat and drink well, my friends, just not here!

V-Dub
Eat and drink well, my friends, just not here."
1,"Anyone that thinks this place serves good gyros, has never had good gyros and needs to have their head examined..  Half a pita with something that looks like steak-ums does not a gyro make.  I don't know what kind of meat that was, but it wasn't gyro meat. And when someone asks for fries to be boxed separately, don't just put them in the styro containers smaller compartment, box them SEPARATELY! The place was virtually empty when I walked in long after anything resembling a lunch rush could have possibly happened, and tables were still dirty..  The cashier or manager or whatever was friendly but that does not make me ever want to go back in there.."
1,Worst pizza ever. It was like a stringy board of gum on our pizza. And we like ALL pizza ..... but not theirs. It was bad.
1,"If I could give 0 stars I would!!
In all my years I have never seen a restaurant this poorly ran. I entered the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. There were no other customers in the establishment however there were at least 10 employees standing around talking. The staff acted as if we were not there they were either on cell phones making person calls or screaming at each other from opposite ends of the store. The supervisor appeared to be all of 18 years old and decided to re-tuck his uniform in requiring him to unbuttoned his pants and showcase his underwear in the middle of the dining room floor. After about 40 mins. a couple with their child entered the parking lot the supervisor said ""Let's tell them we're out of waffles"" and the entire staff laughed. This was a disgusting act of customer service, corporate really needs to look into closing this location they,are over staffed without any customers."
1,Yummy custard donut & large iced coffee. BUT Don't eat here Because Pretty dirty floors & all the tables are dirty & we are the only customers in this place. Lazy employees.
1,so i came accross this dunkin donuts on my way to work because my gf wanted donuts. we first went for a winchell cuz that's her favorit but they had no chocolate bars. so dunkin it was. i spent $5 for two long johns (chocolate bars) and some munchkins (donut holes). such names lets just say i was kinda excited but that didn't last to long when i look inside the bag and my order was just tossed in there like trash. the bars were stuck to the bag. as of i had ordered a chocolate bag instead. i might as well should have asked for a plain donut. needles to say my napkins also ended up with more chocolate then my bars did. so in the end i now know this place isnt cut out to be any good.
1,"Who wouldn't loves tapas! To be honest, when they listed empanadas on the menu, we decided we had to try it. But boy was that a mistake. It was pretty expensive, for such small dishes. We asked what size and how many empanadas we would get, it was only one small one for $8-9! So instead of tapas, we decided to order regular meals. We first ordered a Passion Fruit sangria. That was delicious, included some fresh chopped apple/orange/lemon, very refreshing, but not sure it was worth $15 for half a pitcher. The bread they served with the meal was also delicious, but they gave such a small basket, they couldn't refill it fast enough for us (nor for our ice water)! Sigh. For my meal, I went with the Meatball pizza for $11. The crust was thin and crispy and the pizza itself was pretty huge (couldn't finish it), but the oil from the cheese and meat just gathered in the middle of the plate and my crust soaked it all up. They also added some cherry tomatoes and basil, which definitely enhanced the flavor, but by the time my food came to me... the cheese already looked hardened. Disgusting. Unfortunately, the rest of our service wasn't that great either. Our waiter never came back for a water refill, and we actually finished eating our food and probably sat around for 5 minutes before flagging down another waitress for our bill. 

Also, they include an 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more. What? Ok fine, can we give less? Whatever. Our meal came up to be $xx.90, so our friend wanted to break her 100 and get some change. They had the nerve to keep her extra 10 cents too, something about rounding up or some crap. I know it's only 10 cents, but based on how bad our service was, and just on principle, they should have given it to us. Ugh, never again."
1,"This place was AWFUL!  Came here on a Friday night during the NCAA tourney looking for a place for good music with friends.  We paid the $5 cover but the band was TERRIBLE!  The girl singing was not even able to carry a tune, I think it was almost started bleeding it was so bad.  I used the ladies room which was disgusting.  The toilet paper dispenser was broken and all 3 sinks were clogged and full of nasty brown water. The worst part... There was a bathroom attendant in there, collecting tips!  WHY????  Avoid this place at all costs!"
1,"A gentleman was dining here and had a medical emergency requiring 911.   He was unconscious.  911 was called and the man was taken outside to the ambulance. 

The ambulance got ready to leave and the staff ran over to the table that the guy had eaten at, grabbed the bill and ran out the door after the ambulance because the bill wasn't paid.  

Really???!!!!    What's wrong with people. Not empathy at all.  It was a lunch $6 lunch bill.    pATHETIC!!!!!!!!!      Another family paid the bill and walked out!!!!   They actually took the money!!!       Merry Christmas to your pathetic restaurant!!!!!!!     No one in our section left a tip."
1,"So I must say, I am insanely disappointed in House of Hunan. I always make it a point to eat there every time I am in town. Usually each experience has been pretty good. However, my mom and I ordered take out a couple of nights ago. While we were eating the ""minced chicken and lettuce"" she got a piece of metal in the chicken mixture. It was so disgusting, not to mention she is lucky she didn't break a tooth. We couldn't even bring ourselves to finish the meal we had ordered. Skip forward to today (Friday 4/05) and I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves. (Plus I was craving sushi and I had heard decent reviews.) So I ordered a nothing special avocado roll, a California roll, and an order of edamame. So I went to pick it up and brought the receipt from the previous night (along with the piece of metal) and mentioned that this was in our chicken the other night. The hostess (white male) simple said ""oh yeah, the cooks clean the woks after every order with a stainless steel brush and that happens sometimes."" Not so much as even an apology. I wasn't expecting anything out of this ordeal other than an apology and making sure it doesn't happen to some other poor person who may actually break their tooth... Ok so bad to the sushi that I ordered today... By far the WORST sushi I have ever eaten (and come on it's a freaking avocado and California roll, how hard is that to mess up?!?!) so for beginners, I ordered the sushi to be made with soy paper (which they charged me $2 extra for... Really?! I just moved back from Columbus where I are sushi ALL of the time and they never charged for this and I always had amazing sushi which was also not as pricey.) then they jammed a bunch of nasty pickled ginger in the to go container so the entire row that was next to it tastes like disgusting pickled ginger. Next the rice was so incredibly awful... It was so sweet. Which could only mean it is so insanely processed (yay!!) Do dispite those two issues, I was starving so I attempted to eat a piece or two, which proceeded to completely fall apart. I'm pretty sure I can roll sushi better than they can... I was so ridiculously disappointed with the entire experience. I do not think I can bring myself to spend another dollar there again. Pretty bad customer service coupled with metal pieces and crappy food? No thanks!"
1,"I must be a glutton for punishment, but I do like their coffee. Today the coffee was neither hot nor cold, neither strong nor weak. Today, I received no coffee at all. Why?  Because the two young African Americans working there refused to come help me. I stood and stood and stood there waiting to order, but they never even approached me. I honestly think they are racist, and didn't want to help a white man."
1,"My wife went there to order food due to an error message from calling the published number. She was told they ""take phone off the hook or don't answer during busy hours""....she got cursed out by a young man in the parking lot as he tried exiting the lot.... and was cursed and felt threatened and fearful for her safety....the food was cold when she got it home only a mile away......I have eaten at the place since I was a child but it appears the thrill is gone.....Pizza Peel less than a mile  away seems a better option and more importantly a safe one."
1,"I went there several times and have been convinced they don't care about the health of their dog guests at all. 

First of all, though there is a sign on the gate that requires the dogs to vaccinated, no one is there to enforce or check. In fact owners or management never checked to see if the dogs have the correct vaccinations. 

The last time I went was the last. I was with a large group of friends and one overly aggressive dog kept peeing in the water the dogs drink from. The workers replaced it a couple times but then they they just gave up. The same dog continued to repeatedly pee in it. And the employees watched it and did nothing. They didn't replace the water and they did not ask the owner of the dog to leave or even identify the owner to get it to stop. Meanwhile the other dogs continued to drink from that dish. 

Obviously the owners and managers of this place do not care about the health of the animals or people that fund this establishment. 

I will never be taking my dog there to say the least."
1,"I ordered steak and eggs and it was very bland. There was a lot of fat on it. It didn't taste like steak, but more like a processed meat. I added caramelized onions were not caramelized at all. So i don't know why they would call it that. I was even disappointed in the toast. It wasn't crunchy, it was more soggy if that.

Hash browns are average. 

Server was sub par. The girl who took our name to sit down was very rude. Her name is Audrey and she obviously doesn't posses basic customer service skill."
1,Just wondering if they even care enough to get their machine fixed...I came in last Thursday and the espresso machine was down...bummer ok whatever...then I tried the drive through today and it was still down. It doesn't take that long to get it fixed...can only imagine how much money they are losing. Bad business practice.
1,"I would not come here. I used to visit the Paquime on the west side and that one is pretty authentic. This is my first time trying this one, and I was definitely disappointed. I brought my husband here thinking we would get the same great service and food as the one on the west side and I was wrong. We came in and were attended by the cashier, who wasn't very friendly. We're bringing our business here and they make us feel like we owe them. Now, the tacos al pastor we're bland and little to no meat in them. My husband complained that his torta just tasted like cardboard, almost no flavor. Not coming back."
1,I loved dunkin donuts but I always went to the one in Henderson by the hospital. Tried this one and I'll never return. I was in line for almost 40 minutes and the girl at the window wasn't even nice. Starbucks at least has good service when they take forever
1,"Deeply disappointing. Went here because my friend heard of good reviews, the menu looked great and my friends were on a weekend vacation to Montreal. The service was the worst any of us experienced and we've wasted more than 2 hours here on what should have not took any longer than an hour because it took so long to get seated, get our drinks, order and get our food, with 30 minute chunks of time from an absent waitress. 

When we asked to speak to the manager, our apathetic waitress was the manager and acted so dismissive of our concerns, just saying ""ok"" without apologizing for wasting so much of our time. The place was busy, but business was no excuse because we saw people who came in later than us get served their food, pay their bill and leave before us. When my friend told the waitress we were tourists from Toronto, she flinched a bit. I had to constantly remind the waitress to bring my ice-cream or utensils because she kept on ""forgetting."" The food was OK, but service was worst and have never been treated the way we have by the manager."
1,"Oh god... If I never go here again, it will be too soon.  I got a deep tissue massage, but it felt like I was barely being touched.  I paid for a 60-minute massage, not a petting session.  I don't think that I at all resemble a cat -- if I did, the massage I got would've been appropriate and adequate, but I'm not, so I expect to get what I pay for, and was thoroughly displeased."
1,"I live about a mile from The Dog Bar, and several years ago, when it was still rather new, my young neighbor and I went to check it out.  Our experience was not good at all.  We went in the afternoon and there were a few other people there.  They appeared to be ""regulars"" because they knew each other and the bar tender and seemed to engage in comfortable conversation.  I am in an older generation than most who would frequent this place, but my neighbor was in her late 20s at the time.  I mainly remember feeling rather snubbed, and even when we tried to engage others in conversations about their dogs, we were met with rather cold stares, and the affect was that we were unwelcome visitors.  The bottom line is we never went back.  Dogs are very important to me and they are my young neighbors very LIFE!  We had hoped to find a place to hang out with people of like mind and maybe form some friendships.  In my opinion, The Dog Bar is not the place for that!  It seemed more like a yuppy wannabe place to me!"
1,"Tried this location again both yesterday and today. I'm astonished that it has actually gotten worse. Yesterday they attempted to serve me cold ""hot"" coffee, and today after being ignored for 3-4 minutes, which of course feels like hours, they didn't have any dark roast, so I had to wait even longer while they brewed it. It was so weak and tasteless, sort of like the staff of this pathetic location, that I tossed it in the garbage."
1,"Ugh was craving biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were so doughy and gross. Service was bad, which I didn't expect much but won't be back"
1,"So I just left the drive thru and my fruit coolatta taste like nothing but chopped up I e and water and my donut is very hard. I've bought better donuts from a gas station. I will never go back here again, I'll stick to my Starbucks thank you."
1,"They offer takeout, but don't answer the telephone. Get ride of the feature if you can't fulfill it. So House of Pizza I really wanted to like you, but you ruined it for me."
1,One of the few restaurants that I went to without checking the yelp review and I have to warn you it is dissapointing. The best part of the entire experience was the sangria. All the tapas we ordered were bland. It was so bad that we did not even bother with the paella or the desert. I would never go back here. What a waste of a good location and ambience.
1,"I will keep this short n sweet. Took 35 min for waitress to bring us our drinks. Only because she was the only one working, at first i thought it was poor service. Come to find it was poor management, or i should say lack of. Only one waitress when we sat down, with eight tables occupied, and the pip-squeek so called mngr is sitting at a table drinking wine. The only time i saw him off his ass was when he got up to make him and the people he was  drinking with with shots. The food was good, but going in there for a quick lunch during a shopping day with a friend turned into a two hour nightmare. As for the pip-squeek, he should turn in his so called title, and go back to the frat house, since drinking was his priority tonight."
1,The dude that works here closed the store at 10 instead of 10:30 and kicked the us out. Who does that to a customer? Then he agreed to use a deal and after 5 min of waiting requested $6 because the deal couldn't be used with the special. What the what? This was one of the most strange services I have ever received. I hope the owner sees this review and has an answer for the worse customer service ever.
1,"This place is awful I go and everyday after work. I work up the street from them. I've been calling since 7:40 to talk to a manager about what happened and I couldn't get into contact with anybody. I also tried to call corporate and they said they'd have me on hold for 39mins. I  was on hold for an hour!

I email corporate and still haven't heard anything back...... I am a regular and I can't believe this is happening. The manager that I was trying to get into contact with is name Katrina. She is extremely unprofessional. You shouldn't bring your attitude to work....


My letter to cooperate was

""I went in to your 353295 location yesterday, and I received horrible service. I ordered a strawberry doughnut. This one cashier, and he told me there was going to be a wait since there aren't any ready. One of the workers placed a doughnut in the box, and called me over. I did not place an order for one yet because there wasn't any ready. And I asked, ""Is this my doughnut?"" Because I didn't know if they communicated in the back, or if it belonged to another customer. To which Micheal M. replied, ""Are you going to pay for it?"" I was mortified, and I felt like a thief. I paid for my doughnut, and when I opened the box, the icing on the doughnut was skittish. ""Micheal has a habit of applying icing thinly.""-This was told to me two days ago by an employee. I come to this location every day after work for a strawberry doughnut, and I expect consistency. I said to Micheal. ""This isn't enough icing."" He left to go into the back, and came back with a thick up of icing without a knife. I thought maybe he would trash the doughnut I bought and give me a new one. I had to apply it with my finger and got it all over my scrubs, and the doughnut was too sweet to eat and I threw it away. I tried calling cooperate, and they told me I was going to be on hold for an 30minutes. Well, 30minutes became and hour. DunkinDoughnuts does not have a call back system or a way I can leave a message. During this time I called over to the location that I went to twice, and left a message. No one picked up. I went in person to talk to the manager at 8:40am today, and the cashier told me. ""The manager is busy, and in a bitch mood. So, I wouldn't."" I felt I was going in a HR to store circle. I am a regular, and I can't believe I was treated this way.""

I've been upset and nothing has been done so far...."
1,It seems hard to imagine that you can get breakfast wrong but this was some of the absolute worst food I have ever had. It was worse than a microwave meal from the grocery store. Although the staff was obviously trying to be helpful they messed up on our order.
1,"We went to House of Hunan in Medina for dinner.  What a horrible experience.  We were seated at a table that was very wobbly, which ruins the dining experience.  My wife ordered sweet and sour shrimp.  Most of her item was heavily breaded.  The shrimp was not deveined, and cold.  Also, the ""stir fried vegetables"" i.e. green peppers were cold, soggy and uncooked.  The only thing good about the dish was the sauce.  I think they were hoping that no one will notice how bad the food will taste if they sauce the heck out of everything.

My dish was ok...I ordered the general tso's chicken.  It was NOT better than any take out Chinese food. 

Our waitress looked like she didn't care at all.  Very poor service, and she only came back once to fill water.

I would save your money and go somewhere else.  We will not be back, ever."
1,"The Food has not always been that good. My parents went their on valentines day or something and The food was awful, messed up on the order, waited and waited for the food, Some nights the food is good other night the food is not.  good."
1,"So disappointing! We loved this place when we lived in Chicago. The biggest disappointment was that the menus are different and they didn't have our favorite tapas (octopus with potatoes). It was a slow lunch crowd, but the service was pretty spotty. We only ordered one dish plus drinks. It was so meh, that neither my husband nor I can (3 weeks later) even remember what we ate! I suppose it's just as well since we'll never come here again."
1,I just went there for lunch and was handed a very limited lunch menu.  I was disappointed because I wanted spring rolls and one of the items I like on the regulars menu.  I had moo goo gai pan that was bland and the meat was like mush.  Tasted like it was soaked in msg.  I live in Medina and won't go back.  Such a cute place though.
1,"I've been to 3 different Dunkin Donuts locations since flying into Las Vegas and staying in Henderson and this is the worst one I've been to. Just like any any other Dunkin Donuts in Boston, the first 2 got my coffee and donut orders ready within minutes. This one was terrible. 

Walked in a saw a female worker taking drive thru orders, no biggie. Ordered a donut and 2 iced coffees.. figured maybe it would take a few minutes. 2 guys behind us ordered a pretty complicated order.. the breakfast sandwiches, coffee and donut trifecta which normally takes a decent amount of time. So how was it, while we were there first and there a few minutes before they showed up, did they get their large order BEFORE we did? And at least 5 drive thru cars passed me while I waited in the corner. 

Unprofessional. Go by who got there first, just like any normal business would. Would not recommend to anyone who's short on time. Who knows what they'll decide to do once you're actually in and they have your money."
1,"This was my first and last time going here. Waited in line 20 minutes for a croissant sandwich. No one asked me what I needed. They ignored me until I asked for a refund. No explanation was offered jus a ""sorry bout that"". Coffee and donuts are actually better at 7-11 or even Winchels."
1,"Restaurant was dirty; trash cans over flowing, dusty counters, floors covered with grease. 

My eggs were raw and strawberries on waffle old."
1,"Waffle House . . . food is good - consistant and good.

Cook was awesome, she was able to put a quality product out to her best.  Kudos to ' Alice ' ;)

Service was weak . . . shameful.  Only one server and he was overwhelmed.  Ok - Friday evening ( 8 pm ish ) and I can understand trying to cut corners on expenses by letting a server go but NEVER cut corners where it counts.  Service is one area that will break a restaurant or more important bring people back.  ( food of course is the other ) 

One server was unable to get the orders correct, product out to the customers nor clean up.  Given that the cook was doing her job . . . the person taking / putting in and delivery of said orders was the weak link here.  He was overwhelmed with having the entire floor to himself.

I will not go back to this Waffle House again.

Sorry, the management is to blame and since they don't care, why should I return."
1,Kat the manager has zero customer service skills. She definitely needs anger management classes.
1,"This place is NOT where you want to eat!! 

1. Service is horrible!! Be Aware of Scams!!
Please be aware to ALWAYS look at your receipt, the owner has been known to secretly add extra hidden charges, without your knowledge!!
I.e. There was a Groupon deal for this location, so we purchased the $40 worth of food voucher, (note that Im an avid Groupon user, so I am fully aware of the rules/ regulations), we placed our order for $47 worth of food ($52 after taxes) and the owner was going place an additional 15% gratuity on top of our bill, just because he wanted to! NO WHERE on the Groupon deal does it state 15% gratuity would be added!! We asked WHY he was charging us extra and he stated ""because you use Groupon, and I no make money!! So I HAVE TO CHARGE EXTRA 15%"". That's a bunch of BS!!

Needless to say, we argued and walked out not buying a thing, because we were being scammed! As we were gathering our stuff to leave, another couple told us they were equally scammed by being charged extra because they used a Restaurant.com voucher! They too we're going to file a complaint. Here's the deal, If the owner wants to promote his business using Groupon, that is his prerogative, but he needs to respect and honor the rules and regulations!! He cannot create his own price adjustments after customers purchase the vouchers!! Hence, we walked out because we do not trust his business, and we didn't want to be taken advantage of!! 

2. The Food is NOT Fresh!! Eat at your own risk...afterall it's not cheap anyway!
We are locals and locals discuss business all the time!! Apparently this place had to shut down by the Food Department bc of it's LOW GRADE due to unsanitary conditions. It then reopened after Inspection Approval...I found this out after my incident described above...Not being able to eat here was a blessing in disguise, perhaps!

Here's the Interview from KTNV NEWS ""Dirty Dining"" and their Demerits!!! 
http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Flame-Kabob-236810281.html 

3. The place is filthy and unsanitary!! Again, Eat at your own risk!!


****It's Unfortunate that this Business has Potential, BUT is not putting it to use!!
The Owner needs to learn how to treat Customers respectfully and serve Fresh Food in a clean kitchen...bottom line!! 

AGAIN...BEWARE...EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! =("
1,"It's Thursday afternoon @4:30pm. No one in here. Every table is dirty. The floor needs a sweep and the employee is sitting in the lobby on his phone. I had frozen Carmel since they had no more chocolate mix, which was my original order. It's supposed to have the Carmel drizzle on top. I got none. This is my first visit here and already my impression is that they run out of product, the store is not cleaned regularly and the employees are not held accountable or responsible for their actions or inactions."
1,"Let's start with little to no parking due to the rental car agency that's attached to Dunkin' Donuts. If you manage to find a space, and if you see more than one person in front of you waiting, just walk back out. They have usually have 2-3 employees working drive thru and one working the register inside. Service is usually very slow inside but it just gets worse if the person in front of you orders a dozen donuts. My wife and I find the coffee inconsistently made when asking for flavored coffee. I think I have walked out of the store more than waited for coffee."
1,don't even bother requesting a song. even if you give them money they will only play what they want.
1,"Deplorable customer service, wilted vegetables, Dry meat. definitely not the restaurant for me."
1,"I never write bad review, but the bartender (female) on the left side of the bar was the worst I've ever had at any place.  My party ordered  an 84 ounce hurricane and it was the most foul drink anyone of us had every had.  The after taste was similar to bacon.  The manager offered a 20% off second (after tasting it himself). I opted for a beer instead.  After ordering several beers, she never said thank you or ever hello.  When I closed my tab, she still failed to even speak, despite the fact that I gave her 50% tip.  Thank you for ruining my going away party in the United States. There's no explanation for her behavior.  The male bartender, whom I've had many times, was professional as always. 

To the management at Howl at the Moon, I would love to hear an explanation for this in your own words."
1,Worst place ever! The food mediocre at best the service absolutely sucks! Management can care less if you tell them your food came out prepared badly they just argue with you. Don't go there this place is horrible!
1,I went once a few weeks ago and it was some of the worst food ever. I tried everything but the habatchi station. The only thing I liked was the dumplings and they were just okay
1,"Chandler Boulevard Waffle House employees smoking ?? in front of the store...! I'm a regular at my neighborhood Waffle House, so I am used to walking through clouds of cigarette smoke to get to the front door, the rowdy after hours crowds, the waitresses screaming orders at the cooks, it's all part of the charm. But the Chandler Boulevard store is out of control. We arrived at about 10:30 PM, April 14, after attending the nearby races. We walked up on two uniformed male employees smoking within about 10 feet of the entrance. It was obvious they weren't smoking cigarettes. I said sarcastically ""gee what's that smell"". One of them handed the ?? back to the other and quickly turned and headed into the store exhaling slowly as he was leaving, trying not to be too obvious. The other one loudly proclaimed ""it's medicine I've got a card"". I replied ""really waffle house lets you medicate at work and you can share your medicine with your buddy? Upon entering the store we noticed about 15 rowdy high school kids bouncing off the walls, with no employees actually working. The place was a disaster, all the tables were full of dirty dishes. We turned and left and went to Cracker Barrel across the parking lot. Had a nice late night breakfast.
I am a big fan of Waffle House but what happened here? Where is management?"
1,"I had to give myself a week to calm down and not leave an ugly review for this place; it's been 2 and I am still scarred by my experience here. 

The ""food"" is absolutely inedible. Pancakes were burnt and hard, waffles were not even close to moist or soft, even the fruit were sour and not ripe. Don't order the mimosas, the pulp and cheap champagne didn't work. To make matters way worse, we had to wait almost one whole hour for the food to come out and there were only two parties (our group of 8 and another group of 8-10). No servers were ever seen on the floor except when brining out the food so if you needed water or anything else, best of luck to you my friend. 

I normally never leave poor reviews because I don't ever want to intentionally hurt a business, but the food and service was so awful that I'd feel even worse if people actually wasted their time and money here."
1,"Very disappointed by the lack of customer service and professionalism. A massage and facial were scheduled for me as a surprise. The facial was wonderful, although not worth the price. I am currently pregnant and a prenatal massage was not scheduled as it was a gift. The salon was unwilling to modify my massage in any way, doing just arms, legs, or feet, etc. The girl working the front desk was very rude and basically told me oh well it was my fault and that the massage could not be modified and that I would not receive any money back or any type of credit. Very disappointing experience."
1,I had a horrible experience at Dunkin Donuts this morning I never had a problem of switching English muffin instead of croissant bread because the croissant bread makes a lot of mess in my vehicle I don't appreciate it so I would rather use English muffin I even told the lady I will pay extra she said no we cannot do that at all this is the first Dunkin Donuts that I was told this nonsense
1,"Was here first week they opened and ordered the pizza. Pretty bad...then started coming back to give them a second chance and had the pastas and appetizers, salads and they were good. Decided to give the pizza another chance... awful. No taste. Cheese had no taste, very dry and very burnt on the edges after saying we didn't want it burnt. Very disappointed to have to pay for a lousy meal."
1,I stopped in for dessert as I was told there was a pastry chef on staff. The peaches n cream was horrible and a waste of calories. Not say it was $10.00 which is way over priced for dessert.
1,"The House of Pizza used to be very good, no matter if it was at lunchtime or late at night. Not so anymore. Went in at lunch today, after1:00, and waited to be seated. The help stood around talking until I told the gentleman behind me that the reason I wasn't moving was because of the ""Wait to be seated"" sign. That got the helps attention although the restaurant didn't appear to be busy, maybe 3 tables with people at them. I was seated and placed my order of a Pastrami sub and iced tea. 25 minutes later, (I was on a lunch break from work,) my sub came out with chopped meat..I ordered pastrami so I'll say it was pastrami. . This chopped meat had little to no flavor and no moisture...dry as dust. the only moisture in the entire sub was the mustard and whatever drops of water that were on the lettuce. The waitress was nonexistent and I was out of tea for over 10 minutes. I never saw her again until she brought the food. This place used to be good and maybe I caught them on a bad day but it'll be awhile before I go back, if then."
1,"Just ridiculous to take 20 min in the drive thru and have one person I front of me , will not come back here"
1,"So much fun if, and only if, you totally love dogs.  Stinks.  But the run factor: 15 on a scale of 1/19. Awesome"
1,"This is our second visit..,. first one wasn't good but we decided to give it another try......just AWFUL....that is putting it mildly.....salad was good but pizza was disgusting.....there was a scant amount of sauce that had NO flavor.....the cheese was  cheap tasting and DRY.....the pizza was BURNED to the point where I was pulling it apart trying to find a morsel that wasn't blackened to a crisp......we complained and the waitress said ""oh it looks like you are eating it!""... seriously? We came in and we were famished and was hoping for a decent meal.....wow!!!! Just gross....never will I come back again.....a pretty place  but the WORST food!!!!!!!! I'm actually angry that I have to pay for this!!! I'm leaving pissed and hungry.  Alinos is sooooo much better, tastier and really good...."
1,"I had been to Novanta once before for lunch and decided to try again with my daughter as she wanted pizza and I was in the mood for pasta. Checking the menu on line I had preselected Pappardelle Bolognese, which is described as having a four meat sauce with house made ricotta cheese and pappardelle pasta. Yummy!

Upon arrival we were sat immediately and greeted by our waiter. We ordered waters as I requested a little time to look at their Italian wine list, most by the glass or bottle. My 5 year old daughter got a basic kids cheese pizza, I ordered the pasta and asked if I got a bottle could they cork it so I could take the remainder home as the price per glass was rather high compared to the bottle-typical. He said of course and ran off as I yelled a request for bread for my starving baby girl. The wine -a $28 Chianti I never heard of was delivered by out waiter who rather ceremoniously set it on the table while trying to crack a joke stating; ""it's a screw top so it makes it easy to take home"" and walked away. No open and pour, no check to be sure I liked it, nada. A few minutes later the food and our bread was delivered simultaneously. My daughter's pizza was not at all like I recalled my first visit. My first experience was a tasty Neapolitan style pizza, my daughter's slightly smaller scale version was slightly charred on the perimeter and under cooked in the middle at the same time. Seems hard to do for an 8"" pizza. My pasta to put it lightly was a huge disappointment.  The ""meats"" were hard to taste albeit find, and the meal itself really lacked much memorable flavor to warrant even a rating of 1 or 2.  However, I have to say  the overall service was so pour it was easy to give the experience a 1. In fact if it was possible to rank it minus I would do so for the $55+ ""experience"" of food and wine. 

Note to owners. Your other Brooklyn pizza places are great. Living in Cornelius we visit your Brooklyn South location and it's great. Please read this review to your staff as soon as possible. My recommendation-train your staff to property serve a bottle of wine. I didn't order a Diet Coke. Your four pasta choices need to be either upgraded or eliminated or ask the chef to at least retool the one I had. It needs a lot more of the four ""meats"" to live up to the description of Bolognese. Don't serve cut up pizza dough as ""bread""- why bother? Honestly tonight  I could have gotten better food, better service and a better overall experience at less money at your other Brooklyn South location not to mention competitors like Brixx down the street in Birkdale."
1,closed 2/14/10
1,Manager sucks. She always screws up my orders AND she's the manager!!!?? never gives me a receipt when I ask for it. Instead she argues with me. unprofessional and rude.
1,"I was EGGspecting this restaurant to EGGceed my EGGspectations but it did NOT. An EGGsample of the horrible service was when our waitress did not bring out all our food!! She did not EGGsemplify what you would want in a waitress and we found her to be rude and aloof. She EGGsibited horrible memory recall. She did not display a SUNNY SIDE of disposition. We tried to EGGsclude her while we EGGsplained the problem to the manager, but the whole thing was SCRAMBLED and did not go OVER EASY. It was super EGGspensive and the most EGGscruciating experience of my life!! OMELETTE you draw your own conclusions on whether you want to visit this restaurant."
1,"Pretty awful. The smoked salmon was slimy and old-looking, the asparagus looked like it was cooked a week ago, toast was cold, the water glass stunk like egg and the potatoes were both burnt and cold. Everything about it was bad."
1,"I had high hopes for this place, I was referred by a friend. I was quite disappointed by how small the pizzas were at $16 each- we needed four pizzas just for our family of 4.  And all four pizzas had too much sauce and not enough cheese. All the pizzas needed salt or other seasoning, they had no flavor.
My other issue was with ventilation. I hate walking into a restaurant and you can smell strong cooking odors. I felt like this place smelled very heavy of almost burning wood fire, so when I leave my hair reaks and i need a shower (ladies you know what i mean!)
My husband made a comment that people probably go there once to try it but then usually don't go back again. I agree.
Most of the other people we saw there were just drinking beer and getting an appetizer.
Much better pizza places closer to mooresville!"
1,"This officially will be the last time that I set foot into this Dunkin! 6:43 am and they're out of most of their bagels. The donuts usually taste like their da old. 
Off to Einsteins"
1,Fail how do you not have half the stuff on your menu? Tried to charge me for stuff i didnt order gave me wrong dougnuts wtf
1,"We just went there to have persian food. It took 2 hours for them to bring our food, we ordered koobideh and shish kabob. The food was so bad, specifically shish kabob that we could not eat it at all. I don't recommend this place to any one."
1,"The service was ridiculously slow, and the server seemed very inexperienced. The salad from specials was very small and tasted terrible, and it cost me $12...?  My experience was definitely unsatisfactory."
1,Love Dunkin Donuts but hate this location. I went in with the intention of buying a dozen bagels but couldn't because there wasn't enough. I also wanted to buy two dozen donuts and could only leave with one dozen because there wasn't enough  of the classic Donuts. This is not the first time I've had issues at this location. The only reason I continue to go there is because it's the only Dunkin Donuts near my job.
1,"Been wanting to try dukin for sometime now . They finally open one near me with easy access. . 
I ask if they had cream puffs . They said no .but they had brownie filled balls . And jelly balls . So i figure  they will be great. Boy was i wrong
I order 2 dozen of each .  Well whats the best part of a filled donut  ball ? . The filling of course. .they only had about 1 tear drop of Filling!!!!!!! No lie
Waste of time and money . They was just regular Donut holes pretty much .
Eather put more filling or dont say that there is brownie  batter or jelly inside . They where fresh . But also dry . . Not sure if i will order again from here"
1,"I have been to this place 4 times before and always had great service and food. This time, the lady taking your order was extremely rude and my torta had very little carne asada and it had no flavor. I won't be returning or recommend to anyone."
1,"Well, I was really hoping to review this as a 3 star establishment, but I would not classify this place as ""A-OK"". Because, Eek; Methinks not!

Now let me make one thing clear, I have only been to this place twice. Once which was meh, and the other time which was absolutely horrible and cannot be forgiven on any level.

My first time here was barely memorable and so was the food, so I can't really speak on it much. Now my second time here, well, let's just call it an atrocity. 

First off, we were quoted a 20 minute wait that turned into an hour almost. We had our Grandmother with us, who is unable to stand for very long and she had to basically climb up a barstool and sit uncomfortably the entire duration of our wait.

We were finally called to our table and introduced to our abominable waitress. She looked at us, as if we screamed ""no tip"" upon her greeting us. She was rude, hostile and extremely short on taking care of us. I wish I had of complained that night about her, but it's too late now. 

Ok, let's get to the worse part of the night...the food. I ordered the Tiger & Phoenix, and oh, my, God. It was horrific! There was barely any Lobster at all and it was still a blue tint, indicating that it was undercooked. On top of that, it had an extremely fishy smell and taste, which means it was not fresh. The Chicken was so fatty that I had filled my napkin with wads of fat spit.

The only reason I did not throw a fit was because our Grandmother was buying and she is very old. I just wanted her to be happy, so I said nothing until later on to my Wife. She was so upset, telling me that I wish I had of told her. Apparently her food was horrible also. Go figure.

So yeah, that's about it for this place. Nuff said."
1,"Pizza was cold,  service poor !! Someone needs a trip up north.  Zeppole's were over cooked and greasy!"
1,"Stayed at this hotel on Saturday night after the Cavs game. Drove past it and thought it looked nice so I called and booked a room. Besides the service being ridiculously slow, (waiting 2 hours for blankets) I found a large blood stain on the comforter. I called downstairs to complain, the man I spoke to said our room would be compensated. I got a bill in the morning, so I called again and they put me on hold and said they handled it. I go downstairs to check out and I'm told that I have to pay for the room. I stood there for a good 20 minutes going back and forth with Adam the supervisor and Isaac. They told me that I should have magically been able to read the guys mind and known that they would only be comping me $50 instead of the entire room. If I'm told the room is being compensated, I'm going to assume it's the entire room. I didn't ask them to comp my room, they offered and I thought the issue was settled. I confirmed with them AGAIN in the morning as well, only to have to argue before heading home. Another thing that irritated me is that when I asked for a manager, Adam told me there was no manager available which I didn't believe. I even asked another employee who told me there is always a manager during the 1st and 2nd shifts on site.  I told them point blank I wasn't giving them authorization to charge my card and now my file is ""open"" and I will be contacting a manager to get this situation handled. Overall, I was thoroughly underwhelmed, annoyed and disgusted with my experience at this hotel. At the end of the day it isn't about the money but the fact that I was told something twice only to be surprised when I come downstairs. If you're not willing to comp your guests when there are issues, DON'T OFFER TO IN THE FIRST PLACE."
1,I don't remember Jack Astors being that bad. The food quality is horrible. I do know that all Jack Astors food comes in pre-packaged just like every other chain restaurant but their food has gotten much worse since the last time I went which was a few years ago.
1,"Stopped by the Centrifuge while in the MGM for what I was expecting to be a nice cocktail and.... this is not a place for cocktails. It definitely sells itself as a lounge-style cocktail bar but simple drinks couldn't be made. It may have been the bartenders on staff at the time, but on a Saturday night at busy hours? The scene wasn't at all exciting and just seemed like a fancy looking dive with stragglers. The seating was definitely grungy and needs some major cleaning and maintenance or replacement. I will admit that the DJ was pretty good and played excellent music, but even his great skills weren't enough to make this place worth hanging out at. There are far better places in Vegas, and in the MGM to go to."
1,"Absolutely horrendous. The kitchen staff must be asleep. My party and I ordered two steak entrees and a chicken salad. The steaks and mashed potatoes/vegetables arrived cold while the chicken salad arrived with no chicken. We brought this to the attention of the waitress who said she would tell the kitchen to remake the dishes. The manager arrived less than five minutes later with the food in hand and a dry ""sorry about that"". The food was not redone and quite obviously just placed under a heat lamp. Needless to say, the food was horrible and to make up for the horrible food and kitchen service they comped the chicken salad and provided the other two of us with a paltry 15% discount ($6.44). The server was nice and professional but unfortunately the poor kitchen staff made the experience terrible. Finally, the inexperienced manager simply did not know how to remedy the failings of his staff. Will never be returning to this location."
1,Pack a lunch! It took 35 minutes to get my car into the tunnel with only 4 cars ahead of me. It was well over an hour for a basic wash. I could see dirt left on my car when it came out of the tunnel. They let the car dry and then wiped it down with a damp rag. I assume that is not good for the paint.The wash was terrible. I recommend going to Clean Freak Carwash if you expect to get what you pay for.
1,"Please have someone from upper management, preferably Tina's boss, call me about Jenny. My stay with the hotel was wonderful until Jenny felt the need to flex her management muscle. All of the other staff did an excellent job of making my stay wonderful other than her."
1,"Don't go here! The sales guys are complete slime balls! The service sucks and the wash is even worse. I watched the girl wax my car, then clean my wheels, THEN clean my interior windows and leather seats all with the SAME rag. I now have a waxy residue all over the inside of my windshield. 

Not to mention that they slopped Armorall all over my car, so now there is greasy patches all over my seats. 

To add insult to injury the sales guy sold me on the $50 ultimate package. I know it is normal and customary to haggle so I did and the lowest he said he could do is take $5 off... I tried to do better and he swore up and down that, this was the best he could do. He then walked over to the machine and printed out a ticket for my was + $5 for ""washing my floormats"" which is included- then handed me a $10 off ultimate car wash coupon. The slime ball could have given me the $10 off coupon but instead tried to milk me for an additional $5. I asked the cashier if that was normal and she just rolled her eyes and agreed with me that it was shady. 

Beware of this place... I wouldn't go back."
1,"Never again. They cross threaded my axle when I had a wheel bearing hub replaced. Charged me $540 to change it and the part is $97, but they get a discount when buying parts. Hub went bad again in 18 months and that should almost never ever happen on a new hub. Told me warranty is over and it's gonna be $540again. The hub went bad because they crossed threaded the axle nut on with an impact socket. This time I fixed it myself and took me an hour 15 mins and saved myself $440. And yeah, the chubby guy in customer service is rude and sarcastic. Meineke will lose customers because of his sarcasm and wise comments. One day he will be recorded and posted on YouTube."
1,Advertise an oil change for $19.95 end ends up paying 27+. I don't mind paying taxes but hiding a $5 shop supplies fee is literally called stealing. Will never go back.
1,"I went in with a broken AC and they spent about a hour looking at it came back and said it was low freon, asked if I wanted to use dyed freon to see if there is leak for extra $15. I agreed, and came back a hour later again said unfortunately the freon is filled and fixed many leaks the AC is still broken it is the compressor. Quoted me the compressor for $1200 and said they won't charge me for the freon fill today. 
I thought I should go home and get a second opinion and took my car to a small family owned repair shop. The repair shop fixed my AC with just freon fill!!! They said the freon was completely empty there was no leaks , and only charged me $60. And now it is a year later my AC still works great.
Amazing how these scammers can still be in business. Be aware"
1,"WORST SERVICE EVER!  The lady at the counter was super rude.  ""Operations manager"" was arguing with an old lady loudly at the table next to us and when I mentioned my problem to him, he just walked away without saying anything.  Maybe cause they're in a casino they don't really care about customer service because there's always another tourist that doesn't know better to stop by but I'm a local and will definitely never return.  Food was meh."
1,"They do a very poor  job for what you pay. if you have a higher end car, they will ruin the paint.  They are declining over the years. i used to be able to get reasonable wash here. Now the jets that spray the pink and blue foam are clogged and only drop globs of foam instead of an even layer of spray. The pre rinse/wash is non existent on my last 2 visits. I paid for a spray wax. 5 out 6 times they tried to say they were done without ever touching the roof. There are several people walking around with manger printed on their shirts that don't seem to give a darn about the type of work being done. The other huge turn off is the high pressure sales tactics to upgrade whatever service you are requesting. 

If you want a car wash that will just grind dirt into your paint and do an overall terrible job, this is the place for you. They could care less about the quality of work they do."
1,I have to write last 2 times very bad. This place has gone down hill. The windshield as soon as I got out on the road was so bad. I pulled into parking lot across street. Wheels were dirty there were parts on car looked very bad. When he took tip did not give back key fob car idled for over half hour while they dryed and vacuumed inside. I was here over an hour and there were only 2 customers there this morning. I guess I was last to know not to use any  more.
1,"To be clear, my only review here is of the associated parking garage (where the valet associated with The 9 parks), and NOT the hotel.  This is a private garage owned by the same owners of The 9 (according to their front desk).  My vehicle window was smashed in and my car was broken into, while my car was parked next to the lit stairwell on the fourth story.  I understand that one parks at their own risk, but the owner of the garage offered zero sympathy. The police officer also told me that this is not an uncommon occurrence at The 9 parking garage. Cleveland has a great downtown but in my opinion, avoid staying at a hotel with this risk and find another hotel in Cleveland that has more secure parking."
1,"Other than the fact that they sell Sinclair gas I can't think of a reason to go back. i just had the truck washed, and I'm not expecting a detail, but for the Super, I expect my truck to actually be clean I shouldn't have to hunt on the floor for my things that were in the cup holders! I will not return!"
1,"Even though I picked one star, that was because I had too. If I could, no stars would be my honest review. This place was absolutely horrible. I should have known better when my husband asked for a sample of the orange chicken and the associates response was "" we don't give samples."" The orange chicken was like eating a fried batter soaked in orange jam, beyond sweet and little to no chicken. The only positive we can say is the girl was nice enough to recommend only one plate to share and gave us an extra plate, she knew we were in for a horrible meal so why spend extra on food we ended up throwing away."
1,"very poor. I went into bar, ordered a beer and left my card for a tab. awhile later I ordered a second beer on my tab. when I went to cash out, the server couldn't find my card and said the waitress had it. The waitress didnt and gave me a bill for my 2nd beer. when I informed them that I had left a card her rude response was ""you're confusing me and him"" and gave my a bill for my 2nd beer. frustrated I oaid for that beer in cash. I asked for my card and other bill. they couldn't find it. They called a manager. 10 minutes later the manager shows up, and discovers my damn card was literally in a cup with its bill inches away from us the whole time. the three of them then proceeded to have a conversation as I waited for my bill. i finally get it and sign it, when a friend points out that due to the fruatration I shouldn't have to pay. I didnt care just wanted to get out. manager said my drink would be comped. I left. As I check my credit card account.....I am being charged DOUBLE. what the hell? Its 8 bucks and change but I dont care I will not pay for a third damn beer. 

I will never go to this bar again."
1,Bad customer service. Don't go there. The guy in the front desk had a bad joke he not try to help nothing but push you to other place.
1,$2000 bottle service leads to your table given away to leave you on a garbage floor and waiting 1.5 hours to see a single drink.  They consider services rendered if they allow you to carry your drink up multiple flights of stairs to see  the entertainer you paid to be on the same floor with.
1,"We went here on a wed and it wasn't too busy some reason the service was so slow and the food was horrible the calamari was super dry so was my deluxe burger, the pasta shrimp was bland also the worst Cesar cocktail I ever tasted. I don't recommend coming here."
1,"Came in for an oil change and stood inside like an idiot for 10 minutes. Why? Idk because all the workers watched me walk up to their building. Finally, when greeted I was told no one was available to work on my car. So I asked about one of their coupons I had. The worker said that the $25 oil change coupon was gonna turn out to be around $55 for the oil I use. That's fine. Still cheaper then the $79 I usually spend. Then this man proceeded to tell me that it'll end up being around $70 after taxes...

$15 in taxes? Who the fuck are you?

So I said ok.. So this coupon is no good for me, he got all hopped up on attitude and said ""well if you read the coupon you can use it if you use that specific kind of oil.""

Didn't we just do this? I just got done telling you I don't use that specific kind.

I'll never go back here or to any other location. Idiots."
1,Shady as hell keep shopping around to fix your car or truck. They think they can fix but they can't or they too damn lazy. If you want it it done they jack the price up. So I went places all they did was aligned and it straight  and the tires didn't worn as quickly.
1,"Terrible!!!! Spend 35 minutes to get your car cleaned for $19.99 and they do a mediocre job, at best!!!"
1,This car wash and all other locations got bought by cobblestone and since then the service is really horrible. I purchased a monthly pass at the Ray Road location (like I do every month) and it was still valid and they basically called me a liar because it wasn't showing in their computer system. The manager wasn't helpful at all and after a few minutes of arguing (and I'm not an argumentative person) I just figured it wasn't worth it and said I would pay for wash. Then she wanted to charge me for the more expensive wash I didn't ask for! I said I'm not paying for that and at least she just charged me for the wash I ordered. I got similar bad service at the Mesa and Gilbert locations since Cobblestone has took over. This will be my last visit.
1,"They did a good job detailing the car. I paid about $100. I was in a hurry and was told that the car would be detailed in 90 minutes , it literally took 5 hrs. 

They offered me a free car wash for next time, problem is there won't be a next time. 

If you got all day, head on over."
1,"""Premium"" car wash at Classic Car Spa and having to clean your car yourself afterwards because they did such a sorry job: $24.99.

Getting your car washed at a church fundraiser later by kids with soap and a bucket and getting a better job done in the process: $10.00.

Complaining about the bad service of Classic Car Spa to the point that the manager bans you from ever setting foot on his premises: Priceless!"
1,"We went into this bar in hopes of watching the NBA playoffs, given they had numerous televisions and few customers. However, all were tuned to the same, early-season baseball game.  We asked them if they could change one of the TVs to the basketball game and received a lackluster response.  After about ten minutes and asking another employee the TV was switched to the game we wanted.  Then we attempted to order drinks at the bar.  After passing us a couple of times the bar tender took my friend's order.  After another five minutes of passing us he filled her order then left before I could place my order.  I waited another five minutes during which the bar tender rushed passed me many more times, again, this was in no way a full bar and seemed to be pretty heavily staffed.  At the end of this five minutes the entire staff of the bar proceeded to dance on the bar and fill/take no drink orders.  I waited out this interruption only to be passed by the bar tender several more times.  At this point I returned to the table where my friends were sitting to complain about the service, yes, loudly, sorry, the situation was a total bummer.  The bar tender heard me and irritatedly offered to take my drink order, at which point I complained, dropping an f-bomb and then was told off by the bar tender.  Booo."
1,"Do Not Go Here!! They don't deserve your business. Trying to charge you hundreds of dollars more for something that probably doesn't need fixing. After The diagnostic I was assured that my spark plugs needed replacing for $500. Not how I wanted to start my week but I figured it had to be done. Then two days later my car started shaking again.! Went back in to have another diagnostic performed to find out it wasn't my spark plugs to begin with, it was my coil cap and charged me an additional $240. What a nightmare of an experience. And if you don't have the money to have the service done they mock you and tell you to ask your friends and family. Are you kidding me?? This place doesn't care about making your day any easier or saving you alittle change in the end, So sad. I will happily take my business somewhere else next time."
1,"On inspection of the car wash after I left the property I noticed some residue on the top, hood and trunk. I returned to the location and asked the check in attendant if he thought the car wash result were up to their standards. His response was to get a bottle of something and a rag and try to improve the results. It was obvious that the residue was soap that had dried because the entry from the first soap application and the entry to the tunnel was for some reason delayed. I asked if it was possible to re-wash the car and he went on a long spiel on how the car needed clay and detailing.
I left, went to a spray wand wash down the street and it was like a miracle...no clay, no detailing just washed the soap dried residue off and the car looked like it should after drying.
I have no idea why a re-wash wasn't done at the business, I do know I won't return to get a bad car wash, deal with an incompetent attendant."
1,"Will not be taking my vehicle here for any type of service due to your customer service. Your service advisor/cashier (wearing no name tag) was extremely rude not only me but also to the customers that were ahead of me when I got there. I recently move here to the area and was looking for a place nearby to service my vehicle and along with that I booked an appt online because it was convenient and downloaded the coupons it had for me. I drove 3 mins to meineke and stood in line. Well when it was my turn to talk to him no hello just ""what u need?"" I told him I'm here for an appointment, he checked seen I needed a diagnostic too and said you're gonna be here for 3 hours, I said oh I'm sorry I didn't know it was going to take that long and can you just do an oil change only for today? He said no we can't do your oil change today that's not how it works and proceeded to lecture me in front of other customers about booking appt online and how your system operates. I wanted to tell him that online your appointment system is very vague and DOES NOT say how long you will need my car but instead I told him to cancel everything and walked out. I suggest that you train him better with how to talk professional to customers or else you will lose business. 4 people in line behind me walked out and talked to me about how rude this guy was. the GM of this company needs to be aware of his professionalism while at work!"
1,"I can't speak to their ability to maintain or repair vehicles.  I can however speak to their customer service.  I have always changed my own oil and on rare occasion,  have had to take my vehicle to a shop to have the oil plug loosened,  always free of charge.  I decided to stop by Meineke today after having some tires changed next door.  This particular Meineke was dead with only one ore two cars being worked on.  I went to the gentleman at the counter to ask if they could loosen the plug,  at which point the shop manager,  who was lazily lounging in one of the customer chairs in the lobby piped up and said ""No, I don't usually do that"".  Well I don't usually pay people who laze around in the customer waiting area to change the oil on my car either.  I stopped by Jiffy Lube,  who had plenty of customers,  and they loosened my oil plug with no nonsense and no charge.  Good luck Meineke!  Maybe you will help the next person who comes in and asks for a small and simple favor.  That person however will never again be me."
1,Decided to give this place another try since I heard they brought back the iceberg beer.  What a disappointment.  Tasted horrible.  Ordered the deep fried broccoli.  AMAZING!  But 12 bux?  For broccoli?  C'mon!   Then got a burger.  Meh....  over all another let down.  I'll try again in another year and see if the prices match the lack of food quality.
1,"They are only good for washing you car and THATS IT! Just paid $40 to have my headlights restored but now it has more scratches on it than before.  I asked the guy over to redo it 4 times and he finally said thats the best he can do.  They only use one rough sand paper and no fine sanding to sand out the fine scratches.  Sh*tty-est piece of so called ""professional"" work I've seen.  NEVER AGAIN!"
1,"We've been going here for the past years and everything was great until today! We made an appointment for an oil change and was surprised that they were billing us for $80! When we asked, they said that they will be putting synthetic oil in our car. We told them we wanted the regular ""preferred basic"" oil change ($24), which what they've putting in for the past years but they won't do it because they said Toyota recommends synthetic oil... It sucks, because both of our cars are being service here all the time especially oil changes and it's sad that we will be looking for a different place now..."
1,"Not happy with the service, first of all John who work at the front desk is very disrespectful and unprofessional. The way he call he's customer using he's finger, what am I? Animal?! Second, the first time i brought my vehicle for a change oil it turned out there's something wrong with it. So I said, I'll give them a second chance... I brought another vehicle still something wrong with it. There's always something wrong. Maybe they're doing that in purpose. And im sure they are so they can collect more money."
1,The Chinese food here is terrible. Ordered a chili dog this time. Just as bad. Bad chili dog?  Yes pretty disgusting.  On top of which it was barely warm. Towards the middle it was down right cold.   Who serves food like this????   Maybe they're trying to go out of business
1,"I only have one statement to add for this restaurant. 

The tomato in my salad was half black & mouldy. 

What else can you say about this place. If you serve a mouldy tomato you get one star. End of story!"
1,"There was nothing ""Ultimate"" about the car wash I just received for $45 at this facility.  I found trash left under the back seat & driver's seat, crumbs in the crevices of the front passenger seat, hand prints on the back window, and bugs on my headlights.  I could've given my 4 year old a dish towel, a bucket, and some Palmolive and gotten a cleaner car.  Just terrible..."
1,"Wow, people in Las Vegas must be on crack to give this place 3 stars. My 1 star is being generous. 

I stayed at the Freemont last year and on the first day just wanted to grab something quick to eat so I got some chinese food from here. This is the worst chinese food I have ever eaten. The egg rolls were disgusting. Actually, everything they served was disgusting. I ended up throwing the food away. 

Avoid this place at all cost. You better off starving to death then eating here."
1,Ordered the fried saimen it was dry and tasteless.  It was for takeout and i did not get a fork or napkins or salt or soy sauce or anything to add flavor. Rude counterproductive staff. I will never go back. Wish Alaho Specialties stayed open 1 hour later!!!
1,"Double check and do your research before taking your vehicle here for an oil change. I find them a bit dishonest. I was charged 90.00 for a synthetic oil change for a 4cyl sedan under 50k. I was first quoted 75. At any rate, that's what I paid for my Lincoln Navigator when I had it. Instead of arguing, I decided to post my experience here where I feel will have greater impact than dealing with a manager on duty. 

Combined, I give it 2 stars for the cleanliness of the facility and the decent job they did on my car. I just returned from a road trip and had bug and road grime all over the front. May get the groupon for car washes only. But we will see. Not looking good to see more cars waiting to be dried than workers doing the drying


Drove away and discovered at 40mph a skid plate was not secured. Returned it and was told that the oil guy just left. While pulling into the garage, the skid plate was knocked off. I don't know how much damage there was but I'm taking it to Ford to find out. 

One Star..."
1,Horrible place MAX WAS HORRIBLE and JOHN the manager can't manage also he help out zero on the situation
1,"I can't believe this has happened again to me and my son at this restaurant. I'm sick of these so called hostess who seat you at the kitchen because you are a white woman over the age of 50 and you have a white male who happens to be a little overweight. I asked to be moved, as the restaurant was not even half full (wonder why) and she flat out said NO. One minute later another hostess seats a boy about 14 and man about 40 in a booth that I asked for. Then they tell us there is no debit but we can use a credit card. UMMM, funny, the same machine is used for both. Well my friend, as this restaurant is obviously prejudiced against white people, I'll never go back to any Jack Astor's again. By the way, they've changed their menu and basically took all the good items off. Oh, Jack Astor, train your so called hostesses to do their jobs instead of this and teach them that the customer comes first, not a social conversation with each other."
1,"Horrible experience at this particular location.
Was there last night, over 15 minutes to take our order after being seated. Waitress comments that she was waiting on my friend to get off the phone. 

Finally ordered a couple of beers. And a calamari, which was burnt tiny and bitter. There was no flesh just burnt crumbs.

Staffs look like they aren't interested in there customers.

Been to other JA locations, which are way better and no complains.

This place in a prime Scarborough location. Is horrible will never go back in there"
1,I was hungry .. thought I'd try it.: looked good looked fresh.. the absolute worst food I've had.. the sweet n sour pork was dry and hard.. the rice and noodles tasted like mush.. the only half way decent thing was the chicken.. if u have mint to waste go here.. believe me when I say I have never given las than a 3 Star.. I'm usually easy going.. but the worst food I may have ever paid for. If there was a negative star it would get all five. I mean I couldn't even finish the food.. that's how bad.. I guess the only good thing about this place is it saved me carbs for the night.
1,"I asked for an estimate for how much it would cost to get my alternator replaced by Jim the general manager. I asked but he never answered my question straight, he only responded with questions like ""are you sure that's what it is? Maybe it's the battery or something else"" and I'm like ""I don't think so, I believe it's the alternator"", so when I thought he was giving me an estimate for how much it would cost. It wasn't what I thought at all, he ended up running a full diagnostic without my permission and when I had to sign for $616 worth of repairs on my Van I decided to ask him not to go through with it because it was too expensive. Then when I was ready to grab my car keys and go, and he said I owed him $95 for the diagnostic still. I was like ""how is that legal? I didn't ask for a diagnostic I only wanted to repair my alternator,"" so I told him I'm not paying for it because I already knew I had a bad alternator. I don't need to be charged $95 for you to tell me I have a bad alternator when I'm the one telling you I have a bad alternator/ ""yup"" he responds as a hustler would say with no respect for others, ""you have a bad alternator that'll be $95"", with no repairs done to my car, I'm like ""I don't have to pay"" I already knew I had a bad alternator and I didn't ask for a diagnostic, so I called the cops! ""It's illegal for you to charge me for work I didn't request"" (He laughed with his cocky rude rude comments and assumptions, because he knew the results in the end was for me to pay him.) ""I'm not going to pay you $95 for you to tell me what I already knew,"" I said. Then he decided to hold my car keys and said I couldn't have my keys until I pay $95 for a diagnostic that he bullied me into signing. Bullying with his words because of his over confidence he didn't ever listen when I asked him from the very beginning on what I needed done to the car when I first asked him. Instead he bullied me into the diagnostic because he knew what he was doing from the beginning, manipulating me into paying him for work I already knew about which is why I came there in the first place, but he didn't care about my needs, only the hustle. He had me sign some forms that he hurriedly pushed me into signing without a detailed explanation, so he could finish his dishonest hustle. I thought the charge was for the repairs of a new alternator that I requested and had canceled. 
I tried to talk to him like an adult but his rude laughing attitude of talking down to me like I'm the idiot caused me to raise my voice, how dare him treat me like some crazy hobo off the streets when I'm a single hard working Mom! Why pay him to tell me I have a bad alternator? I already knew! He was dishonest. He was cocky saying ""I got your signature and there's nothing you can do."" Well maybe not. Maybe he won today because he does this every day but his foul play was ill and needed to be shared, don't go here! He's a bully, he bullied his associate into doing the diagnostic, he bullied me with questions instead of doing what I asked when I walked in. Don't trust this shop especially Jim the guy who's in charge, the job position has gone to his head, he rips people off and takes advantage of single hard working Moms. He has no guilt or shame for his dishonest actions!!!!! Don't have your car worked on here!!!!! He will rip you off!
This company has no concern with how I was wrongfully charged for work I never requested due to poor listening skills from their Manager who bullied our conversation. I had to ask permission to speak about my own car because he was so busy making assumptions and never listening. The so called comment from this company pretending to be concerned is fake, I responded to them and never heard back from them and never got a refund for my $95!!!! Don't GO HERE, THEY ARE LIARS!!"
1,"Haven't been in years... They've become fine dining prices and portion sizes... But wtf, I didn't come for that.  small portion of fries 15? 5 chicken ""fingers"" that were the size of my sons fingers. They were good, but just tiny... Kids meal was good and always fun to draw on the table... But won't be back for another year"
1,"Jack ASStor's? I get the joke, and believe me I do NOT think it's funny."
1,"On a recent trip to Las Vegas was hungry and was craving some Chinese food and came across this place and I must say that I wish I hadn't, this place is one of the worst I have ever been to. First food tastes like it's been out all day, poorly cooked and very poor quality, service not good and over priced for what you get...heck they even charge you .50 for a cup of ice water. Avoid this place at all costs....."
1,"Terrible service, over priced, and they don't do that good of a job.

I paid something around $80 to get the interior completely detailed and a wash/wax.

The salesman kept try to push and push and push more stuff on me to the point where I just had to tell him to stop. They literally took everything in my car and just threw it in the trunk instead of asking me to put it there. They didn't even bother checking the ashtray to clean it out.

On top of all this, for several weeks after when I turned on my A/C, the most horrible smell you can imagine came through the vents. It wasn't there before I had the detail job done, but it was there immediately after. Logic dictates it was something they did. 

They also put some sort of washer fluid in my reservoir that does nothing but streak up my windshield. I think it's supposed to be some sort of Rain-X stuff, but (a) I live in Arizona, where the cumulative rainfall for a year is negligible and (b) this negates the need for Rain-X. 

Seriously, this place is overpriced, the customer service sucked, and I regret having gone there in the first place."
1,"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE

I've never written a hotel review except for a couple of 5 star exerpmeriences but I had to write about this hotel. While the hotel is very well appointed, the staff were extremely rude and were simply obnoxious. 

Highlights - The room was dirty, got charged for charges we didn't incur, cold room service, terrible recommendations from the front desk, aggressive security staff, etc

Just a terrible experience."
1,Me and my fiancé bought two cars at the same time and took them both in for visual checks and one because we had a concern with the thermostat. After taking the car in they kept it for an very short amount of time and said everything was fixed....seemed shady because they had both cars less then two hours . Drive away and two days later the check engine light is on:) going to a different shop thank god our cars have warranty's because if I had paid out of pocket they would have been met with two very angry people. Don't trust this place. Lazy workers when a car needs repairs they should just stick to oil changes.
1,"The staff makes you feel lucky to be there, and they are not welcoming at all. Beer is just okay, and when asked to sample the pumpkin beer, was told they would lose their job if they gave a sample. Wow. Not my typical experience in Pittsburgh. No need to revisit. Go to Blue Dust or Rock Bottom if you're in Homestead, they now how to treat their guests."
1,"Order: orange chicken, fried rice, sweet and sour pork. The food we cold, tasted like it had been sitting out for a long while. The rice was soggy. Between this and Panda Express I would definitely choose Panda."
1,"awful experience. They changed me $900.00 for two brakes, draining the brake fluid and a rodar. I don't know much about cars and I know most mechanics are scammers but at least do the job good!! They said they would have my car done, I went to go pick it up and they said they had a bad part and had to redo the entire job. Then I finally got my car back and usually when I get my brakes done they are very sensitive. I can barely push on them and they brake, after taking my car to meinke I paid $900 and have to push the brake petal all the way to the floor for my car to brake. It's not sensitive at all and feels like they didn't even do anything at all. They honestly probably sprayed something on my brakes and pocketed the money! I'm upset they didn't even do a good job, I don't even feel safe driving my car so I took it to a different place that won't screw me over. Do NOT GO HERE!! They'll just suck you dry for every penny they can, then they do a half asked job. Save your money!! I would give them zero stars if I could. I swear the only good comments on here must be family members because they are truly the most awful people and company!!"
1,"I used to go to this car wash very often, when I lived cross street. Today, I drove by the neighborhood thinking maybe I should do the car wash. When I got there, I found the old classic car wash was sold to another company. The whole configuration was a bit different. A guy saw us and ran from far away to get to the old entry. I was terribly wrong to stay there! I paid about 19 dollars to get the 'premium' car wash. And clearly told them to wipe the interior. They only used 1/3 of the time they used to clean the car. It left me with a non clean car and terrible bathroom smelling interior.  The interior was not wiped, maybe only the steel wheel. The outside still has a lot stains on.  And now, I am standing in my garage reclean the car by myself.  

What a terrible car wash! Not even comparable to some auto car wash! Do yourself a favor, don't go to this car wash!"
1,"I called and asked if it was possible to bring my car in for an oil change while I wait for it.  I drive there and was told 1 1/2 hour wait.   And told I could make an appointment.  Why didn't they make my appointment when I was on the phone instead they tell me now it's first come first serve.  They should have made my appointment 
Very disappointed"
1,So I go to MGM today to meet Jillian for lunch & play alittle keno.. While waiting I'm sitting playing keno at a bar & it's all sticky & ashes everywhere so I ask the bartender ..could you pls wipe this for me ? He tells me he's busy .. there were 3 of us in the bar  he then washes a rag & throws it at me & tells me to clean it  Really ? I'm pretty sure I'm not employed there  as I'm wiping up his bar I'm thinking this is crazy  so I decide to leave & he says thank you ( as I obviously was not leaving him a tip after that ) wanting me to know I didn't give him one  I told management in the restaurant next door & they were appalled  lol.. oh we're going to buy you a drink !  thanks ! I'm in a casino ! Drinks are free anyway ! Not for anything MGM you Could have actually paid for our $20 lunch!  being I Cleaned your bar!!
1,"I purchased the Groupon for a full synthetic oil change and went to Classic Car Spa last week (the Warner location). First issue with the place- there is no clear signage on where to pull your car up for an oil change but what makes me give them a horrible review is their customer service and their hidden charges. Here is the story: I pulled my car up, the attendant asked if I wanted a car wash, I informed him that I had the groupon for an oil change and just wanted the oil change. He then stated, ""the classic car wash is free with an oil change,"" I said ""even with the groupon?"" he said, ""yes"". So of course, I agreed, I mean why would I pass up a free car wash? Another gentleman then tried to sell me on additional services like a $5 wax, etc., I declined as oil changes are expensive enough, hence the purchase of a groupon. Here is where they fail greatly in customer service and communication: I received my invoice and took it to the cashier along with my groupon, there was a problem with the invoice and after about 15 min of me standing and waiting, they were finally able to ring me up. I wasn't expecting to pay anything as I already paid $45.00 for the oil change via groupon, well, to my shock the cashier informs me my total is $17.73! I asked why, they said I have to pay for the car wash as it is not free when using the groupon because, and I quote, ""the groupon is already such a good deal."" I then informed her that the attendant told me that the car wash was free even with the groupon, had I known there would be an additional charge, I would NOT have agreed to the car wash. She then proceeded to tell me that it states it on the groupon, she looked over my groupon voucher (where there is nothing said regarding the car wash) and said, ""well.... its here on the groupon somewhere... I know its not free when using the groupon because my Manager said it's not free when using the groupon..."" Well... okay..at this point, I reiterated to her that I was told by the attendant outside that it was free even with the groupon.  She refused to do anything about it and honestly, after standing there watching all of the incompetence happening, I just needed to get out of there. Terrible customer service. She should have apologized for the miscommunication with the employee and not charged me for something I did NOT agree to (or) at the very least, offer a discount for another service in the future. On another note, full synthetic oil changes are typically $65.00; I paid a total of $62.73, that is NOT a deal as I never agreed to the car wash! I could have used my $10.00 off coupon at one of the other places in the area. To top it off, once your car is finished, they come in the waiting room and  yell out the make and model of your car, you then go outside to complete disorganization and chaos; I had to maneuver my car out between the other cars, then was directed to out the side of the building (very narrow) in order to get out of there.   My advice, don't go here unless you want horrible customer service and want to be charged for add on's that you don't agree to."
1,I came here to do one of the most easiest things to do which is check my oil and other fluid levels and they had me just waiting around. Then when someone finally came up to help me he was trying to get me to pay for an oil change before he even popped my hood and checked my fluids. When I explained again that I just needed my fluids checked he tried upselling me again and saying I'd have to pay to get checked and topped off with fluids. Umm hello! I didn't ask for that! I just wanted you to check my fluid levels and I deserved the opportunity to decide for myself if I want to use your services. I have never ever been charged for something as simple as just checking me fluid levels in the 10 years I've been driving a car. This place just seems like a bunch of scam artist trying to squeeze any dollar they can out of you. I do not recommend anyone to ever come here unless they like getting ripped off... Just saying.
1,I ate here once and the food was pretty good for poke in Charlotte. Unfortunately I have since ordered twice from here and the service is deplorable and the staff is borderline rude. Will never order here again
1,Seriously lazy staff. I'm a Marriott Executive Platinum for life and don't plan to return here. The front desk staff is not very knowledgeable and showed little concern for us. Oh and the room service was on an hour and a half wait.
1,"This letter is to complain about the poor level of service I recently received from a Classic Car Spa Wash.   I live in the Islands right across the street from Classic Car Spa on McQueen and Elliot and have driven by many times. Just so happened this particular day I needed a wash in a hurry and thought I would give them a try. As I pulled in the salesman greeted me and went over the menu. He told me their top wash was the #5...the Ultimate Wash. It was supposed to consist of the Supreme Package plus Carnuba Express wax, leather lotion on dash, door and middle console, and conditioning the floor mats. So I went with it. Make note this was at 1:45pm. Well at 2:30 they said my vehicle was ready. To my surprise not so much. As soon as I opened up the car it was apparent it had not been vacuumed yet, the glass has not been cleaned along with everything else. I asked the gentleman who was presenting the vehicle if he was aware that I purchased the Ultimate Wash? He said sorry they missed the interior and if I would allow them they would fix it. So I went back inside the waiting area. After another twenty minutes another gentleman came carrying a radio who I assumed was a supervisor. He said sorry again and the vehicle was ready. Yeah not so much. As soon as I opened my back hatch to my Sequoia it was clear they had not vacuumed, wiped anything down, the leather, glass or panels, dash and so on. At this point as a customer I starting to feel like I'm asking them a favor to perform their job or as if I was nitpicking. Then I asked the supervisor what the managers name was and requested him to look my vehicle over. So Terry comes out and opens the door to my car and says you're right this is unacceptable. He then personally takes over the job and I continue to wait as we approach three hours now. When I asked him if this is how long it usually takes he said no it's usually about 45 minutes. At no point did anyone try to make my experience right. I finally pulled out of the parking lot at 5:15pm. Unreal. When I got home I noticed right side of the vehicle had bird poop all over it. The sad part about this is I had every intention of bringing in my other vehicle after this wash. Needless to say, I was quite frustrated. 
I expected a much higher level of service from your company, and I am quite disappointed. I will be informing my friends and family about this experience."
1,"Out of all the jack Astor's that I've been to this was the most shitty place I've been to and it's all thanks to one waitress. I forgot her name that's how much I didn't care for her, she was nice at first but then she messed up my order by bringing me my appetizer with my entree. Like lets be real, it's an appetizer for a REASON. Who eats appetizer with their meal? Honestly it's the first time I hear that. If she wasn't sure if I wanted it with my meal she could've ASKED but she didn't say anything and it's not my job to tell her because it's common sense that the appetizer must come BEFORE the meal. Nevertheless, after that she proceeds to tell me not to be rude with her when I WASN'T. I was just making a point and told her I don't need the appetizer now that the entree has arrived ALONG with the appetizer. And to top it all off, the rest of the night she didn't come back to my table to ask how everything was. Moral of the story is, if you're wrong just admit it and say sorry and do your job properly. I'll NEVER go back to that Jack Astor's. Shitty service indeed."
1,"I asked for an estimate for how much it would cost to get my alternator replaced by Jim the general manager. I asked but he never answered my question straight, he only responded with questions like ""are you sure that's what it is? Maybe it's the battery or something else"" and I'm like ""I don't think so, I believe it's the alternator"", so when I thought he was giving me an estimate for how much it would cost. It wasn't what I thought at all, he ended up running a full diagnostic without my permission and when I had to sign for $616 worth of repairs on my Van I decided to ask him not to go through with it because it was too expensive. Then when I was ready to grab my car keys and go, and he said I owed him $95 for the diagnostic still. I was like ""how is that legal? I didn't ask for a diagnostic I only wanted to repair my alternator,"" so I told him I'm not paying for it because I already knew I had a bad alternator. I don't need to be charged $95 for you to tell me I have a bad alternator when I'm the one telling you I have a bad alternator/ ""yup"" he responds as a hustler would say with no respect for others, ""you have a bad alternator that'll be $95"", with no repairs done to my car, I'm like ""I don't have to pay"" I already knew I had a bad alternator and I didn't ask for a diagnostic, so I called the cops! ""It's illegal for you to charge me for work I didn't request"" (He laughed with his cocky rude rude comments and assumptions, because he knew the results in the end was for me to pay him.) ""I'm not going to pay you $95 for you to tell me what I already knew,"" I said. Then he decided to hold my car keys and said I couldn't have my keys until I pay $95 for a diagnostic that he bullied me into signing. Bullying with his words because of his over confidence he didn't ever listen when I asked him from the very beginning on what I needed done to the car when I first asked him. Instead he bullied me into the diagnostic because he knew what he was doing from the beginning, manipulating me into paying him for work I already knew about which is why I came there in the first place, but he didn't care about my needs, only the hustle. He had me sign some forms that he hurriedly pushed me into signing without a detailed explanation, so he could finish his dishonest hustle. I thought the charge was for the repairs of a new alternator that I requested and had canceled. 
I tried to talk to him like an adult but his rude laughing attitude of talking down to me like I'm the idiot caused me to raise my voice, how dare him treat me like some crazy hobo off the streets when I'm a single hard working Mom! Why pay him to tell me I have a bad alternator? I already knew! He was dishonest. He was cocky saying ""I got your signature and there's nothing you can do."" Well maybe not. Maybe he won today because he does this every day but his foul play was ill and needed to be shared, don't go here! He's a bully, he bullied his associate into doing the diagnostic, he bullied me with questions instead of doing what I asked when I walked in. Don't trust this shop especially Jim the guy who's in charge, the job position has gone to his head, he rips people off and takes advantage of single hard working Moms. He has no guilt or shame for his dishonest actions!!!!! Don't have your car worked on here!!!!! He will rip you off!
This company has no concern with how I was wrongfully charged for work I never requested due to poor listening skills from their Manager who bullied our conversation. I had to ask permission to speak about my own car because he was so busy making assumptions and never listening. The so called comment from this company pretending to be concerned is fake, I responded to them and never heard back from them and never got a refund for my $95!!!! Don't GO HERE, THEY ARE LIARS!!"
1,"Been going hear awhile,  they used to do a good job.   Not sure what changed but the last two times have have been a disappointment.   No matter how many times I ask them to come back for a spot they missed,  I drve away work a semi clean cat."
1,"I took my mini van here because I had just bought it and it needed cleaning. I paid $75 for a detail, plus $ 25 for a guy to fix a crack in my windshield. When we picked it up it was seriously no cleaner than before, and my windshield never got fixed. The manager told us to bring it back. So we took it back the next day and they re-washed it. The guy said sorry and that he would fix the windshield. When we picked it up it was still very dirty! My windshield never got fixed again! I finally took the van home and cleaned it myself. I took before and after pictures. A few days later, there was a horrible smell in the car. I opened the back and they had forgotten to put the car mats back! They were still wet and piled on top of each other.  I basically lost out on $100. And ended up spending a ton of time and money for nothing. These guys shouldn't be in business and no one should believe what the website says. I have heard the same thing from a lot of people that have gone there. It's a big rip off. Go to Danny's or anywhere else. Just don't go here. Oh and if you complain to the manager, he gets really mad and tells you to leave. Very poorly run business."
1,"Got here at 5:45 and wanted to get my car washed, but no one would help me. They are supposed to be open for car wash business until 6..."
1,"this is a hip, cool, trendy hotel, NOT a practical use of space or place to get any work done at.
-elevators are a bit too high tech.  got to call elevators with touch screen before you get into the elevator,  then once inside, no buttons and can't change a destination or goto another floor.
-NO desk.  but got a large useless corner couch.
-shower is in the center of the room and not sealed off from anything... aka, if you take a steamy hot shower, you entire room gets hot and humid.  also no privacy if you are sharing rooms.
-lots of small window, aka a ton of drapes to open and close each day.

just not a good use of space..."
1,"Complete scam artists this all starts with a 98 civic that needed a timing belt changed for preventive maintenance. Long story short I took it to a backyard mechanic who changed it, but long story short it was off a tooth after installed. I wasn't exactly sure if it was a tooth off so I decided to have a professional to see if my hypothesis was correct so I asked them to check the timing. So I drop the car off and 2 hours later I receive a call saying the checked the and it's fine and the ignition coils were crossed and that's why it was misfiring. I said great I'll be there to pick it up. They charged me 290 to put $15 autozone coils in that literally take less than 10 minutes to install extremely easy on a civic. After leaving astonished at the price and still having the same exact problem I came in with. At the end of the day I still had to fix the timing belt myself and completely solved my problem as I expected. So all in all they lied about checking what I paid for and then lied again by making a phony problem. If you are reading these ill let you in on a little secret. Most mechanics are on a flat rate system which means you are paid on the jobs and not hourly, which is probably what they use. So the faster you can do a job and get another job out of it and put more money in their pocket. Drawing to a conclusion they are crooks or incompetent and should not work on others vehicle. My suggestion go across the street to Ted weins they are a lot more honest"
1,"Found John to be very rude. Says He'll call back 
Never happened. I called twice and same thing.
Cancelled appointment. You would think the owners would look at theirs reviews and re-examine their
Business plan"
1,"This is a beautiful hotel, in a wonderful location but unfortunately that's as good as it gets. We checked into our dirty room and at 830pm, and immediately received a noise complaint, which we were later told is because the rooms are for sleeping, not for talking and listening to music. Even-though, it's 830 pm and the music was at a respectable level. The GM caught wind of our bad start to our stay and moved our party to a floor that would allow us to have a good time. He then took us to the vault and gave us drinks and all was well. After just a few drinks my girlfriend needed to sit because she was exhausted from dancing and just because she wanted to sit! But instead she was asked to leave because she was intoxicated.....which she was not!

While all of this is happening  downstairs, upstairs the hotel staff was moving our things to another room and grabbed every little thing in our room and safe except the $550 in cash. The next day when we finally noticed it was gone and complained SEVERAL times it miraculously reappeared. This was night one.

I could go on, but the point is do not stay here unless you want to sleep and quietly keep to yourself. Apparently the bars and dancing are not for their guests, but for those who want to stay elsewhere. After the first hour in the hotel I felt as if we had a target on us from the hotel staff. We were a small group of 30 something year old women trying to have a fun weekend together, and we were treated like we were the wildest party they had ever seen. Which could not be further from the truth. Bottom line, do not go here if you're looking for a good time."
1,"yuck. portions are tiny and food is not fresh.  this place is overpriced as hell and simply do not know how to make poke. if you call putting together some mushy rice and unfresh fish a poke bowl then i guess anyone can make it at home. do not recommend, would not come back."
1,"I would never stay here again; this was probably one of the most disappointing hotel stays I have had. For a place that has been talked up, it was a letdown: No refrigerator in the room, a pervy shower setup, and a generally cold and industrial feel to the entire place. If you are going to charge an arm and a leg, at least get some comfortable beds and pillows. Not sure if they intentionally went for the Fifty Shades feel, but eww."
1,if i could give a negative star i would this has to be the worst Chinese food i have ever eaten. the S&S pork and chicken were like rubber. The something beef was cut the wrong way so it was almost imposable to cut. I learned to clean my plate well not this time nor my wife PS. Chowmein was oily and no flavor
1,"I was excited to visit this place.  I called in early to see if this place was kid friendly for my daughter and the lady I spoke with said it was and that people bring their kids in there all the time.  When we arrived I should have just turned around.  This place was really dirty and it smelt like sewage.  The restaurant was in an old fire station which is a cool idea, but they really should have cleaned it up better.  The staff was nice and the flight of beer I had was good, but this was certainly not a kid friendly place.  The restaurant is not in a safe area.  We went to this place for lunch and I would not recommend anyone going in the evening."
1,"Let me start off by saying that they just lost a potential HUGE corporate client due to their overly sexualized and tacky decor.
  - This is not a place to bring families
  - This is not a place to put up any business clients or anyone you would actually like to make eye contact with in the future

  - This IS a good place if you want to play out a 50 Shades of Gray fantasy

What is so terrible about the room? Well, the art on the walls leaves something to be desired. ""inspirational"" wall art includes silhouettes of naked women with a red (blood looking) liquid surrounding them....yeah really classy. Also, the shower is IN the bedroom. I was sharing the room with my wife so privacy wasn't an issue, however if I was sharing the room with say, my sister or friend I would be mortified to take a shower (which is mostly seethrough)

Horrible decor aside the bed wasn't all that comfy, water glasses did not have plastic or anything else on it to prove that it was clean, and there wasn't a coffee machine in the room. Our room was kind of tucked away but we still heard a good amount of hallway noise (doors unlocking and closing)"
1,"Our ""reserved room"" is really small, claims to fit 4 people.. def would not.. not to mention that the shower is in the middle of the room.. there is no privacy. Looks like a shower in the morning is not happening with my friend and brother in law in the same room. Def not happy with this room"
1,"After reading several bad reviews I wouldn't put this past them. I went in yesterday for new brake pads and some other things. Drove away happy as can be with a lighter wallet. Parked my car and was left stranded in a parking lot. My car wouldn't start at all. I had to get my car towed across town. I called Meineke and Jim, the guy on the phone, wasn't very customer oriented asked if ""when I normally go in to get work done on my car do people mess with other things to mess it up?"" What kind of question is that!!? I just wanted to know if there's a possibility that you guys might have accidentally forgotten to put something back in it's place. He said to get the car towed back, and he would be happy to get it repaired. Uh no! I'm sure you would! I told him I'll figure it out and he responds ""Awesome Sauce!"" Never again using Meineke for anything!"
1,"****SCAM ALERT*****

I used to frequent this Meineke because they used to be honest and not price gougers like so many other auto shops out there. I don't know if they are under new management because they have now become the epitome of fraud and overcharging. 

Took my car in. I already knew what was wrong with it but didn't feel like fixing it myself. Essentially needed a new radiator hose (a $20 part). Meineke looks at it, claims ""air is escaping from the hose"" (yes, that's why I'd like the new radiator hose).....quotes me a ""DEAL"" of $590. I almost had to stop myself from laughing. 

Took the car home and tightened the clamp myself in 30 seconds. Shocker, no more problems. But Meineke would've wanted $600 for 30 seconds of work. 

Sad to see a business fall like this but now they are another greedy auto shop looking to ripoff the consumer. Too bad they just lost several customers permanently by their actions."
1,"My SUV was overheating. Like almost all the way to H, which everyone knows is bad news. I pull into a parking lot and pop the hood and there's a little bit of steaming. Freaked out, I walk to Meineke and ask if someone will check it out. A guy came out and asked me to pull it in so they could do a pressure test. He was like ""Hopefully its just a loose thermostat or hose!"" and therefore gave me hope. I wait as they hook up various machines and test. 20 minutes later the manager trudged up, shows me a vial of green liquid and says, ""Well, did the tests and your head gasket is blown."" !!! I was devastated as he tells me it'll cost over $2,000 to repair. ""Well I don't have that kind of cash right now so I'll have to think about this,"" I tell him. He's like ""Really? Yeah well if you want to sell it to me instead let me know.""

I drive home, scared my engine is about to blow, trying to figure a budget for a new car and stressed out! My neighbor comes over and wants to check it. ""OH...your radiator cap is loose and is spraying water and antifreeze on the engine."" He then proceeds to fill my car with 2 gallons of water and some antifreeze and tightened the cap. PROBLEM SOLVED for less than a meal at Chipotle. My car is running terrific. I know its silly but I'm no mechanic so I rely on others to be honest with me. Sorry but as professional mechanics Meineke should have caught that ridiculously easy problem. Instead now they look like crooks who were trying to convince me of an unnecessary repair that would've cost thousands!!! Avoid!!! You're better off going to Angieslist or Craigslist. Seriously."
1,Why do I even bother.... going to this location. This is probably the worst one out of the whole franchise. Food is typical bar food nothing impressive. Compared to the Pickering location and other locations that have localized special meals/events. Also it's not cool to have kids running around as if it is a playpen.
1,"WORST SERVICE OF LIFE

FIRST AND LAST JACK ASTORS I WILL EVER GO TO

SERVICE 0/5
FOOD 2/5
DECOR 3/5
PRICE 2/5

OVERALL 1/5

I went here for my friend's birthday dinner and everything was going good at first. Service was a bit slow to take our order and get food, but whatever.

They watered down my Mo-star, aka rum and coke, mainly coke. Thanks a lot. And the waitress spilled drinks on my purse and white wool coat. Thanks a lot skank!

The chicken fingers weren't seasoned, sauce was SOOO limey. Shrimp cocktail sauce was awful. Calimari wasn't good either. I don't think they season anything.

I also tried the chicken parm, the pasta tasted like butter and cream. No seasoning what so ever. Have they ever heard of salt and pepper? The basics. duh.


Anyways food was crap, literally. Wasn't worth the $17 tiny pasta.

We wanted to get the bill, asked at 11, got it at 12:30.

I asked 4 different waiters/waitress, they were too busy wiping desks to go to the computer and print a little receipt. NEWSFLASH.....JUST BECAUSE TIP IS ALREADY INCLUDED DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN GIVE US SHIT SERVICE.

I asked to speak to the manager, he said ""sure hold on"" Went to the bar, and avoided our table. This was for a freakin' birthday party with 30 people. You would think you'd care what we had to say or what we wanted.

Then when it was time to bring my friend's birthday cake out, she brought over 20 candles, the staff only put one in. They didn't even give us back the unused candles, they kept it until i asked where it was.

My friend asked why they didn't stick 20 candles in and the waitress said, ""we just didn't have time"" UM your restaurant is empty...

All in all

MANAGER SUCKS, WAITRESSES SUCK, SERVICE IS BEYOND SLOW, FOOD IS UNFLAVORED, DRINKS ARE WATERED DOWN.

FIRST AND LAST JACK ASTORS I WILL EVER GO TO

SERVICE 0/5

1,"If I could give Meineke ZERO stars I totally would because they are sharks!.  So I hit a curb (this is a regular occurance I don't know why) and I needed to get a front end alignment so I thought.  I brought my car to this Meineke because it was close to my house and driving was getting pretty difficult.  When I called before I went over there I asked how much the alignment was and it was in the ball park of $90.  Ok, sweeet!

No, not sweet.  Sour.

They said it would take 2 hours JUST TO LOOK AT.  So I went over to Bilbo's and hung out there for a while.  Exactly two hours on the dot they call me to go back to Meineke.  They gave me an estimate of $1400 (no effing way) and said that my car was basically going to explode on me if I don't get the 4 things I needed fixed.  I was told that it was ""unsafe and possibly dangerous"" to drive my car.  Needless to say I didn't have $1400 on me, or even the ""minimum"" amount of what they were going to do which was $600.  I went home deflated :(

Then my friend suggested Ted Wiens (who I will write another awesome yelp review about).....AND HOLY BANANAS WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Ted Wiens had my car up on their lot in like 45 minutes and was looking at it.  They even brought me out there to show me what was wrong (bent tire rod).  He said it will be like 2 hours to fix and the grand total?  $285.  Yes.  For Everything.  When I asked the guy about all the crap Meineke said I needed he literally said this: ""What?  Are you kidding?  Those A**holes have no idea what they are doing.:""  He then proceeded to show me EVERY part on my car that Meineke said was ""so totally badly and completely damaged and unsafe"" and they were all fine.  Normal wear and tear.  No need to replace.  

I think I hugged him.

Anyway I just want everyone to know to NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER in your life use this Meineke, they will try to get you to spend unnecessary money!"
1,"Very short visit. Walked in at 5:38, walked out at 5:52..no server came to our table with many walking about attending to other tables. Very disappointed. Was excited about having dinner here but mood was completely ruined. Not recommended.."
1,"PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME, MONEY AND DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!  

So I came here because I did not want the hassle to go to my dealership and drive an extra 15 minutes ... BIG MISTAKE!!, I parked in front of one of the open doors thinking Somebody will approach me since I have an appointment and they don't seem busy...They didn't! Instead I hear this car behind me honking like the World is about to end, I'm assuming he is honking because he is trying to get in, I'm thinking he is a customer thinking I'm trying to take his spot but NO it was an EMPLOYEE! 
He kept honking for about 3 minutes, let me add the fact that my husband is behind me and is a DISABLE VETERAN, this kind of loud noises don't bring good memories to him so Of course this did not set well with him, we go inside to tell whoever is there  about what happened and he proceeds to say ""who parks in an open door Blocking the entrance and this is not a quick shop that we should Go to a cheap quick lube and all non sense stuff while raising his voice"" at this point I'm just speechless that instead of offering an apology about the lack of COSTUMER SERVICE of his people he decided to insult us and denigrate small shops, and yeah I should have gone to a small quick lube because I'm sure ANYWHERE else is better than the ""service"" they can provide."
1,"I will give this place 0 star if this review has an option for 0. Worst servers and customer service ever! I will never come back to this place. I went here with my coworkers and they sat us by the pathway and each of the servers who passed by had no consideration whatsoever and kept bumping on my chair. When I told one of the servers to tell the others to be careful, one of the servers girl just said ""well this is the pathway for the servers, we can't do anything"" and walk away. Talk about RUDE!! And one of the guy servers also was no help and added on top ""it's our pathway"" and walk away as well. All the other servers also just stood on one side and looked at me while gossiping I cannot believe it. If I weren't there with my coworkers I would have left already! Unbelievable!"
1,"Took my girlfriend here for her 21st birthday midnight drink.  the bartender, takes her id, checks his watch, and just gives it back.  he obviously knew it was her birthday, he could have at least said happy birthday.  

not only that the place was empty, boring, and obviously the bartender was rude.  wont be going back for sure."
1,Surprised this is a  Marriott hotel the way its run hard to tell tub is leaking  and my finance  fell after I called house keeping several times   Then I wanted to check out after Pre paid 6 days checked out 4 days they wanted to charge my card more and not show me my bill print out of room charges told me accounting was closed wanted to charge me additional 400
1,"Update to my review. I recently had bad service experience at the bar and the manager didn't help at all. I feel sad that this place it used to be nice and enjoyed going there every weekend. I  saw other customers had bad experience but I didn't know the details but after what I  experienced, I feel bad for them too. I am not going to go there anymore because I feel it will be a waste of money."
1,"Their website mentions that ""all of their washes are 100% hand washed"". I visited the location on Litchfield and Indian School. I ordered a mid-priced wash. I noticed that my truck was heading into a tunnel and scrubber like the one mentioned below. This text was taken from their website as of 4/8/14.

 ""All of our washes are 100% hand wash. We do not have any equipment that touches the vehicle inside our tunnel. We use lamb wool mitts to soap up the vehicle and our conveyor belt allows the vehicles to glide through on our track"".

""The Classic Car Spa 100% HAND CAR WASH concept grew out of a desire to provide a very clean car wash and to do it with care. The process allows for an exceptional wash and eliminates the problems caused by the rough scrubbing of heavy equipment and high pressure impellers"".

I find the website to be misleading. I wont be going to this car wash anymore. I didn't go to this location because it's inexpensive,I went to this location because I thought I was going to get a hand wash. I will tell everyone I know to stay away from this place.
 
If I could give them -stars I would."
1,"Worst customer service! Just brought my car in to have a problem looked at and was told it needs to be dropped off, I said that's fine, but I'll have to wait for it. He said it will be 4 or 5 hours, I said that's fine, I don't mind waiting. He said may not even be today. Again I don't mind waiting. Why not offer to make me an appointment so I could come back instead of rudely turning me away.They just lost all my auto business."
1,This place is a joke. I got 'black listed' by Robert who is the owner/manager because I asked for a refund on services I paid for but didn't receive.
1,Came for a car wash. Closed but no sign saying that. Just some old lady smoking at the entrance door. And the other women working there saying they are closed but will open tomorrow and just seemed consisted...
1,"If I could give this no star at all I would! I had three business guests stay at this hotel. They should have all been charged to our company card and instead they charged one of the guests for their stay and to boot it was the wrong amount. Now I am trying to clean it up; getting ahold of someone is nearly impossible. When I first called the hotel the person said I needed to talk to someone else and they gave me a number, that person said they couldn't help me, I needed to talk to the hotel. I have been hung up on, told I was going to receive folios and they never arrive. Finally talked to the manager and she sent me the folios, but one was duplicate and now I am on hold AGAIN for currently nearly 10 minutes and counting (very common for this hotel no matter what you want to do!). This hotel needs some MAJOR admin help!!!! I will NEVER stay here nor will I ever send one of our guests here."
1,"awful experience. They changed me $900.00 for two brakes, draining the brake fluid and a rodar. I don't know much about cars and I know most mechanics are scammers but at least do the job good!! They said they would have my car done, I went to go pick it up and they said they had a bad part and had to redo the entire job. Then I finally got my car back and usually when I get my brakes done they are very sensitive. I can barely push on them and they brake, after taking my car to meinke I paid $900 and have to push the brake petal all the way to the floor for my car to brake. It's not sensitive at all and feels like they didn't even do anything at all. They honestly probably sprayed something on my brakes and pocketed the money! I'm upset they didn't even do a good job, I don't even feel safe driving my car so I took it to a different place that won't screw me over. Do NOT GO HERE!! They'll just suck you dry for every penny they can, then they do a half asked job. Save your money!! I would give them zero stars if I could. Oh and you probably think I have an expensive car, I drive a 2004 Infiniti g35 and it's an R title (meaning reconstructed). Very old, inexpensive car, it was my first car. Meinke is such a joke, I have no problem paying just don't fuck me over and do a shit job!"
1,"WARNING: if you must have poke, I strongly suggest going to Seoul Poke Bowl or even driving a little further out to the new Umami Pokerito in Pineville (which btw is amazing). This place is seriously so bad I wish I could give it 0 stars! 

If you feel like paying $14 for a tiny ass bowl of mushy gross rice and mediocre fish (see my pics), then this is the place for you! 

I weigh just over 100 lbs and I ordered the ""large"" poke bowl. I left the restaurant feeling like I didn't eat at all. We also ordered the poke nachos or whatever. If you want heart or kidney failure from sodium overdose, then this is the dish for you! The chips were SO salty and over seasoned with sauce that you can barely taste the fish. It felt so unhealthy. It's probably because they want to cover smell of the fish thats not fresh? Idk but it was so bad that I had to tell one of the waiters that it is too salty. He took it back and brought out another one that was the EXACT same thing that we just had. WTF? 

Anyways the conclusion is that this place is pretty damn terrible lol. Maybe they think most people that come here don't know the concept of Poke and therefore will be fooled into buying their vastly overpriced disgusting tasting food?? who knows. I've been to places in Manhattan that give you way more food that's more fresh and cheaper!"
1,"They lost me at $50 Oil Change. ..I went in for an oil change....price listed on their services menu at $29.99. Fine. But when I paid it was almost $50. Add on costs- $5 for ""parts"" and another $10 for ""labor."" Then there is an addional Disposal Fee as well as taxes. What exactly is included I  the $29.99 Oil Change? Obvioisly not parts and labor. And it took an hour and a half for them to do a simple oil change...on a Wednesday. Give me a break. I will never be back."
1,"WORST. CARWASH. EVER.
Save your time and your money-- this place will rip them both off.   Took 5 hours for a ""detail.""  I was never called me when my car was done, and there was dried soap on the wheels, the coffee spills on the dash were still there, vacuum job was terrible, mirrors and chrome spotty but worst of all they scratched the tint on the inside of the window and would not take responsibility for it.  Will tell everyone I know to AVOID this place. If I could leave negative stars I would. So disappointed.  THIS PLACE IS A SCAM!"
1,"Arrived at 7:45am to just get an oil change.

2 cars in the bays and NO other cars in the parking lot.

2 guys just sitting in the office, one of which was the manager.

I inquired about a quick oil change since they weren't busy.

Manager proceeds to inform me I can drop it off and they would work it in at some point during the day, but no way they could get to my truck right now because they were booked up.

I chose to sit in my truck write this review....during which time only one tech was working in the bay and the manager walked around with his coffee cutting up with the other 2 techs.

GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE MEINEKE.....I wish a keyboard had a set of sarcasm italics.

The manager did make the suggestion as I was leaving to go next door to Terrible's and get an oil change because that was all they do and they could get me in and out quick."
1,"My wife and I used to go often as we enjoyed certain items. Apple pie, Spring Rolls, steak and baked potatoes . Really nice deserts. The salads used to be nice. Gone are the pie, rolls,baked potatoes.now it's just a common bar and taking most things off the menu. We will probable eat further out as the menu is more expensive with smaller portions.

We returned last night for the last time. 
We found they have also taken off the Steak Fajitas, Beef Dip and Salmon. 
We went over the menu for 20 minutes with the poor waitress as there was nothing left we liked to order. I settled for the Chicken Wings that were good but I would have gone to Swiss Chalet forChicken or Mammas pizza for Pizza.
Even the deserts are minimal. Cookies ?
Well , It's Joeys. If we can get in."
1,"My first experience as a 21 year old was at this bar, unfortunately.  I cannot believe how rude the bartender was!!! I had  literally just turned 21 and I wanted to order my first drink as an adult, yadda yadda yadda. 

So I go up the the bartender a bald, African American gentleman. He seems to be in a very blasé mood already. He hardly speaks to our group, we seemed to be annoying him even though our group is very mellow. I don't think he even asks me what I want but more so stares at me until I order. I order my drink, asks for my ID looks at his watch (t make sure I'm officially 21) and leaves and comes back with my drink. Silent. 

Look, I am not expecting a birthday committee to come and sing me happy birthday but holy hell, just a simple smile and ""happy birthday"" would suffice. I mean it's VEGAS! People are creating memories here and that moment of my first drink can not ever be replicated.

Come on MGM, get your staff together!"
1,"EXTREMELY BAD customer service. I decided to order food from the late night Menu. I then called Sabra from the restaurant and she had a horrible attitude. She questioned me about my burnt food that I ordered from room service and she had someone come up and check it to ""make sure I took only one bite"". She talked down to me as if I lived on the streets. I told her to not call back after I sent the food down and she continued calling anyways as if my request did not apply to her. Wether you are a CEO, a bum or LeBron no one should be talked down to. If she were one of my employees she would be fired immediately. Never coming back here EVER. I'm a business owner and I understand how customer service works and this makes the hotel look more like a 1 star motel. I hope the calls are recorded and monitored."
1,"I've been here before they did the renovation and after they did it. The attitude here just completely changed after they did the renovation and the waiters think they are hot stuff and that you should be honored to be eating in there. Well. I went here with a couple of friends for lunch and requested a table where we could watch some tv. So of course they throw us somewhere where the view is terrible and I make them move us to another table. Oh. The place is not packed at all. It's about 1/4 full. 

Well. We start looking over the menu and the smoke alarm starts beeping. Except that there is no smoke. So they just leave it and let it keep beeping. The noise got so annoying that I asked our waiter if he could do something about it. He looks at me and says ""What? You don't like our music?"" while continuing to stare me down after his smart ass remark. So of course I say, ""Ya. Very funny. Seriously. Unplug it like any normal person would do because there's obviously no f@#(*!g smoke."" Yes. I am pissed. He gives me a look and walks away. The noise continues to beep and other customers are starting to complain. At this point, we've had enough and just leave."
1,"Terrible! Most of the time I come here they do an average job, never a good job. Typically the windows are covered in a film but the body is not to bad. Today however was the worst. The entire body didn't even look like it had been sprayed with water. When I pointed it out they proceeded to wipe down the entire vehicle using a spray bottle and rag. The supervisor was right there and didn't even bother to apologize for the poor job that was done."
1,"I am so disappointed, when I stopped I asked if it would be quick and if not I would come back another time. With three kids under four in tow and a promise of quick service, we went inside, only to be told 1/2 hour later that the lube guy was on a break and they hadn't even started. One guy felt bad for me and offered me water, another guy turned on ""cartoons"" that were inappropriate for my babies so we spent our time trying to steer clear of the tv. 
Over an hour later, I went to the front to ask them to check on the car and it was only then that they brought the paperwork up. I asked for a discount for the extra wait, but after waiting five minutes for the manager to even respond to their call about it, I paid and left in frustration. 
I expect honesty from businesses. If they had told me an hour and a half, i would have come back another day. If there had been anyone ahead of me in line, I wouldn't have gone. If someone lies to get me in I don't want to know what else they will do to my car. I will never go back."
1,"I finally got an email response from Mike Grimes the General Manager for Classic Car Wash. His attitude in his response reflected the general attitude of everyone involved with my hapless patronage of this ""wannabee"" carwash facility. For clarity purposes I'm posting my initial email to them sent on Friday a.m. I didn't receive any response from anyone until 10:30 p.m. Saturday night:

My email to Classic on Friday 4/15 at 10:07 a.m.

To Whom It May Concern,

I got my car washed today at the 1555 W. Warner Rd. location. I have used them many times before and have never had any issue. Today was a different story.

When I brought my car in the service advisor, Dale Collins greeted me pleasantly and kept pushing me to upgrade from my Supreme Wash to a special they were doing. Being in sales I don't begrudge anyone trying to up-sell their services. However he paid no attention to my needs and seemed to be only concerned with his i.e. getting a bigger ticket. I asked him to address a spill in the middle console drink area of my car and he said he would take care of it. According to Alex, the manager, that wasn't even put on the ticket. 

When my car was ready I walked around it briefly and to my shock and surprise, I saw places that were easily cleaned that had spots of trash still remaining. I drive a 2009 Prius and I keep it pretty clean. Long story short I had to grab a rag myself and clean off some of the more noticeable areas of my car. 

I paid $24.99 to have you guys clean my car. This was literally the worst car wash I have ever experienced. If I wanted to clean it myself I would have. 

I have attached some photos of the areas that your people missed on my car. 

I called in to the store after leaving and spoke to Alex. He lamented the fact that I didn't get a manager while I was there. I told him I had to go to work and was rushed. He did indicate a willingness to address the problems if I were to bring the car back to them. 

I don't know what quality controls you have in place for your store but whatever they are, they are simply not working. My time is extremely valuable. I paid good money to get my car clean THE FIRST TIME. I don't have time or energy to try to ""get it right"" working with lackadaisical service. 

I thought you'd like to know of my extreme displeasure working with your store there on W. Warner Rd. This is the first time I've had a problem with your store and will more than likely be the last time.

My Car# was 108 and I got that done this a.m. 4/15/11. Sale # 52385024003

You can call me at the number in my signature line if you'd like to discuss my issue. 

Respectfully,

Doug Shields

The following was Mike Grime's response to my email sent Saturday at 10:53 p.m.:

Hi Doug, 

my name is Mike Grimes and I am the general manager for Classic Car Spa. I read your email and my typical response would be as follows. I apologize for not meeting your expectations with your wash today. We strive to meet and exceed our customer expectations on a daily basis. Our customers satisfaction is obviously our top priority. I spoke to Alex at the site. He assured me that he apologized to you and offered to rewash the vehicle for you at any time you desire and remove the road tar from your vehicle that is not included in any wash we offer. However, since you took your obviously valuable time to insult my employees on yelp.com by calling them monkeys, I will simply say that you are not welcome at any of my locations at any time. I have flagged your license plate number in our  system for any associate of mine to contact me if you show up on any of our properties. Find another hard working car wash crew to insult. If you desire to speak to me by phone please contact the corporate office and I assure you I will return your call immediately. 

Sincerely, 
Mike Grimes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously these folks have some serious issues and besides shoddy and mediocre work, a bad attitude is the main one. As any leadership or business class will teach the quality of the service of a company comes from the top down. In this case I can see why the customer wasn't served judging from the manager's response. As an aside I will say that road tar wasn't an issue on my car as he tried to indicate. It was simply dirt that they neglected to wash off of my car. I will also say that I was NOT told that I could bring my car back anytime. Alex tried to get me to bring my car immediately back in and when I couldn't he asked me what time I got off work. He never told me that I could bring my car back in ""ANYTIME"" and get a free wash. If he HAD told me that then none of this would have been posted to begin with and Classic might have kept me as a customer.

I don't need to say anymore here folks. You were warned."
1,"Bad slow service. When you order a meal that comes with multiple items, you literally have to ask for the rest of your meal, when your combo comes with a drink, they do not give it to you, your have to tell them that you actually WANT your drink that you paid for. My friend who ordered before me asked for a glass of water, instead of charging her, she charged me, even though she knew we were paying separately. When I questioned the cashier/server, she acted like my concern about being charged for someone else's food was an inconvenience for her and would not make it right. 
So basically they try to rip you off in any way possible. 
On a sanitary note, no gloves worn and they handle the money and make the food without washing their hands. My suggestion is STAY AWAY!"
1,"I just moved to Arizona and didn't know my way around so I decided to go to here to get my car washed. 

I gave one star just because I felt really bad for the workers here, considering it was 110 degrees and they were working as sweat was dripping from their face. 

Now let's get to the point: 

Pros:  
Fast service (20-30 mins) 


Cons: 
water spots all over the car. 

Dried Soap still on the rear bumper and trunk lid

Glass was only cleaned from outside 

Rear mats were placed on the wrong sides and were not secured 

They forgot to vacuum under rear mats  

There was weird smell after I got in the car. Idk if it was dirty towels they used or their sweaty shirts 



Personally I do not recommend this car wash. I could've washed my car better at home."
1,"THEY ARE SCAMM!!!! They told me I needed new brakes after an inspection. The person they have call you to tell you you need certain things done to your vehicle just sounded shady the way he was explaining thing. His voice would taper off after each thing he would mention that needed work and he was almost whispering into the phone. After I question him about the work he said they needed to do to my rotor I questioned what he meant and he was very vague. When I went back to get my truck I told him $800 was outrageous. Then the guy at the desk said oh I'm sure I can do better then that price. Then he says oh he has you down for a brake flush you don't need that. I refused the service and got my keys back. My truck has only 54,000 miles on it.  

2 months go by and I get my brakes checked again at a different place they tell me my front brakes still have 50% left and my back brakes still have 30% left. 

Plain and simple these guys want your money and that's all they care about. I hope they go out of business. They are clearly working together to rip you guys off. STAY AWAY!!!! 

Update!! 
13,000 miles later and I'm still using the brake pads they said needed to be changed so bad. 

DO NOT GIVE THEM BUSINESS"
1,"If I could give this place a -5 stars I certainly would!The management here are a bunch of liars and crooks!So much so that they have been made my special project!They had my Dodge from 12p-5:30p.I left it with my last words being ""take all the time you need,just do it right"".Well,if by ""doing it right"" means that I got my truck back still dirty and with broken peices of interior molding,then yeah they did okey dokey.After a bunch of back n forth about their responsabilities for my broken parts,daryle finally agreed to pay.He also offered a couple of free car washes.As if I would ever trust anything of mine in this outfits care again.So,after waiting for several weeks for a return call on when the repairs can be madeI called and was informed that the parts would not be replaced.So now I have to go get a lawyer.Thanks classic car spa.If you know whats good for you then you and yours would steer clear of this outfit."
1,"Where oh where do I begin?I guess at the beginning.Yes,my interaction with this business is turning into a saga.I was looking for a car wash business that would clean my headliner.A coworker told me that I could take my car here and it would be in ""good hands"".Let me first start by saying that we have differant veiws on what good is.I pulled up to the spa and asked for ""ben"".(I type his name in lower case out of lack of respect.As he is a liar!)I asked if they cleaned headliners.He stated that they only service certain types of headliners.So I asked if he could check mine out to see if it qualified.He came out and inspected it and informed me that this headliner could indeed be cleaned.So without further hesitation I purchased the $100 detail package.I brought the truck in the following sunday at 12:01pm.Dropped it off and told ben to take all the time he needs.I just want it done right.I get a call around 5:30 that its done.Again,I dont care how long it takes.I dont want time crunch to be an excuse for poor performance.When I get there I can see plenty of armour all on the tires.So it looks good so far....from a distance.When I get inside I find broken peices of molding in the front and back!I wont even gripe about the puddles of armourall and the poor vacuuming job and the seats having water stains all over them.Alot of which came from the shampooer splattering everywhere.And when I look up to see how well they did on the headliner.....it hadnt even been touched!And indeed it was dirtier than when I brought it in!There were black greasy specks sprinkled all over the headliner!So,I ask for management while this illegal alein is scrubbing at stuff.He informs me that I have to wait for jackie to show up the next day and talk to her.I do.And we schedule an appointment to have things looked at to see what can be resolved.Then she calls the day before the appointment at closing time to reschedule for her a day off.I reluctantly agree.So my wife drops it off this moring with quotes from the dealership down at dodge.They tell my wife that they arent going to pay for the repairs to one panel and that they will need to discuss the back panel.Their worker broke BOTH panels!So I called and was told by darrel or doug or whatever the weasels name is that they arent paying for my repairs because ""I sent my wife to negotiate""!I mean can you believe that?!As this man doesnt know how to behave honorably when talking to women?!If its a woman then he just runs over her rough shaud!I then informed him that he will be hearing from my lawyer.To which he said ""thats fine"" and I hung up.I then got on here to read reveiws and am glad I did.They wont only be losing my business but also the business of whom I work who regularly has a fleet of trucks they clean.And that doesnt seem to bother the manager at all.So I dont see this place staying in business if this is how they operate.They are NOT to be trusted with expensive vehicles.I wouldnt trust these people with my bycycle!There are plenty of other places to go.Guess I will see if Francis and Sons are any better.Anyways,I started a yelp account just so I could warn my fellow citizens of this place and its staff.Stear clear if you like your car."
1,"Close to home....but would never recommend.  Went there today and watched my car dry itself for 25 minutes.  Asked for a refund and was told by the attendant someone had dried it.  Since I was sitting outside the whole time, I had a visual and told him that did not happen.  Asked for a refund and he couldn't do it because I had used a cc....went inside, spoke to the manager who seemed to care less.  Told her I thought it was awful that no one apologized, just gave excuses.  Guess what, then she said I'm sorry.  Terrible, terrible, terrible!"
1,"If there were a zero star, I would give this place a zero. The clerk, Chris, lied to my face & bullied me when I called him out for his lies. I posted to their website how displeased I was with my treatment there so the manager called me to offer an apology. While apologizing, the manager laughed at me. That certainly was an apology fail. They both were disrespectful of me as a customer & a woman. I didn't let them oppress me. I stood up, unflinching & insisted that they be accountable for both of their disrespect. Don't go there. JERKS"
1,"First of all, let me say that this review is for service and not for the beer or food truck. My husband and I drove an hour from Morgantown to try out Voodoo, because we had heard awesome things. We also called before we made the trip there and asked if we were allowed to bring in outside food, and they said that was fine. So, we get to Voodoo with our Thai food and were immediately approached by one of the men from behind the bar. He told us that because of the food truck parked outside, we had to leave and couldn't eat our food inside. We said that we had called and were told that we could bring our own food, but he unapologetically and rudely told us that we would need to leave if we had food. I understand that they are running a business, but there were less than ten people in the entire bar. Tell us that you can make an exception but that if we come in the future, to not bring food. Give us suggestions of where we can go with our food, so that we can eat and then come back. Tell us that if we buy something from the food truck, we can stay and eat our other food as well. Be APOLOGETIC, at least. We were there to pay for lots of beer and have a good night...but I guess buying food from their truck was more important. We ate our food in our car and found a cooler, less pretentious brewery to go to instead."
1,Thanks but no thanks! I got my car washed by these monkeys this morning. My car came out just as dirty as it went in except that I was 25.00 poorer than I was before! The service writer was more interested in getting an upsell on the ticket than what I was requesting to be cleaned. I had to spend five minutes with a rag wiping my card down after the guy told me it was ready. Called in to the manager and he pretty much berated me for leaving but I had to get to work. I had wasted enough time trying to get a decent car wash from these guys. Stay away...far away!
1,"Horrible service from cashier,  nothing but attitude.  I would not return here because of the service. The server girl was very nice an attentive however the cashier girl, pish that's another story. She got mad because I gave her a 5 dollar bill then I said I have the $2.25 instead. She said you gave me a 5, i said give me back my 5 and ill give you $2.25. I had my hand out for my change and she threw it on the counter.  Rude, rude, rude! Mary Ann if you are reading this, you need an attitude adjustment and a math course if you don't know how to take away $2.25 from $2.14 then girlllll, you need to go back to school stop letting the cash register do it for you."
1,"Felt like I had to report this. Went to the counter with a few of my friends (Asian males, late 20's).  Bartender (White male, mid 40's, beer belly) saw us (made eye contact) but ignored us.  We waited patiently for some time to be asked for our order. Never happened.  New patrons came in some time after and were serviced immediately. Confusing isn't it."
1,"Let me first say that I went to this location after it had been specifically recommended as doing the best work in town.... can't even begin to say how disappointed I am.
The young man who greeted me was very personable but, I found out later, unfortunately not knowledgable about the products or services accessible to the customers.  Nonetheless, I payed $299.99 to have what they called the showroom treatment for my vehicle.   That means spotless, perfect in every way except obviously for preexisting paint, body and glass damages.  Was told I would not believe how good my car would look and that the paint would feel as smooth as butter and that the build up that had accumulated over the last six months would be completely taken care of.  Well, as one would say, my car looks goof from afar and that stops there.  
- The paint has plenty of spots where it feels rough (not from old damaged paint but from what they defined as overspray).  A clay bar was supposed to be used.  I'm sure it was... just not everywhere it needed
-They were supposed to use only top of the line professional grade products from Meguiar's.  That's what I've used for years when I take care of my vehicles.  Turns out there in the process of going to these products, so I got leftovers I was specifically told were being given to employees because they needed to get rid of them.
- It was not buffed enough or evenly.  So, you can still see the products they used, finger and hand prints, smudges and swirls.
- The windows and mirrors were not cleaned with streaks or swirls free products or clean .  Many were  clearly visible just standing next to the car.  They were even worse when I drove into the sun to get home.
- Was told by greeter/salesperson who tells you what you need for the results you expect that mire Giovanna rims would look spotless and that the gunk accumulated inside the rims would be taken care of.  No such luck.  Was later told by supervisor, it could not be done because of safety reasons and injury prevention.  Isn't it funny, I've done this clean up myself multiple times without any issue, damage physical or otherwise.  It only took time and patience.
- The carpet cleaning left multiple spot in place.  I could forego that detail if it weren't for the cost and the statement of absolute quality like,,, ""you would believe how good your car will look.  Just like the showroom.""
- The cargo area cover was not cleaned (not that it needed a lot of it to begin with).  Some product was put on it so that it no longer is gripping the cargo it suppose to hold in place.  Now, everything slides.  Can only guess that they used some Armor All type of products.
- The entire process was supposed to take 2 hours.  It took almost 3.  That I could live with without any issues if the services delivered were up to what was sold and expected.
- They used glossy products on my leather seats, doors in other interior parts.  Really?!?  Now, I have to clean up every bit of the interior of my car and hope the professional grade products I use will help the leather recover their elasticity and natural shine.

Last but not least, I heard the manager say: ""No tips?!?' in an unbelievable tome, when I got in my car to leave.  Wow, I did not know one got tips based on poor performance.  I must be old fashioned and out of touch with the world.

Anyway,  I would not recommend them for any type of service.  If  $299.99 doesn't buy quality services then I can't imagine what less will...

Too bad.   I don't believe the individuals that work on my car were trying to do a bad job.  They were either not trained properly or are only doing what is asked of them which is definitely not enough too meet expectations of showroom quality.  A waste of time and money."
1,"I too, came here, for some needed services (tires). I cannot believe I ended up at this hell hole!!! I needed some tires, had appt, when I showed up I ended up having to stand outside (it was 117) with my 6 year old daughter and her 8 year old friend!!! For soooo long!!! I cannot even begin to tell you how hot it was and the girls were just wilting....I was so unimpressed, overheating, I cannot express how angry I was at this Meineke shop, and how full of bull they were!!! I swore when I left there I would tell everyone about my horrible experience, hence, yelp. 
My husband had to drive across town with our baby to pick us all up, it was truly a nightmare...however, we left here and went to discount tire by this place, it was soo soo soo nice. They gave us water and told us to come in and sit, so yes i did  get 2 sets of tires (for 2 cars at discount tire)...Meinieke......F that whole place and the owners!!! Maybe this place has new owners and does not make clients stand outside for 2 hours in 117 degrees!"
1,"THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!! 

They told me I needed new brakes after an inspection. The person they have call you to tell you you need certain things done to your vehicle just sounded shady the way he was explaining things. His voice would taper off after each thing he would mention that needed work and he was almost whispering into the phone. After I question him about the work he said they needed to do to my rotor I questioned what he meant and he was very vague. When I went back to get my truck I told him $800 was outrageous. Then the guy at the desk said oh I'm sure I can do better then that price. Then he says oh he has you down for a brake flush you don't need that. I refused the service and got my keys back. My truck has only 54,000 miles on it.  

2 months go by and I get my brakes checked again at a different place they tell me my front brakes still have 50% left and my back brakes still have 30% left. 

Plain and simple these guys want your money and that's all they care about. I hope they go out of business. They are clearly working together to rip you guys off. STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,"Usually have a mediocre service experience  but today was unacceptable. Asked for a particular wash was told that there was a special on the ultimate regularly $49.99. The special between an in house coupon $10 and a groupon discount would be $23.00. So went for it   Well got the $10 but no such discount on groupon  the cashier, young guy was rude, arrogant and unhelpful. Tossed him the $39 and will no longer use them. One of the employees tried to sell me a new windshield. The car is two months old and there was one tiny spot not worth talking about. Then after I left I stopped at a store checked the hatch area and they didn't even clean / vacuum it.  Spend between $30-$50 every two weeks. Just lost a long time customer due to lies, inappropriate practices and lack of customer service. Suggest you think twice on using Classic Car Spa for your car needs on Val Vista in Gilbert"
1,"Everyone please beware workers there steal from your car!!!!!
My family would take all of our cars there to get washed but we will NEVER go back again and I will tell everyone I can to not go there! My brother who is a U.S. Marine gave my mom this beautiful necklace that he had engraved "" thank you for always supporting me MOM"" that was stolen out of her car by one of the employees there!! If it was a random necklace I would say no big deal it can be replaced. But this was a priceless possession for her as my brother gave it to her after his boot camp graduation. I just want the person that works there that stole the necklace to know you stole a gift from a young man that is doing his part to help protect you and your freedom here in this country!!!"
1,"I will never go back to this place again as long as the front desk guy Jim is working there. What a sarcastic, money hungry, unprofessional human being. 
The first incident happened when my husband took our car in for a basic oil and  filter change, and the guy Jim recommended we get a fuel system cleaning also. He makes us feel pressured to purchase these extra services, as I understand this is there job but it's only a recommendation. We shouldn't feel forced or obligated. My husband knows how to do basic maintenance on cars but doesn't have the time, so my husband told him, ""no thanks"" and that he can do it himself later. Jim sarcastically tells him, ""well maybe u should do your oil change yourself too"".  How unprofessional. Like, Really?? He than asks my husband where do we get our car service done because from what he sees in the computer you only come in to do oil changes. First of all that's none of his business. We're coming in for an oil service and not an interrogation. We didn't do the service because they didn't have the filter in stock so we rescheduled for another time. 
2 weeks later we come in for our scheduled appt for the oil and filter change that we didn't have done the first time. My husband walks in and says ""hi, I have an appt for an oil change"". This same guy Jim, once again comes out with a sarcastic remark, ""yah, that's what they all come in for"". My husband just brushes it off once again, not understanding what this guys problem was. So he lets Jim know that we have a coupon for $19.95 oil change. And that we bought our own filter from our dealership, since they're always out of stock. This guy says they can't use ""our"" filter unless we bring in or own oil. Because they can only use all of our parts or all of there parts. Not half and half. To me this didn't make any sense. From a $19.95 coupon he says it's gonna cost us $45 to change our filter and oil change. My husband ended up telling him no thank you and walked out. He decided to keep pushing his sarcasm ness as my husband walked out. 
  In the end, We called another meineke and they had no problem using our filter that we purchased from the dealership. Actually they didn't have the filter in stock so it was a win win situation for both of us. 
The sad thing is the mechanics at this location are good and do great work but this guy Jim is such an unprofessional worker. Because of him Meineke on Blue diamond will never have our business again. I will make sure I spread the word to my entire family and friends. My husband has all the patience and always has a  positive outlook, so for him to be upset means this guy really pushed his limits. 
The Meineke location on Serene and Spencer did an excellent job and had A+++ customer service."
1,Gross!! I tried it cuz I woke across the street but OMG... dry ass food... I wanted to puke!!
1,"I can't explain how bad this wash was...first off had a coupon for 4 dollars off, turn around and they bump up price a dollar for large vehicle. I drive a buick encore...probably smaller than most sedans. There was no one in line waiting for vacuum or on back side for drying. The seats were never vacuumed, the car mats were not put back properly. The dash, door panels and center console were not touched at all and to top it off the wash was horrible. I left and will never return. I also let some buddies of mine know who go through the cheap 5 dollar wash a couple times a week for uber  not to return."
1,We love Barros!! Usually go to other locations around the valley but decided to go to the one on Ray because of where we were at. Great service!! Lady was extremely nice! However this location is the dirtiest I have ever seen at barros. We were the only 6 people in the restaurant and very few tables were available that were clean! This restaurant really needs to clean up. Asked for them to clean a table and 15 minutes later a worker came to wipe down our table! Please clean up!!
1,"I ordered two kids meals online and was told 25 minutes for pick up. I show up 25 minutes later and I am told my order is not ready and it would be another 10 minutes because it is in the oven. No problem, I can understand an extra 10 minutes. After 20 minutes I ask about my order again and get told it will be another two minutes in the oven. So if it's been 20 minutes already that my order is supposedly in the oven, I'm pretty sure it is burnt by this point if that is the truth of the status of my order. This was for a kids spaghetti and meatballs and a kids pepperoni garlic bread. They did offer to give me a free 2 L of soda, that was ridiculous. I waited for five more minutes and then requested my money back and as soon as I did, magically my order was ready. I took the refund and the food, but I will never return. Not once did the manager talk to me. This was a horrible experience."
1,Funny how this car wash claim that Yelp hides their good reviews wow you know your service is bad when you go that low.  By the way your service does straight up suck you like to collect the CASH CHECK AND VISA but not hold up your end of the work. Recently I had my oil change done there and these guys screwed the bolt for oil engine by hand good thing I caught that in time otherwise I would of had a serious problem.  All I have to say is that your service there is terrible and I will not be coming there ever again and I will definitely spread the word as well go ahead and keep blaming YELP because your incompetent eventually you will run out of excuses and karma will come back.  Once again your service could caused me serious damage definitely I can say it's the worse ever NOT TO SCREW IN A BOLT AFTER AN OIL CHANGE.  I WOULD'T TRUST THIS PLACE TO VACCUM MY VEHICLE LET ALONE DO ANYTHING ELSE.  BY THE WAY I LIKE YOUR WINDSHILD REPLACEMENT SIGN YOU HAVE UP WHEN CUSTOMERS PULL UP CRACKED WINDSHILED===============================$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!!!
1,"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return."
1,"I have been here a few times for carwashes. 2x for oilchanges. Here is what I take away from my experiences:


Anyone can have a bad day, and I am pretty easy going most of the time, but, this place is unorganized. That's why you're there so long. Nobody knows who is doing what? I was greeted by a kid with a mouth full of food.

Car Wash- how do you mess this up? I'll tell you... But standing on the seat, and the armrest of the open door to reach the top of the truck. When he did this he separated the vinyl from my door. 

Oil Change- 2 hours. I get my van back, with oil spilled all over the side, on my bumper, and the steering wheel and door handles are slick with oil and grime. And no reminder sticker of the next change. I don't even know if he put synthetic in. 

I give praise when it is due, but I will definitely help others stay away of an outfit that is unfit."
1,No need to be so unfriendly (!) on the phone when people call to see if you have room! You are in the service industry after all in case you have forgotten.
1,"Barros actually has some of my favorite pizza but I won't order from this location again.  My husband and I ordered a pizza and some wings on Sunday and were quoted 45 minutes to an hour for delivery.  The girl on the phone corrected herself right before we hung up and said ""it may be a little over an hour, we are really busy""- I said no problem.  An hour and a half later I called to check the status of our order and was told that it hadn't even been made yet.  The manager asked if I was quoted 2 hours to which I answered no and told her we were quoted ""a little over an hour"".  She proceeded to apologize and tell me that our delivery would likely be another 45 minutes before arrival! That's 2 hours and 15 minutes for a pizza and wings...no thank you! We cancelled our order.  Now a few days later the charges are still on my account.  I'm annoyed with the whole thing probably more so because I'm 7 months pregnant and my patience is low.  I was very surprised that we weren't even offered as much as a coupon for our next visit.  Just poor customer service all around...we will find a new ""go to"" pizza place."
1,"Please do not go and eat here! I have only been to this place once and I will never be back. My visit was short of how bad the experience was. 2 days later after visiting this place and I feel the need to write my experience. I visited this place with my family Saturday night, we hadn't seen each other all day and we were starving and didn't want to wait 20 minutes at another restaurant so we decided to try this place. First of all they didn't charge us at the entrance which I suspected it would be a bit pricey but i didn't really care because maybe the food was worth it and we were just very hungry. Anyways we were sat down on a dirty table that I began cleaning with napkins that were left behind by the previous people sitting there the waitress looked at me while taking in the order for our drinks. She never said anything, my husband sat down and jumped back up because he was on spilled drink. She pulled out napkins and placed them on the table, I began cleaning and didn't make much of a deal about it. We got up and began serving ourselves, their were many options of food but that was fine. As we sat back down our 2 year old began eating. He was eating his beef broccoli and became disgusted by it, I thought it was normal since sometimes he just doesn't like the taste of things, I didn't pay much attention to it and just gave him water to water it down. When I pulled my drink back I noticed my water was extremely fogged up and then began to notice their was a lot of hard rock soup outside my cup that I couldn't scrape off. So I left it aside and said to myself I'd tell them to take it back, then I noticed my husbands cup was cracked from the bottom and was leaving a mess. Their was nobody around so we waited on our drinks and left them aside. We began eating and my husband told me the broccoli was very sticky and tasted funky, I ate one piece and realized it was expired. It had such a foul smell to it. I pulled a piece out of my plate and began inspecting it, their was growing FUCKEN Mold on it. I pulled my toddlers plate away from him and inspected his bro oki too, it had growing Fucken mold!!!!! I was beyond upset!!!! I couldn't believe it. I began to complain about it a little out loud so someone would hear me. People kept staring at me but began to eat, no waitress came around I had to wave at one. I asked her for the check and she looked at me and said that's it? I said yes we are done here. She obviously knew their was something wrong. She took our money and I followed her, I didn't wait for her to come back to our table I was just ready to get out of there! She gave me my change I took it and left. I paid $40 dollars for 2 adults and a 2yr old that ate moldy broccoli. I will never go back to this place and I will never forget this horrible experience. What a scare! It's not fair that people are so inconsiderate and selfish about what they put out there! Yes it was a bit pricey considering we didn't eat much but it's not about the money. I am writing this because my 2 yr old was put in danger of getting sick because the people that run this business obviously don't care about what they are putting out there.. they are just their to take your money."
1,"Part Two to my previous review of this joint.  This particular store of Barry's remain we a major disappointment  one year after my previous visit.  I mentioned that the salad was pre-med with brown lettuce a very spongy  (soggy) croutons.  This restaurant is too cheap to have an actual salad bar like other Barro's.  Huge let down!!!  Quality of value of the salad was as poor as one can get.  After I returned my salad for a fresh salad, I asked for pepper and parmesan cheese..  The cashier tilts her head and said, ""Over there."". I looked where her head had pointed to only to see nothing but an empty counter.  When she returned, I told her that nothing is where her head had pointed.  She said, ""On!  You'll have to walk around the restaurant to look for them.  One would like to  think that each table would at lease contain the parmesan, salt, pepper, red peppers, & napkins on each table  like the others."
1,"The food is cold, ir has been sitting there for awhile. The soda taste like plastic. Ugh the whole food no taste and simple nasty!! Will never go back or recommend."
1,"My husband and I have ordered from Barros religiously since we moved to Arizona. When we moved to the Foothills we were thrilled to see a Barros just down the road.  The delivery times are way better than pretty much any other chain and we've pretty much never had an issue with the food.  Well that stops today.  I decided to try something different since I was home alone and I've always been curious about the ""White with Ricotta & Tomato Pizza"".  I call and get some smart-alec teenager on the phone who proceeds to tell me there is no such thing on their menu, he doesn't know what Ricotta cheese is and I must not be on the right website.  That's right, of course it's me because I only had to go through like 3 people saying Barros before I could try to place my order. I gave up and placed an order through someone else and called back for a manager. Some dipstick picks up the phone and again proceeds to tell me there is no such thing, they've never had anything like this on the menu.  So I say ""humor me pull up your website menu.""  Ta-da there it is, then I find out I'm not even talking to a manager because he conveniently isn't there and it sounds pretty close to the moron who told me he didn't know what ricotta cheese was.  Bottom line, like I just told these kids, bad customer service will screw you every time. Good thing I'm not that big on pizza but the good news is I can get it elsewhere and it is better."
1,"This is not a review on the food here. The food is average and if you expect hot wings, you will be disappointed. However this is a review on the manager. I find it hard to fathom a manager approaching someone sitting in the bar area watching a football game if they are expecting more people to come. I've been to several other sports bars and sat in the bar area for the duration of a game, and not once has anyone ever approached me pressuring me to either have others join me or leave. Then signing up for their VIP program I received a 15% off coupon. When my server approached this gentleman with it, he said to tell me to make sure I delete it immediately cuz he didn't want me using it again. I can see why there were seats available at this sports bar for the games. My seat will forever remain empty at this locale, as I will never give them another penny of my hard earned money to be disrespected like I was yesterday afternoon."
1,"Here we go again...worst car wash / oil change service in the metro area. Showed up a few minutes before 8AM (opens at 8 ?) with coupon for discounted oil change / wash. Employees began to stagger in around 8:15AM , looking like they just got done with a hard night of dumpster diving. Cashier was also late and had difficulty in processing basic sales related to the car wash.
 Oil change : did not check coolants or windshield washer reservoir. Car wash : did not vacuum interior and tried to deliver vehicle partially wiped down on the exterior.
 Possible irregularities in payment processing : store was only able to accept cash payments. credit card system was offline.  This is a highly dubious situation and may require further attention from regulators. This business hit rock bottom and now shows signs of starting to dig.

1,"0 Stars!!! Horrible Service!!! If you are an interracial couple do not bring this place your business. If you have kids, they will tell you that if your child is not receiving service that your child is not allowed. Horrible customer service. Me my boyfriend and my daughter attended this place only to be treated like crap. Me and my boyfriend were judged by these rude ""nail techs"". I was asked over and over again by each lady the status of me and ""the guy"" that walked in with me... ""Is he your boyfriend?"" I gave no answer ""Is he your husband?"" I gave no answer. Only for these ladies to start laughing and whispering in their Vietnamese language right in front of our face. Very Rude and none of their business. ( My boyfriend is white with tattoos) So what!?! Then I called in a complaint only to be disrespected by one of the managers sending snap shots of my daughter from their cameras to my phone telling me she isn't welcomed. I never gave this woman permission to take and send pictures of my 4 yr. old underage daughter! To make a long story short this place is over rated, disrespectful, racist and don't like kids. I will be reporting them to the BBB. ASAP

And in response to your reply. My daughter did nothing wrong. How about you try telling the truth instead of bullying and lying on my four year old. She sat in your empty pedicure chair where you had no customers... What's the crime? She was sitting down. What's the crime? I was sitting down so I did not go into your fridge. My boyfriend did grab two sodas, opened them and then was told that was VIP. He offered to pay for them after your staff jumped down his throat about two 50 cents sodas and your staff didn't take him up on his offer. Did you catch that on camera too? We then were offered waters. And my daughter was told that she could get herself a water out of the fridge by ME, her mother the paying customer. I'm not going to deny my daughter water because you don't want kids in your shop. My daughter did not run a marathon or 100 yard dash in your shop. So stop exaggerating and lying on my daughter. My daughter caused your shop NO harm but you and your staff want to lie and try to make this about my four year old when it's actually about you (who wasn't anywhere to be found) and your unprofessional, rude, catty, racist, and judgmental staff. How dare you go after my child. I asked to speak to the owner who was unavailable to file a complaint. Never saw him. Your staff judging my boyfriend and each lady asking if he is my boyfriend and or husband multiple times is None of their business. Yes, they did ask if he picked the color for me. But when they were told ""that it didn't matter"" about our ""title"" by me...they should not keep prying into other adults business/relationships. Do they ask everyone that walks in about their marital status and relationships? Did you catch that on camera? Your staff needs retraining in dealing with the public. And should learn to not discriminate because of age and race. We need a translator for those tapes as well during my visit when your staff was laughing in our faces, and talking in Vietnamese under their breath. Do better."
1,"My sister went and had her car detailed because she left soda in her car and the Cans exploded. She paid $100.00 and asked if it included the headliners. The guy she was working with said yes. She wait two hours for her car. The windows inside were not clean, headliners were still dirty and they stayed they don't clean those, and there was still soda spots all over the car. I would not recommend this place at all!"
1,"Negative stars if possible, save your money and time, go to another place then here. Service was bad to start off with and food was horrible. Will not be returning."
1,The food was OK the service was OK but the management was horrible. It is before 11 o'clock at night and somebody just came up to me at the bar and said we're trying to get our boys out of here we need to lock the door. My bill was over $300 and I don't need that kind of service ever.  Saturday night...
1,"Disgusting.  Tomatoes in the noodles, even the eggs in soup were rancid.  $30 food straight in the trash."
1,"Terrible experience here, the fat dude with glasses was very rude,  we went out for a dinner with family for a birthday but this was a terrible choose,  food was ok, and the family meal plan is the worst rip off ever. Usually in other restaurants when you pay 38$ for a meal everyone gets it's own portion, here we had 3 family member buy it only sharing 2 small plates, what a rip off 20$ extra just for that, comes with 60$ for 2 small plate dishes ? TERRIBLE"
1,"Ok, so we finally decided to eat at the waffle house... Bad choice! The food sucked and my server Kelly was not very nice.  Now I know why it's called the awful waffle!!"
1,"I'm am use to a certain level of untidiness at Waffle Houses in general, but this morning was by far a clear indication I need to stop eating here. There were a number of flies as well as a couple of roaches in clear sight. One roach was even at the register as the serve packaged my food and collected my money. Please do better Waffle House Your $3 breakfast bowl is amazing, your pest control is lacking!!"
1,"This place was not what it was chocked up to be.  I went in Thursday afternoon with a friend.  I had heard good things, and wanted to try it out. I love poutine. 

The cashier was so stoned she couldn't understand a word we said to her.  My bud tried to make conversation and she just stared blankly. Did not smile,  say hello,  goodbye,  or thanks for coming.  Less actual service than you'd get from the worst McDonalds restaurant. The cook in the back looked pretty ripped too. By the time we got the food I was already discouraged. 

The poutine was mediocre,  nothing I would recommend you go out of your way for as we did. I just got a regular poutine.  My friend said his tortilla poutine or whatever was good,  but he's from Columbia and just didn't want to offend me I guess.

0/10 cheese curds.  McDonalds makes better poutine."
1,Noodles tasted like dishwater. It isn't the best food. Not including the overwhelming smell you get when you first walk in.
1,"My wife is full, that's the nicest thing I can say. Food was cold although the selection was fine. The sushi bar looks so good but I'm afraid to try it because all the rest of the food was cold. I was afraid of salmonella. This place is definitely not a keeper."
1,"I live in the neighbourhood and really want to like this place.  We've been there twice and experienced very poor customer service both times.  The food is good but not good enough to make up for the lack of customer service.

The first time we went the person at the cash told me ""it was a pain"" for her to make change from my $20.

The second time we went I was served the blackest, most burned quiche I've ever seen and told by the waitress that they knew it was burned but wanted to see if I would eat it anyways.  Seriously, that is so rude and almost mind numbingly bad service.

I was given a $10 coupon to make up for the quiche which I spent right away on cookies because I won't be going back."
1,"Really bad car wash. They take forever even when there isn't many other customers. Last time I went here, two employees were frolicking on the ground like kids while I was waiting for them to dry my car."
1,The food is ok but they have to have the WORST/NASTIEST restrooms in the city!! With all the money they make they could certainly update/sanitize these gross rooms!
1,"After walking on foot, in my high heels over from Planet Hollywood, we came to Caramel only to discover that at 3 in the morning that they were already closed for the night.  Why advertise that you stay open until 4am if you don't?"
1,Do not eat here any place that has bugs climbing in its dinning room means bugs in the kitchen. Will never ever eat the food here!
1,"This is by far the worst location I've ever had at Barros pizza... keep in mind I always love Barro's pizza but will not be back this time.  Called in and instantly placed on hold for over 5 minutes just to place an order.  Figured I had been forgotten about so I hung up called back and couldn't get a word out before being placed on hold for another 2 minutes.  Anyways, pizza is delivered and I give the driver $30 on a $22 bill just to find we are missing 3 items and a marinara sauce with our cheesy bread.. keep in mind Barro's Pizza charges for each individual ranch and we had ordered 3 of them.  I called in not being upset at this point asking if we could be reimbursed and the girl relays my message to the manager and says they will reimburse $5 on my next order... that's got to be the worst deal I've ever seen as I had already paid $2 for the ranch and tipped the driver $8 and they never showed up and ruined our meal. Just all around worst customer service I've ever had at this location... on another visit and different day they had all of their beer taps not working and pouring straight foam... it has to be the worst location in all of Phoenix... this is my first yelp review I've ever left and definitely worth it."
1,"First things first, this is the worst manicure and pedicure I've ever gotten, ESPECIALLY for what it cost me. 

I came in on a Wednesday at about 1:30 hoping to take advantage of the special advertised on Yelp for a free pedicure with $35+ purchase. When I inquired about it and asked whether a gel manicure would qualify for the free pedicure, I was told yes and then I was given a total for both that was absurd and in the ball park of $70. Puzzled, I asked how that could be if the pedicure is free and I was given a different set of numbers and an explanation that didn't explain anything. Still confused, the lady I dealt with proceeded to try and add up all the numbers on paper only to add them up wrong and when I pointed that out, she acted like she was the confused one and thew out an entirely different set of numbers that gave a slightly lesser total. Then, when I picked out sparkly polish for both my mani and pedi, the total price jumped back up, this time to $76. I'm still not really sure what cost what, what I paid for and what exactly was free here because there was definitely a language barrier. All in all, I paid $90 ($14 tip added) for a gel mani and pedi and I kind of feel like it was intentionally made to be confusing in an attempt  to try and increase profits. I was having my nails done for an upcoming wedding and figured the extra cost would be worth it and expected the quality would reflect the price and it did not end up being the case. 

Two different ladies worked on me but the quality of both the manicure and pedicure was the same - bad. Both ladies globbed gel polish not just on the nails but the cuticles as well and then would go back and clean up the cuticles with a brush before curing. Because they applied so much polish, it pooled up between the cuticles and the nail and in the case of the manicurist, wound up being extremely painful because she was using her nails and a nail file to separate the cured gel from my skin then filed away at my skin in an effort to shape the nails. When I asked her to stop and pulled my hand away because it hurt so bad, she told me it was because my nails were too short and kept going. She basically carved the shape of a nail out of the cured gel instead of simply painting one on. The final product looked like thick & uneven fake nails and immediately started lifting around the sides and snagging on my hair. It got to be so annoying that I peeled them off and went out and bought a UV lamp and gel polish and redid them myself and they look 10x better than what I got. I was there for about 2 hours and for most of that time I was the only one in the entire salon so it's not like they were rushing to get to the next customer - they just did a really sloppy job. 

To be fair, both ladies were very nice and very polite and the salon itself was really clean and super cute. Unfortunately, those things only go so far when the quality of what you receive is poor."
1,The food looked better than it tasted. I worried excessively about food poisoning while I tried to eat.
1,"OMG they had so many empty tables and they sat us at a dirty table. Then we saw ants on the table. We had to ask to get the table cleaned. The menu was small and had such a small selection. My wife was ready to leave when the waitress said, "" oh, we have this menu too."" We toughed it out and finally ordered. Food was minimal at best. The waitress was nice, but the rest of the crew was talking so loud. Definitely not an experience I want to have again!!!!"
1,"TRAVELERS BEWARE! If 0 stars was an option for rating I would have chosen that. I will review this hotel on every platform I am able to let other travelers know to beware. I travel often for both business and pleasure and frequent Hilton hotels. I have never been disappointed in a stay at any Embassy Suites and in fact have stayed at this specific hotel several times. Tonight however upon returning to my hotel I found my key did not work. I went to the front desk and was told by the ""hotel manager"" Tiarra (unsure of spelling because she would not provide it) that I was locked out of my room because the card on file with Priceline was only for ""incidentals"" and I was not charged for the room. Rather than contacting me at the number on file they chose to lock me out of my room (with all of my belongings inside). They then proceeded to charge my debit card for a second time. So, in essence I paid over $320 for a one night stay. When I went back to the front desk to confront the manager regarding this issue with proof of where I was charged twice I was told ""I will not work with you"" and ""I will not give you your money back"". When I expressed that I would not leave the front desk until I was refunded (seeing as how I was clearly charged twice and had proof right in front of her) she called security on me. The only saving grace was the kind security guard who agreed with me regarding the ridiculousness of this situation. After spending over 45 minutes on the phone with Priceline they confirmed the hotel and manager was wrong and called to speak with her while I was still standing in the lobby. She then told me the hotel would refund my money (which is all I requested in the first place) but said she could not give me proof that this was going to happen I just ""had to trust"" her. When I asked her what her name was so I could lodge a complaint she told me Tiarra but would not spell it or give me a last name or initial. She told me she ""runs this hotel"" but to feel free to try to complain. She also told me I am ""Priceline's customer not a customer of this hotel"". Excuse me?! Am I not staying in THIS hotel that I was just charged TWICE for? I still do not have my money back and wasted over an hour of my evening dealing with an extremely rude, arrogant and condescending manager. I cannot express how disappointed I am in this stay and this interaction. I have seen several other reviews within the last month complaining about this same manager and cannot believe the Hilton brand would continue to allow this type of behavior."

1,It looks like the workers really don't care and clean well enough.... I was sitting by the window with my girlfriend and I swear 3 flys kept swarming around us and our food. Really ruined my appetite but the waffles are good .
1,So it's starting to get pretty old. Always something with these people. A few times in the past our delivery has been cold and late. Today I come to pick up my order and they tell me they dropped my pizza and I have to wait for a new one to come out the oven. They need to get it together.
1,"Disappointed in the car wash job done on my car on Friday. I was referred to the wash by the shop working on my car. As a classic car, they suggested a hand wash with some interior wipe down and armor all. I agreed and was shocked to then be told it was $40 for a hand wash. I figured it had to be a great wash given the referral and the cost, but I was wrong. They didn't even wipe down the seats, didn't wash the rocker panel on the passenger side (I should have walked around it) and didn't even vacuum the back. I was planning to email them to give them opportunity to refund, but can't find a way to contact them online. Certainly not the wash I expected and less clean than a rain storm or drive through has station for $5"
1,Ordered the veggie poutine. It was awful. Fries were cold and soggy! Won't come back.
1,"food was very tough, soda taste like soap, the only thing good was the ice cream with that very small cone.....overall good service but bad food that upset my stomach...i wont recommend this to anyone. the price 11.99 was not worth it save your money.."
1,"I was not impressed by this chinese buffet. The only things that were good were the sushi and the location. The servers only speak enough english to serve you. And their food offerings are of very low quality. Their prices are way too high for the lack of food quality. They had crab legs that were so tiny, I could barely get the meat out of them. Also, their fried rice tasted like dirt. Their chicken was dry (except for the chicken on a stick). I won't be going back here at all."
1,"I have given this place so many chances and now I am done with this location and maybe Waffle House in general. 
The skinny 
By no means do I expect Waffle House to be a 5 star restaurant but what I do expect is a clean and friendly place and this place never gets it right I have been there 6 times (no car closest food chain)  as I work around the corner. Out of those 6x only once did I see a worker that I had seen before this place seems to have a high turnover rate. They made a few mistakes such as giving me the wrong burger (I order the lunch special 5$ double burger with drink combo) they tried to charge me for wrong burger and I had to tell them that I ordered special which I always say can I have the 5$ burger special to avoid confusion after a brief argument she gave me the special price. The food is ok I don't expect it to be great but it's not bad. The very last time I went there, there was 2 employees one cool one waitress they seemed to be texting and getting calls from friends on the work line as it kept going off and they would have small quiet conversations with. When I ordered the special the cook seemed to be upset over me disrupting his convo he finished my burger literally in 2 minutes he gave me a small plate with just burger no hash browns and my drink. He asked how my burger tasted I advised it seemed under cooked and not that great which he laughed and walked away I didn't finish burger. When I went up to pay she charged me for the special I let her know I did order the special and that  I didn't get my hash browns she deducted .60c when I asked if that's how much hash browns cost she replied rudely and barked yes I paid with no tip and as I was leaving could hear her complain about it I let them know how I felt and how unprofessional they were and left. The cook was also cursing out loud as he thought I would be cool enough to not say anything. 
Even if I was starving and had a free lunch coupon would I ever go back to this place."
1,"This will be my first and last time to this location in Ahwatukee. I called and ordered my pizza at 5:50 I was told it would be 20 minutes. I went to pick up my pizza and it should have been ready at 6:10. I paid for the pizza at 6:15.  At 6:30 the girl at the counter asked me for my name again and then grabbed my pizza out of the counter oven where it was staying warm. I said to the girl behind the counter that that pizza had been there for over 10 minutes, she responded with ""I know"". No apologies. No discount offered for future orders or 2 liters of soda like she promised previous upset guests before me.

This place is a disaster. The girl behind the counter even told one gentleman that she recognized him from before as having had bad service so for him this was two times in a row for him. 

Based on that I don't have any desire to return to a place of business that doesn't know how to serve their guests."
1,"Awful! When my husband and I walked in our shoes stuck to the floor...we should have left then. It looked sketchy so we ordered something simple...waffles and eggs. The eggs came immediately, but where were our waffles? The kitchen is open so you can see everything happening. A few minutes later I saw the cook, who was coughing and sneezing, open the two waffle irons. When he opened the irons, they both stuck and he said ""shit""! He sprayed the two other irons, but ran out of batter. Soon he had more batter and tried again. The waitress (using that turn lightly) asked how we were doing. I said my eggs are cold and I still don't have a waffle. My husband ate his eggs alone. The waitress went into the kitchen and tells him she still needs two waffles...someone else must have gotten ours while we were talking to her. So, finally I got a waffle to go with my cold eggs! Yay! Then my poor husband says "" where is my waffle? She goes over and sprays the waffle iron herself...this is so painful to write...I'm going to stop now.  Ps They didn't care how crappy the food or service was."
1,"I used to like this place but the last few times I have my oil changed also and it was horrible experience, the guy that changes the oil takes his sweet time and every time they said sorry he is by himself today, one time yes I understand but every time is ridiculous, get more help or move people around, there is people standing around doing nothing.
Next if you have a chipped windshield you have a guy that doesn't understand that you don't want to have it repair"" come on the insurance company pays for it"" 
And the icing on the cake .... the car was filthy , even with the supreme wash.....and yes !!! Mark ,I did comeback and have the car wash and it was horrible, don't give me an excuse get your people to perform like they used to do until you do I will get my business somewhere else."

Bad service and filthy - see pics



2016

Waffle House

Pretty standard where ever you eat at one.  Service at this one is also descent.

Waffle House seems to keep raising their prices every 3-6 months.  They are becoming a little expensive for breakfast compare to their competition like IHOP and Denny's."
1,"After two subsequent visits we are giving this place thumbs down. Their steak sandwich' is nothing more than steak ums, piled with french fries (Pramanti's rip off), and lousy tasting overall. And for close to $9? I don't think so. 2nd visit: 'giant fish' sandwich had absolutely no flavor! Guiness beer on tap special was watered down. Wife had steak salad with wilty lettuce. Wrote to them and they told me nitrogen valve on the keg tap was faulty...maybe so but don't they taste test their tapped beer every day??? Seems like this should have been a protocol. Overall...so-so to lousy food, lack of quality control beers, noisy, crowded, and terrible to find parking. Never more."
1,I spent one hour and half  getting my SUV washed today will never go back almost had to beg too get a free car wash
1,I am so beyond angry about the service that I received I do not know what to do so yesterday I took my car in to get detailed didn't have enough time so they told me to let it sit overnight and be ready at 10 in the morning I stressed that I needed it back by 10 and it wasn't done so I had to wait around for an hour for staff to figure out what to do once they finally decided that I was going to get my detail part done refunded to me they gave me back my car but they were going to charge me for the regular wash which my car did not even get a basic regular wash there's bird poop all over my windshield and I have pictures to prove it I am stressed out and I feel so robbed. They said they gave me a refund and that's a lie. They are going to give me a partial.  They charged me for an extreme wash and didn't do that and not to mention my time.  You guys are the worst.  Not to mention the staff didn't realize I spoke Spanish and were talking crap the whole time. When I answered them in Spanish they looked so terrified because they didn't know. Don't assume and never trust this place
1,"I have  been coming since you all opened today was the WORSE service ever received... I will never be back!  Wish I could have seen the manger, but gone for the evening..  an hour and a half wait and I had to ask for my bill.  I was forgotten, and they were NOT busy...   $28 for a wiper blade ???   outrageous... Not dealer cost $15. talk about a rip off the service it use to provide over the years as a loyal customer!
Robert

5/1/2015 never heard from anyone ...,"
1,"I came here on a Saturday and the restaurant isnt busy for a noght with a Mayweather boxing match happening. Ive seen bars packed compared to this and had better service. 

Our waitress took 30 mins to take our food order after receiving our drinks. 

My bf and I order 1 cheeseburger with fries and sampler platter of wings. The fries and wings came and the burger never showed up....

The waitress never checked on us or refill the drinks (iced tea and cocktails). When we complained to the manager he went to the waitress asked her what happened and she said we were lying. 

We asked her to explain how we got fries and no burger? No response.

Finally the manager  (Donaven) agreed to comp the food but we pay for the drinks. Fine.

20 minutes later we were still waiting for the check...

After 40 minutes we finally got it needless to say no tip was given for poor service. I hate not giving a tip but Im not going to pay for crappy service ever!

I will never be coming to this place ever and I will make sure none of my friends come here either."
1,"This is a highly disorganized car wash. There are no indicators or personnel that guide you through what lanes to go to. Furthermore, their employees are washing cars and smoking cigarettes, getting their ashes all over the car. Avoid this place if you can. There are other car washes near by with better professionalism and courtesy to their customers."
1,"I used to love coming to this place. They were super fast, and very reasonably priced. On 10/12/2017 The sales manager tried to charge me $35 for a hand wash when I have only paid $17.99 for the previous year. I had asked if they are doing something different now and he stated that's what the price is. I was shocked to find out they had doubled their price within a month. I gave him the ticket back and told him I'm not going to be using them. He then told me that he could do the wash for $25 this time since I was there. This place has turned into a joke. I feel there is a game going on to see who can rip off the customers the most. I will not be taking my truck back ever again and will never recommend anyone to you guys anymore.

One more note: The Sales stand has a pricing sheet taped on it, and the price next to hand wash clearly states $13.99. HAHAHA. I understand a few extra bucks because I have a bigger truck but I refuse to pay almost triple the price. Another example of getting ripped off!"
1,"I used to live this place but the more I come here and he kore I see the poor mess of customer service. When even I ask for something they look at me as they didn't want to do it. The cashier never gives me any sign of appreciation at all. When I asked for receipt she through a fit. How is that right? 
So I'm not coming here anymore."
1,"I've been to a Waffle House before and the service was top notch and super fast so I was excited to try this one out. I came on a Sunday morning and the lady taking names didn't even greet me and was super rude, she also said the wait would be 15-20 minutes and we waited for almost an hour. When getting seated I noticed several dirty napkins utensils on the floor. then a young lady named Britney came to give us our drinks, she rudely asked ""who's the coffee for?"" we then waited for another 45 mins for our food and when we had to get up to ask for our waffles! when our waffles came they were cold and Britney rudely came back to take the plates we were done with and we could clearly hear her complaining about our table to another employee. there was never an apology for the wait or delay in our food. the whole staff looked very unprofessional and we're running around like they had no idea what to do. I'm only giving this place one star because I don't have the option for zero stars.

bottom line is there are other waffle houses in Phoenix and I definitely recommend going to another. the food is mediocre. the service, attitude and cleanliness are beyond poor. I will not be visiting this Waffle House again!"
1,"Do I have to put any stars?? On a road trip my son was ""craving"" WH. Called to ask for a couple booths together for 7 of us arriving in 5 min. Was told we have three empty booths and 2 are together. Came in and none together. Oh well, 3 of us sat at the counter across from the table. Then table behind is opened. Moved there. About 15 min later the table behind came in, got served, food arrived. Still we had not been offered drinks or order taken. We told the waitress we were ready and she said ok. 10 min later we left. There were 5 or 6 people standing around in the office and not doing anything. Menus were sticky and when I came back from the dirty restroom, I could see the filthy kitchen. Junk all over the floor behind the counter. Glad we left and went to First Watch."
1,Staff was too busy gossiping with one another and talking badley about other employees to bring me my pizza when it was done.
1,"Disappointing coffee and service ever!!
It was super busy saturday afternoon.
I lined up and waited 5min and order my coffee extra ice and long shot as usual.
But even 10min later my iced coffee didnt ready so I asked the lady ...
my iced latte coming. 

She looked forgot my order. 
But she didnt say sorry and told me it will be ready after another customer's drink. 

But I knew that the another customer was lined up way behind of me so it was very annoying and disappointing.

Anyways she made my coffee in a very sloppy way.. 
And she almost threw the lid of cup and went away.

I am regulr here almost 1 year but
Never seen this rude before so embarassed.
But it was okay cause it was busy and people can make a mistake I do understand that but the problem was coffee taste....

It was disappointing.
No extra ice or no longshot.
It was almost milk color.

I used to recommend people this place but
I am not sure from now.

They are always super busy most weekend lunch time 
So dont expect good service or coffee.
Sometimes I feel like this place is over hyped. 

Disappointing today!!"
1,"So ridiculous! They mail me a coupon with there name and address on it and then don't want to take it. She says, It's an old coupon! I say, it doesn't have an expiration  date on it. Ok she says with total attitude, next time we won't take it.  I say ok, next time don't mail out coupons with no expiration date and next time I'll just go to Red Dragon.  Seriously every time I come here these older ladies are so unfriendly and act like you bringing your business into their establishment is burdening them.  Compliments to the men and the cooks who know how to give good food and good customer service. After 6 years of faithfully going, referring, and bringing friends and family to China City, I'm done!  So sad but done."
1,"Wish I could give it a zero stars...awful food and even though it looks like there is tons of staff everywhere, good luck getting anyone to pay attention....if you want real wings go down the street to Texas Longhorn. $0.65 each on Mondays and Wednesdays. Do the math, that's 25 wings for the same price as the all you can eat scam here. Here you can only order 6 at a time and they have to all be the same flavor. It took so long to get wings that we gave up after 12. Never again!!!!"
1,"The Big Cheese?  I'm sorry, but this place should really be called ""Fries and Gravy"". 

There were hardly any curds.  I'd give it 4 stars if the big cheese served big cheese, but they don't.  I heart poutine.  I hope they pick 
up the slack.  That is all.

EDIT: You can order extra curds for $1.25.  You need to add curdsx 3 to make it reasonable.  Makes a small poutine about ~$11.  You decide."
1,"I didn't like the service I received and the place was so tired and gross. My room wasn't ready so I waited in the center space. The tables smelled sour and the wifi was spotty and the music was so loud and obnoxious it sounded like they were preparing for a dance party. I asked the front desk if they would turn down the music (I was the only person in the whole place) and she said ""I wouldn't even know how to do that so no."" Unacceptable. My room was tucked away in a back corner so it was quiet (except for road noise). The bed was comfortable but the rest of the furniture was so tired and gross i didn't want to sit on it. Not up to the Hilton standards for sure."
1,"This was the worst meal we have had in a long time. The food was cold on the inside. Not sure why because you could see steam coming from the warmer but it was. No flavor and incredibly over priced. Two meals and 3 drinks ( had our 3 year old) and it was almost $30. When we questioned the food we were told ""she says it is fine"". Not sure who she is but we asked to speak to the manager. The server left and came back telling us that the ""boss lady"" is not here. We again asked to speak to the person in charge and her response was the same. She finally asked if we would talk to a guy working there.  He tried to say the food was so cold because of the a/c. We payed for the drinks and left. Will never even consider going back. Just hope we don't get sick."
1,"I do not know how people think this place is good! I've been here a handful of times and all i've ever gotten is a greasy fry, gravy overloaded mess. For those few people on here who have commented that this place was their first time trying poutine, good lord- make sure you eat at another place and DO NOT make this your last poutine experience."
1,"Unfortunately, the food is less tasty than average Chinese food. Second, right as we were escorted to our table there was a long hair stuck to the table and the host said they forgot to clean the table! Third, my husband found a hair in his broccoli and the waitress said "" don't worry it's just a eyelash!"" WTF!!! Then she called the manager and they were arguing with us making a huge scene and all we tried to do was alert them so they are aware! The next time I decide to eat buffet, I will travel all the way to 75th Ave & Mcdowell. 
Good luck whoever wants to be humiliated and not satisfied after they eat!"
1,"Overcrowded with seniors during week for lunch, so noisy!! My waitress should have retired 20 years ago, slow as moses, and had an attitude!! The pulled pork sandwich had zero BBQ sauce, no taste with some foreign Cole Slaw. High price, bad food, bad service. Hire some younge girls, geez its summer!!! Hire more cooks who can actually make what is on your menu!"
1,Don't not go there or order online . We ordered food from there and we asked that it be delivered at 7:30 . It did not show up until 8:30 cold and nasty. When I called they did not care. I will not be going back there.
1,I tried multiple times with no response.the place I was told to go to did not work with my schedule and I cannot afford to take time off work to resolve the issue TNT was responsible for. What a nightmare.
1,"Don't waste your money this is garbage disguised as Chinese food, there is nothing super about their selections!"
1,"Oh goodness where do I even start. The customer service was okay, but the food was really not that good. They had a lot of old items out at the buffet bar that looked like it had been sitting out for 3 to 4 hours. I've been to my fair share of Americanized Chinese buffets , but this one was really Americanized and when I mean Americanized I mean it tasted so bad there wasn't even a hint of authenticity was in there. Most likely I will not be back. You would probably have to drag me. The only reason why I did give it 1 stars was because they had a pretty wide selection unfortunately they failed to deliver on the taste. My wife and kids didn't really care for it either and besides you really can not take the kids word for it. Thank God for my wife's cooking though and by the way she is Asian and her food is awesome!"
1,"Look. Poutine isn't that amazing or incredible. Therefore, it is not that hard to make. Find the right potato. Cut it. Add the inedible cheese by-product that is carved off from real cheese. Add gravy. Compared to southern food, it shouldn't be too hard to master. But this place seems to make such a simple dish beyond adequacy a really difficult feat. Maybe it's the overwhelming menu they set up. Perhaps they should just get the basic type of poutine ""right"" before offering over the top varieties that contain edimame or pre-packaged smoked meat.

I go in, and there's the usual half baked enthusiasm that epitomizes Calgary's service. Order basic. Fucking rip off, something like $8 after tax. I have to thank them for doing their job upon serving it to me. The fries are not fresh and I suspect they were frozen. The curds are almost non existent, and the gravy is from stock. Enough said. I won't waste your time the same way this place did. Go to A+W instead. Or Alberta King of Sub. Even District. Good lord.

17th should be restricted to good restaurants. Not pita pit and this shit."
1,"I have been here before for some chips and margarita and had OK service but when I went to check in for a breakfast burrito, I was treated so poorly by short fuse tude lady, Yolanda. She was more friendly to the lanky, pale man who she handed 2 beers to at 10'am in the morning. I will never, ever go back there becos of her and in fact if it wasn't for me being hungry, I would of said curse words to her and reminded her how customers like me pay for her livelihood. The burrito itself was good and the cook had a more friendly face than both Yolanda and the shy cashier who seemed to have no idea on what to do."
1,"By Calgary's standards, their poutine is edible, and I would've had no problem giving them 5 stars, however...  their pickles, which are quite popular, and worth the $1.00 each, as they are/were LARGE authentic deli-style sour pickles, however during my recent visit, I purchased 5 pickles at $1.00 each, and as the pickles were being pulled out of the large glass jar behind the counter, I noticed that the pickles looked quite small (compared to how they normally look), less than half of their normal size, however I still purchased them.  When I got home, I tasted one, and discovered that not only were they smaller than normal, they tasted like regular dill pickles, like the ones you would get from a jar at the supermarket (ie; NOT deli-style, and certainly not large).  

Shame on me for not questioning their size and authenticity at The Big Cheese in Calgary, and SHAME ON THE BIG CHEESE IN CALGARY, for not only trying to pass off these smaller generic pickles as their usual large authentic deli-style sour pickles, but for also charging the full $1.00.  It just seems like a silly way to tarnish your ""brand"".  It is also interesting to note that this was also posted on their Facebook page, and was deleted.

It's not the money, it's the PRINCIPLE :("
1,"I had dinner there on a Saturday. Everything was great EXCEPT THE PRICE! WOW!! A WHOPPING $15.56!!! PLUS A TIP!!! TWENTY BUCKS!!!
I will go to China Harvest  for $9.38 at Cactus and I 17. And no tip there. But great food and experience. After leaving ""China City Super Buffet"", even though the food and service were good, I will never return. I had a terrible case of buyers remorse!"
1,Not bad service or food except when I got home. Got food poisoning from eating a texas melt. I'll never eat here again.  not worth it.
1,"I don't normally review places but I downloaded the app just to report what a terrible experience my family had here. We came by for lunch and the food was horrible and tasted bad. The fruit was old, the hot food was cold. The flavors were very odd. Before we left 2 of my kids were doubled over with stomach aches. When I took my youngest to the restroom we walked by the kitchen which was a complete and total mess and had a god awful smell pouring out of it. 90% of what I tried tasted funny and we left after barely consuming anything. I went to the register with a coupon which was from the money mailer and they had taped something to the register stating they won't take them. When I tried to tell the person at the register about our experience, he just shrugged it off. I told him about the rotten fruit so that other kids wouldn't eat it and he didn't seem to care. I will never be coming back and I hope this review helps save someone else the same trouble. We aren't picky or ones to complain but this was too much not to say something."
1,"This place takes far too long. Dropped my car off at approximately 11:15 and didn't have it returned until 1:50, even after being told ""10-15 more minutes"" two separate times. Car came back clean on the outside, but trash still remained on the interior.  Keep in mind that I only had an oil change and transmission fluid replaced. Front desk attendant is oblivious to what is going on around her and fails horribly in the customer service department. Never coming here again, I suggest you don't either. Not worth the $200 dollars I paid to them."
1,Man I hope I got my oil changed didn't seem like it . $64 plus $3 tip later with the extreme wash upgrade. This place is still the worst in AZ. Very shady had to wait an hour and 10 minutes being the only car for lube. Car wash is trash my kid does a better job at home
1,"Yuck!! So disappointed.  The free egg roll and the crab Rangoon with no crab in it was the best part. We ordered a lot and it was not expensive, but definitely will not be going back again."
1,"Two crappy drinks. How can you mess up a martini or manhattan? They did both! And then I wanted to get water for a friend and they don't serve tap water, only Fiji."
1,"Very lack luster reception at check in, even as a diamond member they couldn't seem to care less. Evening reception was terribly understaffed, taking 20 minuets to get a drink. The morning breakfast area was filthy by the end of service, nothing was cleaned breakfast was over. I forwarded pictures of roaches in the bathroom and faulty fire alarms to the Management but it didn't seem to bother them too much. Won't ever stay here again."
1,"Straight nasty if you can avoid!! I just ate their and I'm sick to my stomach! The food was cold old and gross ,I'm definitely not going back"
1,Paid 10.49 for unedible 2 taco plate which i threw  away. complained to staff and was offered something else which i declined but no refund. meat tasted very bitter and left bad taste in my mouth. It was truly horrible tasting. Worst mexican food I ever had this place is going on my NEVER again list. Go taco bell its better. Also there was very loud construction jackhammering  going on in the back which ruined the visit as well.
1,"I used to love this place, I would eat there regularly. I moved away but still come back to eat here until today. This was the worst experience I've had with Barros and sadly I won't return. Whomever is running their kitchen now must have gone home for the day because I feel like I've been waiting hours for my food. They used to be quick, attentive and friendly. Sad to say they've lost their touch."
1,"Smell terrible from the minute you walk in. Facilities are clean, but the food is terrible. Chicken, beef, and pork dishes are not hot. Plus the food has bland taste. 
Egg rolls were cold and are lacking ingredients. I am not very picky when it comes to the restaurants I eat at; there is something I can generally find good to eat. But this was the worst food I have ever ate. I would save your money and eat at any other establishment in that area."
1,"DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL

It is DANGEROUS and the night security is inadequate.  If you are a woman traveling alone and/or with your family, do not stay here!

I was woken up in the middle of the night with my furniture shaking and a domestic disturbance going on next door.  After waiting for security to handle the issue, it never stopped.  I asked for a new room and was told that there wasn't anyone to bring me a key.  When I was finally brave enough to step out in the hallway in my pjs with my bags packed to go and get a room key, the night manager and security guard were in the hallway talking.  I asked if one of them could help me get a key.  The night manager started shouting at me and even told me that my room was not his issue.  It was obvious that they were not going to secure the situation next door and I was not going to get a key, so I walked downstairs and asked for a refund.  I am now at the Garden Inn down the road and it is much nicer on every levels

I am a woman, traveling for business alone and I have been a dedicated Hilton Honors member for many many years. I always look for and stay at the safest hotels I can find.  This is by far the most nervous I have ever been for my safety and absolutely the most horribly I have ever been treated.  To think that my best and safest option was to pack up my things in the middle of the night, walk across a dark parking lot and drive to check into another hotel is an abomination. 

The icing on the cake...not 1 time did someone say, ""I am sorry that this happened to you.""  Terrible all around."
1,This place is a disappointment. The good is awfullllll! Tastes terrible. Everything is just wrongg!
1,"Came here for what I can best describe as a disappointing, boring lunch. There aren't many hot items to choose from, and like many other buffets, have several varieties of chicken/shrimp that all taste the same. It's pretty bland and unimaginative. 

Well, except for the sushi, I suppose. They churn out California rolls very fast, so kudos. 

I know that any AYCE place demands the diner lower their standards for quality of a meal, but this falls even below that...often, items are overcooked and dry. 

The worst part was that I apparently came within an hour of dinnertime...which is like 3pm, I guess. About 15 minutes into my stay, many items disappeared, replaced with new food that said ""dinner only"". Some of these, like bacon-wrapped shrimp, were clearly premium items. Others seemed quite arbitrary. A new flavor of the exact same item, for example, could be restricted. Strange. 

It was also a hassle getting refills. Staff constantly circles tables, but ignores empty drinks until you explicitly say, in a kind manner, ""WTF are you blind?"" They're really just there to police staff and charge extra if you grab a dinner item, not all of which were explicitly marked. I understand the model they're trying to pursue, but it's unwelcoming to basically have someone follow you around and watch you eat. 

So the service blows, as does the food. The only part I enjoyed was the soft serve frozen yogurt at the end. I probably won't come back."
1,"Worst customer service and service! I have never had such a terrible car wash... all they did was vacuum the inside. No one wiped down anything inside and they let the sun dry the outside. I paid $15.99 for the wash tipped the vacuum guy $5 and the inside cleaner $7. $27.99 for the worst car wash ever. Definitely will go back to cleaning my own car.

Dear Marc R,
You are probably the worst person in management I have ever witnessed. Here's why... You said you checked the film... what is the make and color of my car? If you truly did this you would see my wife and I pulling up with 3 employees standing doing nothing and no one approached or directed me. One guy even walked away. As we got out of the car a windshield guy approached me to fix a crack I said no (you can clearly see him pointing and looking at the windshield) he still proceeded to try and sell me the service through my insurance. We then went inside to pay... I paid for the wash with my card and asked the cashier to break a  $20... I asked for one $10 and two $5's... She gave me one $10 one $5 and five $1's was not what I asked for and she didn't bother explaining or counting my money back to me. The best part of this experience was sitting in the lobby. After 15 min I got up to see what was taking so long. I notice my car sitting in the middle of the road baking in the sun with the door wide open. It was a good 20ft away from any employee with the keys still in it. I started to get in and a lady (same lady who told me a couple weeks ago the avgerage tip was $20 when I called her out she then said it was $5) came over asking for my receipt. I gave it to her plus $7 in $1's. My wife and I got in and the inside was not even remotely close to being wiped down. In your video you will see me get out go to an employee ask for a rag and go back to wipe down my own car. So for you to leave me a comment earlier in the day then proceed to delete it and leave me another comment is outrageous. Ontop of siding with your employees over arguing about upgrades and tips. I work in the hospitality industry. I started at the bottom making $5.05 an hr and worked my way up to Division manager overseeing 20 accounts managing over a 100 employees. I know a thing about customer service and standards. Rule #1 The customer is always RIGHT even when the customer is wrong. In this case I happen to be right and you are beyond wrong. For this I will do everything in my power to spread the word about my experience at your place of business. I would love to come in and do a consultation regarding your service and standards and possibly increase your ratings. After checking other reviews from people who have utilized your products and services you could use the help or seriously need to look into a different program and/or training for employees."
1,"Extremely poor experience. I purchased the ""special"" in January 2017. The reason I purchased the ""Two step buff & wax"" and the ""hand wax express"" is because the salesman (sales manager) reassured me that they would be able to get the light scratches off of my paint, especially off of the hood. When I picked up my car, the specific places we spoke about when I purchased the package were not even slightly improved. When I spoke to the same sales man he backtracked and stated that he did not guarantee the success of their work. I am waiting for the owner to call me back."
1,"I hate to be a negative Nel but this place sucks! 

A friend of mine suggested I try this place for lunch, the ratings were just ok but gave it a shot anyway. 
I ordered a carne asada taco salad, you know the kind with the crispy flour tortilla bowl? Needless to say it was a mini-me version of something that wanted to be worth the 9 bucks I paid! 
The cook didn't even take time to slice the flavorless heap of meat that sat sadly on my iceberg. The person at the table next to me had a similar complaint except hers were tacos. 
This place is frequented by lots of locals 
I can't figure out why...... is there a Gold Membership we don't know about????"
1,"Wish I could give this place zero stars. Came in 2 hours before closing needed a fill and a full set for my daughter. Was told to have a seat and they would get someone to help us. Then after we're seated and waiting she tells ya she can't help us! And to come back tomorrow they're too busy. No thank you Ma'am. You should have said that when I first walked in. I'll never be back.

And you messaged me offering me a discount if I came back. Thanks but no thanks. I stand by my original review."
1,"Feeling frivolous? CB&L is for YOU!  

My girlfriends and I were in dire need of some appetizers, and we happened to stumble past Caramel Bar & Lounge (and by stumble I don't mean in a drunken stupor, we weren't at that phase yet). So, we said hello to the host standing outside of the lounge as we read the appetizer list. Sounds good to us! So we walk in and get seated.  Nice place!  Total lounge feel, great ambiance.  That is, until our experience turned sour.

We asked for a couple items off their appetizer list and some water for two of us. We were then told that they aren't serving food as it was 9:17, just minutes after they stop cooking. Bummer.  How about removing the appetizer list placed outside that draws in the crowd?  So we disappointingly said water is fine, while we make our drink selection.  

The waitress, who looked underaged and under-experienced, arrives back with two 11 oz bottles of Fiji water for each of us.  We then order our alcohol beverages - 2 vodka/redbulls and one jack/coke.  Check is given.... wait for it... waiiiiiit for it.... $71.00.  Whoa!  Really? We questioned it and assumed it had to be an error.  So the waitress checks on it and comes back to confirm it is in fact correct, that the waters were each $10 and the drinks averaged $18 a piece.   Wow. I might sound cheap, but $10 for a bottle that small should come with a happy ending of some sort.  

I finished the water pretty quickly... in a gulp practically, since there wasn't much to begin with.  My girlfriend had hers down about 75%  while she sipped on her alcohol.  Suddenly one of the staff members picks it up from the table and threw her water bottle away, without asking if she was finished!!  He just threw away dollars that we had spent! We told him his error, he apologized and talked to his manager about getting a new one.

So 5 minutes later the waitress comes by with a BELLAGIO bottle of water that looked like it was meant for a 2 year old.  You know, what comes out of their faucets probably.  At this point we're thinking:

A) If Fiji isn't worth $10, neither is your faucet water
B) If you had Bellagio water, why didn't you bring THAT the first time?!

Explaining that we weren't going to accept a substitute for water that they had thrown away at our expense,  she gets her manager who comes by, drops off a new bottle of Fiji water without saying a word and just leaves. No apology, nothing! How the HECK do you get in management being a complete d*** like that?! Please tell me, because if I treated my customers that way, I would have been fired yesterday!

Almost hate to say it, but a tip wasn't left at this place. I hope she got commission off of scandalously selling water for an absurd price.  I know it's Vegas, but that shouldn't sacrifice good service and informing your customers of their options.

Save your money and go elsewhere.  This place lures you in and then rips you off completely."
1,"Wacky Wings, how do I loathe thee, let me count the ways? In case you are the owner of Wacky Wings, ""loathe"" means ""hate."" Then again, I can't imagine that the person who runs this place knows how to read. This is someone who, when asked to describe wings, picked the word ""wacky."" 
Well, what's wrong with this place? Well, the room is a full on assault on your senses: led palm trees, taxidermied poultry, and 90s music videos. You could bottle the tacky here and sell it at Shoppers next to Jessica Simpson's newest fragrance. Do you miss Matchbox 20? Don't worry, this place is paying them plenty of royalties. I feel like my worst enemy in grade school is forcing me to listen to her _Now That's What I Call Music_ collection. Every piece of decor here seems placed to remind you of dead chickens or Chernobyl. Or dead chickens in Chernobyl. Playing pool here is mostly an exercise in trying not to step on other players and swearing at the oddly built tables. Most annoyingly, this place is saturated with a heavy dose of good old-fashioned, witless sexism (see picture, clever right?). 

The waitresses try their best, but this place is so poorly run that I can't imagine working here is a lot of fun. Good luck finding a server if you are in the pool area; they have some strange ""you can't order drinks at the bar"" policy which leaves you hunting down the last person who acknowledged your existence. 

All of this ""atmosphere"" makes me want to barf. And that's before you order the food. Even the picture of the chicken on the menu kind of looks like tiny pigs screaming for freedom. The fluorescent tinge that dominates the room seems somehow to be mixed into meals. I know what neon tastes like now, and it is not good my friends.
So if you are a sexist whose taste buds have melted off from a meth accident, I guess this place would be OK for you."
1,"Today was a cold and blustery day in fine YYC. Having to brave the blowing snow to run another errand and having intended to try this place out sooner, my partner and I decided this was a great day to splurge on a rich, high calorie take out food. Upon entering the building we found the interior to be very pleasing. It had a homey and folksy feel. There were some cool vintage pictures on the wall. The counter service was pleasant enough, if not overly friendly. 

Why do I spend so much time telling you about my day and the decor? Even thinking about the two shockingly small boxes of vomit inducing, $20 worth of mush inside induces my gag reflex again and disappoints me so much. Recycling appeared to be important to them from the signs in the store, and that sure explains their portion size, as it means less garbage headed for the landfill. Especially in the face of how long we have waited to try this place. We ordered different kinds, they were both utterly disgusting. They both had unmelted curds and tasted probably a little better on the way up when body heat partially melted them. You will enjoy the taste of a big box fast food store much better, and I used to think that was poor quality poutine.  Today, Big Cheese Poutinery lowered the bar for us significantly."
1,"Terrible delivery service. First time was over 2 hours to arrive. The driver didn't speak English and had no clue what I was saying to him on the phone. Driver went back to the restaurant and the Manager delivered the food. 

Second time was just as bad. Same non English speaking driver and a repeat performance. It's been 90 mins and the food has still not arrived. Called the restaurant and was advised the driver is having GPS issues. I live 3 blocks from the restaurant. 

Never again. Too many choices out there to deal with this."
1,Yuck! Food old and service was terrible! Dont try askin for sushi the wont make it for you with out a bad attitude. Will not return!
1,"Today ...What we ordered (to go) from Waffle House #1797 in Tempe, AZ: 
1st Meal - 3 eggs, double order bacon, hash browns, grits, raison toast; 
2nd Meal - 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, toast, waffles.

WHAT WE PAID (Cash):  $23.77

Missing FROM BOTH MEALS was ALL THE BLASTED MEAT !  
There was NO bacon in either meal;
There was NO sausage;
There was NO meat in either meal !!

And the receipt ...it was a ""REPRINT"" (??) so NONE of our ordered items appeared (??!!????).
What's going on at THIS Waffle House?????!!    What kind of con game are they up to????

We are not NOT happy!  
We called the Waffle House immediately & they offered NO explanation or remedy; told us to go online & complain.
So here we are!!!

This is the SECOND bad experience with this Waffle House #1797.
The 1st bad experience is when we used our credit card at this SAME Waffle House ...then 1 day later, our bank called & said ""possible fraud activity on the account"" and the amount was HUNDREDS (100's) of dollars !!  Fortunately, our bank watches closely & they declined the charge, canceled our credit card and issued us a new card with new numbers.

THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!  ...and it's the LAST time we'll go to THIS Waffle House or any other Waffle House !!
And we're certainly going to let our friends & family know about BOTH incidents, so they dine elsewhere too."
1,"Horrible experience. The one star comes from the food (I'll give it to them, it's tasty). However, the service was so incredibly poor -- but when gratuity is automatically built in I suppose there's no urgency with a larger party."
1,"Went there thinking we could grab a quick meals... it wasn't a game night or event night so assumed it would be fairly quiet.  Got there, asked how long the wait was - was told 45-60 minutes.  Half of the restaurant was empty, lots of empty tables and booths.  Asked if we could sit in one of them empty ones and we were told no, we cannot seat you for at least 45 minutes.  We asked why and the hostess said just because without a particular reason.  Doesn't make sense.  Will not be going back here again."
1,"Terrible service.  They shorted out order.  Mistakes happen, but they weren't even apologetic. Very disappointing. We will not come back."
1,This place has good food. But bad customer service. We waited 15 mins to get service. This will be the last time I come here. This fucking place is covered in FLIES!!!!! Ever heard of a fly trap? Or cleaning??!!
1,My wife was eating her food and the waitress attempted to take her food from her. Then the waitress brought a box as my wife was still eating and kept coming back for asking for us to pay the check. My wife left there in tears. I will never come back here.
1,"I used a Groupon for a mini-detail of my Ford Thunderbird on March 13, 2017.  As soon as I pulled up and told the person who approached my car that I had an appointment and a Groupon for a hand wax, he tried to sell me another $60 worth of leather ""cleaning and conditioning"" for the interior of the car.  I declined.  I then had to fill out paperwork for the detail while the car, always within my eyesight, was vacuumed. They missed the trunk.
When I started to walk into the lobby with the paperwork, I was approached by Javier, who told me that I had a chip in my windshield.  To my knowledge, he had not approached my car, which was now in the car wash.  He told me not to worry, if I had ""glass coverage"" on my car, because they could fix the chip and call in the problem to the ""glass center,"" who would take over from there.  He then realized that the car was already in the wash, and promised to meet me ""on the other side.""
As I sat in the lobby and waited, I saw the car driven out of the wash, and two apparently experienced workers cleaned the inside and the windshield.  While this was going on, an elderly woman with a cane walked into the lobby with an employee by her side.  He was holding a clipboard and had a cell phone.  They were about 20 feet from me, but speaking very loudly.  He was telling her that he was going to call the ""glass center"" and that they would ""process her claim"" for her.  All she had to do once he got them on the line was to give them her information and tell them that her windshield had been chipped by a truck on Interstate 10.
He called them and put them on speaker phone, handing the phone to her.  To my horror, the woman on the other end of the call elicited from her the following:  her name, address, telephone number, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, email address and all of her auto insurance information(she was holding her insurance card).  The woman at the ""glass center"" told her that she would receive an email with all of the claims information in a few days.  
I am a retired criminal defense attorney, and I used to work in the insurance business in the property/casualty area.  What this poor woman I am certain did not understand is that the ""glass center,"" in addition to getting all of her personal information, was going to make a claim on her comprehensive coverage.  It seems to me that there is some kind of kick back arrangement going on with TNT and whatever this ""glass center"" is.  Anyone who drives a car knows that a chip doesn't always turn into a crack. 
My car:  they actually did a pretty good job cleaning and waxing it.  The scam they appear to be running:  if you are a woman there by yourself, be prepared to be told that you have a chip in your windshield, etc.  DO NOT fall for this!  It will cost you money in the long run.  BTW, my windshield DID NOT have a chip, as examined later by me and my husband.  I wanted to intervene when I was observing what was happening to the elderly woman, but I didn't want anything ""mysterious"" to happen to my car before I got out of that place."
1,"This steakhouse has a colossally dumb business model:

1. Open up in a lower-end, off-strip casino.
2. Have domestic AND japanese wagyu at ultra-high prices.
3. Have only TWO other beef choices on the menu: a 6 and a 10 oz prime filet mignon.

So that means: no prime rib-eye....no new york... no sirloin...no prime rib...no portherhouse! 
If you want anything other than filet mignon, you must pay the wagyu prices of $70 or $85 a steak! (see menu pics)

Did I mention that this restaurant is in the Westgate, which isn't much more than a time-share masquerading as a casino?

One should never use the words ""Westgate"" and ""Wagyu"" in the same sentence; that's what I call Culinary Cognitive Dissonance."
1,"I don't know where to begin. This was the absolute worst Embassy Suites I've ever stayed in.  I'm kicking myself for not reading the reviews before checking in. I've never had a bad experience with Embassy Suites and trusted the name... Never again. As soon as we drove up I felt uneasy...the local area was not very inviting. The hotel was dirty/dusty and not well maintained.  It was obvious all cleaning was on the surface level... The furniture,  elevators, hallways, etc was just ugh... The blanket in our room had not been washed and had a really bad odor. We asked for a new blanket and the girl that delivered it to us had a nasty attitude and asked ""what's wrong with the one you got"" . My husband told her to SMELL IT... She responded ""no I won't be doing that""  then handed him the new blanket and walked away. The breakfast was not good.... At all. They didn't keep the dining area clean. Food was everywhere on the floor. This place is ghetto. There's a club across the street and apparently this is the place the locals choose to stay after a night of partying... Trust me,  it was some very unsavory characters roaming around this place. Oh,  I forgot to mention the gunshots we heard overnight in the area. Never ever ever again will I stay here when I come to Charlotte.  And never again will I stay in another hotel blindly due to the name alone. As a hilton honors member,  I was extremely disappointed."
1,"Where have all the good Chinese restaurants gone? I recently moved to this side of town and decided that I would try it out. 

I got the vegetable lo mein, easy enough, nothing that should be messed up in a Chinese place. I called ahead and it was all ready when I came to pick it up 15 minutes later. The lady was nice but I guess decided to jack up the price $2 from the menu. I didn't say anything, but actions spoke louder than words and I left no tip. The restaurant is FILLED with cans of food all over, so obviously nothing is fresh. Gross. 

I decided to not let the experience at the restaurant ruin it for me so I went home with an open mind, hoping to find a treasure. Well all I found was junk. The noodles were slimy and had a weird thick gooey sauce (from a can) smothered all over it. My one piece of broccoli could hardly mark it as a vegetable dish, so they added a pound of cabbage. I don't mind cabbage but that is not what I ordered and it is a very cheap substitute for a plate full of real veggies. 

I will never be going back. I will though continue my search for good food in Henderson! Wish me luck..."
1,Wheat beer an more wheat beer. Taps are terrible. It's either wheat beer or an IPA that's it.After all this they let a bunch of drunks in and served them. They didn't control the situation awful experience. I had to confront the unruly gang an was thanked by the other patrons for putting the drunks in check. Drunk golfers that get to much sun.
1,"It used to be pretty good when the previous owners ran it, (you can see who they were, their picture is still on the wall on the left).
The portions are smaller, service is slower and it isn't the same by any means. I used to LOVE the Shrimp Pad Thai, but it's not even close to what it was.
There are only a few booths for patrons to sit down and dine in, but now there is a hand written sign on the walls, ""Clean up your plates before you leave""
Shouldn't you be happy people are dining in your place of business? that sign seems very unfriendly and unwelcoming. It only takes a few seconds to bus a persons plates, but there aren't even plates used, they are those cheap cheap cheap dollar store styrofoam plates, low budget, low quality....
It used to be good here, not anymore. I've enjoyed the food quality here while it lasted."
1,"Not impressed. Terrible service. Took 20+ minutes to get food, and then the orders were not completed (hash browns weren't done right, waffle came out way later than the rest of the food). She brought out multiple drinks for each of us at our already crowded table. Not impressed."
1,Don't ever waste your time here!!  Walked in sat & waited 10 mins no one greeted no coffee nothing. It was Sunday morning 8:30 and not busy. The place was dirty floor was sticky and tables not clean. We left as we arrived receiving nothing not even a greeting or water. I spoke with the manager who along with other staff were all having a social hour among themselves and she seemed indifferent and care less that we were walking out. As we departed the were laughing and happy to not work. All should be fired and establishment closed. Encourage health inspector check this horrible place out!!!
1,I've learned my lesson. Do not come here when it's not busy! Like 8:30 on a Tuesday night. The food had obviously been sitting out for awhile and most things were cold and unappetizing. They didn't even have someone behind the counter doing the Mongolian BBQ... :( Very sad.
1,Today we used a free firecracker wash card which we were given because they busted the rear wiper on our Vehicle. After the wash there were still bugs splats on the front and bird poop on the side. After looking around the vehicle in the sun you could see that they missed spots around the lights and plates the inside the dash was missed around the dash controls and the door panels.
1,"Really lousy service and poutine to be honest.

Someone please explain to me what the big deal is with the Big cheese poutinerie...


Terrible"
1,"We found a bottle cap in our drink, waitress apologized and said manager would come...guess what after 30 minutes no one.  Its obvious they don't care about their clients or cleanliness.  Would never come back.  Be careful next time someone may find a finger in their drink."
1,This poor guy. He's in the office managing instead of paying attention and leading his staff. I'll never go back. The worst excuse  for a business I've ever experienced. When I complained he offered a free wash instead of refunding my money. Pitiful experience. Keep putting up with crapy service and that's what you'll get! Never again!
1,"I purchased the mini detail on groupon. I made an appt a week prior. When I arrived the guy had no record of my appt. He also had no idea what the Groupon was. Then proceeded to tell me I can pick 2 out of 3 services... Seats, vinyl or carpet. I chose vinyl and seats. This also included a wash. He tried giving me the basic but after pulling up the Groupon offer I showed it was the extreme wash. Waited over an hour and a half (that was fine. Waiting room inside is decent). I go out to check my car. They had not wiped the vinyl. Did not vacuum the carpeting. And there was suddenly a hole in my drivers seat. They insisted I only get a wash and seats with the Groupon.. Ok, that's fine. But wash states it includes vacuuming and wiping interior. Then, when I inquired on the hole they insisted it was there. It was not. They didn't speak English so I went in to talk to the cashier. She filled out a report. This is over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard anything. I've called...nothing. I've emailed... Nothing. This is ridiculous. Never should have taken my car there. Beware!!"
1,If I could give this place zero stars I would. This place has got to be the most disgusting Mexican place I have ever ate at!!!! Their meat was overcooked and flavorless.  Salsa had no flavor at all!! Even their tortillas were bad!! So please don't listen to want anybody else has to say about this place.  It should be illegal to sell food this bad!!!
1,"(we stayed here May 15-19, 2011) 
we went to our room and the moment i walked in i could smell mold. I am allergic to it so i went to look up at the air vents and it was visible there was mold. We called to the front desk to have us moved, when we got to our new room it was not as bad as the first but i could tell it wasn't good. We turned off the air for the night since it was very late. I called maintenance first thing the next morning and they said someone would come take care of it. When we got back that afternoon it didn't seem like anything was done. I got the manager on the phone and had them send maintenance back up. I asked the man if he opened the vents up and cleaned them and he said no so i asked him to take the vents off so i could show him what was in there. It was disgusting! I asked how often they clean the vents and he said ""they are supposed to clean them once a year"" but it is obvious they don't. See the pictures i added of their vents.
Do not stay here unless you want to breath in mold!"
1,"Very expensive.  
The chicken wings were not cooked properly and it just not worth the hype."
1,"In response to Marc R.s response: First off I do not know what my truck being a 90's has to do with anything, because as I watched your in experienced careless employees spray directly onto my distributer and everywhere else that any other experienced detailer would have known not spray. Does not matter if my vehicle is a 1990 or 2017.  Your employees careless regard to what they are doing would have ruined any vehicle. Also, that is a complete lie that I was advised about the waiver, this is exactly what I was told that I was initialing , that my vehicle had no check engine light on, and it did not! That was it! Another complete lie, Brian was not the one told me of the condition of my vehicle, the only reason I knew was because I watched them mess up our vehicle so I personally went out and checked. Still to this day, Brian has yet to tell me what happened, he avoids our calls and talking to us face to face. It is funny you say any pre-existing conditions on our vehicle would have caused this, yet I had no problems driving it 30 miles one way to your location and 2 days prior  passed emissions with flying colors. The only reason our car is not running is the lack of training and experience by your employees. Had they had the proper training or cared about the customers car this would have not happened. And, yes there is a proper way to clean an engine. For your information I managed a carwash in Vegas, so I know what I am talking about. Thank you for ruining our vehicle and if your yelp reviews are a representation of how you run your business you probably won't be in business long. 


If I could rate negative that's what it would be! No stars, just negative! Do not recommend! Went with a running vehicle, now it won't start! Had to have our vehicle towed home. I absolutely DO NOT recommend ever taking your car to TNT off 91st and Northern. Should have read the Yelp reviews before going there. Everyone of their locations gets bad reviews. They are the reason for this tow. Brian one of the managers blame other managers, ignore phone calls, state owner will be in touch, just a whole lot of lip service. They could care less about their customers, or Vets for that matter. Had a perfectly running vehicle when brought there. All about making a buck, I mean who cares if your vehicle won't start after the service they did, 3 days later and here we are. Your lack of business ethics disgusts me. Never again!"
1,"Terrible customer service!  Came in just for ice cream, and received such bad attitude from the server, and he even quoted us the wrong price!  Even when I pulled out my calculator to prove it to him, he still wouldn't acknowledge it and continued to give attitude.  Manager came out and was reasonable, and offered to make things right, but at that point it was such a bad experience.  It was our first time there, but will definitely never come back or recommend to friends, train your servers to work on their customer service skills."
1,"That was the most disgusting Chinese food ever. It smelled so good but when I looked at it I knew something was wrong. I ordered the combination rice.....It suppose to come with chicken, shrimp and BBQ pork. Okay.....The pork was not BBQ it was raw, warmed meat....the chicken was chewy looking and undercooked, the shrimp looked warmed as well. It seems like they may microwave their food, which explains how fast it was prepared. I didn't even eat it. I had already tasted the egg roll, and little chips they provided, which was the only thing I had....Now my throat is starting to close and tongue is swelling. I'm allergic to crab and I hope they didn't cook it in the same oil...My husband ordered the veggie with tofu meal...Its called the Buddha delight. He threw his out too after we began reading the reviews on here. Soooo we just wasted money on crap food. I'm reporting them to Action13 news or something because honestly I don't think they're up to code."
1,"Took my car in for a wash today. Got the supreme wash which is their middle tier. $16.99 and they charge an extra $1.00 because I have a minivan. No problem. I have the custom mats that are the shape of my van floor as well as smaller Walmart mats because I drive rideshare & want that extra protection.  This is the 3rd time in a row now that I have gotten my van back only to find that they didn't vacuum my smaller mats or bother to move any of them aside to vacuum under them. The third time in a row they didn't spray the air freshener that comes with my package or wipe out the cup holders. 

Of course, management is always like, ""Please let us know & we'll fix it!"" but I don't have the time or patience to do that every single time I take my car to have it washed. It adds an extra 20 plus minutes to the time I spend there. While I was there, two other customers whose cars had gone in before mine had to make them finish their cars and as a result they were still sitting there when I left. No thanks. I'm done with this place.

UPDATE: Please note the completely indifferent and dismissive response from TNT. Of all I listed - he only sarcastically referenced the small mats? Wow, TNT... I really appreciate your concern for my satisfaction as your customer & your desire for my continued patronage!  Thank you!"

The bar was full and the only seating available was at a table - so we looked at the ""bottle service"" menu. Holy sweet Jebus - $352 for a bottle of Belvedere vodka?? Seriously, for that kind of money there better be something more included with it - either caviar, a foot massage or a lap dance for hubby (or all three). But no, that is the price for a bottle and the mixers. 

We walked right back out. Screw the waived cover charge."
1,"Tacos might be delicious but service is 
always slow and at times particularly rude. Today I had the pleasure of watching two women eat behind the register while I waited 20 minutes for my tacos. Will no longer recommend this place."
1,"I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, but this place was just horrible. My partner and I have recently moved from Vancouver to Calgary and were on the hunt for vegetarian poutine. Alas, we had to look no further than our front door step as 'The Big Cheese' looked so promising. 

I opted for the original veggie poutine. My boyfriend took the first bite (sneaky) and gushed 'Wow, that's hot' and not hot as in temperature hot. He meant hot as in THAT SPICE IS BURNING MY MOUTH OFF hot. I swear a whole pot of pepper was added along with a handful of chili flakes. Why? Why would you do this, my mouth is burning! Maybe they did this so you had to also buy a drink, which we did. The next disappointment came in terms of the cheese curds. There were about four on the top layer, honestly, literally four cheese curds on a LARGE poutine. The final disappointment came in the form of the fries. They were burnt (both me and my boyfriend had several BLACK fries in our 'poutine', and if they weren't blackened they were the bits of fries that no one wants to eat anyway - obviously been sitting in the botton of the deep fryer for 10 years. The worst poutine I have ever tasted.

Cheers Big Cheese for the bad tummy."
1,"For those with little patience (which I completely understand having just wasted three hours of my life at Edge Steakhouse): 
Don't eat here! the steak is great, as you would EXPECT for any $70+ steak, most everything else is good but not mind blowing. The service was horrendous and for the price I was left having the least satisfying dining experience of my whole life. I've had food poisoning I enjoyed more than eating here. 

The longer:

I was at a convention, me and my colleagues were very hungry after a long day and already at the Westgate, we decided to eat at Edge vs more than a dozen other good steakhouses in Vegas, purely for convenience. 

After being seated our party of five looked at the menu and figured at those prices we were at least going to have the best dinner of our trip. Nope. 

Our appetizers took forever, I will say that the bone marrow flatbread was delicious. Really it was the only stand out dish of the night. The waiter even apologized about how long it was all taking and bought us a round of drinks. 

They did have a few other large parties come in, but they were not full, and this is frickin vegas. And you're in a casino. If you can't handle it when it's busy literally stay out of the kitchen, and the dining room too. Every course came out painfully slow. Salad was fine, Panera makes better (and has a drive through). Steak as stated was good. How hard is that to mess up really? Truffle fries weren't as good as the ones I had two days ago at Umami Burger. Dessert (7layer chocolate cake) was good, no more. 

3 hours people. Maybe a hair over. It took 20 minutes to get our bills!! My water glass didn't get refilled for the last 50 minutes I sat there!!!  

My waiter, Mark, must have been ecstatic when we asked for split tickets (business trip remember) because turns out in parties that size (5) they include a whopping 20% gratuity when you split the ticket. Of course, he didn't tell us that until he brought the bills. He made out because I felt he deserved a kick to the groin instead. 

My bill was just under 200 all together, that's right, for that much you can eat at Ruth's Chris, Morton's and probably 174 independent steakhouses in the US and have killer service. I only kept my mouth shut to not cause a scene with business associates. In retrospect I wish I'd left after the appetizers and gone for fast food."
1,Mediocre.  I haven't been there in a few years.  Perhaps I'm just not a fan of Chinese food anymore because I dislike Panda Express too.
1,"I knew the cheap prices were too good to be true.  I still had dog hair in my car and the armor-all they use to make the interior look dark,  they only touched some areas so there are stripes of untouched interior and it looks awful.  Doesn't even look like they cleaned my leather seats as there's dog hair still on them too.  Over all a shitty excuse for a detail job.  Never going back and I suggest anyone else finds another place to wash their car or do detail work."
1,"First person in line at the car wash this morning, took 40 minutes to wash my van. They left lots of protectant in globs on my floor mats, my windows are all spotty, and they used about a gallon ugh whatever liquids they use to make the scent.   They even managed to get some of that protective stuff on my paperwork in the front of the van.  Currently having the one with the windows down to breathe! Very very poor job!"
1,"If you are en route to this place because you have been enticed by the $3.99 price point, turn around right now. I made the mistake of attending this place yesterday and, if there had been any room to turn my car around and leave, I would have. After sitting in line for 10 minutes while workers stood around without offering any explanation as to why things were moving so slowly, I finally made it into the actual car wash. My car was stopped TWO times while in the wash, for more than two minutes each time. No explanation from managers, no concern from workers. Absolutely unbelievable. When I got out of the wash I immediately pulled over to make sure there wasn't any damage to my car. Luckily there wasn't, but this was the most unprofessional place I have ever been. They pack cars so close together in the wash (1-2 inches apart) that it is a miracle each car comes out without being attached to those in front and behind. Beware and do NOT use this place"
1,"Disappointing and irritating would sum up this experience. We came here with the intention of ordering a quick to-go meal to satisfy a random craving of dumplings I had. Having been here before, regardless of the fact that their food by no means is standout, we figured we'd give their dumplings a shot as they were the closest place we could think of that had dumplings. We walked into a restaurant with maybe 6 people waiting around for food. It took the owner a few minutes to emerge from the kitchen to take our very simple order of some hot and sour soup, potstickers and wontons. This is an order which by no means should take a long time as most of it just involved boiling the preprepared meals. We proceeded to have to wait OVER AN HOUR for our food. At least a few other irritated customers voiced their opinions about how long the wait had taken. I never had anticipated waiting that long as my previous experiences there were NEVER this busy nor hectic. When finally actually eating the food, we found it to be about how we expected. Nothing in the least bit near spectacular or exciting considering the anticipation and cravings we had. The hot and sour soup was alright considering there's really not many options out in the Henderson area. It actually was a bit sour and spicy considering most places that have hot and sour soup have neither of the above. The dumplings were nothing special and nor was the wonton soup.

The food was subpar, the wait was absolutely ridiculous considering the simplicity of our order. They simply were way too understaffed and didn't have the decency of forewarning their diners that there would be an incredibly long wait. Instead, they chose to try and take on all orders at an incredibly slow pace, and proceed to cook the food even slower. This is not a place I would recommend if you're looking for a nice meal that you'll be at least satisfied with what you paid for. For the hour wait for your food, you'd be better of driving to Spring Mountain and actually getting a decent meal."
1,"We stopped by for breakfast and ordered chicken enchilada plate and my brother a chicken quesadilla. Chicken was super hard(old most likely) and dark, couldn't eat it. We left after taking a couple bites. The person at the counter was nice and had a smile, but food was terrible and its typical ""Mexican food"". I usually stay away from places advertised as "" Authentic"", but we were hungry, oh well you live and you learn."
1,This place is disgusting the food is horrible do not waste your money. They don't have a variety and what they do have it's under cook poorly made
1,ew. i will never go back. just thinking about my experience makes me want to vom.
1,"This place doesn't have a good reputation but I was in a hurry. When I called all the person who greeted me on the phone said was ""hello"". And that's it. I asked is this car wash? ""Yeah"". Ok. She handed me off to someone who said that it would be $69.00 and they'd throw in a free exterior wash worth $21.00 and he'd have it done in an hour. As soon as I got there he tried to raise the price to $120. I said no. I needed my car detailed because a crazy person climbed in and peed in my car. This was no problem on the phone but now it was. Since I wouldn't pay for the full detailing he would have to charge another twenty dollars because of the pee. They then charged me for the $69 detailing and the $21 car wash which he said would be free. The handwritten slip he gave me did not match the receipt. The employees trash talk their boss Mark (maybe Mike) who must be the most charitable person in Peoria to hire these people. They were supposed to steam and shampoo the seats and floor, and shampoo the carpets. The guys doing the work outside seem


Your reply to my review is ridiculous. I fully explained the situation before I came in. Your salesperson (salesman, person who sells things) was just up selling. Your employee who answered the phone did so with no respect and a all around poor attitude. The car was not cleaned as promised inside or out. The sodas from your fountain dispenser tasted like ass and your own employees openly mocked you. I was sitting there watching and listening for over an hour and it was a shit show deluxe. You don't understand my complaint? You sir are a baboons ass and a terrible manager. Merry Christmas."
1,"This place is HORRIBLE. it is SHADY very very SHADY. I went to get a car wash and the started selling me things that i did't even want but they gave me a good deal on transmission flush, oil change, and headlights cleaning. when i went to pick up my car NOTHING was done the THREE STEP BUFFING was not done i don't even think they did the oil change and the transmission flush. I told the representative which did not have any customer service he told me well YOU can't have your keys without paying the $200. no manager was on duty. some guy with a bunch of tattoos is in charge i guess. DON'T GO HERE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"So ridiculous! They mail me a coupon with there name and address on it and then don't want to take it. She says, It's an old coupon! I say, it doesn't have an expiration  date on it. Ok she says with total attitude, next time we won't take it.  I say ok, next time don't mail out coupons with no expiration date and next time I'll just go to Red Dragon.  Seriously every time I come here these older ladies are so unfriendly and act like you bringing your business into their establishment is burdening them.  Compliments to the men and the cooks who know how to give good food and good customer service. After 6 years of faithfully going, referring, and bringing friends and family to China City, I'm done!  So sad but done"
1,"The vibe is nice, the music is good, the atmosphere chill. BUT I do have a problem when I'm the only female at the bar and in order to even be acknowledged I have to wave around my $100 bill= I don't like it one bit!! And I'm honestly pretty attractive so I was extra pissed at this bc it would've never happened back home in Chicago. 
P.S the drinks are wayyyy overpriced...honestly you're better off getting tipsy at the bar RIGHT outside the entrance then walking in to chill and listen to music, but that's just a thought"
1,"Went to check this place out on a Friday night around 830,sort of busy, got seated, started getting food and noticed half of these trays were empty, I asked 2 employees if they were going to put more food out since they didn't close until 1030 they both said yes, 20 min later,nothing.  I asked to speak to a manager and so she came and I asked if they were planning on putting more food out she stated that WE WOULD HAVE TO ASK HER SPECIFICALLY to put food out and I said I heard 2 other customers ask for more food, she smiled and said no one has asked me, so she then proceeds to asks what ""items"" i would like more of and I pointed out 3 trays, and 35 minutes later she only had 1 out, we then left, very dissatisfied and paid $60 for 2 adults and 3 children.  Never again. Save your money!!"
1,"Ordered two slices of pizza, cashier said ""only one left I'll bring the other one to your table"". Fifteen minutes later I went back to the counter. After five minutes I had to call it to her. Claimed my pizza had just come out and cook was slicing it. Five minutes later she literally drops a plate with two slices of personal pizza  on my table and says this is all we have. No apology before hurrying away."
1,"My experience here is what drove me to create an account on Yelp and give this place but one star. My younger brother, age 17, and myself, age 21, decided to try this buffet for the first time at 7pm on a Wednesday night. 

Immediately as we walked in we were greeted with judgemental stares as the staff spoke to each other in a different language then finally told us we had to pay first before we were sat. I didn't think much of this, since other buffets do this, until we watched as other families after us were kindly greeted and quickly taken to their tables. This kind of discrimination is what made us uncomfortable during our dining experience at China City Buffet. 

The food was better than we expected, especially the sushi, but it would have been much better had the staff not treated us as if we were some kids, up to no good, who would run out of the restaurant without paying. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone with a family or simply anyone who looks over the age of 21 since they will not provide good service if they think you'll run out on the bill, which is why they will make only you pay before you can even sit down."
1,"Terrible car wash. First time visit, but never again. The service writer was friendly but that's the only positive thing I can say for this place. Terrible wipe down job, terrible front seat floor area vacuuming. It's on me that I didn't inspect my car before I drove off, but I don't feel I should have to do that. You pay for a service and expect it to be worth the money. I do anyway."
1,This place is terrible!! You would be better off stopping at a High School band car wash. They are super slow and do a poor job.
1,"This place is located next to my house and very convenient for me.  After countless times leaving disappointed and disgusted I have finally wrote off going to this place for good. I'm not sure a business could be run more poorly than this place. Usually I'll pull up for a car wash and wait way too long for someone to come take my ticket. Most times there are multiple workers including what seems to be managers just standing around and looking at me. Half the times I need to ask them to come help me and the last few times I've literally drove away without going through the wash that I paid for because I was soo frustrated. 

Don't fall for the new owner / new management signs, seem to do this quite often and the workers/service never changes."
1,"A group of is come to Las Vegas often and always stay at what is now the Westgate. We always have dinner at the steak house at least one night during out stay. They have increased their prices on their steaks to out of this world prices, almost doubled. How can a steak cost $70 and not even be Waygu or Kobe. We are not poor or cheap people, but we won't be going to the steakhouse anymore. There are MANY good steak restaurants in LV."
1,"Tables are always dirty and sticky, pizza is good but hit or miss most of the time. To much inconsistency to come back. I'd rather eat costco where I know it will be good every time. Looks like this place used to be better."
1,Absolute worst place to eat. The food was very undercooked and cold. The staff seemed sweet but they weren't very customer service oriented. I will never eat here again.
1,"I will only go into lazy daisy's cafe if my regular cafe down the street is closed, simply because the service is horrible. The baristas are pretentious and rude! I've never felt welcomed by the staff. With all of great cafés in the area, this one is NOT worth your time or money."
1,Terrible. Turned off jukebox at 6 on a Saturday night. The manager was very inconsiderate of our financial loss. They let parents get hammered in front of their kids but do not allow any uptempo music. Priorities. Food was mediocre and the bar was very boring. Would never come here or recommend to any friends or family. Seems like a silver sneakers club.
1,"The worst pizza I have ever had. I ordered delivery for my friends and I the pizza shows up over 30 minutes after an initial wait time of 1 hour... So it took 1.5 hours. The pizza was soggy and greasy, the wings were hard and fatty.

Honestly it sucked and I feel like I got ripped off - not to mention all the apologies and feeling like a horrible host to my friends. I called back and explained, but they seemed like high school phone girls who don't understand I can care less about getting a discount on my next purchase because I'm not going to order this EVER again. Personally I thought it would be a step up from dominos but I was proved wrong.. Now I know 2 pizza places that deliver to my house and suck.

I've had celery before, but celery in a plain brown bag ( with no container just a dirty ragged brown bag) is a first for me. As much as this placed made me nauseated and they can't take the horrid taste out of my mouth they did reach a new low for me in terms of pizza/service."
1,"no please avoid.
fire alarms going off all night long.
loud party in common area.
long lines for food.
screaming children everywhere.
over-crowded ... avoid!!"
1,DO NOT ORDER THE HORRIBLE MILKSHAKES. Worst milkshakes ever and the cashier had a HORRIBLE attitude. If you're miserable work somewhere where you don't have to deal with living people. Extremely rude. Wasn't that great. I would definitely NOT go back. Get fries and gravy at KFC instead. Tastes better and no attitude from the wannabe hipster cashier. Boo on her.
1,"I would've given this place negative stars, since I can't they get one star.

First off, I noticed they had that ""hurry up and buy"" stank attitude as soon as we walked through the door.
This place is called China City...my ass! They had no more than 30 selections of food to choose from. Everything lacked flavor, and the buffet area wreaked of that steamed rag smell they use to wipe around the heating pans. 

So, my family and I were literally seated five minutes before the waitress started walking by our table staring at us every few minutes as if she was ready for us to leave. After about 30 minutes, this heffa starts clearing our plates without asking if we were finished. Shortly after this, she  put the tabs on the table. Really?! We hadn't even made an attempt to get dessert, so my patience was running really thin with her.

Needless to say the food sucked so badly, so did the lack of customer service. Myself or my family will never visit this overpriced dump again.

By the way, when it was time to pay at the front register, about 6 of the employees crowded around the register as if we were going to run out on a bill. I should've walked out, seeing that we spent $76 bucks for completely sh!tty food. Skip this crap hole and go to Lins if you're in the mood for an Asian buffet.

Spending your hard earned money in establishments where your presence appears to be more of a nuisance is asinine, that is the reason they can sit on an spicy egg roll because I'll never dine here again."
1,"Would be nice to have a table to sit at-all tables were not bussed and there was a big spill in the floor with a sign that wasn't attended to for 15 min. 
Too bad, because any table that wasn't filled with -dishes was not clean/wiped off-filled w crumbs or grease. :("
1,"The biggest thing that irks me about this place is that they're a complete rip-off of Smoke's Poutinerie in Toronto (http://smokespoutinerie.com/Default.aspx). I did my research before writing this review to see if there was a connection between the two businesses but there doesn't seem to be. 

Complete with plaid, an eerily similar menu, and a black and white character plastered all over, this has the complete makings of Smoke's. There's only one thing different here: The poutine isn't as good.

My first trip here was in early June, not long after they opened. The fries were soggy and the gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese. I chalked this up to them just having opened and was willing to give them another try on a future trip to Calgary.

I came back this weekend after a night out with a friend. I thought that maybe some slight intoxication might make things better for me here. Not really. The fries were better and the cheese melted but it still didn't taste that great. I'd probably give the poutine here a solid three stars, but never anything more."
1,"Worst Embassy Suites Ive been to in my life. They need to remodel the rooms, it doesnt feel like a hotel at all it feels like im in a cheap motel. Shuttle was 30 mins late and the breakfast opened so late. It says they open at 6am and we waited till 6:45 but they havent served the food yet, so we just left to catch up for our flight after wasting almost an hour of waiting for the food... Worst hotel ever! Dont be fooled by the name, my family and i love Embassy suites  but this one is just awfully bad.  Not worth staying at all, id rather go to hyatt or renaissance just next door next time Im here."
1,"Stopped by during a brief trip to the area. The food here was very heavy of lard, or whatever they use to cook everything in. Made me slightly ill from sitting in my tummy undigested. Blah. 

I'll pass next time."
1,"Considering the location I thought this would be a good breakfast place. Sadly I was mistake. The Restaurant smells dirty. There hole staff is ghetto and trash. They have employs wearing street cloths were our food was being cooked. No one was wearing hair net's and some employs were not even wearing gloves wall handeling food. All employees were loudly talking about drinking, partying, and other inappropriate things. 
The food it's self was alright for the price you pay."
1,"Worst experience I've ever had at a car wash. I went yesterday April 13th, 2017 around 5:20p.m to get my small SUV washed. I pulled up asked for the extreme car wash (23.99), the guy printed out the ticket and I walked to the kohl's that is in the parking lot to make a return. When I returned 12 minutes later my car was still in the same spot, mind you there was only one car ahead of me when I first got there. I went inside grabbed an ice cream, paid, and sat down to eat. I had a nice little conversation with the lady working inside, and then I proceeded outside to watch my car get finished. I was quite surprised to find my car still hadn't come through and there were no cars or people there. I sat down and 2 minutes later my car came through. 3 guys started working on my car, then one got in and drove off, I was shocked, he took it to go through again, but didn't bother saying anything to me. 3 other cars came through before mine made it through again, and instead of finishing mine when it came through the men kept working on the other cars. I had been there for over 30 minutes at this point and was furious. I got up gave them my paid slip and said I was leaving. When I left I called the car wash and asked for a manager, a gentlemen said hold on a minute. 4 minutes later a woman came on and asked how she could help. I explained the situation, she apologized and said to. Ring it back in tomorrow and tell them when I pulled up that Barbara said to complete the wash. I asked how I knew I wouldn't have to wait as long for the same service and she said she would let them know to get me through quickly. So I went back today April 14th, 2017 at 4:14, I pulled up the gentleman asked if I had already been through (my window still had the writing from the day before). I  explained the story to him and he said well we can do it, but it won't be fast, we are busy today. I could tell there were a lot of people there today and I wasn't expecting it to be 10 minutes or anything, but the fact that I had already waited 30 minutes the day before and that the manger had promised quick service should have meant that they would try and get me in and out as quickly as possible. Instead he told me right off the bat that it wouldn't be quick. I asked him just to get the writing off my window and I left. So I ended up paying 23 dollars just to have he outside of my car washed. I called back and they said Barbara wasn't in today, so I decided to write a review instead. I am quite irritated and upset over this experience."
1,"Today I thought I would treat myself to a little less work. Turned into the worst decision I could have made and more trouble than it was worth. I came in and asked to have my car detailed and washed because I had recently traveled with my dog, day hair was everywhere. The carnival barker they passed as a salesman up sold me and made me feel  like I was getting a great deal. So I optimistically paid asked for a estimate of completion from the cashier and waited for my car to be done. 
I waited and waited and waited for 2hours until I had no more patience. So I walk in ask what's taking so long and I'm accompanied back to my car to explain that it's so hard to clean up dog hair and they couldn't have finished any faster. He also talked down to me saying that i shouldn't have asked for a time estimate from the cashier and I should have gone to him. I'm not going to lie I was mad but okay, I get it, it was a mess, so I take my keys and pull out. 
As soon as I turn the corner and the sun hits my car I notice the coat of dog hairs all over my dashboard and door panels. Along with the hair was spatters of leather and plastic cleaner all over the center console and instrument panels! The inside windshield was dirty and worst of all there was still bug carcasses and debris all over the front end of my car. This was a classic example of extremely poor customer service how they could have ever passed this as finished is baffling and perplexing. I will never come back to this carwash that can't even handle cleaning a car."
1,"I travel for business 40 weeks out of the year. This hotel is by far the worst experience I have ever had. About 25 minutes after getting into my room there was a knock on the door, the manager wanted to inspect my room for someone complained about smelling smoke. I figured this was some whacky routine of theirs, I let him in and he cleared the room. Ten minutes later he was back asking me, no telling me that I have to leave. Am I a smoker? Yes. Did I even have a pack of smokes with me? No!  There was no talking to him, he was on a mission to have me leave. By far the worst travel experience I have ever had."
1,"I have only visited this location one time with a date. We decided to order breakfast foods. When we walked in we were not greeted. This was my first and only visit to a Waffle House, so I had no idea what to expect. We eventually got seated, and waited. The tables were dirty and the employees acted like they were bothered that they had to serve customers. The food was the best thing about the visit, and it was not even that great in my personal opinion. Will I return to this location? Never, ever, again."
1,"Just brought my car in for the supreme wash and they did a horrible job! Inside of car wasn't wiped down at all still dust all over dashboard...it looked like they did try to wipe out cup holders but left sitting water or cleaner still inside. Also, there were still spots all over windows from wash. Next time I'll spend my 18 bucks elsewhere. For a job like that I could have spent the five bucks for their cheap wash and vacuumed my car out myself! Huge waste of money!!"
1,"Its possible I may vomit tonight. I just ate a slice of Barro pizza and it was HORRIBLE. I then ate a few disgusting wings and waaa laaa I want to puke. 

So listen up. You want the worst pizza on earth followed with the wings made probably from bats? Order here.

I warned you so if you die your family can say that you were just an ignorant fool to eat here. 

Try the hawaiian pizza. It gets delivered ice cold and soggy to the point you think its stuffing."
1,"I placed a delivery order last week for Pad See Ewe with beef. Delivery was quick, about 30 minutes. When I opened up the box, I thought that they gave me the wrong meal because whatever that food was, it was NOT pad see ewe. It looked and tasted like a stir fry dish. It had small skinny noodles, bell peppers, jalapeños, tons of onions and veggies. There was no sauce like the traditional pad see ewe has, and no large flat noodles either. I called them to ask for a refund because they didn't give me pad see ewe, and instead of apologizing and giving me a refund, the manager argued with me and told me that's the way that they make pad see ewe, and that I can't get my money back, only a credit for my next order. I'm very disappointed with Little Dumpling overall, the quality of food and customer service was awful. 

If you want real Thai food, don't go here!"
1,"Was so excited to try this place.  Literally walked in at 9:00 and they told us they're out of bread.  
I don't buy it.  #youreasandwichshop"
1,"We returned to Wacky wings after saying we wouldn't go back...

if you want a fun place to have your birthday, this place is cool.. we've only gone here to celebrate someones birthday we wouldn't go here to just have dinner.. both parties we have gone to have had a separate little party area which is nice because its private ..so this place is one star.

i liked our waiter, she remembered my name all night while serving us however i heard a lot complaints from the other people in our group. such as no forks and knifes, meals taking forever to get out ( they ended up just canceling their order) bringing out fish and taking 40 min to bring tartar sauce... the food is gross. and even worse..expensive. our son got a kids meal..7.99$ and says comes with dessert , a choice of mac and cheese or mini burger ...few choices and a drink and a toy..we got mac and cheese ..disgusting, i felt bad letting my son eat that garbage for dinner. looked like no name KD made poorly..the noodles were clumped together cheese in clumps..just gross..came with side of sweet potato fries, and by side i mean 5 fries...the dessert theres no choice unless you pay extra ..its a pre packaged cookie in a bag..again gross.. then for the toy we literally asked the waitress 4 times for our son to get his toy and she said on the way out he can pick one out of a chest..instead of bringing us the chest..anyways..on our way out we asked again can he pick his toy? the response we got was ""its in the back of restaurant near the kitchen"" so now we have our one year old all packed up and we have to mission back threw a busy bar..no thanks forget it.

we had wings, a boneless chicken wing meal ( with a garden salad) and a kids meal , a beer, and a cocktail..70$.. the food was actually gross. wings dry.

totally NOT worth 70$. everything taste frozen from a bag deep fried. no taste. dry. bland. barely warm. 

the little private area you get for a party is fun but thats the only good thing."
1,"Brought my truck in this morning for a wash.They said my tires were too large for them so I needed to get a hand wash for 25.00 dollars.I said ok i understand and that would be fine.They did a really lousy job washing it as there was dirt all over the passenger side wheel well and dirt all over the nerf bars.25.00 for a two minutes wash,definitely felt taken for the lack of effort...the wash was worth about 5.00...don't waste your money on it..."
1,I agreed with Gary K. (his description is right on the money). This place is mediocre at best. Much better selection at Hibachi grill or Lin's Garden.
1,"Came here today with my co-wokers ('bout 6 of us). It was my first and last time. 

The service was awful. The server gave us attitude for her mistake or the kitchens mistake. They also forgot about another order for one of our co-worker. When we sat down, we ordered the all you can eat wings @ 3PM. They would start you off with 15 wings, and after that, it is in increment of 5 wings. 

You are better off just buying a pound because their all you can eat wings TAKE FOREVER. After the first 15, the next 5 will take maybe half an hour or more; then it'll take another half an hour + before you get your next round of wings. 

I love my wings, but for some reason, the wings at Wacky Wings gave me a headache and upset stomach. It could be that one of their wings they served me was undercooked, but I'll never know.  And I guess that's why they call this place ""Wacky Wings"".

Personally, if you are going in with a party, avoid this place."
1,"I was somehow tricked into getting 28 dollar hand wash only car wash instead of a basic 3.99 basic wash. 

After the hand wash there were still so many spots left uncleaned, the drying aspect was not complete either as I could clearly see all the water spots and dirt still on my car. Lol I will not come here again if my life depended on it. I'll become a zombie even to avoid this place. 

J out."
1,"Horrible food. Went with a group of three, and the others couldn't even eat a plate. I tried to force myself to eat more then that but it's too bleh. Would not recommend. Have to find a new place for dinner tonight now.. Thanks"
1,"Didn't care for the Traditional Poutine. Not enough cheese, too much gravy. Gravy tasted like it was from a mix. Nice idea, good location, but needs some tweaking."
1,"Horrible service! Had to give a licence and credit card to get a pool table (understandable) but didn't see a server for roughly 10 minutes. Once we were finally served, it took another 15 minutes to get our pitcher of beer. Ordered MGD and it was beyond flat :-/ Ordered another pitcher right away (as we knew it would take some time) and decided to switch to Heineken in hopes that it would be fresher... Flat again. 
Didn't think about ordering food seeing as the drink orders had taken waaaaayyyy too long. 

Positives - good fun scene, music was well mixed and lively and the place itself has great potential. Missing professionalism. 

Wouldn't go back!"
1,"The food did not have much flavor, it was definitely left out for a few hours.....would not recommend at all....save your money folks"
1,Gross. I had a vegetarian burrito and to tell you the truth ive had better burritos at taco bell. I threw it away after 2 bites. Even the tortilla wasn't cooked all the way. My boyfriend had fish tacos and although edible we can make them better at home useing just the microwave.  It was horrible and I won't ever be back.
1,DO NOT GO HERE!! Worst car wash ever. $23 bucks wasted. Not only did they NOT Clean out the trash or get the dirt off the door but they left my car running with the drivers door wide open after they were done. We specifically asked them to park it cause we were going to go run errands. Anyone could have jumped in my car and drove away. We will never go here again!!
1,TERRIBLE! The rooms was filthy and the staff was beyond rude! The manager made things right BUT still this place is NOT okay! For the $ you can easily find a better place!
1,"We went on a Sunday night 1-15-2012 for my wifes birthday and I will not likely go back.  I had been there twice for lunch and it wasn't bad, however my experience last night was horrible.  Most everything I tasted was bland and no egg foo young.  What chinese food buffet doesn't have that item as a staple food on their menu.  Won Ton soup, with only liquid in the pot, nothing else.  As I said before, the food was mostly pretty bland and even the hot and spicy dishes were not very spicy at all.  Too top it off, not looking at the prices before I sat down, two meals and one ice tea, $28.08 which was ridiculous for the quality of food we ate.  Taco Bell or Subway would have been a much better choice, or Lin's which has never been disappointing.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"TAKE OUT EXPERIENCE
This was not only a VERY awkward experience but also annoying! We reside close to this location and decided to give it a whirl. There were a few other patrons waiting for their take out items and one couple dining in. This is definitely not an establishment primed for dining in, and if you must try for yourself, I would strongly recommend to download their menu and call ahead. We waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to greet us. Now mind you, during this wait period, we managed to see the delivery gal stream out of the door and the cashier look directly at us before grabbing her infant, taking him to the kitchen and tending to him prior to taking our order. Being a mother, myself, I patiently looked past the initial lack of customer service... I mean, I came for take out... My expectation was in the quality of the food.
During the wait; which felt like an eternity, we took notice of the dirty floors, another worker, most likely the owner's, 5-6 year old daughter roaming around to EVERY patron and asking to play on their phones. She sat next to us as we waited and began to flip through my phone inquiring of my game apps. At first it was endearing but became rapidly annoying as she also took my husband's phone to do the same. As our food finally arrived, she REFUSED to give back the phones! I literally had to pry the phones from her hands as she kicked and laid on top of them! She then refused to let me out of the booth!!! My husband had to move the table and I had to literally climb over her! The woman at the counter said NOTHING!!! We grabbed our condiments and scooted out as fast as possible... Only to find that our Chicken Teriyaki bowl was missing. We reluctantly went back in to be told that it would be another 10-15 minutes. During the interim, this little girl went up to 2 male patrons and proceeded to take and also play on their IPhones. When they too tried to depart she ran out of the place and across the parking!!! They went out after her and the lady finally came out from the counter, retrieved the guy's phone and left her alone again. Not a word to the little girl!!! A new family walked in and she proceeded again. This time she took their little boy's toy and ran around the entire place! He kept attempting to grab his toy back and she would run. How is this even possible??? Wow!!! 
I would love to say the food was fantastic and it was well worth it but unfortunately the Wor Won Ton Soup was extremely salty and consisted of 4 wontons, 2 shrimp, 2 snap peas, a few slices of pork and NO veggies!!! The Veggie Fried Rice was extremely bland and could say the same for the Chicken Teriyaki. The Veggie Egg Rolls weren't cooked internally and our rice container was maybe 3/4 full... Really less for a family of 3 that we paid additionally for. 
So not only was the food sub par, next to awful... But the customer service is non-existent and you become an instant babysitter for the establishment without ANY reward. Makes you wonder how cleanly the kitchen staff really is when they are changing diapers from the same kitchen they are preparing your food. By the way - It took  45 minutes to complete our order."
1,Worst customer service I have ever experienced at a car wash. Never going back. STAY FAR AWAY
1,"Oh boy, where do I start?  Firstly, the table had been wiped down, but was still very wet and not at all clean.  The menus were filthy.  Food, grease, and smudges of ""I don't know what"" were all over both of them.  We ordered decaf and had to wait for it to brew (not really a big deal, but you pay $2.20 per cup, then get to enjoy it for half of your meal).  We both ordered a two egg breakfast, which was supposed to come with toast, or biscuit and hash-browns or grits.  One of us ordered a biscuit and grits, the other hash-browns and a biscuit with added gravy.  We also ordered one waffle to split.

So first, two plates come out with a biscuit and gravy on each, then two cups of coffee show up.  Next comes a thin, cold and rubbery waffle.  About 5 minutes later one plate comes with two eggs, toast, and grits and another with two eggs, toast, and grits.  No hash-browns.  So they had added a  side of biscuits and gravy to each plate and just assumed we wanted the toast.  I ordered hash-browns, not grits. 

So they take back my plate and scrape my eggs onto a little plate and bring them back, then after a few more minutes, and after my eggs have become cold, a little plate with some hash-browns shows up.

To top it off, the biscuits tasted like they were cooked in old, burnt grease left after popping popcorn.

I will say they comped our meal, but I would much rather have skipped the whole mess and gone to McDonald's or something.  The waitress was very nice, but I don't think she had been properly trained.

Beware..."
1,"I don't think I've ever given one star to a place I've never stayed at before. 

My fiancé and I missed our connecting flight in Charlotte and were stuck there overnight. The airline gave us a voucher to stay at Embassy Suites for the night. We were a little disappointed not to be going home that night but were at least happy they put us up in a nice hotel...

.... or so we thought. Fast forward to our 30 minute wait time outside by the hotel shuttles. We saw other hotel shuttles come by twice and still no Embassy Suites, so I called to find out where the were. We were assured that they were ""en route"" and they finally showed up ten minutes later.

We finally got to Embassy Suites and were not greeted by anyone. There were two employees standing at the front casually chatting with each other and not bothering to acknowledge our presence. Finally, someone came from the back and I gave her my voucher. She then told me that all of their airline rooms were full for the night. I clarified with her that they had rooms available, just not one that the airline had paid for. I expressed my confusion since I was holding a voucher for the Embassy Suites and she told me there was nothing she could do and proceeded to just stare at me. I asked her what we were supposed to do and she went in the back for a few minutes.

When she came back, she instructed me that she called the hotel down the street and they had vacancy, and that we would need to stay at the Ramada Inn down the street instead (see separate review.) We had to ask for a ride from the shuttle driver there and luckily he hadn't left for the airport yet. 

We were stressed, exhausted from travel, and just wanted to stay in a nice hotel. Embassy Suites did nothing to help our situation and I suspect that a simple phone call to the airline would have allowed us to stay there. If I ever find myself in Charlotte again, I will most definitely steer clear of their terrible service."
1,"I've been to this restaurant maybe 5 times as of yesterday and it was the worst experience I've had . My husband and I walk in let the lady know table for two she tries and set us over to the right in a corner where there's about 8 booths or so and I realized there was some Africans whom look like they were a whole party that came from Church,I'm mixed with African American , Mexican, and white and my husband is African American. I felt like I was getting categorize, because when I look over in the other area it's whites ,Mexicans, all kinds but my color.So when we walk to the booth we want to sit the lady doesn't set our silverware down she drops it down , I almost wanted to leave at that point but we were both hungry and didn't want to find somewhere else to eat.The staff here have never been to friendly."
1,I came here to get a hand car wash on my brand new truck and for $35 it was not good. I will not return and do not recommend coming here at all. Disappointed that it wasn't good either.
1,"Absolutely terrible! First sign of trouble was weceaited in front almost 10 minutes and finally just seated ourselves.  Flagged down an employee and told them (4) for buffet and ordered drinks.  We normally look at buffets to see what they have, bit we had been running around fir hours and were hungry so ""figured"" it would be good...it was a Chinese buffet, we should be able to find decent food eh?  I mean, the China Buffet in Surprise is good spool...we took a risk, and lost, BIG TIME.   Food tasted lukewarm, sweet and sour chicken ""rubbery""and sauce ""watery.""  Took forever for drink refills, desserts tasted stale.  Nothing good to say about it!  Went with husband and our (2) teenage sons, they all barely ate.  After about 20 minutes of picking at our food ended up going to Jack in the Box after wasting about $40 here...(2) enthusiastic thumbs down!"
1,"I wish I head read the other reviews before going back to this car wash again.

I won't be going back.

In the past they did ok with the car wash.  But last time, about 6 or 8 months ago, I had an oil change done too.  The next day I had oil drips on my drive way.  I took it to a mechanic who said there was no gasketing.  At first he thought maybe the bolt wasn't tightened enough, said that can happen.  Not the case though.  So I decided no more oil changes from there.

Thought I was safe with a car wash.  Nope.  Asked for a thorough vaccuming, had the seats folded up and the car was empty.  The back seats and hatch back were never vaccummed, or if they were, not very thoroughly.  The passenger rearview mirror was moved (normally they didn't do that).  The back window was smeary/streaky.  I take it to  a car wash so that I don't have that problem, because I do if I do it myself.  They usually wiped down inside really well.  Not this time.

A previous poster mentioned dog hair.  I have dog hair in my car, and I still had dog hair after I returned home that morning.

I didn't want to drive all the way back there as I was heading northwest for the rest of my errands that day."
1,"We stopped in here the other night because BJ's was too busy.  It's drab and the food is just okay.  I don't care how busy anything else is, I don't see myself coming back.  Maybe when I'm 90, actually, because that seems to be their primary demographic."
1,I used to love ordering Barro's when I was in town. Now every time there is an issue with the order. Manager calls it will be late but we are redoing your order. Ok good thank you. But I doubt that happened. The ranch for the wings was hotter than the wings. Last time I order from them.
1,"Don't go during a big sports game. They told us they had no menus left,  we had to write our orders and bring it to the front.  Waited for an hour,  no waitress has come by.  No food, no drinks. Would have thought if we made reservations, they would plan better and have enough staff. Guess we are leaving without food or drinks."
1,The place was nice in appearance waiter taking drinks was very rude and was never attended to order food I just walked out this was last night I was going to have dinner with a friend from new York I felt like everyone else in the room was being attended exept me waited like 30 min no waiter or waitress even went to take my order I do not recommend this place there's better places else where in Vegas
1,I don't know why I keep going here. Probably because it's so close. This will be my last time for sure. They do a crappy job and the manager is so rude!  Very cocky.
1,"Wow... worst lemon chicken I have ever experienced. How hard is it to get fried chicken and sugar sauce right? The lemon glaze tasted like it was reheated and had grease remnants in it. 

Too much oil in the rice. At least the soup was edible."
1,I was served dirty plates and the most awkward cup of green tea ever ( a plastic cup full of large leaves with a bit of hot water)...when I complained..of course no one spoke english. This place sucks..
1,"""What a Disgrace to the Service Industry""

So I recently got married in Las Vegas and had a wonderful time.  Ceremony at the Venetian, dinner for 32 people at a restaurant overlooking the fountains in Bellagio (Fantastic) and then tried to find a place to go for drinks after dinner.  Caramel was suggested since it was nearby.  What a mistake!!!!  We strolled in around 9 PM and it was nearly empty although to sit at any of the empty tables, we would have had to order bottle service.  We were told the tables were also reserved for 11:30 PM that night so we couldn't sit there unless we order bottled service and then would have to leave by 11:30.  We were alright with that idea so sat down at one of the tables.  All of a sudden, the server came up and said in a snarky voice ""You can't sit there"".  This was the same guy that said we could sit there if we order bottle service and left by 11:30.  Still, we decided to stay and did manage to find a table where some of us could sit and the rest were just standing.  The service from there just kept getting worse.  You better know what to order because if you are unsure and can't order immediately, the server will get upset and stick their nose up at you (with a little phhhh) no joke.  I suppose she was in a hurry to serve the empty ""reserved"" tables around us.  We also asked if they could play 1 song for a first dance (even offered $$ to play it) and were pretty much ignored and finally laughed at.  We had a quick drink and wanted to get out so asked for the bill.  Half an hour later it finally came (guess it would take that long since there were only 3 servers and there was now a huge crowd of 20 other people in the lounge) and we bolted out of this horrible place.  

For a group of more than 20 people, dressed to the nines after our wedding we were disgusted with how we were treated.  We were ready to spend a lot of money and ended up taking our business elsewhere.  Thanks for a wonderful memory on our special day.

p.s. The ""reserved"" tables sat empty the entire time we were there (around 1 hour).  Glad they didn't let us get the bottle service even though we were going to when we first arrived (at approx $400/bottle no less).  

p.p.s. I would have rated 0 stars, but it wasn't possible."
1,"Awful. New owners. Again. Each time a little worse. We had to update the review as a result. 
Prices have increased. Quality has diminished. This was our go to place. Not any more. We tried twice since the new family took over. We won't be back. 
Disgusting. 
The food is at best average. Not tasty. 
I'm so sad the first owners moved away. This WAS. My fav."
1,"Was that food? Ranch dip taste too sour like rotten, fried dumpling meat taste like mixed meat, most dishes taste bland or doesn't seem like food.. nothing else to say just not worth it to spend money for"
1,"I stopped in here today for lunch since I was in the area. The service was friendly and nice. I ordered the carne asada tacos. First I got chips and went to the salsa bar. The chips were noticeably stale, but the salsa was good. The carne asada tacos were gross. The meat tasted spoiled, the texture was weird and it was greasy. I was very hungry but could only stomach two bites. The beans were runny and tasted bad. I will not be back here again."
1,"I wish 0 stars was an option. I came to check in after driving 7 hours, and they said they couldn't process the card on file and didn't have an authorization form. The only way they could even have the card number they had, is if they got it from the authorization form but he kept saying it was the payment on my account. I pulled up my account to show him it was not, and he still refused to help me. The ""manager"" on duty, who was the one helping me, was rude, unwilling to out of his way to see what happened to the authorization form (he just kept saying there would be a note on my account if there was one), and completely unprofessional. I am shocked he would be placed in a management role as he had absolutely no managerial skills at all. I stay at Hilton chains 3 weeks out of every month and am extremely disappointed in this location than I've ever been. If you have a problem, say a prayer that Markus is not the one working."
1,"This food was not good.  Very disappointing.  The ribs were tough and bland, the shrimp was dry, over cooked and bleh, The eggrolls were flavorless.  The crab rangoon was basically just creamcheese filling.  Just not good.  The kung pao chicken was inedible.  It had a weird sour taste to it, not that it had gone bad, just not good food.  Very sorry we spent our money here.  We will not be returning.  We enjoy China-a-go-go on Valle Verde a lot better than this.  It isn't fabulous, but we are always satisfied.  Also, the delivery took well over an hour after ordering without any forewarning.  Not happy at all."
1,"I was not a guest of this hotel, I was here to assist my sister in decorating the hotel room for a bachelorette party. When I approached the front desk to get a key for the room I had to wait for the associate to finish sending a text on his cell phone before I was acknowledged. After he said hello, but before I could speak, the phone rang and I had to wait again for him to finish a phone conversation. The agent was very friendly, but it left me wondering why there would only be one person at the desk or why there wasn't a call center where the calls could be routed.
The hotel itself looked very updated and modern, and the room looked nice and comfortable as well. This is the reason why I would never pay to stay here. while I was decorating I had to put something in the mini fridge. Upon opening the refrigerator I noticed that the back wall of the fridge was covered in black mold! That left me wondering how well the rest of the room was cleaned. I would not take my chances there."
1,"Not as good as everyone says it is.  They use MSG and I feel sick from it.  I wouldn't be so harsh but folks, let's wake up as a whole and demand no MSG, it's a simple enough thing and I suppose we shouldn't support places that use it.  Admittedly, it's hidden in many foods.   (excerpt from MSGTRUTH DOT O R G)  CHICKEN and  SAUSAGE products,  RANCH dressing,  PARMESAN items, GRAVY, and DIPPING SAUCES and fries with any kind of seasoning on them except plain salt.  FLAVORED salty snack chips  - ESPECIALLY Doritos® and Cheetos® and items with cheese powder added.
At regular restaurants, you want to avoid  PARMESAN encrusted ANYTHING, SOUPS, CEASAR salad, FISH SAUCE or EXTRACT,  SOY SAUCE,  BOARS HEAD® COLD CUTS and beef jerky (usually made with soy sauce)  and anything that comes out of a can.  Go to restaurants that make things from scratch - you can ask what is in food and also ask for special items without the offending ingredients.  You WILL be glad you spoke up BEFORE you eat the wrong thing.  DON'T smother your choice in the parmesan cheese at the table either- Parmesan cheese is 1% straight MSG by weight.

As you can see, we're literally surrounded by the stuff.  But that's no reason to turn a blind eye, keep consuming, and ""hope"" everything will be OK.
Should be fine to eat here as long as the request ""NO MSG"" is made."
1,this place sucks they went though all my stuff after I asked them not to they broke a peace to my rear mirror and didn't say anything till I asked about it and didn't want to fix it they didn't vacuum and spilled some cleaner that stained my carpet I had to leave to get my son from school I called all day trying to speak to a manager the girl that picked up the phone was nice about it after the 4th time calling she took my info and said the manager will call me as soon as he can well he never did so I called back they where really unprofessional about everything I will never go back
1,"Went in to pick up a to go order and they currently have a ""C"" health rating. One step above the health Dept closing it down."
1,Horrible!! Stoned and hung-over staff do not care what they are serving you. I paid $10 for a soupy watery poutine that was not edible. I took it back to the counter and told the staff who went back to texting on her phone rather than helping me. I would advise against this place unless you are hung over and need Denny's style grease to soak up alcohol. Not appetizing at all and wasted my money.
1,Beer was ok. The wings were definitely fresh but missed the mark.  I expected better wings from a Wing place. Not recommended.
1,Worst car wash I have ever been to. The place looks big and nice but no attendant ever greeted me. As a result I ended up paying 10 bucks for a wash I could have gotten for 3 bucks at any gas station. I called them back immediately as I got home. I told the lady for 12 bucks at another Place they did everything. She said they have and too and basically tough luck. I even tipped the guy who dried my car and did my tires because I told him I was confused and it said my tires would be dressed. So really I spent 12 dollars on a crappy gas station wash job. When if someone would have helped me get I wanted I would have gotten a full service for the same price. I hate this car wash. They ripped me off.
1,Thought I girl this place another try since its across street from my house. I got The WORST $16.99 car wash EVER I had to go around and vacuum my own damn car PLEASE don't waste your money my niece and nephew could've done a better job in my garage.
1,"Walked in to order a pizza. What I wanted was very simple. A pizza pie and extra mozzarella cheese on the side so when I go home, I can put cold cheese on top of the warm pie. In NY, it's called cold cheese pizza. I was looked at like I was crazy and the manager said they don't do that because I'd be leaving with their product uncooked. I've been to many pizzerias in AZ, and never encountered this before. If I'm paying for the item, what I do with it after is none of your concern. Waiting in the pizzeria right now to try it for the first time, let's see how it goes. So far something very simple became very complex."
1,"Came here for Summerlicious with 2 friends.
Ordered the veal lasagna with the fried cauliflower as a side.

I can honestly say that this meal was horrendous.The veal lasagna was  swimming in grease and the noodles were so overcooked that they were like mush. Furthermore it was totally tasteless.

I can't even find words for how awful the cauliflower was. It was certainly not fried. It was boiled, overcooked, sitting in water, and totally devoid of taste. I would not serve this to a senior in a hospital.

Just returned from 10 days in the US, where I ate fabulous food everywhere - fresh ingredients bursting with flavor. We ate at a cool bistro in suburban Detroit that had the most delicious brussels sprouts ( locally grown) I've ever eaten made with agave nectar and sharazi. How can this be compared with the awful cauliflower of last night!

Toronto needs to learn a few lessons in good cuisine- don't know how Joanne  Kates can think that this is even palatable food- it was gross and this morning I even feel ill from all that grease.
Wake up Toronto."
1,"They placed ranch out for the queso and I covered my entire nachos thinking it was queso...and it wasn't it was ranch. 

There were no veggies in sight..who puts ranch out with nachos?! 

Please tell me this is not the America we live in...bring out real queso or don't put out nachos."
1,"The quality went down hill, slowly at first, then it accelerated...place got dirty....and now it is CLOSED!"
1,"Wife and I waited 10 mins at the end of the bar, a small crowd of about 10 at the other end but we were never even acknowledged by either the guy or the girl behind the bar. Obvious that that the bartenders were lost, so we walked out. Oh well."
1,$15 premium wash.. Decent price but horrible wash. Hood came out dirty and they didn't even try on the rims.
1,"The gel that they used chipped in less than 1 week. 
Terrible. I dont remember the name of the product but it was not D&D or OPI, I had never heard of it. but I thought I would try it! now less than a week after my mani/pedi I have to get it done again."
1,"The cheese pizza was so salty it was inedible. I have to think something has changed or the accidentally dropped the salt shaker on this one. Please check the sodium content on your ingredients Barro's. 

I hope your reading your reviews and taking this stuff to heart. We have loved supporting this business for the last 10 years+."
1,Went for lunch yesterday. I was sick all day and night. I think it might have been the sushi.
1,"Cute space, and it's great to support a small local shop. However, the coffee they poured me was horrifying. It had clearly been sitting on the burner for far too long. Will never order coffee there again. Blech."
1,"Yuck - this the first time I've ever left a review, and with the food and service combined I'm compelled to let others no, don't come here

Food review - Yuck.... How about no stars. My wife and both my kids, we all got plates, say down and ate, and after about to bites in nobody was eating. The waitress even asked us as she was taking away all our plates full of food why we didn't like it. Then she quickly walked away and came right back with our check. Didn't offer to discount it out not charge is or anything, just apologized as she handed us the check.

Service - the waitress all walk towards you as if you the customer should move out of their way. They did it to my children as well! Almost knocked my six year old daughter over because they didn't stop to let her by. I asked for lots of ice in my tea, I got a couple cubes."
1,"Walked in, sat down & waited......& waited....then waited some more for someone to acknowledge us and take our drink order. We were even sitting at the bar. Didn't drink anything or eat anything, so I can't say anything about the food & drinks, but the service was horrible. Lots of other places in the area with great service."
1,"Yuk! Really? I'm born and raised in 514. You can't fool ,me with your overpriced poutine. The sauce is like brown water and the cheese curds have no flavor either. 

Drive to Canmore and visit La Belle Patate for a real taste of Montreal Poutine"
1,I thought this place would be good. Had the Italian hoagie and noticed right away that the lunch meat was low grade !!!! TERRIBLE
1,Vegetarian options are always a disappointment. I've ordered every meat free option on the menu & the food always tastes bland.
1,"I'm am use to a certain level of untidiness at Waffle Houses in general, but this morning was by far a clear indication I need to stop eating here. There were a number of flies as well as a couple of roaches in clear sight. One roach was even at the register as the serve packaged my food and collected my money. Please do better Waffle House!!!"
1,I tried this today. Bout the same as Filibertos and I always feel really bad after eating it. Just like today. Heartburn and just uck. Not good.
1,Had this for lunch one day before work - bad move. I was totally useless all afternoon as I felt like I had a brick of acid eating away at my stomach lining.
1,"This place is terrible. The lube guy had a terrible attitude and purposely made us wait over an hour for our car. We complained but no one seemed to care. Then when our car finally made it through the wash it was rushed the inside was not cleaned properly. We paid extra for the extreme wash. Do not do that. I do not recommend any of the TNT carwashes on the west side of town.
We even called the district manager several times yet to this day have not received a call back. Terrible business practices.
Read all the other terrible reviews this place received."
1,"This restaurant in this location was the absolutely worst waffle house I have ever been to. I ordered a waffle and 30 minutes later it was still not ready. I asked them what is going on with the waffle and they said the waffle irons have not be cleaned in 2 days! Finally, I got my waffle and and I turned it over a it was blacker than my car but I ate a small piece of it and it was raw. Me and my family were so mad we kinda sorta went off on them and we made them not include the waffle in our bill. Now we are driving home mad and hungry writing this yelp review. #healthdepartment"
1,"Well the woman who did my eyebrows did a nice job but I really feel I was over charged. I got gel nails, wax, eye brow tint (25.00???), and supposedly a free pedicure. My bill came out to 90 dollars. The pedicure actually ended up costing 22.00. I upgraded to stone which lasted a minute and was so hot I pulled away. The stone was ten extra than the basic. I was told the other 12 was because I had to pay for the nail polish.  Huh??? On top of that I ended of with a nice gash on my heal. I kept wincing and saying owe when she was using what looked like a cheese grater to remove dead skin. Once the girl looked and saw I was bleeding she got up and grabbed some neosporin. I have to say it hurts like heck when I take a step now. I'm pregnant and you just don't heel that fast when you are pregnant. I've attached a pic so you can see. I ended up wearing flip flops to a steak dinner because I couldn't tolerate my heels."
1,Where's Joanie? You fired the most experienced professional in the place?  Went for dinner and most servers were young and inexperienced.  Service was slow and the employees were observed gossiping and socializing rather than checking my beverage levels.  It felt like a college bar more than a local place where adults dine. What were you thinking North Park Lounge??!!
1,"Worst food I've had in awhile. China joes , chopstick are the way to go.  The kung pow was chewy and the paper wrapped chicken was flavorless.  Beef and broccoli was shit. worst 50 dollars Ive ever spent. I would have rather got a hooker for that 50 and caught an std."
1,"Well I stopped in with myself and my 2 kids to eat lunch on the lunch special.we needed a total of 4 slices of pepperoni pizza ,they only had 3 said 10 min for more. I dont understand why u wouldn't you wouldn't start a pizza when u realize u at that low. Also the 3 slices we got we're not even room temperature. very very poor on their part"
1,This Waffle House appeared dirty down to the dishes. The employees could need some serious help on professionalism and what's appropriate behavior in a restaurant. To top it off the food was not so good either.
1,Terrible chili bad service not worth the walk from the hotel!!! The servers were real ghetto!!!!
1,If i could give them a 0 i would there food is gross.There service is the worse.I wouldn't step in there if my life depended on it
1,"Yikes. I have family in Quebec, so I have been to Montreal dozens of times and had the real deal poutine. This place is nowhere near the quality I've had in Quebec. The gravy was watery and bland, and the fries were overcooked. The cheese curds didn't melt at all, and had no flavor. If you want something a bit closer to poutine you'd find in Quebec, try Smoke's."
1,"Used to come here a lot since my friends and I enjoyed the food and the pool tables. However, one Monday evening, we had various problems with our food. Our server, Tabs was very helpful and understanding about the problems but when the manager on duty came, she handled the situation very poorly. I told her there was a hair on my breaded wings and she poked around at the food with her hands in front of us claiming it was a chicken hair which is still very disgusting. When I emailed the managers about the situation, they didn't really accommodate us or fix the problem. Bottom line, don't think we're going back there."
1,Terrible service. Tables after us got their orders before us. We were told different orders which is why ours was taking 15 minutes longer. Not sure why they would lie when the neighbouring tables  had similar orders. I was also told fried chicken takes longer to make? Table next to us got that too! Disgruntled and annoyed that there wasn't even an apology. Worst Banh Mi Boyz service ever experienced. Maybe the staff here needs customer service training.
1,"I have been to many Waffle Houses before, but this one is gross. I had to get up and leave due to general lack of cleanliness. We sat down at a ""just cleaned"" table which still had a big smudge of syrup or jam on it, then we grabbed our menus which also had finger-smudged gunk all over them. I ordered an ice tea and the aftertaste of it was gross... it had been over-brewed. It was incredibly cold in there as well, which was totally unnecessary considering the temperature outside was in the 70's. Yet they had the AC on full blast and I was uncomfortably chilly. The final straw for me was when I saw a small group of flies buzzing around next to the window near my table... at first I didn't think anything of it; I thought they were outside the window. But then I noticed they were all actually inside, and if I can see that many flies right at my table, there must be quite a few roaming freely inside the restaurant. Overall lack of cleanliness made us get up and leave. I shall not come back to this particular Waffle House."
1,"I love Barros but this location is horrible. I placed an order over the phone for 12 wings and garlic bread. They told me 15 minutes. I arrived, paid, and they said it would be a few more minutes. 45 minutes later the gal asked what the name was again and realized my food had been sitting there the entire time. Her response.. ""Oops."" My food was cold & disgusting. I didn't eat it. Will never be back."
1,"A group of us checked into this place this past Friday night. We were staying at the bellagio and thought we wanted a loungey place to hang out for the night as opposed to a club. We walked by Caramel, it looked nice enough, so we entered the place. 

Let me just start out by saying, I love lounges with plush-modern furniture. This place had that, but that's all it had. 

The staff was pretentious and made us feel really uncomfortable. Instead of the energy screaming welcome, sit down and have a drink. It was more like, order, tip and get out. 

First, I could not believe the prices. $10 beers and $15 cocktails Yes, I know we were at the Bellagio, but geez...really? This is Las Vegas, not Manhattan or San Francisco. 

Second, the bouncer carded my 55 year old step-dad and when he said his ID was in the room, security wouldn't let him in. I understand that in the abundance of caution, you have a policy that you card everyone, but shouldn't management give their staff just a little bit of flexibility to use some common sense. ""Hmmm, man with bald head and a gray mustache....who's old enough to be your dad, why not let this guy in??!?"" 

Finally, the real reason I felt it necessary to give this place just one star (as opposed to two) besides everything I've already said. After our first round of drinks, we asked for some water. So, that we could hydrate for the next round. The place would not give us water - period. Unless, we shelled out $5 a bottle per person!! Insane. No other lounge in the Bellagio has this policy. 

So, to make a long story somewhat short. We asked for a cup of ice, sucked that down and walked out . We went across the casino to another lounge and got our second, third and fourth round of drinks with cups of water each time. It's the principal."
1,This piece of shit place doesn't even answer the phone. How are THEY still in business with SUCH SHIT SERVICE!!!!
1,"I walk in and order two beers. I put a $20 bill on the bar to pay for the drinks and am humiliated by the snooty bartender who tells me that's not enough money.... Two 12 oz bottles of Bud Light = $22 plus tip

 Practically empty on Sunday night at 9pm except for a few sweaty golfers. Unless you have money to burn take your entertainment dollars elsewhere in Las Vegas.

P.S. The same drinks were $1.75 each at O'Shea's across the street and there was a funner crowd."
1,"Wish I could give this place zero stars. Came in 2 hours before closing needed a fill and a full set for my daughter. Was told to have a seat and they would get someone to help us. Then after we're seated and waiting she tells ya she can't help us! And to come back tomorrow they're too busy. No thank you Ma'am. You should have said that when I first walked in. I'll never be back

Update: I don't care if you put up video. You're gonna keep this one star. Your staff could ya e told me when I first came in they couldn't accommodate me. Not telling me they would then changed their. Mind. Enjoy this 1 Star. And you have an even more blessed day!"
1,"This is the worst experience I have ever had with a so called manager. The day was May 18 I was getting my husbands truck washed, after sitting there for about an hour and my truck not being completed I was started to get upset. This is a dark blue truck and it sat in the sun for about a half an hour and wasn't touched so the water marks were drying. Other cars came and went and mine sat there. I went to complain to the girl at the front and asked to speak to a manager. The ""manager"" was Chompie, when he was told I wanted to talk to him he avoided the situation and went back to his office. I again said I wanted to talk to the manager he came out and I told him what was going on. He went outside yelled at some people and now my truck was getting attention except that it was being revved up so loud that the noise that came from my exhausted sounded horrible. This immediately upset me I told the guy to get out of my truck that we pay for our things and we take care of it, He got out and I was going back in to complain again and Chompie was walking out the other door. I said I want my money back. This stopped him in his tracks, he turns around and said, ""cant you read no refunds."" Well Chompie I actually can read I am  college educated. I hope he can read and all the others that will read this and not go to this car wash. I have four vehicles and multiple siblings that live in the area that will not go to this car wash. Chompie needs some management and customer service classes."
1,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. I've only been to this place twice, but the last time made the final decision to never return. I went in on a Tuesday for lunch since they have the taco specials. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and 1 steak taco. Never once did I hear my number be called. It was busy in there so I continued to wait. After about 20 min of waiting, I decided to go to the counter. The lady then informed me that someone else took my food! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! That didn't sit too well with me especially since they check the numbers before handing out the food. So I had to wait an additional 5 min for the cook to prepare my food again. I only get half an hour for my lunch so I was furious! There was no apologies from anyone. I didn't even want the food by then. Once I actually ate the food, the tacos were hard (almost stale like) and the chicken was way too chared. I defintiely won't be returning and I will NOT recommend anyone to this place."
1,"First time to Barro's Pizza and most disappointing time. I had a coupon for one large one topping pizza which I thought was a nice gesture from Barro's to send me this coupon. The coupon states dine in and take out only and no delivery which to me meant I can order over the Internet and pick it up, hence take out. When I showed up to the restaurant they told me they couldn't take the coupon because I ordered it online and paid for it. No where on this coupon says no online orders so I thought I was safe, boy was I fooled. I would appreciate it when places hand out coupons they would go by what the coupons says and not make up some other criteria on the fly. As for the pizza it was ok a bit greasy I would say. So if you're into greasy pizza and false advertisement then this is the place for you :)."
1,"If I could give 0 stars I would, do not eat here. If you want Chinese food there's a Panda across the street you'll be a lot more satisfied. Out of all the restaurants in the area this is definitely ranked last. Food was horrible, they couldn't even properly make rice or lo mein. I know it's a buffet but at some point you got to replace your food."
1,"DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY: This place RUINED my Mercedes paint job. Don't mean to be stereo type, but the illegal immigrants that this place has working on your cars can't even speak a lick of English. My car has burnt swirl marks in the paint! My black paint has blue marks and swirls all over. This place completely ruined a new cars paint on purpose. When I asked what the hell was going on, they just gave me their idiocy, by staring at me and saying ""No Blah Blah"", they don't speak English now, have a good day with a smile. This happened over a year ago and my paint still suffers. Screw this place and what they have working here! They need to go back to Mexico and stop ruining Americans cars because they are Racist! If you have something nice, they will hate and ruin it for you. Than try and mask it with cover up paints, than a month later, your car will be an abomination ruined by the illegals. You've been warned! Screw this place, illegal workers committing crimes of criminal damage and just straight illegal. Ruined MERCEDES:("
1,"This was and is the worst experience that I have had eating out at a Chinese restaurant with my family I watch them scrape food into pans to put away with dates on it for tomorrow employees eating out of pans in the rear of the restaurant where we were seated had to basically beg for someone to do a stirfry on the grill because 
they had all ready cleaned it up for the night items were not replaced with fresh things were hard and rubbery and this would not be a place that I will go back to ever again customer service was crappy worst experience ever what was supposed to been an enjoyable evening with two graduates turned into a crappy night plain and simple don't go there if you expect decent service because you won't get it"
1,"Worst nights stay ever due to noisy plumbing all night long, doors banging all night and a noisy toilet that was not properly affixed to floor. Embassy corporate needs to look at this location. It does not meet expected standards."
1,"I really wanted to like this place because of the excellent reviews, but sadly I regret switching nail salons and giving this place a try. When walking in the salon wasn't busy and everyone in the salon had great customer service. The pedicure area is in a different room and they play very relaxing music. They have really high-end feeling Spa chairs and right when you sit down they put a warm weighted type neck towel around your neck and down your shoulders which felt amazing. There was a quick pedicure for 25 and then there was an upgraded version for $35 that had a note at the bottom that said it would be at least 35 minutes. To start off my review I'd like to say that my pedicure was 25 minutes. Normally that wouldn't bug me but I felt terribly rushed the entire time and I wish I only paid the $25 for the quick pedicure since that's what I received. The lady who did my pedicure was very nice however her massage was very painful. And I say this in the nicest way possible as I always get pedicures every 2 weeks and I am usually complaining about the massages being too weak. I really didn't like it because she kept drilling her thumb consistently over one area on the top of my foot. She was very aggressive and rubbing the top of my foot where the bones are pretty thin and more sensitive, vs massaging the bottom of my foot or my leg like most people do. When I told her she was hurting my foot she started drilling her thumb up my shins which hurt even more. I did not enjoy any part of my pedicure and massage. By the time she rushed through painting my toes my foot was still hurting really bad and I just thought my goodness I feel like she broke the top Bones on my feet or at least left a bruise. When I was walking around the grocery store after my pedicure I had to go home because the top of my foot still felt so tender. Sure enough I woke up this morning with a bruise on the top of my foot. I'm not trying to be a baby or over-exaggerated I'm just very upset that I paid an extra $10 for a relaxing spa pedicure and received a rushed pedicure and no legitimate massage. It kind of irritated me when I saw how others around me were getting their foot or legs massage and I was just getting a thumb drilled consistently up and down my shin or Up and Down the Bones on the top of my foot. It was really awkward and uncomfortable. Even when I got the hot stones and the warm towel they were so hot. And again this is coming from someone who always gets pedicures and prefers super hot water on my feet and a firm massage. I couldn't tolerate how hot the stones or the towels were which sucked because I felt like they didn't even feel anything before putting them straight on my skin. I feel bad leaving this review because everybody was super friendly however I am not satisfied with the care I received especially for the price I paid. I feel like these are the kind of pedicures I could get for $15 in California. If I'm paying $35 it's definitely worth more than being rushed out."
1,Barely walked in and the customer service was the worst lady at the front was so rude I had gastric bypass and need to eat off the kids menu she would not honor the card would even look at the card just put her hand in my face that she doesn't honor it very poor customer service I walked out with all of my children
1,"NEVER VISITING HERE AGAIN!! Go to River Nails instead!! 

Gave this place a few tries since they're open late and close to home. 

First visit was okay. Received a regular full set and they got me in and out quickly. I wasn't in a hurry but apparently my nail tech was despite the empty shop and no customers waiting. Didn't think much of it. 

Second visit, I treated my mom to a gel manicure and I got a full set. The nail tech that was servicing my mom was visibly frustrated that she was tossed between two colors. It seems we were taking up too much of his precious time. Both received a rushed job and it reflected in our nails. 

Third and final visit, I decided to give them one last try. DON'T ASK WHY, IDK. I went in one evening after work around 7:30 pm. There were a few customers but not many. Requested a full set. The tech that greeted me stated he would check the wait time. I didn't understand the conversation between him and an older lady but he turned and asked did I want gel or regular full set. I replied regular. All of a sudden ""they were busy"" and couldn't fit me in. I asked within the next 3.5 hours that they're open, there's no availability? I wasn't planning on coming back or staying but I was just blown away by the blatant unprofessionalism and poor customer service. He stated maybe come back tomorrow. So goes without saying, I will never step foot or refer anyone there again. They were convenient but did subpar work consistently. Found a much better shop up the way. River nails on Durango provides excellent customer service, takes their time and provides mimosas, also open late! :)"
1,Worst car wash ever i tried to give them so many chances but they never do a good job. I am always disappointed. I wish i could give them o star
1,"The girl at the counter at the 17 Ave location  ignored us and said she doesn't take the Groupon cash only 
When asked what store does she told me the other store in Kensington
 I asked her where was it and she had no idea :(
Not impressed by her paying more attention to here text messages than her customers 
Came into the kensington location  207 10 th st Nw and was Treated Way better !!    

day and night experience  !
I do recommend the Kensington location !"
1,When this place opened it was very good. That is no longer my perception.  Nothing is worse than to get cold food on a buffet. When the stir fry is tasteless you know it is time for the eatery to go on the OTL. Off the list. Food quality is cheap. They don't even have duck sauce for spring or egg rolls. Additionally the sweet and sour sauce isn't thick. It is runny and taste like sugar water. I cannot stand places that draws  you in with good quality cooking and then take short cuts and distribute lower quality product months later. The food is sub par. How can you get can peaches to look like gray matter? The fruit wasn't even ripe. Watermelon was mealy. No pride in this establishment whatsoever.  Do not eat here folks.
1,"Terrible, never again. I've been taking both of my cars here for the past year, and usually they've been good. But today was the last time. Dropped off my car and asked for an oil change, wash, interior and seats shampooed. Was given a quote and left. Came back two hours later: scratches on both sides of the car, dashboard had black handprints on it, trash/etc still on floor, bugs on the hood. Ridiculous. Talked to manager, he said I got what I paid for, and if I wanted additional service he would have to charge me. Was unwilling to budge on the price, or correct the work, even though it was clear it hadn't been done thoroughly. Offered me two free washes, but why would I? And when I sent inside, the cashier didn't have the coupons available. Customer service was non-existent, work was shoddy, I won't be returning. Extremely disappointing, and I won't be recommending it anyone."
1,All I can say for this place is that if you were starving in the desert and stumbled upon it you'd actually might rather starve to death.  The dressing was good. But if im looking for a hoagie I'd rather go to GetGo. First and last visit.
1,"Go here if you want to smell like your greasy meal afterwards for three days!!! Don't dare wear a cute little outfit because you'll smell like sausage, deep fry grease, and stale coffee forever. The aroma infuses into the fibers of your clothes! I had to take a shower immediately after because my hair smelled like so much grease. 

I took my jacket off and left my room and came back to the whole hotel room smelling like Waffle House, but not in a good maple syrup warmth way."
1,"I really enjoy poutine especially when drunk...really hard to disappoint a drunk!  The poutine was gross..didn't enjoy any part of it..brewsters poutine is WAY better, plus they have yummy beer...try theirs and then compare it to this crap and tell me which is better!!"
1,Just ordered a side salad to go and came home to eat it and found an extremely brown piece of lettuce (see my photo). 90% of the lettuce is browned/ looks like it has been sitting for weeks. I thought Barros typically had good health/freshness standards but I guess not...
1,"My husband and I were around the area and couldn't decide where to eat .I was in the mood for some variety and also wanted some crab legs so we stopped in. The cost was $11.99 per person which was a bit higher than other buffets in the few mile radius. But I was hoping it was because they were gonna have a great selection. We arrived at 7:30 pm and the dining room was about a third full. All the food trays were not full (not even half full) and the food looked like they had been sitting there for a while. I was just still looking forward to my crab legs though. Well the crab tray was never full and when it was replenished, they only brought out about a pound at a time. Let me tell you I wasn't the only person eyeing the new trays brought out,but I was the farthest from the buffet table. So I didn't get as much as wanted..just a couple legs. The majority went to a table of 4 big young men who had the eyes of a hawk and speed as fast as lightening. Oh well..So I told my husband he could pick the next place for us to eat at, even if it is fast food ...which I despise. We won't be going back here but I still wasn't able to leave China City Super Buffet behind after I left. My stomache started hurting on the drive home..."
1,"This place is always so dirty and grimy, been there twice and will not be back.  Customer service is horrible!!!"
1,The most horrible wings I've had in my life. I felt like I was biting right into oil. It was disgusting. The flavours were also not the greatest. They need to step it up.  I will never come here again for wings. But the place itself has a nice setting.
1,"What's worse than a chain taqueria with no ambiance, really bad tasting food, and rude staff? Nothing. 

I almost never eat at these big chain half-fast food restaurants. I didn't have high expectations, but I thought it would be better than taco bell. Wrong. 

The tacos I got on taco tuesday tasted terrible, and then gave me about 12 hours of food poisoning.

Go to a mom and pop taco shop and avoid this place like fire avoids water."
1,This place has the WORST costumer service I have ever seen!! You have a problem and they will tell you they will get it handled for you and they don't. Every employee will give you the run around. Even the OWNER is to lazy to return your calls or help fix the problem!! They will tell you that owner or someone will call you back and NO ONE will.  I tried multiple times with multiple people to try to get in contacts with the owner about my situation and it took over 5 days to finally get a hold of the owner. I've been going to this car wash for years since it was convenient and it's done nothing but go DOWN HILL! Worst experience of my life! I will go totally out of my way now to get my car washed. Please to avoid a major headache take your car to any where else but this place!
1,"Wow.  What a HUGE disappointment.  After reading all the reviews, we were looking forward to spending our last night in Vegas partying here.

We left The Bank, which is located nearby, to Caramel with high hopes of a fabulous time.

IT.... MUST.... OF.... BEEN... A BAD NIGHT.

There were only a few unattractive 40+ sausages aka The Bank rejects.  It was dead inside.  Yelp has never let me down, so I'll be giving this place a second chance in the near future.  

One star for no cover."
1,So sad! Ive been coming here for 15 years and used to love this place. My 5 star review is now 1. Prices have gone up $2 and portions sizes are going down. The food is still good but its not worth the money. I dont know if management changed or if they just started trying to gouge people but i hope something changes. They lost a long time loyal customer today.
1,"Our 4x4 jeep was driven into a wall and through a concrete bench by a negilent employee. He claims his feet were wet and his foot slipped. This accident resulted in a blown out tire, and a severely damaged suspension. For all the jeep enthusiasts out there, you know this hurts. To make matters worse, they will not provide any property damage, or liability insurance information. I keep getting the same story...the owner is out of town, the GM is on vacation. Looking at parts, labor and the cost of a rental so I could work this week-I am already in the 800$ range. 

Pending the owner's resolution to our issue, this review may be deleted. I am all about opportunities for redemption.

Update: 5 days later, no tow truck, no tire, no repairs. We are still out a vehicle. No response. The owner, Marc Rosenberg actually freaked out on me in front of customers demanding I take this review down. In a yelp driven rage, he said ""I'm not fixing your piece of sh** 1996 jeep"" and called the police to have me trespassed from the property. When they arrived, he slipped out the backdoor and further avoided the situation. Of course I wasn't trespassed. I was invited there to meet with someone to discuss repairs which needless to say was a mistake and a joke much like this business.

Update: 3 weeks have passed. I am sure they assume we gave up. Not likely.

Update:5 months later, and a default judgement has been entered in our favor. TNT did not answer the complaint. I would encourage other customers to pursue damages against TNT if your vehicle was damaged and not repaired."
1,"I have been coming here for awhile with my 2 cars.  I have watched them slowly go down hill.  They are slowly but surely taking longer, the quality of service has completely dropped off and you can tell nobody enjoys what they do.  Outside of the usually pleasant cashier or orser taker, people just look miserable, toss stuff around and generally have no concern for accidental damage to your stuff.  I was there for an hour today for a simple handwash.  No wax, no buff, just a simple hand wash.  Car sat there because they dont communicate.  They called people over the intercomm twice before someone finally came out.  The carpets had straight up dirt on them because of the lazy vacuuming job.  There were streaks everywhere, I had to come home and wipe down the entire car again.  They dont blow the mirrors out enough so soapy water just poured all over the sides the second I drove off.  There are no standards, no supervisors spot checking quality.  I get that this is an express style wash, but for your prices have some standards and hold your people too them.  2 people were complaining to a manager while I was there for similar reasons.  They love to move my seats around as well, why? You are in my car less than 2mins.  Why do you need to adjust my seat settings?  Needless to say todays looong wash paired with a below standards wash I am officially done with this place.  It was better before T.N.T. took over."
1,THEY STEAL STUFF  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE We took our car there yesterday.  Our nano along with a USB cable were hooked up to the USB port in the middle console of the car.  We have gone many times and the Nano and the USB cable have always been left in the middle console and never touched. But yesterday it was taken out of our car.  They saw on tape an employee disconnecting the USB cable then stand up and rub his pockets.  The police were called.  The cop said he did see on camera the employee disconnecting the USB cable but could not see on tape where the employee put the cable along with the little nano as the camera was not clear enough to show that.  So since the employee denied having the Nano and USB cable they said we were out of luck as they were not sure what happened to the Nano and USB cable. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUSINESS
1,"my mp3 nano 16 gb was missing during cleaning,we saw on the video camera that the one man disconnected it but the police said they couldn't tell for sure if the guy took it because he was blocking the camera.the manger then posted he was getting me a new one just for customer care,well it took a week to get it and it doesn't work in my car.it was used has all kinds of scraches in it and one the screen.it also had someone elses play list and name in it. it is an 8gb,mine was a 16gb,that would of been fine if it worked.one the one hand it was nice of them to try,but they got someone elses used one,and i guess my lesson is to not use them anymore, and take everything out of my car at any car wash.it's a shame,because i just had my car detailed there about a month ago for 160 dollars,and my wife's car detailed for 129 dollars,just a few weeks ago.i never had a problem at this car wash until now."
1,I give it 1star because the crab cakes were horrible and smelt nasty & tasted disgusting.the waitress said it was normal but how! please fix.
1,Horrible! Took my car in for an oil change was quoted one price and was told if we brought our other car it would be $88 for both. After they bait and switched and claimed the cars required more oil and charged us $160. This was not the case they refused to honor their quote and refused to give me our cars! Run from this business! I am reporting them to attorney general and calling my lawyer. Please run from this business!!!! They are unprofessional and rude. Despite their response they did do business this way and this was my experience! And based on all the other reviews I am not surprised. As you can see they still wont acknowledge their bad service!!!!
1,"This place doesn't have a good reputation but I was in a hurry. When I called all the person who greeted me on the phone said was ""hello"". And that's it. I asked is this car wash? ""Yeah"". Ok. She handed me off to someone who said that it would be $69.00 and they'd throw in a free exterior wash worth $21.00 and he'd have it done in an hour. As soon as I got there he tried to raise the price to $120. I said no. I needed my car detailed because a crazy person climbed in and peed in my car. This was no problem on the phone but now it was. Since I wouldn't pay for the full detailing he would have to charge another twenty dollars because of the pee. They then charged me for the $69 detailing and the $21 car wash which he said would be free. The handwritten slip he gave me did not match the receipt. The employees trash talk their boss Mark (maybe Mike) who must be the most charitable person in Peoria to hire these people. They were supposed to steam and shampoo the seats and floor, and shampoo the carpets. Mediocre results. The guys doing the work outside seem like they're doing their best. Wouldn't use this service again."
1,"Wow been going to this place for years and tonight just blew me away. Called in for a pick up order some guy answered first time. Gave order ask if I could pay with CC over the phone not able to because had to be present with my card when picking up. Told him my wife was picking it up to just put the order in and she will pay for it. Dude tells me stop yelling which I wasn't I was just telling him to put it in and she will pay. He hung up. Called back and asked if he hung up on me and said yea and he will hang up again...he did.. What an asshole wanted to drive down and handle it in person but not worth my time.

The owners who has always been great to us may want to review their staff. With this type of shit ass attitude business will decline if it has not done so. 

If you don't mind a drive go to New York chinese or better yet if you want really great chinese food go to Wo Fat look them up. I will never purchase from little dumplings and I will let a lot of people know the new staff sucks ass!!!"
1,"Im sorry, it was not good at all, being from Montreal and reading my reviews and photos from poutine  from there can tell you i have had a few. 
I ordered their traditional large poutine, first there was little to no curds on it and not enough gravy to call it a poutine.  i shared the poutine with my family  we all took one bite and my son spit it out and my wife and i forced it down. the gravy was NOT traditional poutine gravy it had no flavor no thickness just blah,  the fries had a burnt taste or some (taste) and not a good one,  my son refused to eat any more i tried one more bite but we ended up tossing it out :(  . i made the trip to 17 just to try it i wont be going back.  Unless you have been to Quebec to try the ones there you have nothing to compare it to."
1,"The waitress was extremely rude, did not want to be there, I had to catch a plane and there were only a couple people I the place. Took 40 mins to get food, people served after us got fed first, figured it was because we were not regulars. 

Had to quite literally beg for pink sweetener 4 times, then she brought one. Husband took for his tea, I ask for some for my coffee, she got smart with me. 

I wanted to leave but he wanted to wait. The food was ok, but not worth 45 min wait for breakfast."
1,"I used to come here occasionally and like the wings and the sandwiches. The last three times have been progressively worse over the last year. The pasta overcooked, the sauce thick and tasteless, the salad rife with old refrigerator - you know what I mean, the wings and fish and french fries as if they came straight from the SYSCO truck and then to the freezer then to the fryer. If you don't know what I mean then by all means keep eating here. Clearly the food does not deter the masses who pack this place and Olive Garden etc. I'm sure the bar is a good time. It is too bad that even a local small chain has let the food go like this. I imagine they are resting on their reputation. The service is friendly and the outside patio is nice but I will not return because of the food."
1,"Terrible experience.  Food took over an hr and when we got it,  the food was cold. We bought appetizers and didn't get them till the food came.  The wings were bland.  I bought the second hottest one and wasn't hot at all. The servers were nice but not efficient."
1,"Where oh were do I begin...?

I came here a couple weeks back and got my car washed. The sales guy preside me on what I thought would be a great deal. An extra car wash with the seats cleaned and the doors/dashboards scrubbed down. All for $60. 

I wasn't able to stay to get the detail because I had an appointment to make, so I prepaid and came back the following week. The wash wasn't even that great, but ?

My husband and I dropped it off expecting to wait about an hour because hat is what was quoted to be the week before. TWO hours later and they hadn't even pulled it into to get the detail. It was parked in a sea of cars who also hadn't been helped. No one came to notify us how long it would take. No apology. Nothing. 

I approached the cashier to take our car so we could come back another time when we had time. (We weren't about to wait another TWO hours for it to get done) 

When I called to reschedule my appointment because I couldn't make it in time for work, the guy said ""You're rescheduling AGAIN!?"" He is so lucky I didn't flip out on him. I calmly explained that I worked downtown and there was no way I would make it in time. I was trying to respect their time. 

When I showed up the next morning for my 8am appointment I wasn't helped until 8:08. I was quoted an hour to an hour and 20 minute wait. It took them over 2 hours. Needless to say, we won't be back. I'd suggest you don't come either. How they are still in business is besides me. Literally the worst customer service I have EVER experienced."
1,"WARNING..UNDER CONSTRUCTION!  We have been here before and have enjoyed our stay in the past.   Website did say renovations were being made to lobby..understatement!  After walking in with an obvious shocked look on my face, I was assured that our King Suite was modern and renovations were already made.  We checked in at the wee hours of the morning, so we just took our room key and headed to the room.   We get to the elevator and it is trashed and disgusting (could they not at least kept one of the 3 elevators in decent condition)?  We get off on our floor and are greeted with no carpeting, but padding.   WALK ON THE PADDING otherwise your feet will stick to glue.   We get to the room and it was quite apparent that this room was in need of repairs ages ago.   it didn't stop at repairs either.   I slept well and proceeded to shower, the mold and tile falling off the base board area was the last straw.   I would post pictures but i know how nice this place used to be and they ate making upgrades.   Just don't lie to your guests about the rooms.   We informed them of our disappointment and the did give us some $$ off but we will check out early regardless.  On another note, our floor has no carpet when getting off elevator and yet the others do.  Why on earth would you put anyone, especially a Hilton Honors guest on a carpet less floor?  Use your head people!"
1,"I had my 03 Mazda miata detail here. Its a two door and a standard transmission. The manager did not gave keys to the people that was going to Detail my car so they had no idea how to clean a manual transmission car. When I got back to pick my car up. The car seems like it was never detail! I paid $115 and it feels like I would have done better at home detailing it myself. Don't get me wrong, i brought my scion xb here before and they were awesome... but now, they don't seem to value customers anymore."
1,"very upset over the crap we endured last night 
they wouldn't take a reservation over the phone and then we were informed it was a 90 minute wait with standing room only...not impressed"
1,"Did we just get there TOO early or what?

I heard good things about this and dragged my friends there after the buffet. It had 1 long table and some smaller ones on the other side. Where's the live music? 

No one was at the front and when we walked in, there were about half dozen people drinking. No music, no service. Walked in and walked out."
1,"Horrible service! I'm still waiting for the beer I ordered last Saturday.
All the food is horrible here I gave this place a couple of chances never enjoyed a single thing.
They boast that the wings are the best (not a chance ) small, overpriced ,cold and gross , I was horribly sick the next day.
My table was oily and dirty when I sat down.
Only thing this place has is a lot of screens pool tables and looks cool but otherwise horrible so many better bars with better food in the area.
If you don't want to get sick then don't ever go eat here .....
When I finally got my beer from last Saturday it was flat and my glass was hot which made my beer warm.
Highly overrated overpriced"
1,"The Battleship is an excellent value and feeds quite a few! 
My tip best to call ahead with your order especially on Steeler Sunday's.
If I had a wish list for the triangle, I'd add a place order here line and a pay here line. 

6-10-18 update-called our order in we were given a 30-35 minuet wait time.
Prior to hanging up the gentleman told us 45 minuets...ok...
We arrived to pick up our order we were told it would be ready soon...25 minuets later we left.
NO Organization what's 

6/10/18 called in my order and was given a 30 minuet pickup time, prior to hanging up he changed my time to 45 minuets. I arrived to pickup my super battleship and was told I was next...fast forward another 20 minuets...nothing...nothing but consistent disorganization. I left and went to poppa johns."
1,"Service was good, ambience nice
Food lousy. Way too salty. 65 dollar steak and they don't know how to cook"
1,Found a pubic hair in the chicken fried rice. Definitely recommend this place if you like pubic hair. If not I suggest the Panda Express next door.
1,"I'm not big on writing reviews, but nothing motivates me more to do so then getting a severe case of diarrhea after a highly anticipated first visit. My girlfriend and I came home feeling sick, but I am suffering more so because I ate the majority of it. We shared the sardines appetizer, seafood linguine, and veal chop. The sardines were overcooked and dry, but the sauce was ok. The seafood linguine sauce tasted great, but a little more linguine would have been excellent. I think the lobster was the culprit. Something about the aftertaste was a little off. The lobster had a kind of smelly aquarium. The veal chop was just a veal chop, for something that cost 28 bucks, they could have thrown in a vegetable or garnish. I thought the taste was okay,  but my GF thought it was way too salty and couldn't eat more than two bites. 
I like to be supportive of local businesses and restaurants since I own property and business here myself but shit, not when you get people sick. 
Chef, please get your act together. I'm sure you don't want the health inspector breathing down your neck. Unfortunately my 1st and last visit. Still no apology since my visit on may 17th, so this review will stick."
1,Buyer beware this car wash RUINED my car. I paid over $100 for a detail when I brought my car home I realized my carpets were green from all the left over shampoo. I brought it back that same day and they re-shampood my car. for 3 days I left my windows open and tried to air out the car but it smelled AWFUL.  I took towels and was able to ring water out of my carpets (after 3 whole days!). I took it back the next morning for a THIRD time and told them my carpets now have mold and they re-did the shampoo again. I go to pick up my vehicle after 2 hours and they had killed my car battery which lead to me needing to buy a new battery. So now I'm $250 in the hole and 2 weeks later my carpets still have mold which means I can't drive my vehicle because I have a newborn and mold spores are dangerous. I have to replace my car carpets which is over $500. I've placed numerous tickets online asking for a phone call and I can't get a call back. To top it off the manager hung up on my husband when we called to get our money back. This entire experience has been an absolute nightmare. The picture I've attached is a screenshot of my husband ringing water out of a towel from my back seat carpet.
1,"Used a groupon here for my car and my mom's car. The first weekend they didn't bother calling when they were closed so we showed up to a dark office. Then we went this weekend and I could have done a better job with a rag and PineSol! 

Disappointed I gave them a second chance. I highly urge you to go elsewhere. 

Plus, the woman cashier/business owner had a nasty attitude. All around bad business."
1,The worse pedicure I ever had! The guy cut my toe made me bleed. Got the hot stone pedi paid extra and didn't get a good message. Told the manager how unhappy I was and it didn't seem to faze him. Will not go back
1,"I am a hardcore Hilton lover.  This time she cheated on me.  Staying at Hilton's over 165 nights a year I am use to receiving exceptional value.  But today April 26 I have see it all! 

First there was construction all over the place and it was not listed on their website.  I find that extremely disturbing.  Next was the room.  Some Hilton's show there age, this one hit the wall.  

What made me sick to my stomach was I came in from work and the sofa seemed damp.  There was nothing dripping and I had a water bottle laying there so I thought it was that.  The next morning the sofa was soaked.  I looked up at a small maintenance hatch and drip drip drip.....  Called maintenance department they responded and opened up the hatch and assured me it was the cold water pipes.  

Now, I get a call from the front desk, had to move to a new room.  Here is why I refuse to come back here and I caution anyone who would be thinking of coming here.   I asked if they could being the key up and a staff person to bring a trolley.  No dice, the clerk sounded as if it were my fault that I had to move!

Next, looking up in the open hatch I clearly saw the bottom drain of the shower with bend underneath...MEANING MY SOFA WAS FULL OF SOMEONES USED SHOWER WATER.....  I am posting picture as proof.  Paint chips, water damage, pissed off staff, no assistance with moving....Not what I expected at an Embassy.

Two more things to consider.  The hotel seems to be in a ""high risk"" area.  You see security van patrolling the parking lot non-stop.  The the final nail in the coffin.  There is a freight train line within a few hundred feet and you can hear it clearly as they go by.  For those who are old enough to remember I love Lucy there was a train scene when the Riccardo's and Mertz's were in a hillbilly hotel on their what to see  uncle Ernie and the room shook so bad the bed moved across the floor.

I am being a bit dramatic on the train, but the totality of the problems makes it a place that I cannot and will not recommend.  I snapped a few shots and posted them in my page here.  Please take a look!"
1,I do not know why I return to this carwash expecting a better experience. The only good thing about this store is their location. Other than that their carwashes are sloppy. Do not like the windshield repair sellers at the check-in line and the store is sadly bare inside.
1,"I definitely agree with Amy A.'s review.

I came here tonight (a Tuesday evening around 5:00). I could count on my hand the number of other people in the place. There were two servers and one cook. The other people already had their food. We sat down and still waited 5-10 minutes before a server came and greeted us, asking what we'd like to drink. We each ordered a coffee and I a drink. Another 10 minutes go by before we get our coffee...but no water! She took our food order...pork chops for me and eggs for who I was with. Not a hard order. 30 minutes later they finally come back and my water is still no where to be seen (it came a couple minutes later).

The pork chops were rubbery and had nothing to them. It came with hashbrowns and salad from a bag. Her scrambled eggs weren't cooked all the way. When we asked for more coffee she didn't come back. We finally had enough and got up to go. Can you believe that the server had lost our ticket? So she made up some number and charged us.

Never coming back and this experience has put me off from any Waffle House. The place was unsanitary: flies, gross build up on the table edges, sticky floor, splotches on the tables, etc. You'd think this Waffle House in particular would look much better and have better service being so close to a decent hotel and sort of off the I-10. The location at Baseline and Priest is much better. They're normally packed but deliver impeccable service. Doesn't matter we're not going to any one of these places again. 1 star is too much."
1,"I think it's rare that I give a one star review because I always try to be the optimistic patron. Granted. However, my/our experience at Caramel was right up there with HORRIBLE.  A friend who is a local recommended this place since it's more of a lounge scene and not an obnoxious nightclub.  

We were a group of 5, walked in on a Sun. night around 11pm, some top 40 hit was being mixed loudly overhead.  Proceeded to the bar, my friend asked the bartender if he could recommend any specialty drinks with bourbon or whiskey. Two things - 1. Yes, she knows that these are not typical alkies to mix but we did just read a FULL article (with pics and recipes !) in the LV magazine about bartenders and their creative elixirs using whiskey and bourbon and 2. Most exotic concoctions are made with vodka but she reacts how I do on tequila - BAD, BAD, BAAAD news.

His response ? Rolled his eyes, got on his high and mighty hat and said ""people who drink whiskey and bourbon don't mix them with anything"" Really !?! Because last time I checked, when I'm paying close to $20 f*(*ing dollars for a drink I don't think I asked for judgment from a Las Vegas bartender.  So, while my friend tried to ignore his arrogance and decide on a drink, we ordered for the 3 people who were ready.  After he made the drinks he said he HAD to close out the tab on the 3 drinks, to which we said we still needed 2 more and he just said ""well, I HAVE to close out the tab while you guys decide."" Gee, I must be the idiot that thought bars make their money off drinks and not forcing people the close out when they're not ready.  I've actually never had this happen before.

Maybe my illustration didn't fully justify how RUDE AND ARROGANT he was but we were completely disgusted.  If we are going to pay $80 for 5 drinks I'd appreciate at least a basic level of courtesy, esp. from an a$$ho&e bartender who works for tips."
1,"2 stars for food and 1 star for service. Came here with a small crowd to have a good night after work. What resulted was a night of waiting for a 15 minute chow down.

I mean, I read the reviews coming here but one of my friends was a regular so I thought it wouldn't be that bad, but it was pretty freaking bad. Here's how our waiting game went: 40 minutes for the table, 20 minutes to order drinks, 20 minutes to order food, 20 minutes for the food to arrive, 15 mins of eating (yay!), 20 minutes for the bill and machine. 

Also, they were out of half the things we ordered. Okay, I exaggerated, it was like 2 things, but after waiting so long to order it was like the world was ending. No Dr.Pepper BBQ and one of the apps.

As for the food, it was okay, and by okay I mean ""seriously, this is what we get after waiting 2 hours? DON'T EVEN CARE, I'M STARVING RIGHT NOW. CHOMPCHOMP"". 
I got the Korean BBQ x Sweet Chili Thai which was nothing in terms of heat, and I can't really handle my spice, so it really should have been closer to the top of the list. 
The Forty Creek BBQ was okay, it's one of the sweeter BBQ sauces. 
The deep friend mushrooms lived up to the name. 
The dry cajun wings came drenched in the salty cajun seasoning and was almost inedible. I took a bite and my mouth dried up like a desert, the seasoning even gave it a sandy effect. 
The poutines/fries were so not worth the price, as you get a handful of fries and a couple teaspoons of toppings.
The one standout of the table were the deep fried pickles.

Yeah... I'm not coming back."
1,"Median age is 80.  If you are coming in for a quick beer, forget it.  The employees are much more interested in talking to each other than in serving you.  It's hot, it's cold.  The temperature is never level.  I felt menopausal just sitting at the bar.  I have seen them serve parents (with their children at the table) alcohol until the police have been called.  People are loud and obnoxious.  Never again."
1,I used to come here for pho normally since it is close to my house. Food came quickly and was delicious. However I stopped coming here after finding a fly in my pho.
1,"Christmas Eve 2017 my guinea pig was ill and this establishment killed him! I knew all he needed was antibiotics because he was in much worse condition 1 year ago and I was able to save his life with only that. I would like to mention it was this establishment that sold me the antibiotics that did save his life about a year ago. Being that they did this, I brought poofy back since they of course should have this in his medical file. The vet looked him over and I brought up everything that happened about 1 year ago and I mentioned he was in a much worse condition and all we needed was antibiotics. We are also on a tight budget. So with all of the information they have they sent in a rep giving us an expensive treatment of over $500 and the lower option that I think was around $250. I explained to him again that my poofy was in a much worse condition and the antibiotics sufficed. The rep gave me this look and an attitude like I didn't know what I was talking about and pushed for a water treatment for dehydration. I kept saying I didn't think poofy needed it and he again kept pushing it. Which I'd like to point out this man is not even the actual vet. He made me feel like this water treatment was imparative so I finally agreed. When they brought my poofy back to me he literally jumped from the person who brought him to me into my arms. I then noticed poofy kept opening his mouth. This was something I have never seen him do before in my life, even when he was half dying they year before! My husband immediately grabs the vet in back and brings her to the room. I then ask her about why he kept opening his mouth and told her he was not doing that before they took him in for the water treatment. She gives me this big smile and says ""oh it's fine! That's totally normal because he has an upper respiratory infection. Also the water treatment stressed him out but it's totally fine and normal that's what the antibiotics are for."" Trusting her I brought him home. I tried to give him the meds but he turned away and he kept doing the mouth thing non stop from when they brought him back to me till that point. He then tried to crawl onto my bed from my arms and fell over. In that moment I realized he was dying! That sorry excuse for a vet knew he was dying and just smiled and lied through her teeth!!! That mouth thing he was doing was struggling to breathe! That vet let my poofy suffer for over 1 hour struggling to breathe till his very last attempt because she cared more about making money when she was the one who put him in that position by having her rep push a treatment that stressed him out making his condition worse! THIS IS AN AWFUL PLACE! THEY WILL SUGGEST TREATMENT TO MAKE MORE MONEY THAT COULD POSSIBLY KILL YOUR PET! THEN WHEN THEY DO THE TREATMENT AND MAKE YOUR PET WORSE WILL LIE TO YOU AND LET YOUR PET DIE IF THEY KNOW YOU DONT HAVE MONEY TO PAY FOR THEIR MISTAKE!! IF YOU VALUE YOUR PETS LIFE DO NOT BRING THEM HERE! Oh but they sent me a sympathy card so I guess that makes it better right?! UM Noooo!!! What kind of sadistic sick evil monster sees an animal dying because of what they have done then smiles to their owners face and says it's normal?! She could have done the right thing and tried to save him since she inflicted the stress upon him in which she stated so herself! But instead let that animal suffer in pain dying. That is a while new type of sick and twisted demented human being. I wouldn't even call that person human!"
1,"I was utterly disappointed by their service. The tables were not cleaned. There was rice and water on the chairs.

We found ourself a half cleaned table and when I was halfway done eating (10:40pm), I was told by the waiter that we are closing in a few minutes. I gave her a look basically stating do you want me to stop eating.. She again came back in 5 mins stating we have to turn off the lights. At that point I just got up and left.

I told her while leaving that they should have just told me at 10:20pm (when I arrived) that they are not taking orders. 

I am surprised this place is still open with this kind of service. 

Better go somewhere else."
1,"Well, it's October 2017.  I've lived here for 6 years and still haven't been able to use this range.  Useless and run by assholes."
1,"Went here yesterday and ordered a barg kabab and chicken breast and a bolani. The bolani was undercooked and had absolutely no filling in it like none whatsoever.  Was told that ""This is how we make it."" It was literally the worst bolani I've seen.  The barg kabab was also not cooked all the way through that we only found out when we got home and ate some.  There was another lady behind us who complained about the portion sizes and the salad. The salad we got was less then half the box and consisted of 1 cucumber slice and the end of a tomato that you would normally throw out. Was given another box of equal quantity of salad after complaining about it.  Their orange sauce was doused in hot sauce and completely undigestsble unless you're into super spicy throat burning sauce. The lady returned the food and got her money back and I'm thinking I should've done the same. Definitely won't be going back. The cooks have definitely changed because it used to be good. I might have given it another chance if it wasn't for that other lady and her recent experience."
1,They were very strict on all you can eat. They told me if I left some food on my plate the would penalize me by charging me more money on the things I didn't eat. It was  a very strict restaurant. I got the California role and shrimp tempura roll also the crunchy roll the sushi was average. But it was very strict I couldn't even give my friends a piece of the sushi.
1,"The customer service today was non existent. I placed 2 orders. One of them was wrong. I return and say I received the wrong croissant and she says I had ordered exactly what I was given. I also had ordered a venti peppermint mocha. I ask how much longer I have to wait for it and I flat out get told I did not order a drink. UGH! The register wasn't printing receipts so I was about to open my app as proof. I decided to just tell the barista my exact 2 orders and then my drink pops up on the other end. The store was empty and I ended waiting just as long as if it was the morning rush. I usually visit in the am, the night crew is something else. It seems they have some type of attitude, just too snotty. The longer I sit in the lobby, the more I get to experience bad service, customer after customer!"
1,I wanted to order take out for my daughter and I but was told no to to-go orders for children. I understand people probably try to take advantage of kids meals everywhere but she was with me. I cannot support a business who has such a ridiculous no exception policy. My 8 year old daughter would like to eat too!
1,"Worse service and food, especially with the Malaysian chicken rice which came with a pain white rice!!"
1,"Cons 

Terrible food! 
My chicken smell like fish
The meat had a smell 
Expensive for what you get 

Pros
Lot of Parking
Hummus and bread was good 
Decor is beautiful"
1,This is the worst Starbucks in the whole town. I only go here because it's the closet to my house but every time I order here my drink is messed up some how. If I'm paying for all the add ons for a drink you should probably make sure that there in there I constantly have to ask to make sure that they did add them and then every time you ask they always make it seem like a hassle to re do something . Worst customer service ever.
1,"Went for dinner on a Sunday night for a girlfriend's birthday, with a party of 9. First impressions were great with a wonderful view and overall eye-pleasing decor. Unfortunately, that's how far the positive characteristics go. We will absolutely not be returning.

Food
Their entire menu was mediocre, not to mention quite expensive. My friend's tuna ceviche came almost an hour later than everyone else's orders. Instead of offering compensation for that by possibly making it on the house, all we got were displeasing jokes from our server, who basically teased her for having to share everyone else's food. 
They do not have the traditional portions and selection sizes for main courses, but instead have a variety of skewers, which are ridiculously steep in price for what you actually get. We had all tried the chicken ($14 a skewer), short rib ($20), lobster ($30), and shrimp ($26). All had about 4-5 pieces per skewer, and did not come with any sides. Some may assume that the price reflect the flavour or quality, but I can assure you that those prices do not justify what is being put on your plate. 


Service
The service was the worst part of the experience, and the main reason why we will not be coming back to this restaurant (and possibly the Bisha Hotel, altogether). I have mentioned our indecorous waiter with his failed jokes, but the rest of the staff also shared the unprofessional manners. A few of our guests were running a bit late, and a hostess deemed to ask if it was fine for her to take the table away when the restaurant was almost empty, and tons of other tables were available. She rushed the birthday girl into confirming if the other guests we had were still coming, which was extremely distasteful. Aside from that, numerous servers and hostesses kept reminding us that we only had the table until 9pm (we were there are 6pm). A reminder once or twice is acceptable, but to be in constant notification every few minutes was just horrific. How could we finish our food in a timely manner when everything comes more than 30 minutes late? 

All in all, we will not be coming back. There are many other places with the great view, but have way better service, and a more palatable menu. Save your money and experience, especially if you are thinking of going for a special occasion, celebrating it at this restaurant would not be advisable as it might just ruin your day."
1,"I was sold a lemon the end of November 2016.  I reported the issues before driving the CX-9 off the lot to Michael Knox and he stated the car just needed a system update.  Since then this car has been in their service department over 8 times.  I've been treated so poorly there and each person just passes the buck even though the General Manager and the Parts Manager who is no longer there stated the car was unsafe to drive.  I've had 2 rentals and the owner's dealer car.  The owner will not handle this situation.  The infotainment system continues to malfunction and turn off in the middle of driving to my destinations and 2 weeks ago in the same week the same tire went flat without any warning until the tire was burning on the metal.  The manager would not match Discount Tire's price and then refused to service me at his dealership over the phone.  He was verbally abusive, condescending, immature and unprofessional.  His name is George Salman.  He is an amateur.  I have escalated this to Mazda Customer Care and will be retaining a Lemon Law attorney.  I have been taken advantage of being a single educated mother who knows medicine and not cars.  It's outrageous the way I have been ignored and mistreated and will be escalating this guaranteed.  I even went as far and recorded all conversations with the General Manager, Parts Manager and the intake person which all agreed that the problem cannot be fixed and deemed it a Lemon but no one will do anything about it.  It's unsafe and they won't replace my car or settle with me.  George Salman did not behave as a professional that has been in the business. He treats customers like dirt. He gave me more of a difficult time due to a malfunction that they sold to me. The electronic system is flawed. Both times my tires became flat no warn ing light came on and just the other night the infotainment system went out during my drive home late at night with 2 small boys. George Salman and Matt the parts manager stated the car was unsafe and most likely could not be resolved. I have not ever been treated with such poor customer service like this man treated me with witnesses. It's all documented and I'm a highly skilled RN. I had to bring it back over 5 times and each time was a struggle. He made it so difficult when I was sold a car that shouldn't have been sold. The wait time, the abuse, the load of crap and excuses. He had no idea how to handle the situation and George Salman disparaged his own company that he works for. This truly has been a nightmare and I've only owned higher end cars. I will update the outcome."
1,"I liked the front staff, so I want to point out that my experience with them was good. 

With that said, I'm not satisfied with the medical treatment from the veterinarian.

My German Shepherd is a very submissive dog to everyone, and I've never had a complaint about him, so I was told that his ear could not be flushed last week or this week because he was resisting treatment. 

When I confronted the charges of the ear cleaning from last week, the story was changed that his ear was in fact cleaned the first time. 

I did not notice his ears to be wet last time and I even asked if his ears were actually cleaned. Moreover, I've always been given a bigger bottle of keto ear flush from every other vet when this occurs, but I was prescribed a bottle that was too small, so I ran out before the week was even over and had to buy another smaller bottle on the second visit. 

To put it simply, I believe that I've been charged for treatment that was not actually applied and their story is not consistent with charges on my receipt. 

I recommend another vet to be honest."
1,They put very little meat in their sandwiches and they taste just okay. Bubble tea is way too sweet.
1,Warning! This place has horrible! I've been to some of the best Japanese spots nearby and this is not one. Sushi was disgusting! The waiter forgot my hibachi entree and served me the check with it included. Manager did a terrible job resolving the matter.  Save your money and time.
1,The rice on the sushi was overcooked and mushy. I also ordered chicken teriyaki and it was very under-seasoned.
1,"Let me start off by saying that I don't eat meat. we checked their website and they have a special section for their veggie food. we found out that they don't have veggie options available on their menu. so I didn't order anything since the person who was putting in the order was not accommodating enough to mention any other options. after my friends got their food, they asked for a spoon. the spoon was taken right out of a water/liquid bucket and dried with a hand towel infront of us and given to my friend. so disgusting. poor service and messy place with the harsh kabob odor."
1,This is total BS AND I would know as I am well educated in alternative and Eastern Medicines. Worst was that the girl at front who also filled our bath had a total attitude towards my friend and I. It was one of those places that doesn't understand the reason for a Groupon is to try and get customers in your door than provide an excellent experience so they come back. She also charged us more than the Groupon and tried to get us to pay additiinal money. I had to make her read the fine print. So when she realized she was wring instead of an I'm sorry she git rude. We even tipped her 20% and she didn't even look either if us in the eye.
1,"Worst service on earth! went there at 8:45 and ordered a dinner plate, a skewer of kandahar kabob and a drink. That order ... which was supposed to be ready in 15 mins according to the cashier took an HOUR to come! there was no apology or explanation as to why the order was taking so long. the servers didn't know what the hell they were doing and worst part is the people who ordered after us got their food delivered before us. Supposedly, they give more importance to the ""eat in orders"" and give little to no importance to the people doing take out! our order was 163 and orders 173,171,170,168,169,167 etc were all being served right in front of us. Now onto the food, nothing great, not even decent. kabob was dry, rice was very little and bread was despicable. Please do yourself a favour and go to ANY other afghan restaurant ... there are so many good ones like naan and kabob, bamiyan etc. This is a joke of a restaurant with idiots working in it. Dont even deserve half a star let alone a one star."
1,I was visiting from out of town and thought I was planning ahead by booking a shampoo and blowout online.  When I arrived I was met by an extremely rude woman who declared I didn't get a confirmation so I had no appointment.  I understand that it was a mistake on my part but this person was so unaccommodating and rude that I left furious!  She didn't look to see if there was anything  later that day or the next or apologize for the glitz in booking.  Fortunately for me I walked across to Scott Damon Salon and was met by the kindest stylist who fit me in for the same price.
1,"I have had my girl for 13 years and my boy for 7. We've been going here all the while. My girl  has surpassed her life expectancy for a dog her size, and she's doing great! I used to be content with the services at Lone Animal Animal Hosp., until recently. I've seen Dr. Eisenmann on our last 2 visits. Both times, she's given me workups to do expensive, unnecessary tests. When I decline those services, she becomes short and doesn't want to answer any questions or offer any information. Exams are complimentary with shots. We came for shots and I told her my girl was sick for a couple days last week. So, Dr. Eisenmann gave her her annual shots and did the routine 2 minute exam, but refused to keep the exam complimentary because my dog was sick the week before. Her assistant told the clerk not to charge for the exam ($50), but Dr. Eisenmann insisted. She's in it for the money and doesn't understand customer service. I won't be going back there anymore."
1,"The hummus was gravy, the pita bread came right from the store bought package, and the chicken shawarma tasted like nothing. Sad face. 

Customer service was excellent! Very nice Persian family runs this spot. I got my order in right away and they were very helpful. But the dish was so awful I thanked them quickly and had to run out for plan B meal cuz I just cannot stomach the food."
1,"This place was horrible, and the food was dry. I ordered the chicken kebab but only got one skewer of the kebab. Not only that, but it was sooo hot inside, and the AC was not turned on. Overall, I had a terrible experience and would not recommend this place. Food quality is NOT good."
1,I would NEVER EVER go back to this place..the rangers there are on power trips and are EXTREMELY RUDE....I know safety is important but they abuse that fact and use it to pump up their own egos and take their personal frustrations out on the customers...my advice go out in the far desert and shoot.
1,"The only reason this restaurant gets any stars at all is because of the interior decorations/design. Really beautiful. 

Otherwise, the outdoors are horrible, dust, dirt, construction. 

The food is actually horrible, the meats were undercooked, the rice was unflavored. The food poorly reflected Turkish cuisine. And it's way over priced. 

If you thought that was bad, let's not even begin with the customer service here. Just horrible. They give zero shits about their customers and the waitress gets real sweet when it's time to pay the bill, other than that the staff is rude af the entire time and snarky. 

Will never be coming back."
1,"We had made reservations for this place a week ago and requested patio seating. We sat inside. When we had asked to be seated outside since there were tables available, one of them was for the ""hotel owner"". We asked what about putting 2 tables together outside and was told ""we never do that"". When we asked about sitting at the patio like furniture, we were told that it was up to the servers since we started a table inside an hour or so ago. We told them we will close our bill inside and start a new bill with another server outside. Anyway, to end the story we were told that everything is taken outside.  So we paid the bill and left.  Lousy customer service. When is it up to the servers and not the customers? This is not the only place to go to downtown."
1,"Cool. I LOVE PAYING $20 for 5 pieces of pasta swimming in lemon water, and extremely slow service."
1,The view is amazing but the food is all crap. The wine is over priced and the food is nothing to write about. The Server did not even know how to carry plates or serve
1,"The service was rude.  I left a tip on the table but the waitress/owner didn't see it and loudly told us in front of all the customers that we forgot to leave a tip.  It was embarrassing and they shouldn't have done that.  Even if we didn't leave a tip, they should have swallowed that and kept their mouth shut over a tip.  Now, I will never go back to that restaurant over that experience and it's not worth losing a customer over a tip."
1,"We were here a couple times before for dining in. Today we decided to take out. We ordered at 7:14 and it took forever and we are still waiting at 7:59. I went to asked if the food was ready. And the staff purposely said was because we didn't give tips so I could hear their conversation, hinting for us to give tips. LOL. Are we obligated to give tips for take out when you purposely tell us to give tips?

When we got home....We realized the chicken was not very fresh and the vegetable dish we order was so tiny in terms of portion....."
1,"Called the vet I use for my dogs at Craig Road Animal Hospital  and was recommended to their other location , Lone Mountain Hospital, which is their sister location for nail trims for my 2 sugar gliders, was told it would be $19 each and would have to charge additional $49 each glider for Doctors/Vet Exam. If i needed a Dr to establish my relationship with my pets, I will ask for it. Dont need to pay $100 for a Dr to tell me what I already know. Always call first for quote and any additional charges so you know what to expect. Found another Vet that wouldn't charge $100 for something I didn't want and they were happy to see Bullwinkle and Rocky. They will say anything to charge for services you don't need!"
1,Wouldn't recommend this specific location. Owner wouldn't honor the $ value of an expired groupon & didn't tell me until midway through my service. Definitely NOT worth the $. Style didn't hold up through my event & wasn't even hot or humid
1,"Worst car buying experience of my life.  Aggressive and predatory Sales department.  What they do is wait until end of the evening when store is empty to show their worst side.  Stay far away from this Dealership.  I specifically stated NO Dealer Add-Ons and that I won't sign if I see any slipped into the contract last minute.  So, they didn't put them in writing but added them to my bill ""coverertly"".  Then they deliberately acted out, creating a hostile and threatening environment at the time I was expected to ""sign"" on the dotted line.  Kind of like walking into a wolf den. They told lie after lie.  At first I thought, how sad they had to make a living stealing from honest hard-working people, then I noticed this was actually the highlight of their day."
1,"This is my 2nd time here. The first time i didn't notice anything as the crowd and line up was shorter. The food is pretty good but all of them go down the drain as the service is horrendous. First of all there are 3 servers and cashier who is completely clueless what to do. Instead of one person taking orders, and 2 person handing the food out to the customer, they have 3 of them doing the same thing and often time confused themselves. How can you get confuse at the things you are doing repeatedly? Not sure how hard is it for them to get the naan, sauce, drinks and salad dressing. I mean doesn't take a rocket scientist to do that. And the big no-no was when they handled the food with their bare hands and then touched everywhere in the counter and the cash register. I mentioned several times, please don't place your finger in the food, please use a gloves or tongs, they just ignore it and continue putting their finger into everyone's food and then use the same finger to touch the cash register and anywhere around the counter. They have great potential but run by kids who have no idea what they are doing. Basic food cleanliness and hygiene people! Come on!

Oh ya, when the counter ran out of space to put the take out food, they decided to put the food on the floor!. ON THE FLOOR!! then when customer came back to pick up the food, they just pick it up on the floor yet the customer who saw it say absolutely nothing about it. Are you kidding me? Is it me? Well, there you have it, this place nasty but food taste good. Sorry that to me is like eating from the toilet bowl. YUCK!"
1,"Got profiled at the door and turned away. I went to grab a drink after work with a friend. Admittedly, he was dressed a little too casually with a backpack for his camera (he's a food blogger) but I didn't think it was bad enough to turn away. We were told that they ""weren't accepting walk-ins"" by a very rude hostess even though they seated two groups that arrived before and after us who had no reservations. I've never been turned away from a place like this before, it was very embarrassing and because of this experience, I would never recommend it and would not plan on going back."
1,"Chase not only didn't listen to the things that we had spoke. About like calling me with a price quote with oil change and or things that warrenty didn't cover. My tire needed to be changed because of a nail so he couldn't do my requested car diagnostics. Ok well I understand the policy of Mazda however I'm having a hard time financially and I bought a used tire and brought it with me and because of policy again he said his manager didn't. Allow a perfectly good tire to be replaced. I explained to him I'll go get it fix. He then ignored the go way and beyond policy you have and didn't even bother to try to make a new appointment . Actually he seemed aloof and disconnected that I only had the loaner washed and gassed up due to having it fmduring the weekend when your service department is closed on sundays. I did call and convey a message to the answering service the day he called and said that my car was done. Which is wasn't. I have the message voicemail. I left upset and unhappy! I not only didn't get my oil changed or the requested diagnostics handled in my vehicle . I completely felt obsolete and unimportant to not only the second car I purchased with Mazda but he didn't understand why I was upset. I went up and down trying to afford a tire and then the price of oil etc etc. I left to get the tire hanged but didn't return because I've been completely discouraged with this company not only with the service department but your core values! I'm so upset even writing this thing that when I purchased both cars I was given and told the impression that you. Your core values would be that of a satisfied customer. I'm UNHAPPY WITH CHASE IM UNHAPPY WITH MAZDA. Be ware people . I don't understand car functions but. Customer service I'm a pro at . With frustrated regards

1,My Fiance ordered a Tom Yum soup with no flavor and my pho tasted like regular broth from a can. I didn't expect good service and was right. They don't accept credit cards and you have to pay at the front. Not a place worth trying!
1,"Ordered the House Special Beef Rice Noodles and the portion was small, especially the toppings. See the picture for the amount of tripe that they put in. Plus service was bad. Not returning to this place."
1,"Place is terrible.  Food,awful.  Undercooked falafel, over processed babaganoush, gyro salad oily with no flavor, and terrible service.  Guy cooking was more interested in texting, than the quality of his product. Waste of time and money"
1,"Hope you like dregs, because that's all you'll be tasting. When they screwed up our order, they didn't even make the drinks correctly the SECOND time. My main question is, how do you get coffee grounds inside of a peppermint hot chocolate? 10 people behind the counter only contributed to the chaos. Sloppy sloppy sloppy. Keep driving to California to get some real coffee."
1,Worst place to take ur dog !! They lie take ur money and then when they are Wrong don't do anything about it .. Let my dog suffer for months because their doctors got no experience !!! What ever u do don't ever go there !!! Place is f n stupid !!
1,"I used to love to go... Yes!  used to! Did they change the owner or change all the staffs? I went on April 14th , I was extremely disappointed .  The service was very bad ; he messed up our order and question us if we have ever made that order; 2) he was not patient , he ignored us and ask us not to wave him .he will come to take our order paper 
3)(the third one may not related to him) he not allowed us to order 6 ice cream for 5 ppls  , 
we were like WHAT ? It is all u can eat ? 
I swear, we ate all the food , nothing left  ! And reasonable order for 4 girls and one guy !"
1,"Just moved to the area and wanted to get service done on my 2016 Mazda. Set up an appointment for a week out (service was good setting up appt).  Then the day of my appointment I was called 70 minutes before my 11AM appointment saying they had to cancel because several of their technicians were out.  I would understand maybe they all got sick or something I'm not sure, but they were not of help in trying to reschedule.  They offered me one other day ""which I said I couldn't make because of the short notice"" and they then were like well just call and reschedule.  Maybe I am expecting more because I am in customer service, but if it is the companies fault that they cannot honor an appointment on such short notice they should go to better lengths to provide service alternatives.  Whether that be making sure I find an appointment that fits my schedule or some sort of fee off of the service for me to come back at a later, more inconvenient time, I'm not sure (that is up to their management).  Regardless, I took my car to a different dealer in the area and had great service.  Could not tell you the quality of their service here but the customer service could be better."
1,"Came here from a long day of shopping due to its Yelp ratings. Very small place for AYCE sushi, slow service and we even found hair in our rare beef teriyaki! Some of the food we ordered never came. The table beside us had the same issue. Price is $24.99 pp for the weekend which I think with the variety food they had should only be $16.99. The only that was good was that they had spider rolls which is one of my favorite that most AYCE don't have."
1,"Not impressed. I sampled the Tuna and it was pale pink, mushy and had a terrible fishy taste. We left and went to our favorite in Tempe even though this one is right up the street from our house. Very disappointing."
1,"Stopped here for the first time for lunch and ordered a tabouli salad and chicken shawarma with a side of garlic sauce. Great service and friendly counter help but the meal was probably the worst tabouli and shawarma I've eaten. Shawarma no flavor, tabouli full of bulgar filler with almost no parsley. The ""garlic sauce"" which is usually a white creamy paste was actually liquid with some chunks settled at the bottom. No bread. All this and a drink for $10.00. Never again!"
1,"AVOID TAKING YOUR VEHICLE TO THIS MAZDA REPAIR SHOP EVEN WHEN TRYING TO GET AN ESTIMATE ON REPAIRS.

THIS REPAIR SHOP WILL CUT INTO YOUR VEHICLE CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE TO SEE IF ANYTHING NEEDS TO BE ""PARTIALLY"" or ""FULLY"" REPAIRED.

The manager, Fred, who makes poor judgment decisions, cut into a vehicle that was not authorized, or consented. He played dumb and said he was advised by the insurance company to do such thing.

The vehicle was not owned by the shop, dealership, or the paid out by the insurance company.

I dropped off a drivable vehicle on 07/2018 and did not receive anything in return. Fred, refused to reassemble the vehicle and put it back in a drivable state . I did not a payout or anything to accommodate from the shop, or the insurance company.

YOUR PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES WILL BE TAMPERED AND FURTHER DAMAGED AND THEY WILL NOT BE RETURNED BACK TO YOU. 

This shop should be sued for their poor decisions"
1,"I've never walked out of a blow dry bar feeling uglier than when I walked in. First, I overheard my stylist, Sasha, complaining to the receptionist that she didn't know I was her client. As it was a 5:30 appointment  on a Friday night, she obviously wanted to go home. I told her that I part my hair on the left side. She attempted to pull out my bangs without parting my hair and only found a few fringes. I mentioned again that I part my hair on the left side and then my bangs fall straight. As she never parted my hair, when she dried the few bangs she located, my bangs parted in the middle with half falling left and half falling right, looking absolutely ridiculous. I asked her to wet my bangs and restyle them. She ignored me, finished drying the rest of my hair, and abruptly left. I asked the receptionist if Sasha was coming back. She didn't know and arranged for another stylist to try to fix my bangs, who tried but my bangs were too dry to fix. This was the worst $45 I have ever spent. I will never go to Primp and Blow again. I will go back to Dry Bar, where I've always had great blow dries but is further from my house."
1,"NOOOOOOO! SAVE YOURSELF.......DON'T BUY FROM HERE.  They do not care about customer service.  No one answers the phone at this place.  They are either ""at lunch"" or in a ""staff meeting"".  They were unwilling to negotiate at all......not even to earn a loyal customer.  I found them to be total con artists.  They attempted to make money on the back end by getting a kick back on the interest rate, lied about inventory, jacked up my interest rate, took $1,000 CASH deposit (easy to take your money, but a total pain to get it back.  It was promised the next business day by 9 a.m.  No one would take my call.  I'm pregnant and had to drive out 3 times.  3 days later only AFTER threatening to call the BBB did they release the check after 2:00).

I'm serious, I have bought dozens of cars in my day.  This outfit is a total joke.  They absorb dealer incentives rather than pass them on as a negotiating tool or for customer retention.  I have never been more frustrating in just trying to get a refund for a car they couldn't deliver...in fact, they said that Mazda didn't even manufacture a white CX-5 with black leather.  LIES.....LIES.....LIES.  

Do yourself a favor.....BUY ELSEWHERE!  I had a similar experience wtih Chapman Toyota a few years ago.  They are swindlers."
1,Terrible customer service and very rude. Tried to check out with hair products and nobody was knowledgable or helpful to do any transactions. No managers present to help. Will never go back.
1,"I felt like I was scammed by their service department. I made a reservation to bring my car in for repair. Upon arriving, I was then notified of a $132 diagnosis fee. Sinc I was stuck and needed to get my car fixed, I reluctantly agreed. After a couple a couple hours, I received a repair quote that was 2x what others quoted me. After declining the service, I paid the high diagnosis fee plus a ""supplies"" charge that no one could explain. They just said ""the computer adds it in and it can't be removed"". I feel Chapman Mazda service just wants their diagnosis fee and doesn't care about customer retention. Oh, by the way. My car is 12 years old. Chances are good I'll be buying a replacement soon. Zero chance I'll be buying from Chapman. They can just survive off their ridiculously high diagnosis fees."
1,"As I've said previously...we've been coming to LMAH for over 10 years. At least 15. And we've ALWAYS seen Dr. White. 
I had to bring my cat in to have a urine sample done. While being done, my cat pee'd on himself. The vet or staff only tried to clean it off of him with alcohol. They didn't try to actually get it off of him. They didn't even TELL ME that he pee'd all over his stomach and legs. 

So now I e had to give my cat a bath because they can't take a urine sample properly. I am LIVID."
1,"Ive had it with the service department. First of all when i bought the car i was promised $29 oil changes for the life of the car. Less than a year later it was no longer being honored. Next they started enforcing appointment times for oil changes (latest appt is 3:30). For someone that has a job, thats a little challenging. Not to mention the worlds most annoying service advisor Nik will try and up sale every service known to man (not to mention repeat himself over and over and over again until you either buy the service or cut him off). Not to mention it somehow takes them at least an hour to change oil. The final strike is due to having a job, i was 30 min late for my oil change appointment and was informed that all the techs went home... it was 4 pm... service hours are up to 6 pm... Congrats on losing a future car sell (ive purchased 3 cars from chapman dealerships)."
1,If you're in the mood for hibachi do not come here!! Food was bland and yum yum sauce was watery. Waiter was nice but I won't be back.
1,"This restaurant was a huge disappointment to me and my friend. I ordered the steak and chicken combination plate with a soup and salad. The onion soup tasted like wood and the salad hardly had any dressing on top. When ordering, the server never asked how I would like my steak prepared. To my dismay, the steak came out tougher than I would've ordered for myself. When I needed a refill of shrimp sauce, our server was nowhere to be found(???). We had to ask another server to bring us shrimp sauce and when our server later returned, he wreaked of cigarette smoke...not cool! Unfortunately, this review is about to get vulgar, my apologies :/ The next day, my gal friend and I both had a few green stools (poop). Icky! Overall, I was utterly disappointed with this establishment and did not feel it was worth the $15. I left the restaurant shaking my head :/"
1,Bad service. We have 5 people and they refuse to refill the small dish of egg cake. Food is fair but hot pot is very tasteless. Not a good Korean restaurant comparable with other ones in town.
1,Terrible first impression before we even parked. Outside on the bushes beside the restaurant were cleaning rags laying out to dry. Once inside we noticed they were the same rags that were being used to clean the tables. The water tasted nasty and the sushi wasn't that great either.
1,"The salesmen here (specifically Mike Stone) will lie right to your face to make a sale and then deny it when you call them out on it. Make sure you go in there with a tape-recorder and get a copy of everything they tell you, because the minute you walk over to finance, it will all change. And their Customer Service Manager, Danny Aaron doesn't even have the decency to follow up to emails when he requests to ""make it right""."
1,"do not go here!!! negotiated a deal over the phone & drove up from tucson, took the car i wanted to buy to a local mechanic. i had a trade. the car i wanted to buy was listed under 10k. the agreed price was 10k out the door total. my trade was worth 4-6k and i'd pay cash for the difference. they expected me to gift them my car and write them a check for 10k.  the finance mngr came in and lied right to my face. shifty guy....yuck! i hear they nego bogus deals w people from tucson, figuring if they drive that far then they will buy car regardless that they just kicked the price up by 5k. in one word....run!! buy a car anywhere but here!!!!"
1,This place is disorganized.  I came with family on a Sunday. Half the items on the menu are not available.  They seem to have run out of the Chapli Kabab.  Boulanie.  No kabli palow.  Etc.  Etc.  I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back.  Slim pickings on the menu.  No accommodations.  No apologies.  Go to another Afghan restaurant.
1,"The rice was cold and the kabobs were burned,, never coming here again ... for best Afghan food and best customer service go to naan and kabob restaurant..."
1,"Visit 1)So SLOW. I've waited 20min in the drive thru multiple times. There's no point of a drive thru if you're waiting just as long. Not many people inside and still saw no one come to the window for a few minutes. This is has happened enough times that I feel it's worth noting.

Visit 2)Passion tea - no classic syrup. Should be easy. Nope. Wrong. I walk up to the bar to ask if my drink was ready because 2 parties behind me have gotten there's. No acknowledgement from the guy ""sweeping"" 2ft in front of me. Girl who made it cops an attitude and says she put a passion tea out 20mins ago but no one has claimed it (glares at me). Finally someone checks and finds a passion iced tea with classic syrup..... welp. I only ordered 10min ago for a tea in a cup that was made wrong. 

Yeah I just make the trip to Aliante now. Eff it I'll make a 10min drive outta my way. They're friendlier :)"
1,"It tastes like card board.

Dear Pittsburgh, you have a pizza problem to add to your many others.

The size is great. The price is over priced. 

Every place i go for pizza here it turns out to be a let down. Everyone is like go here it's new and yummy.

The crust is terrible.

I guess I will have to keep on looking."
1,"RUN RUN RUN, this place is highway robbery. They will bill you act like it was put on some kind if credit which it's not. And tackle interest to your bill. I understand late fees but interest on bills that are not credit is robbery. They are awful people the so called office manager,she is rude and talks a lot of hot air just rob you. JUST DON'T GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR BUSINESS"
1,"If you love to be pampered this is not the place.  Booked an appointment and was completely dissatisfied.  Rude front desk personnel.  After reading a few not counted posts, I read there is a new owner here, which explains everything.  In the past year this salon has lost it's appeal.   Will be going to DC ranch from now on."
1,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, check out the competition down the street. The girls are fine, it's the manager, I bought a package, and I have never felt  more uncomfortable in my life.  The manager was all about getting you in the chair and out.  This is literally what happened, I was sitting in the chair getting my hair done, she was behind me ticked off as ever, as I sat in the chair, upset that my hair was taking longer.  I saw her in the mirror having a fit, literally...I will not go back, funny thing, I called to complain to the owner and I got her on the phone.....I haven't used the entire package, don't want to go back that's how bad it was.   I'm going to another salon, I'm now going to their competition, down off of Frank Floyd Wright.., awesome customer service, warm friendly.  Too bad that a package purchase means nothing to this place....I feel sorry for the girls working there, that they have to put up with this women, I don't know how they can relax and do there job with someone managing like this....Funny before entering the door I was telling my husband that I wanted a gift certificate for my birthday, upon walking out I was almost in tears, swearing to never go back...."
1,"I wouldn't even give the Bell Road Mazda Service Dep't ONE star, except thats the only choice I have. I thought I was in good hands, because my mom had been working with Pete since he was at Hyundai when she owned a vehicle with them, and now serviced her Mazda at this dealership where he worked. Well, I took the vehicle in for the oil change in September, to be told the motor mount is cracked BUT covered under warranty. They did not have the part in at that time, but Pete assured me it was covered under warranty and to let him know when I have the time to bring the car back in. No big deal, until I drive away and realize the tech BROKE the Left/Right toggle switch to adjust the side mirrors, and shoved the driver side vent adjuster clean into the dash somehow. I called Pete right away and came back. He peeked his head inside the car and I showed him the issues, and he felt the mirror switch was broken, then manually adjusted the passenger mirror for me so I could drive safely. I did not have another hour & 1/2 to wait for them to fix this, so Pete assured me they would take care of it at my next visit. Here it is December, I have a little time to bring it in, and Pete no longer works there. I explained in detail to John Friedman what happened, thinking the issue would be easily resolved as Pete said. John reached out to Pete, who remembers my mom, remembers me, my last visit with the car, but conveniently DOES NOT remember the switch being broken, the vent adjuster, OR manually adjusting my mirror for me, and did NOT note my account regarding the part # of the cracked motor mount OR TAT IT WAS CRACKED! So basically, I am being called a liar about their tech breaking the switch, AND the motor mount can't be called in until they have the car there, to see which part it is. So there's a good chance I will have to sit there only to be told they don't have the part. And now, I will have to pay for the part their tech broke and who knows about the warranty covering the motor mount since the mileage is drastically different by thousands. THUMBS DOWN. Do NOT expect to be taken care of if they do something wrong. As adults, most of us learn to take responsibility for what we do wrong, and to do a good job at whatever we do-like noting someone's account properly... but not The Chapman Mazda Service Dep't. Now I will be taking my vehicle to the Camelback location from now until I sell the Mazda and wash my hands with the company. Wish me luck... The is why I drive a Volkswagen-they know how to take care of their customers."
1,"Food tasted good. But my stomach got extremely sick after eating from here, TWICE. Had to see a doctor and take a day off work. 

Definitely never coming back."
1,"After recieving a dirty coffee cup , the owner/ manager gave me defense attitude.....like it was my fault.when my food dropped there was a long and big piece of hair in my Dutch baby.........again they asked if I want another( I'm thinking No I like foreign hair in my food)..........at the end my family finished before I even had my food and I would assume they would want to at the very least pay for my horrible breakfast.......The Answer was No! And we don't care if your a decent customer who comes in a lot.......we don't care if you come back.............to the owner or person who called themselves an owner......you suck as a restaraunteur"
1,"There are few times I have been so rarely disappointed in a restaurant.


The Manti was poorly executed. At a $17 price point it needs to be perfect. 
Thick dough, scarcely a wisp of ground lamb, topped with a watery, limp yogurt sauce that was deficient in spice and aromatics. 
The previous incarnation's (Anatalion Turkish Cuisine's) was much, much better.

The bread they brought out at the start had been made the day before. Perhaps even leftovers from the day before, that were hastily microwaved, and glazed with olive oil to give the appearance of fresh baked. Though it was far from fresh. 

The grilled meat platter was suspect. A small ramekin of rice was served. Plain white, Uncle Ben's rice mind you, and a second ramekin cost me $5. 
Literally a dollop of boiled white rice with a sprinkle of parsley for $5. 
That is tantamount to highway robbery in this particular restaurant Plaza.  
I felt violated. Almost to the point of calling 911 and saying I've just been robbed.

Lastly. $1.50 for Turkish tea is insulting. This is the only place I know who charges for it.

The ambience and layout is nice. It's a beautiful place. 
But it's only a matter of time until Pasha dies and goes to Restaurant Heaven.
The Downtown prices do not fit the East York Thornecliffe location. 
The service and product should befit the price, this is

If you're craving Turkish. Head elsewhere. Shirin, Pizza Pide, Mr Pide and Kebab 49 are all much, much better."
1,"I don't know how the elite members can give this place higher than a two star....

The neighborhood and the parking was shady and lacking.  The interior was very bland- no decor and no Korean tv shows.   Or no decoration.  

I was going to put all these aside if they food can overcome these shortcoming.  

We ordered LA kalbi, I asked if it was enough for myself and my college age son, since the price was high $26.  He guy said yes, depending how hungry we were.  When it came out, there was so much bone and so little meat that I scoffed, and needed to order more.  There was only four side dishes: not fresh kimchee, kong-na-mul, motion-kimchee, and a fourth that we cannot remember.  They were below average, and not very good nor fresh.  

So I ordered Kim cheegigae - that was disappointing too, not very plentiful and the pork pieces had the bone knuckles.  

We are visiting from LA or the San Diego area, so my level of expectation is from there.  I guess I can't recommend any place in Pittsburgh for a great sit down Korean style dinner place yet.  

The only other place that had high reviews was closed for the holidays."
1,"I would like to give this place at least one star, but I can't.  I made an appointment with Healing Waters several months ago because a friend recommended them to me.  They called me the day before the appointment to confirm and told me that they were looking forward to meeting me.  The next day, four hours before the appointment, they called me to cancel.  The girl that called sounded very rushed and wasn't very clear as to why she was canceling.  It sounded to me like she was saying that there was somebody that needed the appointment more than me.  She told me that she would call me back ""AS SOON AS SHE GOT INTO THE OFFICE"".  To this day, I have never heard back from them.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!  Do not give them your business!  Do not use Healing Waters!  There are plenty of other companies out there that actually WANT customers!  And are appreciative that they get business!

P.S.  I think that these positive reviews were written by employees or owners that are trying to keep their business afloat!"
1,"I went in with my friend and was a bit hesitant because I didn't know what to expect...we were greeted and offered water (it was a bit funny though, when my girlfriend made the appointment she spelled out her name, and when we got there they still had it wrong).  So they took her back and I waited a couple of minutes for my stylist.

OK - I had a good experience...but the overall tone of this place is just not good!  All the responses from our reviews have been negative.

However, my friend had the exact opposite expereince.  She wasn't offered wine and her stylist didn't flat iron her hair in small pieces like she had asked.  

Of course I felt bad because this was my friend's idea and I went along and had a great time...wish there was a way to make it a great experience for all!

PS - I revised my review and the owner had it removed.  This place is LIMP and FLAT!  Please don't waste your money here...go where you are appreciated!  I gave the a ONE star b/c the owner's attitude toward my friend was RUDE!  I can't believe in the economy that people would even take that approach."
1,"My friends and I visited Kost twice during our stay here in Toronto. The night view was nice but the service was terrible.

The second time we visited the waiter forgot the details of our orders. We asked for no olives in the Ahi Salad and  Mayo on the side for the one of the BLT sandwiches. We waited for 40 min for the food to come, and it came with a lot of olives in the salad, no mayo at all, and no bacon in the Kost Burger. The side we ordered was brought to us after we finished the meal...... and most shocking thing was we saw one of the bartender tasted the drink with stirring spoon and stirred the drink with the same spoon....like is this the really best quality for hotel rooftop restaurant ? Probably not."
1,I'm sad that this restaurant is closed...
1,"Limited selection, poor sashimi and sushi quality."
1,"The old Trump tower is reborn with an amazing location beautiful world class views. The only issue is the staff and value doesn't compliment the establishment. From the moment we walked in...it was about 40% full. No big deal...maybe just the time. Sat down they brought us a menu we asked about the bar items you know your basic $19 salad? (  ^ ^ ) seems the staff made a mistake, got us another menu... no big deal. So after studying the second menu for 15 min we asked about 2 top two items. "" Oh sorry we are out of those items"" Being a limited short menu we decided to opt out of eating and just have a glass of sangria as we noticed a nice pitcher of it behind the bar. As our server was filling our order she took wine glass and filled with ice to the point it was so full at first we thought maybe she is just chilling the glass. You know when someone makes a martini they pack the glass to the point where the ice is almost spilling over. In our case the glass was completely full exactly to the top. Next thing we know our bartender is filling it with Sangria!?!? Hey would you please take 1/2 the ice out of the glass please? ""Sure no problem she remarked but this is how we measure our pour she remarked"" We are talking about Sangria here...wine soda and fruit/juice right? In posting this review we noticed others complaining about portion size. Needless to say we left and opted out of the Sangria. Probably a blessing in disguise as if this place is hurting that much that they cannot afford to pour .93 cents of Sangria into a proper wine glass portion we can just imagine the food. There's simple no need for this today, we're not expecting trucker proportion but simple some basic value. We left annoyed and it was more then evident that this is another one of those over staffed pretend busy restaurants that think their doing you a favour for allowing you to eat there. Much to be learned here. Chapter 22x2=44th floor of Kost. Not impressed and definitely would never go back."
1,To the Polly d look alike fuck you the best way to not get a tip is to make sure to make your customer wait for 30 min for drinks.
1,"Extremely bad place! I won't come here the second time ever! 
The service is bad,the price is too high and the food is not worthy!
We waited for almost one hour for the first dish and have to breath the smoke all around the room. We ordered the first two BBQ on the menu but when they came out apparently not ""BBQ"" at all and each dish is around $30! Barely imagine!"
1,"This is my favorite Starbucks so it is a shame that I have to come here, and give a one star. I have never been disrespected as I was today. Ta'Helia was kind enough to write her name for me as she told me to try her whatever that is supposed to mean. I have no idea how this poor excuse of a girl got a job in customer service, but she does not belong there. She got mad because I asked what other sandwiched they had since the two that I usually order were out, then she threw the bag at me, then she got mad because I waited for my receipt. Told me to come earlier if I wanted to get the sandwiches that I had ordered. Told me to go f myself when I told her to calm down and just give me my receipt so I could leave. Had to ask her five times because she didn't want to. I really don't know what her problem was, but this whole thing was ridiculous."
1,"I wish I had read the reviews. I wanted to try and blow dry salon for sometime now, even though I am a loyal customer to a stylist in Chandler. (A very good stylist) Primp and Blow staff was rude, I was barely offered water, stylist seemed annoyed and avoided having to talk to me at all. Almost got whiplash from the shampoo. All this might have been forgivable had my hair been styled good. Not the case: I looked like a pasty new jersey girl. It was so knotted, back combed and frizzed out, I had to go home and wash it in hopes of saving my hair cuticles or what was left of them. Not only did I feel stupid paying for this disaster, I felt extra ridiculous walking by Scottsdale's finest on Saturday afternoon, on the way back to my car. I even avoided going grocery shopping that afternoon (and I love to cook) because I was so embarrassed.  

Now it has been a few days and I have hair that is breaking where it was never breaking before, I had to go to my stylist and have her cut it and deep condition it!!! I hate to call someone out but I would not want this to happen to anyone else, if you chance it and go here make sure you ask for someone other than Katie."
1,"Awful business! After a once over of my dog they said she might have parvo. They vet & tech left came back then took my pup out of office to be weighed. If she was a possible parvo she shouldn't have aloud to possibly come in contact with dogs?  Then they leave again. Vet tech comes back by herself with $600 bill. $300 was for medications. When I asked what was wrong they said could be this....could be that.... we'll try all theses meds & see if she gets better. They wanted to try 6 drugs to help?? But weren't sure what was wrong. $100 for dog benedryl?  Its was so sad they wanted to give her antihistamine, ant acids, anti vomit, anti diarial, & antibiotics, she would have an immune system shut down! They wouldn't talk about natural helpers or never asked what  we feed her? It was all push dtugs get $! Very dishonest & greedy. My dogs not an experiment? Don't go here! Research what drugs they want to give you & why before agreeing to pay $75 for tums!"
1,"I just ordered their gyro and hummus with pita. The quality was terrible. The tzatziki had spoiled and had a terribly acrid unpleasant taste. The hummus was lumpy and didn't taste like much of anything. The gyro meat was more greasy than I've experienced at a Greek Restaurant before, and the tomatoes were pale and mealy. They need some serious quality control. I called to let them know their tzatziki was rancid so hopefully no one gets sick."
1,"I thought I'd update the review. I ended up getting in contact with the gentleman who responded and was offered one free oil change. I thought that was funny and I thought it might be to anyone reading this too. An oil change is about $30-$50, a limited slip differential is probably about $500+ with parts and labor.

Oh well. They got their sale, which is clearly all they cared about."
1,"This place needs to be shut down. The Hummus taste like a bowl of soup, watered down with no flavor. The shawama taste like my Aunt Betty made it & shes from Nigeria. It was on a super small pita. The best thing was the fries & the Snapple. The place was unclean, it looked like somebody got tired of the tziatki sauce & threw it on the wall. Dont do it...who ever gave this place 5 stars are missing taste buds."
1,"Absolutely DISGUSTING!!!!! I got the super crunch roll...I took  two bites and threw the rest away...so glad I used a gift card...The place stinks and the service sucks .   Run for the hills, NEVER EAT HERE if you like quality food!"
1,Deceptive menu and the bulgogi is a ripoff!!! This was my first and only time eating here. I ordered the bulgogi which I thought was $13.95. When I got the bill it was $27.95. Turns out they have two different bulgogi dishes on their menu. I complained to the cashier but he had an attitude and didn't seem to care. The food was ok but definitely not worth $27.95. I won't be returning.
1,"Terrible customer service, Rude staff, over charging, mixing orders, 
Every time I order Bolani they don't have it, so why have it in the menu?
Naans are usually dry and stale and reheated the next day, 
No fixed time to open, last time we waited 10 minutes outside after 12 noon, Hours of business are not posted on front door.
I will not go back.
BTW, the above review is for their Scarborough location."
1,"We were the only people in the store when we ordered our food, then they told us their system was down. They said that they were going to call us when the food was ready and we could pay then. We waited for 20 min noticing other people were coming and leaving with their food. I approached the person who put our order through and she told me our order did not go through because we did not pay. I repeated what she had told me when we first ordered. She said ""I know I'm sorry"" they should have approached us and told us that our food order did not go through while we were the only people in the store not after 4 orders came and gone. Extremely unimpressed with the professionalism and service here."
1,"Terrible Customer service at Chapman Hyundai ( all the same owner) they dont get back to you for follow up, when you leave messages or even to sell a car."
1,"I stood in the entrance way for six minutes and not one employee came over.  Finally someone came over and asked if I wanted to be seated I said yes and was promptly seated at smallest table next to kitchen entrance.   I pointed to a different table and the man hrumphed as he walked me over.  I turned around and stated sorry I bothered you, I'm going to Denny's and I left."
1,If I can give 0 I would have. 60 bucks for a few pieces of beef. 43 for seafood tofu soup which has 1 piece of shrimp: EXTREMELY OVERPRICED.
1,"6:15 in the drivethru ordered two hot chocolates and waited over 10 minutes to get to the window and the guy working the window tells me I don't have an order for you with an attitude.   
I don't just get into a Starbucks line to sit and wait order ten minutes because I have nothing better to do with my time 
Kindly I replied I did order two hot chocolates but if you can't locate the order you have it now.   
This location needs better organization"
1,"Unfortunately we will no longer be going to the Pancake House. This morning we went for breakfast. My husband wanted to order a few things a la Carte as they didn't have exactly what he wanted. Our section was about half full and it was not super busy. The waitress charged us for 3 meals rather than 1 meal and the a la Carte items. We pointed out the math to her and she said she'd be right back. She never came back. She waited on other tables and ignored us. 20 minutes later when she came back she handed us a new check. Or what we thought was a corrected check. 

When we got to the register, it was the exactly same check (after she told us she would adjust it). At the register we asked to speak to the manager and we waited for another 20 minutes but no manager appeared. We had spent enough time waiting at the Pancake House.  We were tired of waiting and ended up paying and leaving. At that point, we just wanted to go home. Customer service seems like a very low priority. We were really disappointed with this experience."
1,"Closed on a Sunday evening. Instant single star, never returning."
1,"The rifle range is open only 75 minutes a week and only for the specific type of training that the Old Boy's Club wants to train for that week.  For the other 10,005 hours a week, it is off limits.

This is public land, meaning government land for use by the public.  But only one group is allowed to use it, and they don't use it, let alone allow you to.

When something is run or owned by the government, just remember, it's only for show and tell.  Enjoy my tax dollars, you crooks."
1,"This has been and continues to be the WORST choice of car companies and financing companies I have EVER heard of.  I'm going to keep this short and somewhat rant free because if I don't I'll be writing a novel instead of a review.

First issue:  The worlds most condescending finance manager.  I have never, in all my years, been spoken to with such utter disrespect.  I barely said a word throughout the process and yet I was spoken to as though I couldn't even get the name portion correct on an IQ test.  They acted as though I could not comprehend simple words and phrases despite my prompt and polite responses.  By the time I was done with this prick (overweight, 50's, mustache, shit eating grin) I came close to just tearing up the contract and punching him in the face.  Why on god's green earth you'd want to treat a paying customer like that I have no idea, and I really don't care - there is NO excuse for it.  I cannot believe this person hasn't been fired yet, as I assume he speaks to other customers in this same manner, not to mention subordinates, colleagues, co-workers, etc.  If you're upper management and you're reading this, don't take my word for it, listen in on the next few people who come in and see the kind of customer service your customers are getting.

Second issue:  Everything about the process was dishonest, from the sham ""High Tech"" warranty that covers exactly nothing, to the internet discount, the fees, the quality and stability of the car (I've had to take it in to an actually REPUTABLE auto shop 3 times for various issues), to the finance company that puts so many road blocks in your way for issues you have that you will NEVER get your issues resolved.  EVER.

Bottom line - NEVER purchase or finance a car from these people, they will absolutely screw you over and will not even attempt to fix it.  These people need to be investigated for FRAUD."
1,"My mother, bridesmaids and I had our hair done here. 
The owner is the most unpleasant woman I've ever met. Just rude, short and scowling.
My hair stayed all night, but I have thick curly hair.
My mother and bridesmaids on the other hand have thin hair and fell before the wedding ever started and they charged $10 extra dollars to use the hot tools they recommend since their hair was so straight. 
Never going back"
1,"OK ... Did we just go to a totally different restaurant? This places was by far one of my worse experiences on Japanese ""cuisine"".
The sushi was OK, nothing out of the ordinary definitely not something that will bring me back to this place, the hibachi lunch was horrible, my chicken and veggies were swimming on oil, so was my husbands steak and shrimp and the ""fried rice"" was not fried rice at all it looked like rice cooked on beef broth for some color, needles to say I am suffering from the worse heartburn case I had in a few weeks.
 The service?..... we were rushed from the moment we walked in, so much so that we got our check before we got our lunch, right after our sushi roll, it took a while for the waitress to notice that we were still sitting and when she came to check she figured that we were still waiting for the food. She did apologize many times, but by then I was wishing I had canceled the order instead of receiving the hibachi.
I would not go back :( sorry. 
PS... I did like that wooden door, that was a nice touch."
1,That was the worst experience I've ever had in my life. This girl sucked at hair and sucked even worse at makeup. I didn't even let her finish the makeup. The whole thing was worse than horrible. Never ever going there again.
1,"Any dish with beef here is pretty bad. Literally too tough to chew. 

Curry is mediocre at very best. 

Definitely wouldn't recommend any of the drinks - everything tastes super watered down. 

Apparently the service here is infamous (downright rude), and I wouldn't disagree - it really is awful. 

Can't think of any reasons for me to suggest that anyone come to Green Lemon Grass, but I can come up with a whole bunch to avoid it!"
1,"It was absolutely awful. 

Drink: Kost Sangria
Watered down. No taste. There was one orange slice, 2 thin strawberry slices, and 2 raspberries.  I wouldn't call this a sangria.  I would call this sprite with some fruit slices.

Appetizer: Tune Ceviche
It seems that the waiter forgot to tell me that there was a late delivery for the tuna and they didnt have this item ready when I ordered it.  Everyone else's appetizer came, save mine...and THEN i was told that it will be a few minutes. 30 minutes later the waiter comes back to say I owe everyone at the table a bite of my ceviche because they all shared their apps with me while i was waiting. When I made it clear that his joke was not funny, he told me it will be another few minutes. 5 minutes later, it finally came...when everyone else's plates had already been cleared; I should have been prepared that the portion size would be disappointing.  It was served with 6 nachos (toasted to the point of stale); I didnt need all 6 nachos.

Skewer: Short Ribs skewer, half portion
It was meat on a stick. nothing special.

Experience:
I will not be coming back. There were 2 wait staff that kept telling our group that they needed the table back at 9 p.m.....it was 7 p.m. Not to mention that the restaurant was half empty...even less than that.  It was incredibly expensive for the portions, mediocre presentation, even less so with taste, and downright appalling service.  I strongly DO NOT recommend this restaurant at this point.  I hope that they improve their service and food quality because at its current state, you're better off going to Canoe--same view, better service, better food."
1,"Wow...after thinking about buying a car from Chapman I was surprised to find that the sales and service were very poor. I am a younger gal and maybe they profiled me as one who has poor credit or doesn't know what she's doing, but that's not the case. I went in with a hefty down payment and a credit score at 779...they first tried to get me at a 9% interest rate and had my payments at almost $250 a month! Well, after declining the offer and leaving a message on the sales manager's phone early afternoon I had a phone call from the sales manager at 9:30pm acting like he never got my message. Then I had another text message at 11:30pm at night...it gets better...wait. The message states that they could get my payment down to almost $160! Wow! 
My problem...why was my time wasted and why would they want to jack me around like this? I felt this experience was one of the poorest I have ever had with buying a vehicle. To top it all off, I put a $500 deposit to hold the car while I slept on it and a week later, the credit still hasn't been filed. Very, very disappointed with the experience and I would never advise to buy from this dealership. What did I end up doing? Buying a Toyota Highlander from Audi of Scottsdale. They are top-notch and right off the bat were able to do exactly what I wanted in 45 minutes. Moral of the story go with your gut and go to Audi of Scottsdale."
1,"I'm extremely allergic to milk. All i wanted was a simple cup of chai tea to wake me up, made with soy. Nope. Didn't get it right and used milk. On my way to get some medication for the hives that are covering my entire body. I feel like im standing on an ant hill. Thanks Starbucks. Ill keep my $5  and spend it on some benadryl.  Dont go here if you have allergies. They dont care enough to follow directions."
1,"Overly priced bad service and bad food!
1. $5-6 for a beer. They gave me a wet room temperature water glass, a bottle of beer(unopened!) and a bottle opener. 
2. Ordered 2 meat. It(raw) came out brownish looking, not fresh. They unroll and cut up the meat. But took the bone(with meat still on it) away. We did paid for that, didn't we?
3. Next table was using a sauce bottle. Waiter ask for it back. Because the kitchen needed it. 
4. We finished a bow of sauce for the BBQ. We ask the waiter for more. He took our empty bow to the kitchen and return with the same bow just with more sauce in it. Use a clean bow would be a standard procedure.
5. Waiter collected all the soy sauce bottles and refilling it at the corner table and forgot all customers(5-6 table). 
6. Multiple people come to our table to cook the BBQ. How can that be cooked correctly?
7. It lack of ventilation. No over head big vent hood like all other BBQ places does. Walk in it is more like an nigh club then a restaurant. 
8. Ordered a sea food soup pot($43.00!!). You don't even get a whole crab, just half. And all sea food in it were frozen. 
9. Group of 4(three weren't big eater). Ordered 1 sea food soup pot, 2 meats, 1 appetizer and 4 beers. Final bill - $150.00. (Wow! Really?!?)
10. One of us ask for hot tea. Waiter replay: We don't have tea.  This is the 1st(and hope last) time a Asian restaurant I been to where it doesn't have tea. 

If you have no taste buds and have extra money that you don't care. By all means, go and eat. You be the judge!"
1,"My boyfriend and I were staying in the hotel/residence of bisha. We booked this specific place for the view & pool on the 44th floor. After flying for 6 hours we get excited to see what we paid for ! When we get to the 44th we're greeted by 2 doorman? security? and they were so kind. the staff member working at the hostess stand asked us if we had a reservation, we said no, but that we just wanted to take a peek around and maybe look at the menu. He seemed to think it was weird but allowed us to look. We decided that we were going to stick around and have a drink (it was a beautiful evening and there was plenty of empty tables) We were told that they were accepting walk in but that we could take a seat at the bar. When we were standing there making small talk with the security staff a group of 4 women walk in, go up to the hostess stand & they're asked if they have a reservation. they said no, then the man at the stand said it was fine and sat the women at a table. I couldn't believe it. When we sat at the bar my boyfriend said it because we weren't dressed nice enough. he was in a tank and nice shorts and sneakers and I was wearing a denim dress with nice sandals. My boyfriend also has 2/3 of his one arm covered in tasteful tattoos, he said that could also be it. I understand that if there's a dress code, we would of course follow it! but to say nothing to us and seat other people ? Unreal. While we were leaving we were talking again with the security and just told us to make a reservation. A different staff member cut him off and told us that we had to make reservations through opentable. A group of people were walking out of the elevator and they went up to the stand and said they didn't have reservations, they again, were sat at a table. After reading other reviews I understand how pretentious and judgemental they are. So instead, we went back to our room, dressed up nicely and went out for dinner at a small mexican close by instead. Honestly so disappointed in the staff here. We will never go back."
1,"DO NOT GO HERE!  I booked here because the Dry Bar at Scottsdale Quarter was completely booked.  There were so many appointments at this place, and now I know why.  This was my FIRST experience getting my hair blown out.  I am a teacher with HARDLY ANY MONEY, but wanted to spend a little extra on myself for my husband's Christmas party.  I wanted to NOT worry about doing it on my own.   I had booked the appointment for a blow out and hot tools (I wanted curls).  The arrival was fine and seemed normal.  When I went to get my hair blown out I described to the girl that I was going to a fancy Christmas party and wanted my hair to look elegant.  She spun the chair away from the mirror for the entire appointment, so I never got to see what she was doing (issue #1).  She was curling my hair during the blow dry part, which was fine, if she knew what she was doing.  Then she spun back around, and said ""okay, you're all finished.""  My hair did NOT look finished.  It looked ratty and NOT elegant for a nice Christmas party.  I said, it didn't look finished and that many parts looked like they needed to be combed.  I kept pointing out areas & also reminded her I had scheduled the appointment for hot tools as well and maybe she should finish the curls with the hot tool.  She did not even know I had booked the appointment with hot tools (bad communication with front desk and hair person- issue #2).  She kept asking how the curls looked (issues #3).... well, they looked fine, but the part & rattiness of my hair looked like I had already been out partying on scottsdale rd., possible WALK OF SHAME, hairstyle.  I question this stylists taste level & hated that I had to pick apart the hair-do, so I didn't leave in tears.  I waited until the car to cry about my hair because now I had wasted two hours of my life, was going to be running late for the Christmas party, & spent $$$ on my hair that I WENT HOME AND WASHED OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Also, at home was the only place I was able to actually see my hair, because she never even gave me a mirror to check out the back of my hair (issue #4).  She was hiding the job she did and made me feel awkward, sitting in a chair, pointing out places to fix.  She wanted to get the job done and did not care AT ALL about the actual hairstyle.  

ISSUE #5--Worst part is, I completed their survey online that they send to clients, explaining how unhappy I was with the service I received. NO ONE EVER CONTACTED ME ABOUT MY UNHAPPY TRIP... which led me to fill out this awful review on Yelp.  Bad management, bad customer service, and bad employees is a recipe for disaster.  ALL THESE REASONS are the reason why this place will eventually go out of business.  What's the point of sending out surveys if you don't actually do anything about it.  Must be nice to get paid extra to be a boss, manager, etc. but never have to actually do anything extra except order some supplies and schedule employees.  Customer service should be a big priority.  After checking out yelp, it seems as though no one from this company even looks at what customers are saying because there are A LOT of unhappy people out there & obviously the problems have no been fixed.  Eventually, Primp & Blow will have to stop blaming customers for being picky and start looking at themselves, but by the time they do that, it may be too late.  

THANKS A LOT PRIMP & BLOW for taking my hard earned money and washing it down the hair washing staion drain.  Bottomline- BOOK AN APPOINTMENT WAY IN ADVANCE FOR THE BLOW DRY BAR AT SCOTTSDALE QUARTER & don't waste your time with a business who does not appreciate their customers or their employees (if the employees were happier, they would probably do a better job & care)."
1,45 minutes for food at lunch hour is not acceptable....the service is much better at Bamiyan
1,"Don't fall for their $20 unlimited sushi/hibachi trap. There was a fruit fly in one of our sushi rolls and the manager/chef got mad at us for that. They made a big deal about remaking another roll. In fact, the remake was a different roll. Furthermore, the fried rice and sautéed veggies are mediocre. Too oily! The shrimp sauce is off balance ... way too much mayo. That was definitely my first and last time."
1,Service and food quality has declined drastically. Third time our order has been messed up and or food has been poor quality. Will never order from there again
1,I refuse to eat here.Ive tried it twice. once when it opened. And once few days ago. And I got sick both times.The fish is not fresh. and they dont even try to keep it coold. I dont recommend this place at all. Very dissapointing because this place would be really convenient for when i'm craving sushi. I'll keep driving to Neko at south Blv.
1,"Over charging, over prescribing. I have 50 Tramadol pills I can't use. My former vet asked me what meds I had at home before giving me more, and only gave me as many as I would need, not 20 or 30 tablets to recover from a single procedure and then a new prescription every time I come in.  They told me on one visit that they couldn't prescribe Rimadyl because my dog has liver issues, and then a different vet went ahead and prescribed Rimadyl on the next visit. Sometimes a pill is labelled ""rmuscle relaxer"" and sometimes the same medication is labelled ""pain relief.""  Its always a different vet, no consistency. My dog broke her leg, and in addition to charging me $55 every two weeks for a licensed vet to unwrap and re-wrap her bandage for three months until the cast comes off, they wanted to charge me extra for trimming her toenails that were growing out the bottom of the cast and causing her pain. The last time I told them the cast was chafing so they added so much padding that now she can hardly walk with one leg that is longer than the others. I gave them a chance, spent thousands of dollars there for care of two chickens, one axolotl, two dogs and a cat.  I'm going back to my former vet.  I'm not even going to let these people take the cast off my dog's broken leg. No trust left."
1,"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE:This was my favourite restaurant. From past couple of experiences I have observed the service are way below average. Today I really had worse experience I don't think I will ever want to go again. The rates which are displayed are not the same what they billed. The staff who take the order will not bother about the customer service anymore. since they are huge lineups for the food they don't  need to be attentive. Today I have ordered 2 dishes 1 dish for dine in and 1 for take out and the clerk made both take out. When I asked her to make 1 dine in, just gave the parcel boxes in a tray. There were no spoons or knives to eat. They made me to wait for a while to get the cutlery. By the time I started eating the food was already very cold. I had similar kind of experience last time also. I don't think if the management is not talking care of this things soon they will lose loyal customers like me. They will not have line ups anymore."
1,"I have attempted to eat at Kost twice. I wouldn't give them any stars if i had the choice.

The first time i had a reservation for my birthday brunch on a Sunday at 1pm for 14 people. My husband called at 830 am that day to cancel the reservation as the city of Toronto was experiencing an ice storm and was on an extreme storm watch and was told not to leave your house. The manager told us she was going to charge our credit card 25$ per person for cancelling less the  24 hours, even though mother nature was not on our side and it was not safe to be on the roads. While i understand the cancellation policy they should have been understanding of the unsafe weather conditions that were out of our hands.

Today my family and I decided to make a last minute reservation and have lunch at Kost. 

We arrived and were seated. Two of us used the restroom and in the mean time we were told they wouldnt serve us until all guests were seated. Once we were all at the table a good 15 minutes passed without anybody greeting us at our table. We asked a waitress if we could get served and she rudely told us she was not serving our table. She came back 5 minutes reiterating that she was not our server but will do us a favour and punch in our food, but we didn't need any favours and decided to leave. As we were on our way out we spoke to the manager, who was chewing food with her mouth full as she tried to apologize for the lack of service. She also mentioned that she had just started...are you working or not?  Behind her were at least 6 other servers also eating enjoying their meals while we were not. Does Kost or Bisha not provide breaks or areas to eat for their staff?

Neither of these experiences would ever make me come back or recommend to a friend.

If you want to eat some good food, with great service and a cool atmosphere go to La Carnita on John street."
1,"Extremely disappointed.  The desk staff wasn't friendly, didn't greet me when walking in and then I had to ask for a beverage (not offered).  The person doing my hair complained about life, the business, people of Arizona and most importantly failed to mention the $10 up-charge for using a curling iron.  Was really looking forward to something relaxing, representative of the advertising and it felt like a waste of time and money.

Since my appointment on April 16th (using a Groupon which was marked used on the 17th) this all might have changed but for the time I was there for my service this was an accurate description of my experience."
1,"This was my first time trying out this place considering it was super busy the last time I tried coming here.  Unfortunately, this will be my first and LAST time here.  Here's why you should avoid this place:
1. Take-out charge (50 cents)- although this is not much, I've never heard of a place that charges something that is part of their business expense!  No other restaurant charges this type of fee for something customers can't finish.

2. Does not accept credit card- only debit cards and cash.  However,  as I was going to pay with debit the machine wants to charge me a surcharge for using debit???!!!!  It's bad enough that they don't take credit cards and don't even tell customers in advanced but to charge customers for using debit card as well??  Here is another example of a business who indirectly just wants cash.  Probably reports only a portion of their earnings to CRA.  Honestly, I have never been to ANY restaurants that have this type of money-grabbing business practice as a way to boost their revenue.

3. Food- good but nothing to die for especially when they charge prices that are more than other places I've been to.  I ordered to Roti Curry, Curry chicken and Chicken Vermicelli.  Vermicelli isn't really authentic.  They used the 'Gui Lin' noodles instead of the true rice noodle (mei-fun) that most other places use and the chicken portion is very small. 

4. Service- average.  It is a typical Chinese business who thinks that just because they are getting business they can treat their customers badly.

Annoyed at all the above I gave them a $1 tip to show my disdain for this place the the lady has the nerve to tell me that I gave her too little and that she needs to survive on tips, etc.  I ended up giving her two bucks but am never coming back to this place again."
1,"Went in with some girl friends before a girls night out. No one seemed to know what they were doing, my friends stylists were friendly but the girl who did my hair never smiled and barely said 2 words to me. She kept burning my head with the blow dryer and did not seemed concerned with what I wanted but rather getting me out her chair as soon as she could. She never offered me a magazine, iPad or a drink as my other friends were given mimosas and were offered other things. We all ended up not liking our hair and re-doing it before going out and could persoanlly all do our own hair much better than they did! So glad we did not pay full price(luckily we had groupons) and we will never be back!"
1,"Our warehouse is very close to this place.
We order for 8 people from Kandahar kabab.
They gave us the breads from yesterday we couldn't even eat the breads with our kababs.
The money you pay is a lot and you can not even enjoy your food.
Come on!!"
1,Called to make an appointment for my friend and I. Lady at front desk was so extremely rude that I ended up canceling the ones I made. She knew I was a first time customer but apparently that meant nothing to her. Skimming other reviews this seems to be a common complaint so management really needs to do something about it. Due to her attitude were booking at another blow dry bar in the area.
1,"I was craving some Falafels and i decided to stop in. It was empty, which is never a good sign. But i went for it anyways. I ordered the Chicken Shwarma(for my daughter) and the Falafel platters with half rice and half salad.  My food came out pretty fast and the presentation was promising. I took my food to go and as soon as i got to the car i could not help but to dig in. Everything, i mean everything was super bland. The rice, the falafels, the hummus......#blandasfuck. The only thing that had any hint of flavor was the tzatziki sauce. I am super pissed i pay 24 dollars for some whack ass food.  I give this 2 thumbs down and some sea salt to season the food."
1,"Mixed up my dogs and gave the wrong dog the three year rabies booster shot twice within two months. They were all up to date on shots the last time they boarded a few months ago. They were given all the same shots again. This hospital only wants your money. I also have my dog scratch his neck after a bath. They wanted to do all sorts of tests. 200 plus dollars.  I feel extremely uneasy about going to this vet. I have been here since 1999. This mixup with the shots is completely ridiculous. I am finding a new vet. 
Edit:
I literally did some looking and they are give my dogs boosters for vaccines every time I board with four months in between."
1,"This particular location had a long wait and the girls working the drive thru were extremely rude. They seemed bothered to have customers. Then my husbands drink came out the wrong size and was made wrong. When he stopped to take it in to have it fixed they did not apologize and had an attitude about fixing it. I get they were busy, but you still need to show good customer service. I love my Starbucks and would not have cared about the wait as much if we didn't have to deal with teenage girl attitude."
1,"One word: MEH. This place is a huge disappointment. All of the other Kabuth restos I've eaten in have excellent service and food that matches the price. We didn't even try the tacos because - $35-45 for TACOS?!?! When Toronto has an amazing authentic taco scene? I don't know what they were thinking. 

Anyway. Onto the food and service. When we arrived for our 7:30 reservation there were maybe 4 other tables of people. I ordered a glass of wine -a very small pour, may I add, for $16. It took far too long for the wine to come and our menus were closed and ready to order. The server dropped the wine at the table and rushed on, not asking or giving us a chance to say we were ready to order. 10 min later We ordered and shared a bunch of appetizers. 

Roast mushrooms $12: meh. They were ok. Quite salty
Beet salad $16: small serving for price. Flavourful strawberries but the flavours lacked any depth so tasted flat when trying all elements of dish in a mouthful. 
Beef tartare $18: worst tartare I've ever had. It came with 5 stale tasting corn chips and the beef was flat all over the plate. No attempt at presentation. And the beef smelled...off...you know that smell when you open a wrapper of beef from the supermarket and it has that blood soaked pad under it? That pad is what the beef smelled like. I couldn't eat more than one serving because of the smell. 
Charcoal roasted shrimp $19: this was by far the best dish but with 2 fairly large and 1 much smaller shrimp to the total of 3 shrimp - zero value. 
Tuna ceviche $18: this was the next best dish and had a lot of brilliant flavour and I loved the sweet little bites of watermelon. However this also came with 5 stale corn chips. 

I would have returned the tartare to the kitchen if we had had any level of service checking in on us but we ate our meal with no one even asking if we were enjoying it. At that point I'd given up and was somewhat testing them. 

For the above meal with one measly under-poured glass of wine, we paid just over $130 including tip for two people. Even the view and decor could not draw me back when I could have much better taco/Mexican a 5-10 minute walk away that would include margaritas for under $100."
1,"First of all, I love blow dry bars. I have really long hair so to me it's such a relief when someone else can do my hair the way I want it. But this place really missed the mark. There were 4 of us going for our friend's birthday and we chose Primp and Blow (over the other blow dry bar in scottsdale) because they do makeup too and we wanted the complete package. On their web site, it tells you that a blow out and makeup takes an hour. Well this seemed a little strange to me because they tell you that just a blow dry takes 45 minutes. This doesn't leave a lot of give room if someone's hair is long, or they want hot tools such as a curling iron, etc (WHICH COST AN EXTRA $10!!!!! absurd). 

So I'll just list the downsides: the place was dirty, there was hair on the floor everywhere, the front desk lady was probably one of the rudest service people I've ever met, followed closely by the lady who did my hair and makeup (she rushed the whole thing and when I tried pleasant conversation, she gave me an extremely rude answer implying that I was late and was now going to push all her clients back. I was not late. It is not my problem that they only book 1 hour for hair and makeup); they only have 2 chairs for makeup so if more than 2 people are getting that done then we have to sit in a low circular couch thing meant as a waiting area; the blow dryers hanging from the ceiling are a nice touch except the one on the end wasn't staying up and kept hitting the client in the head; the surprise $10 for the hairdresser touching a curling iron (which she neglected to inform me about and just did it even when I said she could just curl my hair with a round brush and dryer); the makeup done was rushed and horrible, I had to keep asking her to add stuff because it seemed like she just wanted to finish and get me out of there. 

Needless to say I will NOT be back. There is a far better drybar place not far from this one that was so so so much better. I can go elsewhere for makeup."
1,"Osaka.... WOW what a joke of a restaurant! The food is mediocre for the price. Save your time, money & go somewhere that has a much better score, food & customer service!"
1,"By FAR, the WORST blowout I've ever had at the Hayden location in north Scottsdale. Stylist was RUDE, insulted my hair, huffed and puffed as she yanked at my hair. This was not my first bad blow out there but yesterday was AWFUL! I am a faithful visitor to DryBar, at least once a week, and will never stray again! Save your $45 (plus $10 for curling iron) and go to DRYBAR!"
1,"I went to Starbucks the other day and the lady that was taking our order was very rude and she had a lot of attitude. She was very sassy and had no patience for her customers. My grandma was trying to order a skinny cinnamon dolce latte with no added sugar and non fat milk. Instead of saying ""ok"", she basically yelled at us saying that that isn't possible and the sugar is the cinnamon dolce. We understood that, but we didn't want added stevia or anything else. Also and when I asked for a drink, that was on the menu, she said that they don't make that and that she didn't know what it was. It was clearly on the menu so I would assume they'd know what it was. Anyways, all and all, the customers service was horrible. Luckily the guy who made our drinks did them right and they tasted great. Sadly, they need to work ON HOW TO PROVIDE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE OR LEARN WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!"
1,"I purchased my Mazda 6 here and part of the package was oil changes at 9.99 or 39.99 synthetic for the lifetime, however they have never honored this, figured it would be part of my information so 1st oil change took it in advised of the lower price they looked at me like I had two heads and argued with me.  So I finally found proof that I was told this took it in they said sorry had a change of ownership and we don't honor that deal.  Never did they send information to their customers given this deal saying they are discontinuing.  I also ha be an issue with the paint on my bumper peeling and cracking the rest of the car still looks brand new they said it is do to being in a collision I have never had an accident but yet again no help.  I am planning on purchasing another car soon but will not buy or recommend them.  Save your self the trouble after purchase and buy somewhere else."
1,Hair in my food 2 x in a row! The owner felt obligated still charge us even though hair was in 2 x and I sat there for 45 minutes waiting while everyone else was done! Customer Service is a complete joke!!!!
1,"Decided to go to Prince sushi tonight (picked it over Heart Sushi and 168 Sushi) - biggest mistake ever! Prince Sushi gave my cousins and I the WORST all-you-can-eat experience ever! After placing our order, we waited an hour before getting food and that's not the worst part - they only brought us 20% of the items we ordered!! After speaking to the person in ""charge"" (the manager was MIA), and complaining that we had been waiting over an hour and still hadn't received even close to half of our order, the rest of our long awaited food magically started to come out but by then it was too late - we had lost our appetites. Told them to take the food back and to discount our bills since we didn't think it was fair to pay for an ""all-you-can-eat"" meal when we only ate edamame and avocado salad but as expected, they told us the only thing they could offer us was a 10% discount!!!! Didn't even cover the taxes!!!! Unbelievable!!!! Never going back there again!! Horrible service. Horrible quality. Horrible experience."
1,I and my girlfriend had a diner last time and we ordered a seafood hotpot. We noticed that the clams are all closed. We didn't eat the clam but still had stomachache that night. And there are only one sever and we always be waiting.. very bad experience
1,"First dangerous indicator is that most of these reviews are either one star or 5.  I am not saying the 5 stars are fake, but it makes me suspicious.

From my personal experience, do not trust these people.  They LIE!!!  OK.  Maybe I shouldn't be shocked that car dealers lie, but to have blatant boldfaced advertisement that is an undeniable lie shows how overtly shady Chapman Mazda is.  When I purchased my car there in 2011, I was given a $10 oil change for the life of the vehicle card.  By life of the vehicle they must have meant 2 years.  They discontinued the offer and their explanation was that they could change an offer anytime they want.  I understand changing an offer to new buyers, but changing it on people who purchased on a ""life of the vehicle"" offer is just being dishonest.  The service manager told me on the phone that they are offering an oil change at a price that nobody else is matching.....$30????  Wow!  I have never heard of an oil change for less than $31...another blatant boldfaced LIE.  These people are just so dishonest.  If they are willing to advertise so falsely, imaging what other lies they are willing to tell just to make a couple extra bucks."
1,"I don't recommend for avian visits.

My bird had a broken wing, and despite being fine for hours after the incident (despite a drooping wing), she passed within 2 hours of treatment at this clinic. Fractures are not typically a life threatening injury for a bird. Also suspicious, when we were discussing treatment for my bird he didn't mention anything about her being at risk for death. He kept pushing to amputate her wing, which isn't the standard treatment for a broken bone in birds. I declined and asked to have it bandaged. When he gave her back to me after bandaging her (and after I paid) he mentioned ""there's still a good chance she won't make it."" The doctor was rude and demeaning, and as far as I am concerned, my very loved bird would still be alive if I hadn't brought her to Dr Starks. He made me feel awful about the accident, as if wasn't already in tears. She suffered from the moment I handed her over to their tech (who was not gentle and wouldn't let me take her back to the room, so my bird freaked out and was biting her), until she passed. 

They may be fine for cats and dogs, but I suggest avoided them for avian visits. I regret my choice to bring her here."
1,"This place makes me sick. Tastes ok. 
Loads of MSGs. They also seem to only care about koreans."
1,"Anyone saying that this place has great Greek food, has never had real Greek cuisine before. The food lacks flavor and seasoning, there are no garnishes served with the dishes, and the food is vastly overpriced, especially taking the quality into consideration."
1,"Wow.  Just called in for takeout.   Their response:  ""we are too busy. Not taking call ins today. Sorry"".    How about you staff accordingly?   What a way to ruin Father's Day jackasses."
1,"I had a terrible experience here. The front desk girls were rude. My stylist was nice, but she kept burning my scalp. I told her multiple times that she was burning me. My blow-out was less than desirable. I have been to Dry Bar and left feeling like I looked like a million dollars, but I didn't feel like that with Primp & Blow. My hair was mostly flat, and it went completely flat after a couple of hours. I won't be back."
1,Why keep coffees listed on the brewing machine when you're not brewing them?  People wait in line expecting say Gold Coast for example. To find out you don't have it ready and it needs to be made!  And if you can make any flavor why not just put every flavor one up?  Oh because that's the sign that tells customers what's currently brewed....
1,"Wow.. never been to a slower Starbucks in my entire life!! No hustle whatsoever from 3 of the 4 employees working today.. if it weren't for Carlos who appeared to be the only one working, I wasn't sure if I'd ever get a coffee.

Grande Mocha tasted like warm milk ta boot... Did I mention the music is playing too damn loud.

Giving Starbucks a bad rap these people are.. won't be back."
1,"They have a rifle range that is only open 75 minutes per week.  Minutes, not hours.

I've been trying for weeks to shoot here, but it just isn't possible.  It's public land controlled by an old boy's club.  So it's a great range you have already paid for with your tax dollars that you will never get to use."
1,"I was maid of honor in a wedding...myself, mother  of the bride and the bride all got our hair done here. What a rip off!! Me and mother of the bride got blowouts with hot tools $60 and all of our curls fell out before we even made it down the aisle 2 hours later. The teased areas also went flat. Bride was the only one who's hair stayed mostly because it was a half updo. The people who work there are rude and not friendly at all. My hair and mother of the bride should get full refunds that is how terrible it was. I had to redo my curls and volume areas...poor mother of the bride didn't have time and had to go to the wedding with flat hair. Awful awful awful! Avoid this place and go to the drybar where they use good products and are much cheaper. My hair at drybar cost half of what this place charged and my hair stayed all night plus a pleasant experience. Do not waste your money here!"
1,"Under New Management! I've had my car since February 2012. I had been bringing it here because my contract included a lifetime oil change for $9.99. Awesome, right!! WRONG!!! Now that they've relocated & have undergone new management they no longer honor that $9.99 price. And to top it off, my wait time for an oil change was 1.5 hours. What a waste of time! I wouldn't recommend this Dealership to anyone!!!"
1,WORST! I repeat WORST experience ever! The customer service was ridiculous! Such a joke! We ordered off the all you can eat menu and didn't get the majority of the food we ordered!! We had to ask the server what was going on and she said the chef lost our order list!!! She then comes back with the list and apologizes... This was about 1.5 hours after we had placed the initial order. After such a wait we had no appetite...especially since the sushi itself was very low quality!! I've been to prince prior to this experience and didn't mind it. Be aware it has gone WAY DOWNHILL. Save your time and money and go to Heart sushi.. Much better food and customer service. By the way...after such a horrible experience...the manager which was not there and had to be called via phone only offered 10% off the bill.
1,"3 words for the Chapman Mazda Service Department:  BAIT AND SWITCH!
I purchased a brand new Mazda a few years back and have gotten all of my maintainces done by them.  With the purchase of my new CX-9, I got LIFETIME Oil Changes for $10!  What a great deal!  I know that by going to the dealership they will find new and ingenious ways to bring that cost up by finding things wrong with it.  I was fine with that.  

HOWEVER...when I went in on Saturday morning, they found no other things to fix.  Great.  I go to pay for it and it's $36+.  This is nearly 4 times the cost of my $10 LIFETIME Oil Change.  I was told by the service writer that they got rid of that plan and no longer honor it.  

Needless to say, I will no longer be going to the dealership to purchase anything or get my repairs done there.  Also, I will not be buying another Mazda because of this."
1,"35 minutes and counting for chicken breast and kofta and on top of that, my order was processed as completed and I had to go up and ask about my order. If it was a busy day I can understand. But it's not and this isn't acceptable. And after I asked where my order was they didn't even apologize for their screw up. Excellent service :/"
1,"We have given Osaka their last chance.  They have good sushi, most of the time.  They do however take liberties with the ingredients.  My wife hates cream cheese.  When we complained that cream cheese was not in the description of ingredients, they said the rolls are subject to chef discretion (actually the explanation was not that simple or precise, but that is what the server was trying to say).  We gave then a second chance. All was well for 2-3 other orders.  This last time was a to go order.  We tried the tempura seafood for the kids.  12 pieces of seafood was the menu description.  We had 16 pieces of fried broccoli, onions, carrots, zucchini, 2 pieces of shrimp, and 6 pieces of something else.  Also, it was not tempura.  It was breading like you would find in your local grocery frozen fish section.  I called back to complain. I was polite, really I was.  I asked them why I had all then fried vegetables when I ordered seafood.  I was told,""I just work here, I will ask my boss"". She came back and said, the order was correct.  If I was not happy, I should come back and they will give me more seafood.  I ask for them to credit me back the ""seafood"" tempura.  She said they would not do that.  I asked her if the ""shrimp""tempura came with fried broccoli as well?  She said""no it does not"". I then asked, "" why does the seafood tempura come with it then"". In the end, I took everything back to a very nice young lady who seems to completely understand my position, but she "" just worked there"".  Horrid customer service.  And it starts from the top.   Stay away."
1,"I was so excited to visit Green Lemon Grass; I've worked in the area for three years but had never ventured into the Richlane Mall to see what it had. After doing some looking on yelp, I was so hopeful that maybe I had found an awesome place to get my Vietnamese fix on my lunch break. Let me tell you, I was so disappointed.

Arriving at the restaurant, I was really excited about how good it might be. The restaurant was full, clean and modern looking. Big groups of people ate from family style dishes full of spring rolls, noodles and other delicious looking fare. I prefer to eat at my desk, so I placed an order with the pleasant hostess and wandered the mall for about 5 minutes. I came back in half the time they would said it would be and it was ready.

Arriving back at work, I immediately had some concerns as I started to take my meal out of the bag. It smelled...not great. And then when I opened the box, I once again had hope. I had ordered the grilled chicken, spring roll with vermicelli (in my experience Vermicelli normally means thin little noodles, and what I was served were big thick noodles, larger than spaghetti) and it looked pretty good.  The chicken was fatty, but no big deal. 

Starting to eat, the noodles were unappetizing and tasteless, regardless of how much fish sauce I drowned them in. The chicken was mostly fat and skin, and had been drenched in lemon pepper seasoning. Underneath the noodles were a few shreds of lettuce and cucumber (nothing else to add flavour like mint or cilantro). I struggled through a few bites and then was hoping to be redeemed by the spring roll. I mean, I've never even had a bad spring roll. But there is a first time for everything. It tasted like it had been in the freezer for a year, and then fried in dirty oil.  Second bite I actually spat out. And then threw out the entire container. 

Some people seem to love this place, but after this experience I will not be able to make myself go back and try something else. Really disappointed."
1,"First off I booked for a dry style and was told to come in with my hair dry and clean. I proceeded to tell the rude lady on the phone that my hair dries pretty curly and frizzy and if I should flat iron it before hand. She said no they will do it for u. Upon walking in to the salon no one greeted me and I was standing infront of 3 girls, 1 on the phone and 2 talking to eachother. Finally the lady asked my name and lead me to a chair where she proceeded to Ask me what kind of style I want. I showed her a picture and she turned the curling iron on. She curled my hair straight from it being frizzy and pufffy which is how my natural hair dries. I asked if I could change to just doing a blow out cause I do not want my curls to look terrible and she told me ""I don't have time for that today sorry"" there was no one in the salon and not one person walked in while I was getting my hair done. Overall you guys are rude snotty and inconsiderate it was my first and last time coming here maybe you should clarify what comes with a dry style to any of ur future clients"
1,"Ok so the range is nice the all the employees are nice and cool. EXCEPT THE OLD ASS BOLD GUY WHO WEARS GLASSES. He constantly stood behind my friends and I bugging us. We did not once disobey one range rule. But he kept telling us stuff due to the face that we are all tattooed up. Young kids. Grant it.. Served our country. Will not be returning after being treated like ""thugz"" by this stupid racis old man!!"
1,"Foodies beware!

Don't waste your time!

Bad customer service, poor quality of food and embarrassing lack of management. 

Should be called Sloppy Sushi because it's horrible. 

Read other reviews who all state the same. 

My friends and I ordered ""all you can eat"" and only got half the servings hours later... Waiter judged us because we ordered an extra salad, had to keep asking where our food was because other tables were getting priority over ours. 

Here's a tip for the owner: invest in management.

1,"I stopped by at this location 6:00pm on a Sunday. According to the website, it should be open until 10:30pm. There were workers in the store but the door was locked. However, one of the workers let someone in that doesn't work there and they were both extremely rude in telling me that they were closed. Super unprofessional. Not going back and encouraging others not to"
1,"This place is horrible.  I went in for a 930 appointment before my wedding dress try on. I wasn't looking to do my trial hair just something fun and I had explained this to the receptionist when we Made the appointment.  When we arrived (my mom was getting her hair done as well), they didn't have us down for up dos. I was disappointed but said it was fine.  I didn't sit down until 955 and they didn't even have time to wash my hair! NO ONE had a clue what was going on, and after my hair was done it was terrible! My hair stylist was so sweet, so I don't want him to get in trouble but my hair was thrown into a ugly twist with the side hanging down past my shoulders! It was HORRIBLE!! It was so bad another hair stylist gave me bobby pins as I was walking out. Seriously??!! If it was that bad even to you FIX IT.  I sent pictures after we got home asking for a refund and they said I paid for what I got and have never responded since!  It was a NIGHTMARE!"
1,"I had my birthday celebration at Kost with 9 of my friends. I enjoyed the rooftop view however, the service was disappointing. The hostess was not so welcoming when we came in. We were repeatedly reminded that we only had our table until 9:00pm. It took a while to get our food. My girlfriend had to wait 30 mins for her appetizer while everyone else finished theirs. 3 of my friends were late so the lady asked if she can take away their seats. I did not appreciate that. We felt pressured to hurry outta there. I found it rude & unprofessional. Our server was fine. The food was nothing out of the ordinary & was quite expensive. This would be my first & likely last time here. Thanks for making my birthday special...."
1,"This is such a poor experience in my life time. One star is even more than what we want to give.
Table was book by the owner Charles thru my boy. Services was extremely poor the girl who served us had very bad attitude. 
But we got stuck in the elevator for an hour and no one came help. And we have to call 911.
When we came back the girl who served us just throw our bday cake on the table and it's cold. 
Will never recommended to anyone again or come back. With the food was meh with the price"
1,"After a recent group breakfast here, I can not imagine returning.  We did have a large group, but not so large that it would explain the poor service.  We had to flag the waiter down for coffee refills, & even then, he ignored several empty cups.  One of our group had made a specific request regarding a serious food allergy, & when the food came out wrong, her polite request for a replacement was met with 2 managers visiting our table to try to convince her to accept the order as it was prepared.  What conscientious restaurant employee would knowingly risk an allergic reaction for a patron?  There are far too many great choices in the South Hills.  I won't return.  (I did like their custom pottery mugs!)"
1,"Purchased a grande chestnut praline latte and turkey holiday sandwich. Got my sandwich. Latte never came. I waited and waited. They served everyone ahead of me and everyone after me (really, every single person after me until nobody else was on the line). I spoke with one of the workers at the pickup window and after more waiting, still no latte. This is unacceptable; it is either complete incompetence or blatant discrimination. I will not ever come back or purchase from Starbucks again."
1,"I posted this earlier but My 1st one was taken down due to personal info being displayed.  So I have fixed it, copied all 87 comments from facebook and sent all the information to the Better Business Bureau.  This business is unprofessional, degrading and a disgrace to all business women.  

The response  below is in regards to me writing a bad review.  You should have seen the pictures! People called it a ""Redneck Wedding do"".  From reading other yelp comments this woman is a bully, calling people pigs, bad attitudes, etc.  Way to set an example. Never going there again and neither is about 200 of the people in the valley.  Dry Bar here we come!

May 7, 2013: Owner respone:  Awe! Too bad! LOL! I was going to refund your money the other day but then you wrote a bad review so I decided you are cray cray! We do not give refunds to people who do not deserve them. ;-) Melodi H"
1,"Just came from there.  I have been going there since 2010.  Never had issues until recently. 

My dog Bret passed away April 7, 2016 and they did a courtesy exam.  I decided to freeze dry his body so i needed it frozen while i waited for the mailing kit from Moreno Valley to arrive.   For the usual exam price of $46 they let me keep him in their 'freezer' for up to 10 days while I waited.  When I sent Bret's body and called Preserved Pets to make sure he arrived fine they said the body was already thawed out and asked if I had frozen him.  I told him yes and they said it looks like he was just refrigerated.   I was irritated but Preserved Pets said it was OK and they could still do the process so I let it go.

Just last week I took my Bella to have her left eye checked since it was cloudy, blue and red instead of her natural brown.   They told me it was about $177 for the tests they wanted to run and would take about 15 minutes to see if it was cancer, glaucoma,  etc.   I asked if i would have to pay another $46 exam fee they said no they would make it a courtesy.  I originally made my appointment for today at 10am, but since the process sounded fast and simple I changed it to 8:30am so that i could make another event at 10am. It took me about 30 minutes to get into an exam room, which I was OK with since i figured Bella would be out relatively fast.  Nope it still took about an hour for them to even get started on her tests so even at around 9:50 when I told them I just want to pay and get my Bella and they can read me on the phone the results,  they made it seem like they would rush but it was still the same long wait.  Doctor Taylor Parker was very nice and informative and helped me with Bella and even some doubts I had about Bret and his passing,  but the wait time they originally projected and the actual one was irritating as heck.  I was calming down after talking to Dr. Parker but then I went to pay and they quoted me $232.65.  I went down the invoice with the receptionist and saw I was being charged $29 for a recheck.  I told her that last week I was advised there would be no further exam fee.  She made a couple calls and said Dr. LEE the owner said there was still a charge.  The receptionist Danielle even agreed that she remembered Janie the vet tech or assistant or whatever her title is had said there would be no further exam fee but Dr. LEE overrode that decision  I am supposed to see them again Wednesday but I will find another vet.  

Pros: the receptionist staff doctors, all SEEM to be good at their jobs and caring individuals.   

Cons: 

telling me they have a freezer when they don't

telling me it's a 15 minutes testing process for ALL THE TESTS needed for my dog's eye when it's about triple that time

telling me i have no recheck fee when i do.  If i knew i would have to pay $29 for coming in 7 days later I would have just gutted it out and had all the tests done last week.

Telling me it's $177 when in actuality $232.35 for my dog's bill.

Dr. Choppa (not sure on spelling) and Dr. Taylor Parker were cool, but that staff person who said it was about 15 minutes for the eye testing and Dr. LEE for still charging me $29 despite the receptionist Danielle remembering that the tech Janie said they would do it as a courtesy have really put me off.  The nearest vet is Craig road and I heard they are sister locations with Lone Mountain so I will not patronize them either."
1,I had been taking my MazdaSpeed3 to Chapman Mazda since I bought it two years ago.  I had always been satisfied until this week.  My services used to run about $40 and they were done in a hour or less.  Yesterday it took over 2.5 hours and it cost me $350.  And there was nothing wrong with it.  They also used to have 2 waiting rooms and they don't any more.  I won't be taking my Mazda back to Chapman and I won't be buying a new Mazda (planned for next year) from them either.
1,"I read that a consistent cleansing can aid in all sorts of benefits and I figured this was the perfect time to get cleaned out! I made the appointment despite all the jokes and criticism I received. The only enthusiastic person was my coworker who was upset that I booked the appointment without her. To her, a colonic was a ""girl's spa day"". I arrived and finished the medical questionnaire. The receptionist made me a green drink mixed with powered greens and apple juice. It was tasty. Eliza ""the cleanser"" escorted me to the back. There was Reiki-like music and electric fountains simulating nature's pond. The facility looked like it was once someone's house. It appeared a bedroom had been turned into a private room equipped with water valves and PVC pipes. I recognized the bed-like apparatus. It looked like an angled massage chair with a big hole where your butt rested. Usually colonic flyers showed people propped up, reading a magazine with candles around them and a look of harmony on their face. I don't know where I read this, not on their website, but I could have sworn the tube that is inserted into your rectum was ""PENCIL THIN"". It was not pencil thin, but SHARPIE thick! Even with a glob of KY Jelly, I had a hard time getting this THING in! Eliza asked me if I needed help. With her guidance she angled it properly and it slid right in. GULP! Eliza gave me some additional tips on how to be as comfortable as possible. I didn't mind if she continued to talk. She told me some patients preferred to be alone. Eliza told me by now I should feel like I wanted to push. What does that mean!? I've NEVER had a child! She reached over and increased the flow of water into my colon. She continued to talk and ask me questions when all of a sudden, I got TUNNEL VISION! Her voice was like the Charlie Brown teacher and I couldn't tell you a single thing she said. I had to--FART? POOP? PEE? SOMETHING needed to happen but I didn't want to do it in front of her. I stared blankly into space like a toddler squatting in his diaper. She advised me to push. Modesty left quickly and within a split second my water BROKE! I heard a gallon splash escape from my bowels. OMG! She asked if I wanted her to leave and I nodded quickly. RUN ELIZA! The more she talked the more it hurt! She said I would feel some sort of cramping but this was labor! I've never had cramps during my menstrual period--is THIS what that feels like? On the left side of the bed was a long tube connecting to the suction and every time you pushed you could see what was exiting--THANKS to a mirror. It resembled ""Italian Wedding Soup"". Eliza came after one of my BIG pushes and gave me a hand held massager. She told me to massage in the direction of my colon to stimulate it. Within seconds I could feel my stomach cramping, gurgling and filling up with more water. I kept staring at the reflection of the tube. The more ""soup"" I saw meant this was all worth it. The massager began to work too well and now my legs went from close together to ""OB-GYN apart!"" I was now withering in pain and breathing like I was in Lamaze class! Those colonic photos on the internet were a lie! There's no way I could read a magazine right now and HARMONY WAS NOT ON MY FACE! I wanted to turn over on my side and get into a fetal position but I was afraid the tube would fall out of me and bowel would spill everywhere. Oh God! After five long minutes of cramping, Eliza came in. I told her everything was running clear and I'm done. She had a mason jar full of green liquid and mixed it into the water that filled my colon. Thirty minutes had already gone by---WHAT MORE WAS THERE TO DO?! She told me it was probiotics to put good bacteria back in my gut, and that I was probably cramping because ""something"" needed to still come out. She turned the water back on. I wanted to curse! By now the cramping was excruciating and I watched NOTHING exit my body but clear fluid. Eliza returned after ten LONG minutes and shut off the water flow. She told me to get dressed, go into the bathroom, prop my feet on the designated foot stool and push again. HUH? I sat on the toilet and looked around. I put my feet onto the stool and pushed as hard as I could. Water came gushing out. I got scared and hugged my knees. I felt exhausted! Eliza made me some peppermint tea and told me that I probably had severe cramping due to my empty stomach. She suggested I come back two more times during the week. I nodded and smiled but I knew that wasn't happening. I felt like I gave birth to something and now I was supposed to go home and act like nothing happened! I drove home scared to breathe too hard. When I got home and sat on the toilet I was still flushing out excess water. It looked like I was peeing from the front AND the back! I felt tired and sort of violated. LOL. For the rest of the day I laid on the couch. Did I really need this? Some people actually do. I realized I didn't need a cleanse as bad as I thought I did."
1,"When to this Starbucks because they messed up my order. I called to let them know that they have me the wrong drink. The lady on the phone was nice and said she put my name down on a list. I came today to redeem my drink. I see why I don't come to this one, apparently they they don't know who I talk to and I have to remember the name of the person and the line is hella long. It's like a bunch of dumb airheads running the show...i can't not do I need some girl with vocal fry talking to me like I messed up....as I am writing this only one car has moved....wont come to this one again. And how am I getting lectured like a child by some chick who makes 9 bucks and hour. I have never been disrespected in my life...im so pissed off. I swear I will not give that Starbucks any of my money"
1,Very poor service. Even let us to calculate the payments details! It was just a simple separate.
1,"One visit with my gf, she had lamb-chop and I had lamb-shish. Food taste good (nothing special or amazing but it taste good) , however the amount is not generous (particularly with rice) and price is a rip off. We could not believe they dont serve salad with your order ! Are you kidding me ? Salad has to be extra item to be paid when you are already charging too much for the dish ? The lamb-chop dish cost 24$ (excluding tax) yet no salad came for my gf !  Many other similar type restaurants in town serve salad right at the beginning before they bring in the ordered dishes. Never will return here while much better halal Turkish restaurant just one block off my house."
1,Found mold in a soy sauce bottle...food was also bland and not cooked well. The shrimp was rubbery and tempura batter was not good. The rice was tasteless and the only thing that made anything edible was the shrimp sauce.
1,"I came here for my birthday celebration after seeing how beautiful the restaurant is. Perhaps it was my mistake for coming here for dinner but the food was HORRIBLE. Absolutely nobody was satisfied with their food (mind you, we were a group of 7). The food was so bad (both in taste and presentation) that no one bothered to take photos of them. The service provided by the Front of House and our waitress felt very forceful and rude at times. The ONLY reason I'd come back to K?ST would be for the view."
1,"This review is not for the shooting range, but for the instructor, Rick Barkett, who conducted our CCW course a few months back.

The entire class of about 50 people were in agreement, when I say that this guy is a MAJOR FUCKING ASSHOLE.

He was clearly disgusted that so many people, many of whom weren't very knowledgeable about firearms, could be attending a class for a concealed carry permit.

Now, I would agree that some of them should know more about their pistols & revolvers before they try to carry them around in their back pockets, but since we live in a country where we still have the right to bear arms, and they were attending a class to follow legal protocol, I'd say that this guy should just shut the fuck up and teach his class without passing so much judgment on the students.

If nobody asked a question, he had a smart ass remark about that.  If somebody asked a question, he had an equally smart ass remark.

During the shooting portion of the training, he was totally condescending towards everybody, although he did shut the fuck up with me when he saw all 15 of my bullseye shots!!
 
There was one guy who actually wanted to slash his tires after the course but reconsidered because of all the surveillance cameras at the joint.  THAT would have been funny.

If I ever see his name again for a training class, I'll be sure to skip it and attend elsewhere."
1,"Was going to buy a car with The ""Chapman Discount"". NO!!!

Was looking at car listed on the internet at 20,825.00. Seemed like a good deal, add in 0.0% apr (which i qualified for). Great deal. When we went to do the ""actual"" deal, the price now was 23,515.00. 

Take off the 2000.00 factory incentives. WAIT - where is the Chapman price???

Add the Negative equity in my 2011 Toyota Camry, Ok, (not looking so good, but workable).

Now came the fees, they came so fast i could not write them all down. 
     146.32
     662.45
     210.30
     389.00
   2110.00 (yes it is 2110.00 for a title)
     350.00 (for plates)

My head is spinning, fees at 3868.07??????

I came here two years ago and bought my wife's car. Great experience. 

Pete in the service department, best I have ever seen. The service department as a whole is the Great, we drive in from Verrado out in Buckeye just to have our car serviced here.

What happened? Sales is just awful, run from here as fast as you can. Do not waste your time, there are so many others dealers in the valley! Run! 

I am running as fast as I can! I do not like to be talked down to or treated as they did me some kind of favor. Their insistent repeating of the same words and double speak does not change that they are overcharging on the deal. Listen, just saying it over and over does not make it true. 

As far as the 0.0% apr it became 2.9% not for 60 but 72 months.

Chapman Mazda we deserve better! 

You Should Be Ashamed"
1,"I love sushi!! And this was definitely not the right place to go. I went here once and ordered fried calamari as an appetizer and sushi.... the calamari had strings in it, was extremely slimy and chewy. Sushi wasn't that great either, I have had fast food sushi from the mall which tasted better. Basically we just paid and walked out without eating our meals.

Awful first experience and didn't end up going back till this day.."
1,"This is not exactly real Turkish cuisine. How do I know? Because I am Turkish. Turkish dessert Kunefe and appetizers are okay but I can't say the same thing for the mains. When I pay $40 per person, I expect more than that."
1,This place is disorganized.  I came with family.  Half the items on the menu are not available.  They seem to have run out of the Chapli Kabab.  No Boulanie.  No kabli plow.  Etc.  Etc.  I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back.  Slim pickings on the menu.  No accommodations.  No apologies.  And when we did order we waited 30 mins for the food.  And then there was a big disgusting hair in my plate.  Do not eat here.  Go to another Afghan restaurant.
1,"I had heard really good things about this restaurant and was looking forward to the experience. 

Ordered the platter but we did not get our food for 45 minutes. When we asked the waitress she seemed really surprised that it had been that long. She had only two tables to wait and was her job to follow up in the first place. Like she had no clue what was happening. Turns out that she completely didnt put the order though at all. 

This is especially bad considering that we were the only second table in the restaurant. We saw that everyone else that came after us get their food. When the waitress  followed up with the kitchen she did not even inform us of what had happened  and my husbabd had to ask the second time walking up to her. She tried to brush it off saying 10 minutes  but finally admitted that she did not put the order through and now it had been an hour since the ordered time and my kids were starving.

The food that finally came out after an hour and it was so rushed i could tell.

No formal apologies and no offer of any gestures.

Extremely disappointed with forgetting to put order in in the first place but worst part was how that mistake was handled"
1,"I've been to KOST twice in the last three weeks, not by choice; both times were pre booked by others. My first experience was not impressive and I decided that the restaurant was not a place I'd book myself.  Reason being, I was not impressed by the way the server handled a situation.  One of the members of the party I was dining with was served raw fish and when she mentioned it to the server, he told her that was the way it should be cooked and gave her tons of attitude when she asked for it to be cooked a bit more.  He made her feel like she was complaining for no reason; a HUGE no no when it comes to customer service. 

I was back at KOST on Monday November 5th for my birthday.  My partner had surprised me with this location and when we arrived at our table, there was a huge bouquet of red roses awaiting me.  He is such a romantic.  We had our dinner and it was fine.  Service was neither good or bad, mediocre at best.  Considering it was my birthday, they could've done something special, as they usually do at other establishments I've been to.  Regardless, we left our table and headed to the front where I had checked my coat. I was holding my beautiful bouquet of flowers when the host went to put my coat on, I was SHOCKED at what he said next.  He says (as he looks at my boyfriend), He'd be a true gentleman if he held your flowers for you"".  I was shocked.  I could not believe someone, especially a STAFF member, being the host of a reputable restaurant, would insult a patron like that.  I was so insulted, my boyfriend looked so embarrassed, and we left KOST with a very bad taste in our mouths.  This is absolutely unacceptable and I will NEVER return to this restaurant.  The host should know better than to put down a patron who just spent a lot of money at the establishment, and he could tell it was a special occasion which was ruined.  Never again KOST.  A simple thank you for coming or Happy Birthday would have been sufficient."
1,"I booked an appointment online and provided my credit card info. When I noticed they pulled the full amount from my account early, they said that I was a NO SHOW on the day I booked (which appeared to much earlier than the day I thought I booked online). Regardless if it was my error or the website, I have been going there for years. They would not even give a credit or re-schedule the appointment without charging me in FULL another $95. I will never go there again... such poor customer service. Response I got was basically ""too bad, so sad""."
1,"I DO NOT recommend anyone here, especially tourists.  They might as well put up a big fat sign outside that says ENGLISH SPEAKERS ARE NOT WELCOMED. 

This was my first stop after leaving the airport. I went up to the counter with a cheer and a simple but friendly bonjour to the older cashier.  I received a blank stare back and am immediately treated terribly as soon as she heard me speak English.  Yelling at me when I didn't understand her thick Vietnamese/French accent in this noise filled restaurant, shaking her head in disgust, shoving the menu in my face in a rage, slamming my credit card and pen on the counter with purposeful force, letting the unsanitary credit card machine drop on top of my food, and not providing me with napkins while she did for other customers.  She has no business working in service with this poor attitude.  And this is coming from someone who lives in New York City.  I'm used to subpar service but she is on another level."
1,This was the worst Starbucks I have been too. First it took so long to get my coffee. Taking into consideration this was 6 in the morning and of course there was a line. I ordered a Carmel maculate.  What I received was mostly hot water and milk. I could not taste any coffee. I didn't want to drink milk and water so of course I threw it out. What a way to start the day. Never again I just wasted $5.00. If I am paying that much for coffee I expect to receive coffee.
1,"Disgusting pizza. Cardboard crust, extremely greasy, cheap tasting ingredients. Large pizza so one fills you up, but you don't even want to eat it after you've had a few bites. Would not be coming back."
1,Terrible. Ordered the sushi for two and ate nothing . Salmon was still frozen.Told the waitress the food was terrible and she laughed and asked us if we were full. Really?
1,"This was suppose to be such a good decision and choice to come here and buy a car, I bought a used car which was not really what I was looking for but Bill pretty much talked me into buying the car and once I get home I realize my headlight is out, call the dealership immediately and let them know everyone I spoke to said bring it on on and we will take care of it, so at this time I am a little suspicious and take to my mechanic who does a full inspection on it and finds out that not only my light is out but my suspension is bad. I'm livid, they sold me a broken car and they are refusing to fix it. Wont ever buy from here or recommend them to anyone. 

I had to get corporate involved in order to even get any answers, it should not have come to that or been this difficult to get answers. I will be doing business elsewhere once all this is resolved, I thank justin in the service department for his outstanding help and efforts and also the Corporate office of mazda for getting this all worked out."
1,We really wanted to try their pizza and wings after reading the good reviews. We had family over for my birthday. We are extremely disappointed with the customer service.  We ordered at 5:30. We were told to expect to get the delivery by about 6:30. They are only about five kilometres away in Ajax.  The delivery guy just arrived at 8. It was an hour and a half late. I had called a few times to follow up. They said the delivery person came but no one answered the door; we live in a small home and we would have heard the door bell loud and clear.  Extremely disappointing. We wanted to support local business and this one generally had good reviews.  Wish they would improve their delivery and customer service.  We just ended up cancelling the order.
1,"Always on the lookout for new pizza joints in Durham and decided to try this place out because of the rave reviews. Pizza & wings were okay.

We ordered online where the tip and taxes were all included on the final total and that should have been the amount we paid when our pizza arrived, obviously. When the pizza man brought our pizza to the door.. there were no wings, when we asked about the wings he got flustered and said he didn't know what we were talking about.. after much back and forth he went to his car where low and behold, he found the wings... so shady! But wait, it gets even more shady. As mentioned earlier, the tip was already included in the FINAL total and this delivery guy took it upon himself to add an EXTRA $5 to our bill for his tip! Are you kidding me?! We were starving and irritated and he totally ruined our mood so we didn't bother to argue.

Hope you enjoy that extra, undeserved tip because you won't be getting business from us or our friends again. First and last time ordering from this place.

If you do an online order.. be careful and watch out for ""TIP-STEALING-TONY""."
1,"Dr. Death!!! Do not take your pets there. Staff was good but the doctor was heartless. She was more concerned about receiving payment rather than helping out my dying pet. My mother and I took our rabbit there who was short of breath and going stiff. We took him in as an emergency visit. Doctor was a ruthless person. She told us my rabbit had a 105 fever and preceeded to tell us the cost would be 2 thousand dollars to treat my rabbit. Obviously didn't have the 2k but begged for something to bring the fever down and/or pain meds. I had the cash for that. She declined as she wanted us to leave him there. Her x-ray fees were astronomical not including meds. My rabbit went into shock from the fever and dies 30 mins later. What I left out was also how she told us that if we can't afford her 900 dollar xrays and meds then I should just euthanize him. Cold, Cally's, b word!!!!!!! The staff there were even looking at us in sorrow because they couldn't believe what was transpiring. If I can help at least 20 people from taking their animals there, I have and will have avenged my rabbits death."
1,Not the same good food.......New owner same name:-( Your new windows & patio will not do it.....We just want good food......out waitress was clueless....Our family had been going here for years.......Good luck on your new place.
1,"Big Mistake. Big. Huge. Just kidding. But really..c'mom!!! Let's start this little tale with the cold hard facts. I love getting blow outs. I get tons of them. I am not exaggerating. I mainly frequent another blow out establishment but I am an equal opportunity blow out whore and I have even been to Primp and Blow a handful of times. It is fun to mix it up.  Anyone who has poopy textured hair like me will understand...and agree that it takes a lot of work to blow out your own hair when you have thick hair that is prone to waves/kinks/frizz of an uncontrolled (not cute) nature. It never quite looks the same when you style your own hair. 

Another thing you have to understand, I am actually pretty easy to please when it comes to blow drys. Worst case scenario: I tweak it a little when I get home...no biggie..it is not like a color or a cut where you could really endure some serious trauma...so it is in fact a low risk/high reward venture.

This is where the story turns south. My girl was pleasant enough. The shampoo was fine. The styling process seemed to be going okay, I was just settling into my I pad magazine when the blow dryer stops and my blow dry is apparently finished. 

When you get as many blow outs as I do, you have a REALLY good idea of how long it takes to dry your hair and I am thinking ""Huh? How is my hair all the way dry?""...anyway my daughter was still getting her hair done so I paid for both of us and left the tip for each stylist. Then I went into the bathroom and felt my hair and sure enough my hair was damp. I went back to the stylist and told her my hair was still wet. 

She asked ""Where""?

 I answered ""Everywhere"". 

She felt it and said, ""It's not wet..it just feels that way because the products get cold and it makes it feel wet"". 

What????? Huh????? Seriously??? What kind of products are these???? Huh??
 
She said she would hit it with the blowdryer one more time. Which she proceeded to do for like 30 seconds. :( :( ??

I didn't want to get into it with her because I was actually starting to doubt my ability to tell the difference between damp and dry hair even though I am pretty sure I had that ability since I was a toddler. After all she is the blow dry expert.  

I just waited for my daughter to get done.  Before hopping in the car I asked her to feel my hair. Well...guess what? My hair was wet. 

I booked it home. Of course it was starting to frizz up and curl in a weird direction by that time. 

I just strongly feel if you are in the business of drying hair you should at least get the dry part right."
1,"I am at a loss of words as to what to even say about this place. My husband and I came by here with another couple and were not even allowed past their "" fancy"" velvet ropes. We had read really good things about the view and the food so we called ahead and asked if they had any tables, it was later so they said yes we do. Overly excited we got into a taxi and came here. The bouncer looked at us up and down and got very defensive for no reason. We had told him we called ahead and he immediately turned us down and said that wasn't true and basically told us no we couldn't be allowed in. I literally am loling about it because we watched groups of girls in tight jumpsuits be allowed in before us. Apparently we were too ""underdressed"" the way they presented it to us was oh sorry we have nothing available for you!! Ok to the guy who is a bouncer you take your job way too serious. You open a velvet rope and let girls in skimpy clothes walk by you. Had high expectations for this place but after that experience I would never recommend anyone here. Btw I am a foodie and live in NYC area and have been to very nice establishments, never been treated like this ever."
1,"Very unfriendly service.  We asked several times for refilling water, and waited for a quite long time. The food is not authentic as green pepper.  Not recommend for people who love Korean food . They counted 18% tips and for separating the bills, they said, ""it's a bit messy ""and let us compute it by ourself. We wanted to leave as soon as possible, so we did it. Really a bad experience."
1,"Waited over an hour for our food. There was no organization, people crowded around the counters so you couldn't even get through to get ur food when it was finally ready. The worst part though was the service. One of the servers was incredibly rude and actually started yelling at us because we couldn't get through to pick up the order. The food was good but not worth being treated like shit."
1,"Rude staff. I inquired online about a car, went on vacation fir a few weeks, came home to about 10 emails from the online sales manager. We were no longer interested, so I asked them to stop emailing me. My response to this was a beyond rude and unprofessional email back from them. I will never go to a Chapman dealership."
1,Shooting range staff are the worst and most restrictive I have ever encountered. I bought a brand new Henry with a lever action and a tube type magazine and took it out there. I just got through loading and firing 5 rounds. When they called time after their 15 minutes of shooting one of the range masters came over and forcefully insisted that I take all .22 cal. shells out of the magazine. It is now wonder a guy got shot in the arm just 2 days ago. They are so concerned about safety that they have become communistic in their jobs and have become a bigger danger than the firearms could ever be!
1,"So on 7/5/18 myself and 2 friends went to this range to sight in our rifles. 2 of the employees running the line that day were quite rude. One of them, an old fat bald white guy with glasses thought it would be funny to make fun of a guy with a Scottish accent behind his back. During ceasefire, he said to another employee ""hey Check this out you can understand a f****** world this f****** guy says"". My lane and the lane to my left both heard him say this. The Scottish gentleman returned from his target and the old guy engaged in conversation with him. After they were done talking, old guy turned around and was laughing and making jokes about his accent. Another incident involving the same old man, he was probably 5 or 6 lanes away from us, and I hear some more F bombs coming from his mouth. This is supposed to be a kid friendly range. It's also extremely unprofessional in a civilian setting to be talking like that. 
Part 2: there was a lady running the booth when we had first arrived. She also couldn't seem to control her smart mouth. Making comments like ""all you big bad tough guys have to listen to me"". Telling people they needed to have 2 hands on the broom at all times when sweeping brass. 
Overall it wasn't a good experience and it made my friends and I along with several other shooters borderline uncomfortable. Myself, my friends, as well as my kids will not come back here. 

Side note: after we left the range we went to a few gun shops around town. I told one of the owners about the experience we just had at the range his response was ""doesn't surprise me, those guys are arseholes""."
1,"My not so fave location anymore. 3 days in a row at the drive thru.. Everytime we order WHITE HOT CHOCOLATE, they kept giving me white mocha with an espresso shot. My hubby never mentions the word Mocha.. they kept saying we said white mocha.. the other day we were charged $3.95 for a venti white hot chocolate. Everytime we say our order we get white mocha. Maybe i need to start recording my hubby when he orders. And make them listen to it. We never mention white choco mocha. Why would i want mocha?! I am pregnant and I am craving for a white hot chocolate not white mocha! Damn! And today they charged us for a white mocha $4.95 instead of white hot chocolate. It's only a steamed milk with white chocolate syrup,, for $4.95?! They're lucky I am not a hard customer. Because if I am I will make a big deal about this. Bring it up to management and train their baristas properly and listen carefully to people's orders."
1,"Terrible services from the waitresses. Placed the wrong order for customer, and gave a bad attitude when customer refused to accept the order. At the end, the waitresses complained about the little tips. Tips = quality of service. Will never go back again!"
1,The customer service at this location is bad. I will never go to this location anymore.
1,"I won't go back there after found out my dog's eye drop was charged almost  $ 22 and found out that I can pick up from the Walmart pharmacy for  $ 4.
Blood test, checked out my dog with overcharge eyedropper cost $400 plus if I didn't have FREE EXAM AD, and some military discount. 
They supposed to call me back or email TODAY,  no phone calls or email.
So, I will search more reasonable animal hospital."
1,"I'm a fan of Mediterranean food, this place is a disappointment, the chicken shawarma wrap had way too much turmeric. The man at the counter who may have been the owner, gladly replaced it without any questions for a chicken kabob wrap. Unfortunately though the chicken was very tender it was the complete opposite of the shawarma - totally flavorless. The accompanying  tzatziki sauce was jelly thick. Their beef or lamb might be better I'll never know I won't be going back. Sorry Greka."
1,"I bought my car here a year ago, I bought a sports car which has an option to add a limited slip differential. I believed them because it is hard to tell if your car has one even by looking. I finally called my car's manufacturer with a vin, only to find my car has an open differential. I do not trust the integrity of a dealership who will lie just to sell a car. Just a warning to anyone who comes here in the future, do your own research before buying a car here.

They also weren't as acquainting as other dealerships, I had to haggle for 3 hours just to get a price that was decent. They provided no refreshments even after confirming my purchase of the car."
1,"This place USED to be good many years ago but as of late it is absolutely terrible. The last two times we ordered it took over an hour and a half to arrive and we had to call to literally remind them to bring it because they forgot. When we got our 2 extra large pizzas for the family party, they were completely cold! When we called and asked for a refund they said they cannot do that but we can have a 10$ credit for next time. Unbelievable. There must be new owners or staff because this is not the pizza pino I used to know."
1,"During a no-filre session, I was disciplined for approaching the (unloaded and checked) weapons.  This is fine as I broke the rules.  What is not fine is that the female range master started to insult me and other customers making comments like ""everyone is really stupid today"" and ""I wish that they would leave"".  I appreciate their overall diligence in keeping their customers safe, but rude employees like this do not belong in a public-facing job."
1,"I was not going to post this review, but I noticed that other people had also noticed this so I decided maybe it's time for Green Lemon Grass to step up and fix a few things about their restaurant.

When I arrived with my friend, I was very excited to eat because their pho is actually very good.

However, when we were (finally) seated, there was an insect (with wings - kind of like a yellow grasshopper) that flew up onto the table.

I hate and fear insects, so out of instinct I pushed myself quickly back from the table.

A waitress came over and smacked the bug with a napkin and asked if we wanted to sit somewhere else lol.

I will never go back there again."
1,"SERVICE SUCKS !
I was there to buy a take-out lunch today before the rush hour.  After I paid for the purchase, I took a seat next to the cashier and waited for 5 minutes.  Then a waitress came by and said to me: ""You have to wait outside (i.e. outside the restaurant in the hall) for your take-out.  If you sit here, people walking by our restaurant may think it is full and would not come in.""  I looked around and there were at least 3 empty tables and no waiting customers.  I told her if there are customers waiting for the seats, I'd gladly wait outside.  So I stay put.  Moments later, a Caucasian customer walked in.  She seated him next to me and said: ""There is customer now.  You have to wait outside.""   WTF!  I then told her I am also a customer too.  If I have to wait outside, then they can change my take-out order to dine in instead.  I told the gentleman sitting next to me about what's happening and asked if he mind I stay seated for another 5 minutes. He had no objection at all.  Then I told the waitress I already asked their customer and he doesn't mind me sitting with him.  At the end , they gave me my lunch and I left.  At the time of leaving, there were empty tables and no line up still.
DON'T THEY UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THESE DAYS?  Customers don't just buy your goods, they also buy goods along with service.  
@X%^*!"
1,"I have visited/called 4 times all four a disaster under previous and new management. First I had a Mitsubishi lease, I dropped off my car for end of lease inspection. 6 hours later I go to pick it up it had not be done. They wanted to to look at new cars. I drop it off again 4 hours later no call I picked it up they said they had not gotten to it yet. I needed up dropping it at another dealer 1 hour later done, needed up buying a new car there.

Next time I call service department for tires for my Mitsubishi they transfer me to parts. I ask about tires he says what size, I saw I have no idea. His smart ass response well not sure why your talking to me they put four different sizes on those cars so once you know what you want let me know. And proceeds to tell me they are no longer Mitsubishi anyway. So rude and the attitude is horrible.

So I call the Manager Sam, and Start to tell him about my only 3 experiences with this place he interrupts me to ask why I am calling well to tell you  about your horrible service. Then he says we are under new management and have excellent customer service now. I disagreed. Then says not sure what you are tying to accomplish. When I told him I was doing a review and writing a letter I asked for his name 7 times and he refused to give it to me. I called back and got the manager on duties name. He never apologized.

Such an attitude this place no wonder."
1,Consistently terrible service. There were 4 people in the restaurant last time. Took 12mins to be sat. An hour to get food to the table. I like Denny's...just not this one.
1,"The man who did my pedicure was focused on talking to another woman in the salon and proceeded to rub my heel raw, causing a lot of pain and some blood. 

I'm also pretty positive that he made a racist comment about black people, to the woman next to me. Completely unacceptable. 

I don't believe that this sort of service is characteristic of this salon, but I can guarantee that I will not financially support an establishment that is tolerant of racist customer service. Perhaps I misunderstood his comment, but I think I would be lying to myself if I convinced myself that it wasn't actually a racist comment.

EDIT: after calling the salon on the phone the next day and speaking to a manager, I was reimbursed for the pedicure I received. Much appreciated."
1,"I was really happy with Spencer's when I purchased my kitchen appliances from them last month. I don't think I can complain about anything until of course I have my kitchen appliances installed.

To me, the indicator of quality customer service should be measured with how the customer is treated even AFTER the purchase was made. 

On day the appliances were installed, I was cleaning the fridge before I use it. I noticed that the ice maker box was not aligned to where it's supposed to sit. I looked some more and I noticed that the screw that holds the icemaker was busted so the icemaker at the back was just hanging without support. I called Spencer's Gilbert right away and they told me the following:

1) Schedule an appointment with GE because they have to inspect it first before we (Spencer's) could decide whether to replace it or not.

Fine. 

I wasn't satisfied, I tried calling again.

1) Lady who picked up the phone I think her name is Dee: ""Oh it's the fault of the installer you should talk to the installer for breaking your fridge"" - DUH??? I don't want to deal with the installer, I paid Spencer's for this so I expect Spencer's to be liable to me not the installer! It's day 1 for crying out loud!!!!!!!!!

2) Salesman X: Talk to my store manager he's the one who could decide if he could swap or not. 

3) Salesman Y: Wait for GE to look at it.

One week after, the GE guy came. He said the icemaker is broken but he can replace it. I told me I was informed by Spencers that GE folks have to call them to let them know what needs to be done on the fridge.He said they don't deal with Spencer's at all. It's between me and Spencer's if I'm not happy with the appliance and that I should demand a swap because it was not working on the day it was installed. GE guy said that with the condition of the icemaker being cracked on the side, he knew the fridge was mishandled.

It ticks me that I got a defective unit from first day and I still wanted a swap so I was finally able to speak with Larry, their store manager. Here's what he said ""Let GE fix it, it's just an easy fix, blah blah blah"". He wasn't even apologetic.

I called up Spencer's owner the next day hoping he could ""help"" a bit or apologize -- but to my surprise, he (Rick) was even worse than the manager in Gilbert branch (Larry). He said ""You don't have a choice, let GE fix it, I'm in a meeting...""

I don't deserve this crap from these guys. I should have gone with Sears or Home Depot or Lowes. These guys are just plain greedy. They don't think about their customers. After they made the deal, they didn't care a bit about you. I've never been treated this bad. 

I am banging my head I wish I could have researched more on Spencer's reviews before buying my kitchen appliances from them. With an endless list of bad reviews and complaints about them, I don't know how these guys lasted that long in the valley -- their customer service really sucks!!!

These guys have got to learn their lesson. What a total joke."
1,"My son, daughter-in-law and myself signed the lease with On Q property Management on 07/15/16.  Our lease had a start date of 07/17/2016 and an end date of 07/31/2017.  Under payment information on page 2 of the Rental Agreement a ""Total Security Deposit"" of $2200.00 - Refundable and a ""Pet  Deposit"" of $500.00 - Refundable was listed.  Our property manager was Breanna Landrum when we moved out at the end of July, 2017.  We received $552.43 of our security deposit back.
   My daughter-in-law arrived in Mesa on approximately 07/16/16 and picked up the keys on 07/18/2016.  The move-in inspection form was completed by my son and his wife and emailed to On Q 07/22/2016.  My Daughter-in-law called to let me know that they had the keys to the house and it was not very clean.  They cleaned for two days before they could move their belongs in.  The owner of the house Brian Cotter apologized for the condition of the house.  Mr. Cotter said he came over from California to check on the house.  He could not believe how dirty it was and that On Q thought it was ready to rent.  Mr. Cotter said he spent a day there cleaning. I arrived in 11/2016 and I spent six hours cleaning my bedroom and bathroom before I moved my furniture in.
   In the beginning of 2017 the battery in the smoke alarm in the living room started beeping indicating it needed a new battery. My son and I both texted On Q to have the battery replaced and received only promises that it would be fixed.  The beeping was going continually outside my bedroom.  My son finally called Mr. Cotter to see if he could call On Q to get it fixed.  The next night two men came to replace the battery.  Due to the location of the fire alarm they could not reach it.  The gentleman introduced himself as Brian Cotter, owner of the house and his son.  Mr. Cotter made a comment about a hair band laying on a ledge  that his daughter had shot up there when they lived there 8 years ago.    
    Per conversation with Mr. Cotter, the owner, The Move-In Inspection form and the pictures that I took in 11/2016  we can prove the house was not clean nor in great shape when we moved in.  Per Lease Agreement #8 (d) ""reasonable wear and tear expected"".  #10 (d) Tenant has carefully inspected the premises and finds them to be in a clean, rent-able, undamaged condition except as may be noted otherwise in the unit inventory.  Tenant agrees to exercise reasonable care in the use of the premises and maintain and redeliver the same in a clean, safe and undamaged condition.      
   Per#18 Move-In Inspection, all 5 pages of the checklist indicated on the Lease Agreement were completed and signed off by us and submitted to On Q in the required time frame.  There were 19 items marked in POOR conditions, many in fair condition and only a few were in good condition.  
   Per #20 (B) (Normal Wear and Tear Accepted.) #20 (D) ""Tenant agrees that if Premises are not returned in the same condition as Tenant received it, less Normal Wear and Tear"". 
   All reasons for not returning the security deposit listed in the Disposition Letter were addressed in the Move-In Inspection form which On Q received on 07/22/2016.  Kitchen Counter tops - condition poor, top was coming off on the island.
   Drywall/Paint - condition poor to fair, most areas have cracks, paint coming off, scratches on doors, hole in the wall and some rooms baseboards and doors were painted on one side and not the other.
   Landscape and sprinkler repair - The landscape was returned to On Q in the same condition that we received it.  Nothing was changed.  Weeds were sprayed and killed and bushes were trimmed to the size that they were when we moved in.  The sprinkler system never worked.
   On Q felt Touch-up cleaning and touch up painting in the linen pantry, kitchen pantry and all bedroom closets was needed.
These areas were marked up when we moved in.  The bedrooms were not completely painted the same color so I doubt if these areas had been touched in years.  I also feel these areas are covered by Normal Wear and Tear.
   The Security Deposit Refund is not acceptable and the check will not be cashed.  Out of a $2700.00 deposit On Q returned a pet deposit of $500.00 and $52.43 on the house deposit.  Items On Q listed either existed before we moved in and On Q was made aware of them or they fall under normal wear and tear  
   I own commercial and residential properties back in Ohio so I know the difference between a tenant damaging a property and Normal Wear and Tear. If you ask On Q a question their response is according to the ARL&T ACT ... so  I have reviewed the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.  Article 2 Landlord Obligations (33-1321) (B) Any fee or deposit not designated as nonrefundable shall be refundable.  Per the website there is no state agency that enforces provisions in this Act. 
 
 Do you really want On Q handling your property??  If you are planning to rent don't expect to receive your security deposit back!!"
1,"No need to report a problem at this hotel, they won't fix it.  They'll change you to a different room (which is super annoying) and as you settle in, you find that this newly updated room is only a shell update. The beds don't get updated I guess. The desk chair might be newer, but it had to have been bought at the discount barn. 

Is this really a Hilton property? 

Disappointed and irritated..."
1,"What a horrible experience. We sold our house and needed a place to stay and fast. We found a house with On Q. When we moved in the house was dirty, the yard was not trimmed and overall in poor condition. Fast forward a year and we got out quick! We chose not to renew our lease. These people are unprofessional, lazy and unwilling to help. The funny thing is, when we moved out we were held to a different standard. The floors, Capet and house needed to be cleaned or we wouldn't be able to get our deposit back. This is the worst place ever! The poor owner of the house has no clue! BEWARE!!!!"
1,"My disappointing & frustrating experience here matches another recent review here... I asked for my brows to be cleaned up with just a slight arch maintained. The girl then proceed to remove nearly all my brows. To make matter worse, they were uneven. When I asked about trying to fix a very clear uneven spot, she said she couldn't do anymore since there wasn't enough left to work with... UH, YOU THINK?? Within two days, my brow area was broken out with little scabs that took several days to heal. I've had my brows threaded many times before, but never ever with such terrible results."
1,"Food = 4
Service = 2
Environment = 0

Waitress was more worried talking about drama w co workers than service. Placed a homeless man next to us. Have no problem with it or servicing the homeless but he continued to disrupt us while she was in the back. Place has really went downhill."
1,"I'm disappointed in my experience here. I came here after work because it was close to me. I needed a pedi because I am going to try on wedding dresses tomorrow. Their pedis are over priced for one. They're customer service could definitely use some improvement as well. 
I sat to start my pedi and the lady dug into my big toe. She went in and she was very hurried and very rough. I pulled away a few times and asked her to be softer as she was moving onto the other foot. She was a little better. When scrubbing my feet she barely scrubbed... The massage chair I can barely feel and their polish assortment was a sad one rack. My toe is now infected and hurts."
1,"I went in a few days ago for a full set. I don't get my nails done very often, but I know the difference between a horrible experience and being treated with decency. When I walked in, there was NOT a single client. I asked for a full set. The girl I got seemed less than thrilled to be there. I asked her how her day was going and she replied 'it's been slow'. Ok I was super stoked because that meant she'd spend actual time and not rush doing my nails. WRONG!!!! Not only did she cut two of my cuticles open and bleeding, I watched another girl come in and be treated like someone getting nails done should be by one of the other nail ladies. By the end (25 minutes), my nails were bumpy with air bubbles, my middle finger nail was crooked and they were very unfinished as far as smooth around the edges. She even left extra acrylic gunk attached to the sides and back of some of my nails. In my head during the beginning, I started to deduct her 20% tip little by little. When she was done, I looked in dismay and I said 'are you really done?' She replied 'yup'. I went to pay and she told me it was $35, which I handed her 2 twenties. I asked for my change of five. I wish you could've seen her face when I didn't give her a tip. She proceeded to glare at me through the window as I got in my car. Lesson to all places of business, do a good job if you expect a tip. I'm an incredible tipper if I see fit and deserved."
1,"Horrible service!!! Ive been here a couple times since its close to my work and everytime i go they are all rude and they rush on your nails, always sloppy i had to dwnload this app just to let yall know this place is garbage!"
1,Avocado should not be brown.  There is no ranch dressing or anything creamy.  It is difficult to get help when using their kiosks.  The shrimp are minuscule and taste like sulfites.  Croutons were soggy.
1,"Definitely will not be back and should have trusted the bad reviews. Zero cleanliness (ringing people up touching the card machine, people's debit cards, and cash while wearing the gloves she was wearing for my pedicure and didn't change them) also carrying the cuticle clippers she was using on my feet in her hand while ringing people up. Didn't clean any of the tools between the last pedicure, my pedicure and the next. My water turned cold 3 times while she was helping other people during my pedicure. Literally almost walked out. I've never wanted a pedicure to just be over and I could not wait to RUN out."
1,"Food is good but the worst delivery service ever. 

I live 2 min drive away from here. Ordered food and 1hr 30 mins later it is still not here.   DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY. 

You can eat in or do takeout. That's it"
1,"Very disappointed. I have driven past this restaurant since I was a child, so decided to celebrate my 40th birthday there. I made a reservation for 15 people, so they gave us a private room on the second floor.
First issue: no elevator. My 70 and 73 year old mom and dad had to hobble up this steep narrow staircase, with their canes...you would think with the renos after the major fire, they would add a small elevator. 
Second issue: for those that had pop, the waiter would come by and offer another. ..never telling us that there is a charge for each small glass of fountain pop... $30 on pop after a bill of $1,000...seriously?!
Third issue: the steaks were cold, but my friends and family were too polite to complain because they didn't want to ruin my night. I ordered the filet mignon that comes topped with mushrooms...there were two undercooked mushrooms thrown on the plate. The side garlic mash tasted like it came out of a box.
Word of advice. ..go to the Keg, the food is hands down much better, and a fraction of the price.
It'll be another 40 years before I even consider going back there."
1,"Worst experience ever!! I asked if i could get a full set of acrylics in 75 min as i had an appt  at 5.  I was assured yes.  Then i waited for 10 min before the tech began the job.  She never stopped talking and giggling across the room the entire time pausing to look around and comment to her coworkers.  Despite several reminders that i needed to leave soon, she never stopped socializing in Vietnamese nor acknowledged her american client.   i was charged the full $27 for an unfinished job!!  Don't waste your time or money."
1,"This location is crap compared to the Markham locations.  The bbq duck has more bone than meat and the bbq pork is really fatty.

It was decent here before but quality has declined in the past year."
1,"Sometimes it's hard to judge a place by reviews, I should've trusted the reviews on this place. The cuticle cream was like water, the girl was in such a hurry that she basically slapped the polish on, and two of the salon workers got in a yelling match with a salon full of people. I kept trying to be positive, but it was the worst pedicure and gel manicure I've ever had and the worst salon experience ever. Please DO NOT go here."
1,"I made an appointment at Shine Salon after reading the rave reviews on Yelp. After speaking with the receptionist about the texture of my hair and what I wanted done, she recommended a stylist for me and I made an appointment.

The salon is very clean. Everyone there was very nice and I was helped immediately after I walked in the door. They offered me a drink and I did not have to wait long.

I came to my appointment wanting to get a cut and highlights. The stylist and I spoke in depth about the color I wanted, we looked at hair swatches and I even brought a picture. My hair is very dark brown and I wanted brown highlights just a few shades lighter than my natural color. I also wanted my highlights to look very natural and stressed that I wanted them blended. I felt like I could not have made it any more clear how I wanted my hair colored.

After my hair was finished and styled, I saw that the color of my highlights did not turn out how we had discussed. They ended up having a reddish tone to them and were almost a copper color. I told the stylist that this was not the color we had discussed and that I did not think I liked it. She explained to me that she was trying to avoid using bleach on my hair and lightened it with hair color instead, which pulls a reddish tint on dark brown hair. She never discussed any of this with me during our consultation and if she had, I would have either decided not to get them or asked her to go ahead and use the bleach. My highlights also looked very streaky- they definitely were not natural-looking or blended. 

I expressed to the stylist that I was not happy with my hair. She told me to go home and look at my hair in natural light and sleep on it. She said she would call me the next morning and if I was still unhappy that I could come back and she would fix them. That was over a month ago and she never called me. I thought about calling her myself but she made me feel guilty about not liking my hair, even though it did NOT turn out the color of the picture or hair swatch, because she said it still looked good. 

As a side note, during my appointment the stylist had to leave me sitting in her chair with wet hair after my hair was washed. She had another appointment for an eyebrow wax while my color was setting, but no one had turned on the waxing pot so she was waiting for it to warm up. I had to wait about 10 minutes. This is normally something I would not have thought twice about but I guess it bothered me more than normal give my negative experience.

I have been getting my hair highlighted for over 10 years and I have never left the salon feeling unhappy with how my hair turned out. This was a first. My hair not turning out the color I wanted is one thing. The stylist telling me she would call me and then never following up is what really made me feel like she could not have cared less whether I was happy with my hair."
1,"Asked for Teriyaki Chicken w/Lo Mein noodles, got regular chicken with angel hair noodles. No Crab Rangoons. Over priced, sub-par food. Would NOT recommend."
1,"I would not recommend this salon.  The staff are not very friendly and they switch people in and out to work on you. I believe they do this to spread the tips around. I had one girl start my pedicure and another girl finished it. I thought maybe she had an appointment, but she just went and sat at the desk. She also scrubbed so hard when removing the callus that I have 2 sores on my right foot.  I had another person do my manicure and it was okay, but she spent more time glancing at her phone.  Would not recommend..."
1,"I have a timeshare at Tahiti and all I've done is paid money for nothing. 8,200 and counting. Do not sign up for any timeshares they offer. It's a horrible way of taking ppl's money. I was dumb and fell for the scam. I'm still paying because Tahiti says legally I'm responsible for the payments i signed a contract. Yet they are not helpful at all in changing the contract or canceling it. Stay away from Tahiti"
1,"Being the huge foodie I'm, I have been a faithful user of Yelp for years now. I thought maybe in the new year instead of only using yelp it's also time for me to give back.
For those who might not want to read my long review I will summarize it. I got food poisoning from not very tasty and smelly steak. Customer service was sub-par. 

Now let me get into my real thoughts and experience of the restaurant. It sadden me that my first review was about a such a horrible experience at Octagon. Me and 5 other friends decided to have a triple date there to celebrate the new year. We had a private room, the atmosphere was very antique like. All the server are older well dressed gentlemen reminds me of Barbarian Steak House downtown. But their service wasn't close to the same. Most of the time they were very confused on who ordered what. So they will bring plates of food just stand there and stare their paper and confirm orders. When I asked for gravy for my mash potato the server looked at me with the condescended look and said ""you mean au jus?""
the Two couples ordered the fillet mignon and the rib steak to share. I order rare for my fillet mignon, but it was more like a medium rare when it came. The colour of the meat was very dark. I understand that meat are usually aged in steak house and colour isn't always bright red, but this was very dark I could barely tell if it's medium rare or medium. The colour made me feel very suspicious therefore I decided to smell it. I thought it smelled kind of funky so I asked my boyfriend to smell it also. He said its fine I'm over reacting so I decided to let it go and let him have most of it while I had half of his rib steak. The rib steak (bone in) is usually my favourite cut of steak because I like the rich flavour the bone brings out and the meat around the bone. But both of the rib steak we order wasn't very flavourful and was very very very burned. 
A few hours has gone by my stomach started to feel funny. At the same time one of the other couple who ordered the same thing as us msged me and ask how am I feeling. Don't want to get into details but the four of us spend a big part of our night in the bathroom. 
I will not recommend this steak house not only because I possible got food poisoning from it but also because the food wasn't that great. 6 of us spend $600 at this restaurant in exchange we had a terrible food experience with sub-par service. 
For Octagon, if you are reading this, please work on your quality control on your meat. Maybe consider retraining your staff also. It's a shame that you were suppose to be the only decent steak house around me but I will never visit again."
1,"I unfortunately have to give this place one star. I called ahead and had an appointment at 4:45. I was told to sit in one of the manicure chairs and was not even talked to until 5:25. I had an appointment for a manicure and the woman who did it came over with a small bowl of cold sink water and told me to soak my hands in this. She did not say anything to me the entire time except ""who pay?"" She filed my nails in 30 seconds and pushed the cuticles back so hard that I started bleeding badly on two nails. She just said ""oh you're bleeding."" She didn't even remove my old red nail polish, she just painted the pink over it!! She painted my nails in about 3 minutes and missed a lot of the sides. When all was done it was $36! Worst manicure I have ever had, she was with me for maybe 7 minutes total. She seemed pissed when I only gave her a 5 dollar tip but the manicure was terrible and I did not get good service. Don't bother with this place, it's a waste of money."
1,Not good. Bad experience   Food is average. Won't ever go back again
1,"Probably the most awkward eating experience ever.  Our hibachi fella was the most unentertaining guy ever.   There was no clanking, yelling, flipping, or laughing going on at our table.  The food was edible at most.  Don't bother with this place."
1,"A friend and I got gel manis on Friday, and by Monday I already had two chipped nails  and one I had to super glue back on due to peeling, and hers all peeled off after taking a bath a few days later.  After showering today (8 days later), three more of my nails were peeling off.  $40 for a mani that doesn't last more than a week???! Absolute garbage.  
It's been a while since I've been to Lotus, but it appears to be under new management or had a complete turnover of staff.  I definitely will not be returning and can't recommend this place to anyone."
1,"I have tried really hard to give this place my business, but have been unsuccessful.  A few weeks back, on my way to work, I saw the staff standing on the street holding out small brown bags of breakfast.  On the third day of them doing this I finally stopped, took a bag, and was happy with the little breakfast pocket that was inside.  I thought it was a smart way for them to try to drum up business!  

Unfortunately I have been unable to get breakfast from them since.  I have tried FOUR different times!

I first stopped on a weekday, on my way to work at nearly the same time they had been out there holding out those little bags (8:30am).  The place was closed.

The second attempt was on a Sunday morning, maybe 10ish.  Again, the place was closed.  

The third time I stopped was a Saturday morning, about 8ish, and they were closed.

I mean, who the hell serves breakfast but isn't open at breakfast times?

This morning (Saturday) I tried AGAIN but went later hoping they'd be open.  I got there at 10:48am.  They were open!  But they were no longer serving breakfast.  This one really angered me because the drive-though menu says it's available from 6am-11am (laughable considering they are not actually open in the mornings).

I'm done trying.  I've only even tried this hard because they are in my neighborhood and I want them to survive.  But I'm done. It should not be this difficult to give them my money."
1,I will never go back. They seemed to be bothered by the customers. My seven year old could have done a better job. They soaked my feet in cold water for about 2 minutes. I went right after work so I did not have a pair of flip flops to wear afterward. They did not offer any disposable flip flops. They left me walking barefoot across the parking lot in Arizona 110 degree summer. At least the asphalt scrubbed my heals better than they did.
1,"I have come to this place few time before... I usually get good service depends who is doing my nails. But today, the service wasn't too good, due to the person who did my nails, she kept doing other things at same time doing my pedicure. It usually takes 30 to 45 mins from start to finsh.  And she kept talking across the room, it felt like she's being loud. I'm deaf but I can tell the difference in behavior. I keep looking for nail salon that gives me real spa feeling, quiet and calm.  I have to give 1 star... I would give no stars for today but my nails turns out pretty!"
1,Friendly front desk. The only people who can sleep here are deaf. The air conditioner cycled on and off constantly. It was louder than the TV. I asked around to see if others had a similar experience and they did. The staff was gracious enough to give me a free nights stay at another property. The breakfast was what you would expect (edible). Thank goodness for the Belgian waffle maker.
1,"This is not the same Spencers I knew some years ago.  Things have definitely changed.  The salesperson rushed me through even though there was not much going on in the store.  I was given vague answers to my questions.  He seemed  disappointed that I would not be purchasing the most expensive product available.  Delivery was awful.  I was told in the store that delivery is available all day and someone would call to set it up.  The delivery guy called at 7am and insisted it is only between 9 and 11.  I asked for the latest time, he said maybe when they are done I can be the last one.  I asked how late that could be and was told ""11"".  They were in and out of my house in less than 20 seconds.  When meeting the delivery folks, noticed the person I spoke to on the phone appeared to be ""on"" something or who knows what, but something was off.  Have no idea if there is installation, or maybe this was an option, but the appliance is still in the box and turned upside down in the middle of my living room.  Great.  Not at all what I expected and I will not be shopping here again.  It will be interesting to see if the thing works after all this."
1,"I don't plan on coming back. Yes, I enjoyed the decor and the staff member who gave me a pedicure was nice and did a good job on my nails, but I can't say the same for the rest of my party. I paid extra for the Caffè Americano Pedicure and still had dry calluses as she barely used the callus remover. Definitely overpriced. The reason why I am giving them 1 star is because of the service I received after my pedicure. The staff member I had took my card for payment and when she came back with the receipt for me to sign, she held onto my credit card and did NOT return it to me until I signed the receipt and gave it to her. I was taken aback, as I've never had anyone do that to me before. There is a $1 charge for using card, which I was not told before hand, nor did I see it listed somewhere in the store.  Another staff member who was working with someone in my party told her that her 20% tip wasn't enough, and that they charge 30% for tip and didn't leave them alone until they gave her extra cash. Ridiculous and unacceptable."
1,"My Daughters Car Was Stolen From The Parking Lot Of This Hotel- She Was Driving Back East From California- The Manager Was Off Duty- July2nd - The Assistant Manager Made No Attempt To Help,Her-.We Have Called The Manager ""Wendy"" and Received No Call Back! They Made No,Attempt To Accomodate Her - She Called The Police! They Were Very Lame-There Are No Security Cameras In The Parking Lot-.I Would Never Stay Here Nor Would I Recommend Anyone Else To Use This Hotel Or Park In Their Lot- She Has Lost Everything And No Call Back From Manager! A Disgrace!!!!!"
1,"Gross probably about one of the worst AYCE sushi places I've tried in the city. 

Nothing fresh, nothing made right, portions are so large, it's unreal. I had a single order of chicken terriyaki and I get a bowl of oversauced gummy chicken the size of Texas?

The restaurant's mission is clear.. to stuff you with rice or whatever you order til you're sick of it. 

Price for dinner wasn't cheap either and service was cold as a cucumber. 

Never again!"
1,"We got two bedrooms for a week.  We called to get the rooms cleaned and they agreed to do so.  Then we go back to the room and they haven't cleaned anything. We understand there's a schedule cleaning day, but why did they agree to do it when they don't have plans to follow through?

Also, the time we were trying to check in, there were four people in the counter, and took five minutes to have someone ask if we need help. The man seemed like he was the manager, and didn't even try to help. 

The walls are so thin and you can hear everything and anything. The sink and bathtubs don't drain either.  The beds are lumpy. 

I wish I can like this place, and I hate leaving negative reviews, but this place sucks!"
1,"My husband and I moved into our house at the end of February this year.  The house needs many repairs, some of them being safety issues.
First, our stove/oven didn't work when we moved in, so we contacted the company letting them know.  A week later, somebody came out (I had to take time off of work because they wouldn't come out on weekends)  and determined it needed a new part.  The oven is from the 60s and they couldn't find the part,  so a new one was ordered.  Then the new one was delivered, but didn't fit in the island, so it couldn't be installed.  After a month of constant phone calls, and having to take MORE time off of work, the owner came out and fixed it himself.  Then we had a huge oven still in the box sitting in our kitchen for 3 weeks.  
We have had many problems with this company.  We stayed home last Saturday so somebody could come out and take the shower door and frames off and put up a rod and curtain because the heavy glass doors fall off and it is very dangerous.  So, they said from 7am-11a someone would come out.  Nobody came.  Nobody even called.  And of course we can't call on Saturday because nobody is in the office.  I work as a GM for 3 stores and I cannot always take off of work.  My husband works full time and he cannot ever take off of work, so when something like this happens, it makes me want to pull out my hair
  I am a pretty patient person and I understand that things happen.  But after 4 or 5 times of having to take off of work, or staying at home all day waiting for someone to make your home a safer place, I am 0retty fed up with this company.  I feel like nobody cares.  I would like to see how they would feel if the situation were reversed.  Terrible company :("
1,"2 words: BED BUGS 
2 more words: TERRIBLE STAFF

I stayed here for NYE 2015. We were there for 6 nights. On the 5th night I pulled the sofa bed out only to see a bed bug scurrying across the sheet. I immediately trapped it in a glass to show management. 

How did they deal with this? Put us in a different room and that's it. 

Security came to our room with keys. Not a hospitality member. They only have one manager per day and he's only there from 6am - 4pm. God forbid you need any assistance after 4pm. 

They claimed to have checked the room for more bed bugs but didn't find any other than the one I did, which I took a video and picture of. Seems to me like they just don't want to pay someone to remedy the situation.

We requested that management dry clean  all of our clothes and luggage, they made no effort to help us. They said take it to a dry cleaner and they would foot the bill. Never heard back from the manager. We ended up using vacation time to wash all of our own clothes so that we wouldn't bring the bugs back. 

We lost an entire day without compensation because the staff here is so incompetent. It was cold so we didn't get to check out the pool which seems to be the only enjoyable thing at this hotel since they want to charge guests to use any of the activity center games as if they are on the strip (3 miles away). I'm extremely unhappy with my entire experience at this hotel. 

DON'T STAY HERE."
1,"All of my shellac polish nails ""fell off"" within 4 days. I'm not kidding. I spent $40 plus $8 tip thinking that the nails would last at least a week if not the 2 weeks they say. Yesterday I opened up a make up compact and I heard a snap... I looked at my nails and noticed my right thumb nail was clear and in the sink was the shellac! A full shellac nail in the sink. I've never had that happen. Slowly but surely today they've all come off - one came off when I was putting my hair in a pony tail! The products they use are extremely cheap. They said they'd fix them but to just put the same crap on? No thanks. They'll never get my business again -- expensive lesson."
1,"I'm struggling to find one thing that was okay about this experience.   Will not be back, Beverly."
1,I honestly want to give this place 0 stars. The Bloody Mary was awful and nothing like what they have on their yelp page. And the Stella was ridiculously flat. I would not recommend this place unless you literally want to walk away with a bad taste in your mouth
1,"I had a very unpleasant experience with this business in March 2015.  I purchased a new refrigerator and it was delivered with scratches on the freezer door.  I called and a new door was ordered and they would call when it came in.  Then 2-3 weeks later the refrigerator side quit working - the friday before Easter after which I had purchased all my dinner groceries for Easter.  I called them and tried through the warranty service to get someone out but was told it would be monday at the earliest. I called Whirlpool and the earliest was tuesday.  I called around and found a local appliance repair to  come out the next day (saturday) and it was repaired at my expense of $104. Of course by then, all the food in the refrigerator was ruined.The next week the ice maker broke and I had to take another day off work to wait for the repair place to come out.  In the meantime, the new freezer door (huge box) was delivered to my house (instead of to Spencers).  Then I had to have someone come out and install that.  I scheduled on a saturday and Spencer's never showed up for that appointment.  Come to find out they had cancelled it without my knowledge.
So I had to set that up on my own.  They were rude to me and even lied to me on the phone.  Between all the hours of work lost and all the food in the refrigerator I am out alot of money.  (After alot of hassle they did reimburse me $100 for the service call I had to pay).  But there was no reason I should have had to set up 4 different service calls at my loss of work hours for a refrigerator that was only 3 weeks old.  I even
filed a complaint with the BBB and Spencer's never replied to the complaint.   I would not recommend doing business with Spencer's!"
1,"This review is for Gene Perez ( A pathetic liar salesman working for this company). I was promised 10 yrs worth support for my softener and RO system. There was a power outage in the garage which needed restart and reset the unit. My wife called Ameriflow, from which Spencer's buy systems. There was a pathetic lady who rudely refused to talk to her unless she gets a service request and have someone coming over for $80 just to reset the system. I called in Spencer's and talk to this liar sales man and he straight away said, it's a service call. So, we are not responsible to reset for you and you are on your own to get that $80 service booking or do it yourself. I mean what a pathetic little liar who promised big when selling parts and absolute ZERO service afterwards. Why don't you just get a knife and start robbing people on road???? Terrible Terrible company for service after sales. These guys should be thrown out of business for lying to people. STAY AWAY FROM THESE LIARS!!!!"
1,"I have been renting a house that On Q manages. Suffice to say their response to problems is abysmal. Latest fiasco is I have been without a working refrigerator for one month. The problems with the house are what might be expected, given its age and neglect by the owner. But they are problems that are easy to correct IF the management company is on their game. Here's some examples of no or slow responses:  AC LEAKING MOLD ON CEILING. 3 weeks. No remediation. DISHWASHER NOT WORKING. 2 weeks to repair. Problem with landscaper not treating dying grass. Never addressed. Grass was eaten by grubs. Back yard is now a dust bowl. Stone pillars on patio broken. 12 months to repair. Imagine if I was this unreliable in paying my rent."
1,"I really cannot comment on the quality of sushi, because we never got past the really, really bad soup and appetizers, paid a bill we should not have and walked out. You might be able to get the Hometown Buffet out of the building, but I would rather have eaten there!!!  Do not waste your time at this sorry excuse for a sushi restaurant when one of the best in Madison is less than a 1/4 mile away."
1,"Unfortunately when I called to book my latest appointment, the receptionist informed me that Jane no longer works for Idolize. When I asked if they could provide me with any information of where she went, the woman over the phone laughed and said no. The Dilworth location only does eyebrow threading, the South Park location uses estheticians-in-training, and the other location is 30 minutes away. It's a sad day for me, but Idolize has lost a long time customer."
1,"I'd avoid at all costs - If you're looking to rent, they're eager to help.  Once you're in, however, you might as well not exist.

Additionally - Cover your butts with these guys.  If for some reason you decide to rent with them, before you sign anything, take a lot of pictures, or even video if you can, of the rental you're choosing; while I took pictures, I should've done a whole lot more.  I ended up leaving the unit far cleaner than the condition when I moved in, yet they claimed things were dirty/broken, as took it out of my deposit.

Like I said - I'd personally avoid them - but if you do - cover yourself."
1,Buyer beware. I would give zero stars but you have to pick one. Purchased refrigerator and shared three hour window I would NOT be available for delivery the next day. Wouldn't you know that was the exact time they wanted to deliver and wouldn't budge moving the time later. Then when I called the store Brian Deese was more combative then helpful. They forgot who their customers are... good news I saved $200 more on nicer unit. Spencers will be lucky to reach 3 million customer as they promote with this service. Save yourself time and frustration and better pricing elsewhere.
1,"DISGUSTING! Sticky dirty tables, asked to be moved to another table, that one had food on the seats.... Ordered waters they came with a nasty film on the rim of the glasses so we asked for to go cups for our beverages. The server was nice and apologetic however the restaurant is in need of some management as this seems to be the expectation from him/her. This is before the food even came out!!! Get your 'stuff' together, there are classes at UNLV if you need management training...."
1,Do not go to this location!!!! My son and grandson go there and there's a server there that treats them horribly. Everytime! Honestly I'm over it!!!! They went in today and waited 15 minutes for a server and nothing! Another customer came in and right away she went up to him! Obviously she has issues with my family because it happens everytime and she still works there....unbelievable! I'll be calling the Better Business Bureau and filing a complaint against this restaurant as well as the server. My grandson is Autistic and don't appreciate the attitude from this specfic woman! If you hate your job......quit!!!! Shame on you Denny's by having an employee that is that miserable to treat your customers like crap!!!!!
1,"I used to love coming here but the last visit changed my experience forever. I arrived at 945pm as Aji Sai closes at 1030. As I arrived I was told the last call for food is 10pm and greeted with an apathetic attitude. I was then asked if I would be finished by 1030 because the boss wasn't here and the staff wanted to leave. They then asked me if they could just ""double"" the kitchen food order well my girlfriend was still looking at the menu. Never been to a restaurant that asks you to leave at the time it closes just horrible."
1,"Be careful, if you have germany car , this company do my audi A4, they broke my mirror (inside ) the car, but after the day i installed , they said they didnt touch anything,even they 're not done doing it, the guy said ""please sigb in in yelp and make sure put 5 star, so you can get a discount!!!! Be aware Ok!!!!"
1,"WORST PEDICURE OF MY LIFE. My mom and I came here for 2 pedicures with gel polish. My mom was bleeding within the first minute of her removing the old gel polish. She was done and draining the water within 5 minutes. All of the work was very minimum effort. She didn't trim the cuticles, or really do anything, so the gel was lifting at the bottom of the nails before I even left the salon. She was so focused on every other person walking in, it took twice as long to finish. Just an awful experience. Terrible quality."
1,"i was really looking forward to celebrating my boyfriends 21st birthday and our anniversary at the tahiti village resort. we ended up going to a nice resort with a beautiful lobby and a lazy river all to find out we were actually staying at the sister hotel... the website is very deceiving and does not give any information about the second hotel. me and my boyfriend have been calling it the ""ugly sister"" because there are chips in the walls and dirt marks everywhere. even the tile in the elevator is cracked. we wish we were at the other resort!"
1,"Yuck! 

I saw this place open up not too long ago and was excited to try it out. I went in tonight with low expectations, keeping in mind that this is still a ""fast-food type"" place, but the food was just awful. I am not a Panda Express fan, so I wouldn't suggest you go there, but you may as well (considering what they serve here)!

I ordered Vietnamese Beef Pho, Kung Pao Chicken, and a Vietnamese Iced Coffee.

The Iced Coffee was pre-mixed and poured into my cup from a large plastic container; you could get better pre-mixed iced coffee from 7-11 at half the cost. Don't be deceived; this is not what Vietnamese Iced Coffee should taste like.

The Pho was very bland and inedible, and is the worst I've tasted in my life (no exaggeration). The broth was completely flavorless; I believe they just used the water they boiled the noodles in. The noodles were thick and mushy. The beef was in cut in chunks (not-sliced) and was very tough. I just couldn't get myself to finish this.

The Kung Pao Chicken didn't taste as bad as the other two items, but was pathetic for what you pay. The portion is small; there are only a few pieces of chicken with very little vegetables. The container was mostly sauce and rice.

...very disappointing."
1,"Wow!  What a bunch of racist employees! 
We were also told to be quite because there were kids here! Yet the people next to use said they never even heard us being Loud now kids what so ever just a bunch of friends getting together and having a good time and laughing"
1,They offer THE WORST customer service. I ordered a certain size refrigerator and was brought another. The delivery guy indicated that I needed to accept delivery and he would take care of speaking with the manager...I also called and was of course given the run around. Had the same experience last time I purchased from here so I should have learned my lesson
1,Poorly executed cheap ingredients. Arrogant service. Not worth it at any price. The beef and chicken appear to be reconstituted and pounded flat. The tacos are dry and flavorless. The mystery fish smells fishy and is soaked in lemon to disguise it.
1,On Q Property Management is absolutely terrible. Very unprofessional and will gouge you on every possible fee they can. I would not recommend anyone sign a contract or enter into an agreement with them. You will regret it
1,Very poor service and bad food too. All the waiters and waitresses were extremely rude and disrespectful. AVOID at all costs!
1,"My friend and I have visited the Pub before, and wanted to return for brunch. The Aria website, and google, both state that it opens at 9am on Saturdays, so we waited outside till 920am, then I tried the door to see if it was open. A few minutes later a server popped her head out and snapped at us ""we don't open till 10!"", and slammed and locked the door. Sadly, we did not feel welcomed to wait till 10am, and we were discouraged from eating here. Rude service before we even entered the Pub. Very disappointed."
1,"Came here late night to try something simple with my boyfriend ,  place was empty. Half of the tables still had the dirty plates. The cooks were screaming in Spanish , the manger was screaming something about bacon very unprofessional. Our meal wasn't the best the eggs were horrible!!!! When  I told our server "" Leslie""   she was very rude about it . Never coming back here again! Sticking to iHop !"
1,"This place is CLOSED, closed, CLOSED!!!!!!

In mid December 2017 this location was replaced by Dumpling Fresh Express.  The inside (except for a preparation area in the front window) has remained SO SIMILAR that when I was there a couple came in and were perplexed about why they menu had changed :)  :)  They left feeling a little embarrassed after drinking the tea.

It's sad that the owners of this place seem to have stopped caring about this place.  If you search the Yelp reviews for this place sorted chronologically - you will notice that the quality of this place dropped off a cliff starting about 6 months ago.

Sad - because I liked this place.

There are several other locations - Queen Street, and the Danforth?

Good Bye Aji Sai."
1,"Have been a customer of theirs for 8 years. Never again.
Bought new Whirlpool washer and dryer 3 years ago. Purchased extended 4 year warranty for $ 149.at the time.
Washer is losing it's main bearings. A common design fault apparently. Called Spencers for warranty service, they gave me phone # for them. Called to make appointment,,,,spoke to one of the worst, rudest, and dumbest ever. Does not identify herself or the company, says the service man will be here Saturday, and will call first.
Saturday arrives, no call, I call them. Another rude, arrogant and condescending female tells me my appt. is for........NEXT Saturday!!!
Called Spencers, got a load of BS from salesman, then a bigger load of BS from mgr. He did tell me Spencers owns the Warranty and Service Cos.

They do not stand by their product in my experience, their service is horrible/ nonexistent.
I will never purchase from them again, and highly recommend you don't either. Look up ratings for GOLDWING Appliance service, see what I mean."
1,"Made appointment well in advance for 3 of us to have pedicures.  Started and finished my daughter before anyone even started my mother in law or I.  Took all 3 back, had us roll up our pants, waited over 30 min without anyone even filling our water reservoir.  Got up and left.  My daughter was happy at least she got what she wanted! ;) Second time I've had bad experience here.  Won't go back."
1,"I went here to get my nails filled and had a terrible experience. Right when we got there the ladies gave us a terrible greeting. I went to sit down to get my nails done and the lady insisted that they needed to be redone because they were ugly and were going to give me a fungus. Let me remind you that I only went for a fill. At this point my mom had left to go to Verizon because my phone wasn't working right, so I didn't have my phone. So I couldn't call my mom to make sure it was okay to get new nails. I went outside to see if my mom was there. The ladies where screaming at me telling me my mom was right there but she wasn't. The lady who they were pointing to looked absolutely nothing like my mom. So they asked me what my moms name was and I told them so they started screaming her name and I keep telling them that's not her. Finally they stopped and one of the ladies pulled me inside. I sat down and constantly she was saying,"" see they look better."" After she was finish I took a look at them. I personally don't think they look better at all. Also I asked for rounded tips and they are not even close to rounded. Finally she snarkely ended with,"" do you need an eyebrow threeding."" Also some of my nails are cut crooked. Sorry this is such a long review but,   when I was there some workers were staring at me and one person was watching YouTube. TIP TO BEVERLY NAILS AND SPA: if you don't want to look like you are not helpful and unclean you shouldn't have workers siting in the pedicure chairs and a million people that come from the back of the store distracting you. Also it's the next day and my fingers hurt. The workers should try to be nice and not make your fingers hurt. Finally I will never be coming back and will never sugest this place."
1,"Very frustrating visit today. I understand I came at a busy time but if they didn't have time then they should have given a realistic wait time rather then rush me through. The woman insisted that my nails matched my toe nails and you can see below they obversely are no where close to each other. I hate neon polish and now it's on my toes and the women days ""it's the best we can do"" super frustrating to be rushed and now actually get what I want when spending a bunch of money. In the pic you might be able to see my finger bleeding also. While paying there a customer that popped her head in and left because there about 3 people waiting to be seen. A staff ran after her and sat her immediately to get her nails done. One girl who was supposed to be helped next got very upset and they just threw an excuse at her. It upset me and I wasn't even the person waiting. They need to learn that focusing on the customer in front of you is most important and the faster they get people in and out the less likely any of those people will return."
1,"awful, wings bad, happy hour selection bad, shishito peppers are 5 alarm spicy. Never come back.... miss Todd english"
1,"Ordered salad and they sent it with no dressing. Called and they offered only to refund the dressing. I've been out of the state all week and had no food in my house where do they think I have the dressing to cover their mistake? That's why I fucking ordered dressing with my salad. Then after fighting, they only returned 9.00 of my salad, that isn't the price. It was 11.00 because of add ons. Way to treat someone who always orders 20-40$ orders from them all the time. Hope you enjoy your 2$."
1,"Never again! Chipped bowl with the chip left In the food. The drain under the soda machine was backed up and the placed smelled like sewer. Two workers on duty were more interested in their phones, than ensuring the food is good or the place was clean. Avoid until they fix the issues."
1,"I don't know where to start... from the horrific service, the grease-laden healthy egg white omelet  or the filthy table. This has to be one of the worst eating experiences I've had in Vegas...I will not even attempt to refer to it as dining. The server was dirty, dumb and overly polite to compensate for his service short comings. The food listed as a healthy choice is anything but healthy. I ordered the egg white omelet that was so grease-laden I couldn't taste anything but dirty grease; the omelet was brown instead of what you anticipate an egg white omelet should look like. The coffee was cold, the french fries were cold, we had to ask several times for utensils, and when we received them we just asked for the check. We also noticed the 'manager' was in the kitchen expediting the orders..that is never a good sign and when we asked to speak with him, he made eye contact and seated other unknowing patrons, never returning to speak with us. 

Do yourself a favor and go down the street and eat a Coco's."
1,"Voted the absolute worst chicken wings in Charlotte!!!! HUGE disappointment!  For a restaurant that specializes in chicken, you think the food would be delicious. The wings are the tiniest chicken wings I ever had, with absolutely no sauce, and they only served six tiny little wings and two pieces of carrots for nine dollars. I have a 100% success rate of calling out businesses that are going to fail, and unfortunately this is going to be one of them. Even the service was bad. I ordered three extra blue cheese and when my order came there was 1 ranch on the plate?? No napkins on the table ( all of the bins were not refilled, on any table) and the upstairs bar tender was to busy texting on her phone instead of helping us..."
1,"Don't get the carne asada fries or the tostada + taco combo. Both are HORRIBLE! 

1) Carne Asada Fries:  First, the cheese was not melted at all. Second, the carne asada had no flavor. It just tasted like rubber.  There were also beans in the carne asada fries which was the first.  If you get a chance, try the carne asada fries in San Diego, and you'll realize why this dish at Ricardo's is horrendous.

2) Tostada + Taco: Tostada was not flavorful at all. Tasted like canned beans spread on top of a crispy taco shell with lettuce.  The taco was similar to the tostada, except their was some type of meat which also had no flavor.

I'd recommend going to Del Taco for more authentic flavors."
1,"Not the best  Technician was talking about how often she has sex and penis size with another customer. 
Nails are also never consistent. Great one time, cut my finger the next"
1,"This hotel is a waste of money.  Prior to booking I wanted to ensure that there would be adequate transportation to and from the strip.  The reservations specialist assured me that there was an  available shuttle 24 hours a day that would provide transportation to and from Mandalay Bay.  Over the course of 4 days the shuttle was only available one time.  The rest of the time the shuttle was occupied taking guest to and from the airport.  When asking for a drop-off or pickup to from the Mandalay bay I was told by the front desk to call a taxi.  This happened a total of 9 times costing me approximately $200.00 hundred dollars in additional taxi cab rides! What a waste of money!  Additionally, the Nevada training room had a failed a/c unit in the middle of August.  This drove temperatures up to as high as 85 degrees during an our eight hour training days.  Finally, the cleaning staff was terribly inconsistent, failing to replace towels and clean floors among other things.  If I were you, I wouldn't waste my money or time with this place."
1,"I protest this place for the sole reason of their warranty service (Centurion Home Shield)... i mean, i was able to get some things covered that went wrong with some of the appliances i purchased, but it is the worst warranty service to work with.  Just a pain to try to get a hold of anyone, and they don't seem too eager to fix things... and when your fridge/freezer goes out, you want it fixed asap.  I had a food loss form I submitted and it took 6 months to receive the check.  Just a pain... Also, I don't think I've ever seen a company that has an ""F"" rating on BBB.  So in conclusion, Spencer's seems to have decent stuff at a decent price, but I rate them 1 star for offering the worst of warranty plans."
1,"Of the 5 times I've went here I've only had the privilege to eat here twice.

If you manage to get seated in this empty place then the food is ok.

If you go after 9pm chances are you'll stand at the counter for 10 minuets before anyone will even say be with you in a minute if they even do that. They didn't even do that 2 times, however, on Halloween they did say they'd be with us in a min after we stood there for 7 to 8 min. After 5 more minuets we left. They were doing nothing. I could see them standing there!

I don't know why the waitresses wouldn't seat me. My friend and I always tip well. That's like $10-11 extra an hour she could make on a non-alcoholic meal.

I wont be going back to this place. Id rather go to Vegas BLVD and pay the strip prices or the Ale house on Stephanie."
1,"I wish I would have read these reviews prior to using this company. When we moved in November 2015, the oven, dishwasher, furnace, and bathtubs did not work. It took one month before everything was fixed or repaired. On May 16th we notified On Q that the air conditioning did not work. We are still living with no A/C and we have no idea when it will be fixed/replaced. It is supposed to reach 114 degrees on Saturday. These people don't care. They sit back, collect their pay and that is all that matters to them.   I would not recommend using this company to anyone. 

Update to Tanner's comment:

It seems to me that your comment ""We understand your frustration..."" Is an ongoing dialogue with you. What have you done to mitigate the situation?  I bet if you had to live, cook and sleep in 90+ degree temperatures you would not be saying ""We understand your frustration...""  You would be actively doing something, anything to provide some alternative for us. Did you think of bringing over portable A/C units?  As for keeping us up to date on the process of the unit-you are NOT doing that. We here NOTHING from you unless we contact you. The last was an email stating your surprise that we weren't notified that the unit was to be installed Wednesday. Well today is Wednesday and it's 94 degrees in the house and you never contacted us to tell us that it will not be installed today.   Isn't against state law to not provide A/C to a tenant."
1,"Super poor service
Go in all the time with my son and just gets worse and worse each time. This last time(which is my last time going to this location) took about 15 plus minutes to even reach our table when there was only 2 servers in the whole place and hardly any tables sat. No one was helping eachother just standing around. Never coming again. Don't recommend at all"
1,"My experience purchasing was OK, just less than 2 years ago.  I got what I felt was a good deal on a package of LG appliances. Salesman was wrong about the Fridge having 2 ice makers, but I blame myself for not opening the lower freezer to see this amazing 2nd ice maker.

Delivery was on time, I just had them set in the garage as the home wasn't ready for them to be inside, friendly guys.

Problem started when I needed to use the extended warranty for a blown fuse on my LG Refrigerator.  Spencer's has no customer service when it comes to this, in fact they don't even take the time to talk to you, just refer you to the extended warranty company. Each time I have called to ask for someone to talk to about why its taking so long for a repair, I get the ole sorry sir that has nothing to do with us, please call our extended warranty company. In other words, I don't care sir.

It has been 20 days, and my fridge is still not repaired.  I just want to be able to talk to someone at Spencers who can solve my problem instead of pushing me off to someone else. Its a simple phone call to the repair company they solely use to tell them to buy the part localy instead of waiting for the German part.

I will NEVER use spencers again because of this 1 issue. If you get a great deal, go for it, but don't buy the extended warranty if you value your time."
1,"A once great AYCE sushi restaurant is now one of the worst for service and quality. They are under new management. I would give it a 0/5 if possible.

The servers are constantly confused, bring food to the wrong table repeatedly, and flat out ignore people. They used to have 2-3 sushi chefs working at a time, now they have 1. There appears to be a constant backlog of orders now that they do Foodora. This translates into a restaurant of people waiting up to an hour (yes, an hour) for an order of sushi while irate delivery guys hover at the counter. If you follow up, you get a confused look with a light ""oh sorry"" and nothing is done. Honestly a huge shame they can't figure their business out. We've been going for 6 years and have always recommended it, but will not go back. 

Particularly bad experience tonight:
-could only order sushi twice in 2 hours and 15 minutes because of how slow the service was and how backed up the chef was with take out orders, which he prioritized. 
-Avocado salad served with no avocado.
-Spicy salmon roll served with no spicy sauce. 
-Too much rice on the rolls as if they're trying to fill you up quicker.
-Rolls were wrong and when we gently corrected the waitress, she started pointing at a menu item in an effort to prove they were right, only to realize they weren't. I politely asked for the correct item (how crazy that I'd want what I ordered) and the chef gave us cut eye and took 20 minutes to fix it.  
-Eating dinner while listening to frustrated Foodora delivery guys the whole time.
-We asked for the bill, waited and then watched as our server left for the night. We had to ask another waitress twice for it.
-Confirmed they are under new management, who clearly have no clue how to run a restaurant.

I've never experienced something worse in a restaurant than the last two visits here. GO ELSEWHERE. There are better places!"
1,it was the worst meal i've ever had in Vegas.  i ordered the fish and chips. the fish was greasy and undercooked and the fires were also greasy and undercooked. don't waste your time and money going here. much better places in Vegas. McDonalds is across the street and has better fish and french fries.

1,This place is awful!  The guy who waxed my eyebrows did not even make them even. He was a real ass hole too. Definitely go somewhere else if you want good service and quality work!
1,"On Q will care 0% about you once they take your deposit and hand to the key. You will kick, scream, and fight over getting safe electricity for goodness sake. I had a year lease in Fountain Hills, and it was a nightmare, in the first month I had to take 6 days off work (NOT ONE accommodation) to accomodate them, and had to threaten to sue them to get them to fix back mold in my unit. Move on, search for something else - head this warning. I left the place in better shape than it was given to me, and I was told my 200+ pictures I took would be evaluated when I left - well, they took $192 of my deposit apparently because they feel like it. I have yet  to receive the supposed ""disposition"" for my move out claiming why - but do yourself a favor and find another place. You will thank me, rest assured. Unless you enjoy fighting to get even the bare minimum after you have signed a rediculous contract that means basically nothing.  They are crooks, and they change people faster than you change your shoes. They ignore your calls, and pretend that it is the ""owner"" that is causing this issues - total BS. I will file a complaint as soon as I can actually see what they decided to deduct, because naturally they cannot tell you over  the phone - it is worse than third grade. Unbelievable."
1,"If I could give this place less than a star, probz would. I didn't make an appointment, but I did call ahead. After being there for an hour i had barley gotten my gel polish taken off. I ended up leaving after they took the polish off, which they charged me $17 for lol... yikes. Main chick was yelling at other employees, while 'doing' my nails. Super awkward."
1,"FIRE THE MANAGER. Rudest and most incompetent Hampton Inn staff I have ever encountered.

I love Hampton Inns ... but NOT this none! Over the course of our stay, I have never experienced more rudeness and incompetence from hotel staff. The staff perform on a level more like bottom rung properties. Hilton needs to make some changes here to management and staff. In fact, the manager for this property should be FIRED for letting things like this happen!

Examples of the things you'll likely experience:

1) Calling to the front desk and having the staff just pick it up and put it on hold. They never come back to pick it up (happened 5 times over two days and I ultimately had to go down and find someone who was around the corner). Same thing happened on outside calls into the hotel (7 times over 2 days). Certainly makes it hard to get a shuttle pickup!

2) We had an early flight out and had asked for four ""to go packs"" and they only had two. I asked for two more and the staff person rolled her eyes and said they didn't have any more. Not a sorry or anything.

There are more instances of rudeness, but there is no need to reiterate here. I WILL be filing a complaint with Hilton since I am a Gold Honors member and expect better treatment than what i got here."
1,"We were in the mood to have some diner food on Friday and our two year old was a little fussy from a short nap so we thought why not go casual and see how our neighborhood Denny's is.

     We were kind of greeted by the manager who saw us come in and stayed seated for about 10 seconds before getting up to explain that she was tired. At about that time the female server came over and showed us to the booth and asked if we needed a high chair. I said yes please and she said ""OK wait a minute"" and left to go do something.  After a moment I realized she really wanted us to wait there for a full minute. I looked around and grabbed a highchair from the sidewall.

     I ordered the cinnamon pancake breakfast and the server suggested that I get half bacon and half sausage since I wasn't sure which one to choose. My girlfriend ordered the nachos and our daughter got the dinosaur chicken nuggets. When the food came, there was one strip of thin bacon and one very small sausage link. I asked the girl why she suggested getting half and half if the serving size was only two to begin with. She had no answer at all except ""That is how it comes"". The meat was room temperature (I assume it sat around waiting because the cook forgot to drop the chicken nuggets). The pancakes were horrible. They tasted like they were made with too much egg and had a texture of an omelet more than a pancake. The nachos and nuggets came out OK.

     It was time to go and the same female manager cashed us out. She informed me that the bill was 31 dollars and I said ""That doesn't sound right"". Without any inquiry she printed out an itemized check, handed it to me and aggressively said ""I don't know, you tell me"". She shifted back and forth and her body language was telling me to hurry up. That is just ridiculous. I don't know if the check was right or not. We payed the bill and got out of there. That was enough for me to know that our business is not appreciated. With all the options on Eastern, there is no need to give this Denny's another chance."
1,"It is a very bad experience. I came in today, but it took a while until someone greeted me, besides that, the drinks were super slow. I tried the smoothies and it was really sweet. I do not know what the put in the ingredients. Luckily, I was fine after drinking their smoothies. I won`t come back. Super slow and the drinks were just so so, nothing good."
1,"Great decor.  Horrible service. Scallop was good, but one of four didn't have bacon wrapped.  Server THREW DOWN the steak and ran away from our table. Never asked once how thing were. Steak was bland and only warm-ish.   Mash potato tasted like cotton.  I'm not a picky guy normally, but this place really disappointed.  Sad because the decor really is epic.   But this place is probably the worst high end steak house I've ever been to!!!"
1,"Extremely unimpressed with the customer service at Spencer's. My husband and I just bought our first house so we went in to Spencer's looking for updated appliances. The salesperson in the store was very nice and got us what we wanted which was nice. Everything after the purchasing has been a nightmare. Our delivery guy was over an hour late to dropping off our appliances (didn't get to our house until after 7pm), he was very unprofessional, we asked him to unbox the appliances and haul the boxes away and he just opened them for us, which we could have done ourselves obviously. And to top it all off, our range was apparently damaged and wasn't delivered with everything else, which we weren't informed of until the delivery guy was at our house with everything else. I called to talk to someone about our experience (and find out when we're getting our range) and I informed the man on the phone of everything that happened and he seemed unbothered whatsoever and did nothing to help the situation. Needless to say, once we get our range we're never doing business with Spencer's again. 
Update; our range was supposed to be here today, I was told by 2 people yesterday that it would be delivered today because they ""have a bunch in stock"" and we got a call this morning that it won't be here until Monday. They also keep trying to charge us for installation that we did not have done on our appliances."
1,"I find it very rude that you deleted my review on Facebook!  All I wanted was to know where Vincent and Danny went!!  Anyway, my husband and I used to drive over an hour one way to go to Lotus!  It was well worth it for nails and a pedicure!  The last few times we were there we noticed many familiar staff gone.  Our pedicures were done by new people, and were certainly not as good as they used to be, my polished chipped within a week, and the pedicures seemed rushed.  This never happened before!  Lotus had the best pedicures we've ever had!  We also found out Danny had left.  He did an excellent manicure for my husband, and this was very upsetting!  The last time we went he didn't have a manicure because Danny was gone.   I've only had Vincent do my nails, as he was superb!  I've had my nails done at so many other places, and NEVER had them done as well as Vincent did them!  Now, I call today to have a fill and am told Vincent is now gone!  I knew there were new owners, and many people left, including Danny....but now Vincent??!!!   We will NOT be returning.  We would just like to know where everyone went!  We will be happy to follow them where ever they are!  So sad after almost 3 years of coming to this salon, and telling everyone how wonderful it was, that it had to end this way."
1,???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1,"This place sucks, what a waste of my money. Threw the meal away after my first bite. Even their iced tea was bad."
1,"The salon is very pretty inside. And I like the fact that they line their pedicure tubs with plastic. But I left disappointed. 
I made an appointment for a pedicure and a fill appointment. Little by little she removed my gel tips and replaced all of my tips. (Really? I just had them soaked off; 3 weeks ago), needless to say I left with a new set. I noticed in my car that 7 nails were misshaped. On the second day after my visit, my toe polish peeled. 
The owner, is also very pushy. She really wanted for me to get Shellac. My bill for this visit was close to $100.00!"
1,"WORST HOTEL SERVICE!! Called 3 weeks in advance and spoke with manager regarding shuttle availability for the duration of my stay and was told 24/7. Called before my flight took off and once I landed in Vegas....NO SHUTTLE WAITING. After 45+ minutes I decided to take a cab to my already late appointment. After work I wanted to go to the strip and eat dinner but the shuttle was ""at the airport waiting""....took a cab. After dinner wanted to go back to my hotel but the shuttle was what? You guessed it....at the airport waiting. Every time I called or asked it was at the airport and unavailable yet when I was at the airport it was no where to be found. I think the fact that I called to advance my trip, called before my flight took off, and called once I landed just makes it worse. Oh and no understanding from the staff about the situation. I will never stay at any Hampton Inn again and neither will anyone I work with."
1,"This is my first and last time I'll be going here to get tint services. I really am totally frustrated and disappointed what they have done to my new car. A lot of tiny bubbles, some windows were undercut, rear window was cut crooked as you can see from the pics. It's been 5 days and bubbles are still there all over, it didn't disappear. It seems that my car was rushed , just so that the customer with the Lexus next in line would be worked on as soon my car is out of the way. Besides this, I discovered some damages done to my new vehicle as I examined my car. The owner denies it and offered to redo my windows. He explained that's what the warranty is for. A professional and great company delivers great service and job well done the first time around . They don't waste people's time to come back for errors like this. It's very unprofessional. They have lost my trust and would never leave my vehicle in care of their hands again. I don't want anyone to experience the same thing like me. It's a waste of my time and money."
1,"Terrible experience! Extremely unfriendly and they do a terrible job I had asked them to redo my nails twice and still they kept layering on now polish which was creating ripples in the paint and after waiting in the salon for over two hours I decided just to call it quits, The Salon is filthy they do not use individual pedicure kits at one point the technician was working on my pedicure then stopped and went to the lady next to me to work on her pedicure while wearing the same gloves."
1,"So sad when a great concept and location is marred by grumpy service and bad food. Spicy Dandan sauce is inedible. Thai salad is dressed with the same over spiced sauce.  The manager? replaced the Thai salad with a flavorless chicken salad topped with mandarin oranges that are spoiled. 

Big miss team!"
1,"Read the reviews on Yelp, still decided to try because we were craving for AYCE and its in the neighborhood. It turned out to be a very big disappointment. First of all, for dinner AYCE menu is only 5 kinds of sashimi, which is pretty limited the choice. Secondly, all their chicken dish has a weird fridge taste. Thirdly, by the time we were finished, there are 4 pieces of sushi rolls on the plate, out of the 20 that we ordered, the waitress basically forced us to eat it otherwise she will charge us $2.00 each, then she went back to her counter to gossip about this to her boss. At that point, I just no longer want to order further and just wanted the bill. When we got the bill, there is a default 15% tips which the service itself does not deserve it."
1,"Did not put my friend and I next to each other, even though we came in together and they were empty... They don't know acrylic tips vs gel tips. My poor cuticles. Never again."
1,"Got the cheese enchiladas with beans and rice, and a side of chips with salsa. Everything was incredibly bland. The chips were thick like the kind you get from the grocery store, and lacked salt. The medium salsa tasted like carrots. The beans tasted straight out of a can with no spice or flavor. The enchilada sauce had a hint of cinnamon in it."
1,"Went there last night for the first time.  Not impressed at all.  Sat in the sushi bar and it took a while to get attention.  Staff seemed overwhelmed.  Platters piled up on top of the sushi bar waiting for the waiters to carry them to the tables.  Sushi chef behind the bar yelling directions to the staff through a two-way radio.  Was a bit of a mad house.  Had the sushi boat for two and it is on par with supermarket sushi.  Not better.  No wasabi or ginger. They clearly have to still get their game together.  Until then, thanks but no thanks."
1,"I would give zero if I could, I would NEVER recommend this place.  I will try to keep this short.  I only went here because I had an hour to kill in the area and was beyond needing a pedicure.  I walked in the door and there were 3 ladies sitting able to work, but had NOT ONE customer inside the place. I should have left then.  I picked a color and on my way to the chair I dropped the polish.  I immediately said how sorry I was and asked if they would give me something to clean it up with.  Not one lady got up and offered to clean it up or even help, they were busy yelling at each other about me dropping the polish.  One finally threw a dry towel to me.  I asked if I could please have polish remover and started wiping up the tile.  She came over and poured polish remover so I cleaned up all of the mess.  I asked for one more towel to finish it, so you would never have been able to tell it was dropped but she wouldn't give me one more.  NOW, I am certainly NOT the first person to ever drop a polish bottle like this, but it was MY first time ever.  They had no plans of trying to make me feel like it was okay or that this could ever happen in their shop.  All of them were RUDE and spoke Vietnamese the entire time I was there.  No customer service skills whatsoever from any employee/owner in the place.  I paid $32 for the Deluxe pedicure and was not even offered a design at the end.  I was in the chair at 11:45 and walking out the door at 12:10 - all done.  The job was terrible, she was extremely rough (maybe to show me she was really mad at the dropped polish) very rude people technicians, and the place was not clean.  Some kind of roach was on the floor by my chair which I took a picture of but don't know how to post it.....  I paid $5.00 extra for the broken bottle of polish and I still gave a $10 tip, which was very stupid of me.  NOTE TO YOU AT BEVERLY NAILS:  If you want to come to the USA to live and make money, you should try treating people nicely and be friendly to customers even when you don't feel like it!!!!!!!!!!!  You never know who might refer lots of business in the future, or who might write an honest review of your crappy business!!!!!!!!"
1,"Go somewhere else ...Jr burrito with cheese and beans had no cheese, burrito that I paid for extra beans to be added was missing the beans, súper nachos had no cheese and some sort of wanna be guacamole .. oh and their ""carne asada"" should be called bistec a la plancha. For my friends looking for a good burrito or taco place like my self, that know true Mexican food this is a NO GO! Stay away and save your money."
1,"Two visits, and I have only eaten here once.  This place has a line of people waiting to put their name down for a table, and I don't get it. The second time we went, we were seated at a table in the bar, and after 30 minutes, we walked out.  We watched staff avoid our gaze the entire time, I guess no one wanted to wait the table?  

My first visit was a bit disappointing, as the food was flavorless, and everyone was served at different times.  We ordered various appetizers, and I got the bento box, while my BF got the ramen.  Nothing had flavor.  Changing out my sushi roll for a different roll of the same price was an up-charge of $1.50.  It's things like this that just make me not want to return.  I heard the hibachi is better, and that's the only way I would go back."
1,"WOW! I am horrified with this hotel. I wish that I could give the hotel a negative star rating. Let me explain why..

I booked the hotel weeks ago because there was a huge music festival going on and most of the city was full and completely booked.

When I first checked in, they seemed pretty nice. Although when I asked for a small refrigerator to be brought up to the room to keep my medication in, they informed me that they could not accommodate my medical need. I asked for a manager, but apparently there was no one on duty to assist me for over a hour. I decided I would check back later.
When I opened the door to my hotel room, a terrible scent greeted me. I didn't know what it was until I took off my sandals to walk over to the bed, and I stepped in a big damp stop of carpet. That's when it hit me. There was VOMIT there, and it was poorly cleaned. It was still wet in the carpet, and I stepped in it! I immediately called the front desk and told them of the terrible incident. The front desk lady told me to come down to her and move all of my stuff out of the room. So I carried all of my luggage down there with me, to which I was informed it would probably be another hour until I could get another room. I asked once again if I could have a refrigerator in my room for my insulin and she told me I could keep it down the way with the maids! What if my blood sugar gets really high and they can't get it for me in time. I don't think they understand the reality associated with things like this. 

After this unfortunate experience, I asked if I could use the business center so I can book another hotel and be refunded for my stay. She said yes. 5 minutes later, she came into the business center and handed me room keys and said "" ill have a refrigerator to your new room in the next 30 minutes, don't book somewhere else"". 

I went up to my new room and it didn't smell bad! I cant tell you how relieving that was, but once I sat down I noticed a BLOOD STAIN on the pillow!!!! And when I pulled the blanket down there were yellow stains on the sheets. I am getting sick just thinking about it. I took the pillow down to the front desk and asked for a manager, which is when I heard a woman named Lucy say very rudely ""What do you want"". I told her about the vomit in the first room, and how the employee was very nice and quickly assisted me with a new room. Then, I handed her the pillow with the blood stain and I pulled out my phone to take a photograph but she took it away from me immediately. She told me to go up to the room, and the maids would change the sheets. She also said she would call to see if she can compensate for the inconveniences. 

The maids quickly came up and asked me if I wanted to move rooms again. I have spinal problems and it is too difficult for me to move all of my heavy luggage 3 times, so I told them that the room is fine as long as they change the sheets. Surely enough I am waiting in my room for Lucy to call me, and the phone rings. I answered and she said ""We don't feel that we can meet your cleanliness standards, so we are going to refund you and you need to vacate the room"". I told her that the sheets were clean now and I'm fine with the room, its too difficult for me to move again with my medical condition. Surely enough, she said "" I am going to have you escorted out if you do not leave in the next 5 minutes.""

I went downstairs to speak with her, and I asked her to explain how she can do that because I do not understand. I wanted clean sheets without blood and vomit in the room. She proceeded to start yelling at me and humiliated me in front of 6 other people in the lobby. I couldn't help but start to cry from the way she had treated me. I moved all of my stuff to my car while in terrible pain from my spine. When everything was moved I went back to her and gave her the room keys and asked if I could sit in the lobby to call corporate and use the wifi to book another hotel since I am not from the area and it was 115 degrees out side. I told her that she city was totally booked, to which she replied, "" I know its not my problem. She again yelled at me and said I can if I want, but then it will be trespassing and she will call the police. 

I sat in the hot parking lot suffering from the heat and in tears because I needed to sort out the issue with corporate. They told me I would not be refunded for 48 hours, and in the mean time the entire city was full. Each time corporate would talk to this hotel and transfer back to me, there was a new problem. She lied and said that I was still in the room. She watched me leave and came outside and saw me sitting in my car. I will never, ever, stay at this hotel again. Vomit and blood are both health hazards, and the poor service is by far unacceptable."
1,"Don't buy fridgidaire Products.  I have had a stove crack out, a Dishwasher control panel go out right after I bought it, a dryer hinge that wont stay closed and a microwave that started arching for no reason at all.  All this was fixed once under there ONE YEAR WARRANTY!!  Guess what Problems came back. except stove and Microwave.  Spencers guy are cool people but not there fridgidaire products."
1,"If I could give this place a negative star I would they tell you a different price on the phone then when you come in. The girls are so rude and want to charge you for every little thing. From filing, shaping and shortening them. Don't go here! They are so rude!!!!!"
1,This place is absolutely horrible. The staff is extremely unfriendly. The manager is constantly arguing with her staff. I will never go back.
1,"Don't listen to anyone else's review but mine. The Octagon ruined my birthday with its salty Oyster Rockefeller appetizers and uninspired, terribly mediocre steak. Also the prime rib tasted like grocery store bought roast beef. The pickles were an abomination and made me cry tears for my grandchildren. If you like feeling trapped in a windowless setting with a very underwhelming experience feel free to drop over $200."
1,"If I could give zero stars I would.. this is the worst gel manicure I've ever had. It's lumpy, all over my cuticles and the tips of my fingers. Wish i was better at speaking up, paying for this was torture."

1,"Like many other customers before me (I'm sorry now that I didn't read the reviews) I purchased a KitchenAid dishwasher at Spencer's.  I immediately had issues with the dishwasher.  I called Spencers and they told me to call the service company on the inside of the folder they gave me.  Goldwing service came out and told me that the high priced dishwasher detergent I bought from Spencer's would not work best and told me to buy other products.  It worked for a while and I began having problems again.  I called Goldwing and they never returned my call, they are only open Monday - Friday.  I've had several other service calls for the same issue to no avail.

I called Spencer's and of course was told, they are only the selling agent.  The problem is between me and KitchenAid.  They further told me that if they would have known about this issue before the warranty went out they could have been more help.  I have heard at least 20 times now - you have to understand that it is between you and KitchenAid.  We have nothing to do with it, but I will try to help.  But, if you had an extended warranty- we could do more to help.  Ok, I spent $980 of my hard earned money, you want more for and extended warranty for a product that never cleaned in the first place?  Where is customer service?  Where is responsibility for the product?  The product never cleaned the dishes period!  Neither Spencer's or KitchenAid are standing by their product.  They have my money.....their part is done."
1,"We are so disappointed as this was of our favorite restaurant at the Aria. 
It is a new restaurant and owner...not Todd English anymore. 
Had the clam chowder and calamari. Both terrible. The clam chowder had huge chunks of bacon. The calamari was very greasy and served all clumped. Will not be coming back."
1,"I've been coming here for about a year now and out of the year, it totalled to 6 visits. I should have written a review when I was out with my family but after my last visit, I had to let some steam out. 

My girlfriend and I including another friend dropped in about 2 hours before closing right after the gym. (We were definitely HANGRY) So I noticed that they finished with there late night dinner rush. We were shown to our seats and we've placed out order with the server who spoke english. As we waited (30 minutes in) I noticed that other tablets that came after us were being served including the table next to us that just sat down within 5 minutes of me noticing that we weren't being served. 

We ended up eating 1 dish out of the 5 we've order and I've decided to check out since we only received 3 dishes out of the 5. So the other 2 got cold and I said ""fuck it"" we are leaving. At the cash out, this is where it got REALLY bad. The host/owner printed out our receipt and I noticed that there were only 3 dishes ordered and that was when I noticed how these sneaky servers are. 

TIP: If you are planning on coming here, make sure they read back your order. ALSO if you notice that you didn't get your entire order at your table at a timely manner, DO NOT check with the server because chances are, they probably forgot to punch it in and they will not even tell you that. They will tell you that ""it's being made right now"" in order to cover up their fuck up. 

If it's one thing I hate its a cover up of a mistake you've made. OWN UP TO IT.

So pretty much at the cash out, the server was debating why I didn't follow up with him and in my mind I was like ""uhhh, I know your dirty secret of how you cover things up so..."" pretty much it confirmed a lot of my experiences before at this location. 

Cherry On Top - They expected us to pay the entire bill when we only ate 1 dish out of the 3 that was ordered. Management didn't bother to offer to comp our meal, or offered anything for our bad experience.

WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION"
1,"So, I tried Jimmy's again. After ordering at the drive thru, I waited 8 minutes behind a car in front of me, and then another 8 minutes for my food once that car was gone. I ordered cracked corn, with extra cilantro, a malibu taco, blackened fish, no lettuce, and a standard taco with steak no lettuce. The corn had very little cilantro and was smothered in chili powder to the point I had to scrape it off to eat the corn. The fish in the malibu taco seemed like it was overcooked, or something as it was like mush.....gross!  The standard taco had half as much steak as the last time I got one. Inconsistency, and mediocre to bad food. I won't be back."
1,"Wow, order a part two weeks ago and they ship it back to the warehouse. Stay way, spend your money somewhere else."
1,"Negative stars if possible. The room smelled like an old ashtray. The check in process was awful. Equally or worse since I tried to call from the room to check like I usually do w most hotels, the line just kept ringing. I called multiple times only for the line to be picked up and hung up on.  I even tried my cellphone. There are a lot of hotels in Vegas, good deal or not try to avoid this place and save yourself the head ache."
1,"I took my sister here today for an upper lip wax. Customer service is terrible! Actually, there is NO customer service at all! The workers ignored us and yelled at us from the back asking what we needed. They took no care to wax properly. My sister had to return to get a second wax in order to ""fix"" the issues with the first wax. The spoke in another language the entire time and took no opportunity to greet us at all. They refused credit card as a form of payment and only accepted cash. I would not recommend this place and will never go back. Be warned."
1,"Unattentive service, poor attention to the food and not worth price.

Came here because we heard good reviews about it, decided to get a la carte for dinner instead of the AYCE, which is $21.99 plus tax. We got the dynamite roll and the diamond sushi set which were pricey. For ordering regular menu items, you'd think that the rolls would be a bit bigger and presented better, but they looked exactly like what you'd get if you were to get AYCE, and the dishes were sloppily put together, like someone just threw it on last minute. Like, really, are you kidding me? If I am paying more for the same thing I can get for AYCE, I'd expect larger portions and better presentations. The taste was nothing special, even the food court sushi down the street tastes better, and we paid like 2x the price. 

If we knew it was going to be like this, we would've gotten AYCE instead. The service was pretty below average too, besides taking our order and getting us water, they didn't come ask about the food or anything, even though the restaurant was kind of empty. Not to mention it was hard to wave someone down. 

Definitely better options in the area, I don't recommend this place."
1,"I dont understand why this place has high ratings. It's possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I got a wet shredded chicken burrito and it's terrible. The sauce is really gross. The chicken was cooked in tomato sauce, and the tortilla is way greasy. The rice that comes on the side is dry and has too much paprika, and the beans are... Whatever. They're canned beans. It's cheap ingredients with a terrible outcome. I didn't go inside so I can't talk about the customer service or location, but based on food alone, I'll never go back."
1,"I usually come here to see Ila for my threading needs. However, I needed to get threaded on a weekend, rather than during the week. I figured it's Sunday, and it may be crowded, but I won't have to wait long. Wrong. Took an HOUR to be seen because only ONE person was working. ONE. 

How do you only have one person on the weekend, a time when most folks are able to get such services? That is unacceptable. There should be at least two people available. Several people walked out because the wait was so long. May need to consider switching salons. ?"
1,"i was in Las Vegas for work and wanted to stay near my account , which was near the airport. I usually pick a Hilton property because I am a Diamond member. I greatly appreciated an early check in because i did not have to be at my account until later in the day. the day The night of the day i checked out i realized I had forgotten my Bose headphones. I immediately called the hotel and was told housekeeping was closed and there was no one to access the locked lost and found. They directed me to the voice mail which was full and wouldn't accept new messages. I called in the AM the next day and again was directed to a housekeeping phone with full messages. I asked to talk to a manager he took my name and number and said he would check Skip ahead to 1.5 weeks later and 2 manager calls( one went to voicemail) and still no response. Not sure why this hotel has such a disrespectful person managing but i suspect he would do a better job at a Dollar general. Would not recommend the hotel or inept manager."
1,I only come here when I have a short time to get a pedicure. everytime I come I remember why I hate this place. they are always yelling at each other non stop. I have a headache. it is so unprofessional
1,"Worst experience of my life. Went to get my nails done one evening and while the nail ""professional"" so to speak (her name is KIM) had finished cutting down my nails, I requested to have them shorter; apparently this request put me in a ""high maintenance"" category and she refused to work on completing my nails. She called herself a professional which she doesn't come close to. You can constantly hear them yelling at each other in Vietnamese and it makes you feel very uncomfortable during your entire experience. Kim's so called professionalism should be accounted for and I would not recommend this nail salon. I believe that if you are in the customer service industry and the customer is paying for a service, the custom has a right to request for what they want. I have worked in the service industry and I know what good service is.
The manager of this store let me know she would inform the owner but I highly doubt any action towards Kim has been accounted for.
IF I COULD GIVE THEM A NEGATIVE NUMBER THAT WOULD BE MY RATING FOR THIS NAIL SALON."
1,"Without a doubt the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had getting my nails done and I have faithfully gotten my nails done every 3 weeks for years at many different places. I waited a full 1 hour and 14 minutes (I timed it) even though I made an appointment; had no consultation with a super rude guy--seems to be second in charge next to the owner in the corner. My nails were uneven, bubbly and he cut me DEEPLY with a file. 2 weeks later I still have a scar. But don't worry, he put some glue on it and moved on. The color he chose looked nothing like the photo I showed him-- but he was in way too much of a rush and when I raised my concern he disagreed and continued on. I left with half manicured cuticles, cut finger, janky bubbly nails and $70 less than I came in with. Save yourself. DO NOT GO TO LOTUS."
1,"Is this company good to rent from or good to hire to manage your property?
I have no idea...they refuse to answer their phones or even return calls and/or emails. With that being said, I'm going to say probably not. 
If that's how they conduct their business right off the bat, it's a wonder how they're even still in business at all.
I've called/emailed 3 times now. I'm done. I'll find a home to rent from another company. 
Just want to say thanks for helping me make the right decision to NOT use you in my home search!!!

Update and response to their comment:
The home was found using the Zillow site. The contact info on the Zillow site was (480)696-6776. I tried to call using the number listed on there. If it's wrong, why are you providing that number to Zillow as a means to have people contact you?? And the number actually isn't completely wrong on Zillow because I get a voicemail message stating that I have indeed reached On Q Property Management and to leave a message and someone will call back...*Spoiler Alert* No one calls back. And I left 2 messages on 2 separate occasions.
After not reaching anyone by phone, I went back to Zillow and filled out the ""Contact Property Management"" section and sent it off. Still no contact back.
THEN (and this was the last straw) I went to your website, searched rentals, found the home, and attempted to contact you THROUGH YOUR OWN WEBSITE by clicking ""Contact Agent""...again...No response."
1,"This place is beyond horrible. If I could give them a zero I would. Me, my friend and my 2 girls came in for a pedicure and manicure. My girls where looking at polish and one of the walked to my girls and snatched the polish away while me and my friend was prepping to get a pedicure. We walked over to start the pedicure and the bowls where dirty and we asked them where they going to clean them. The lady yelled and said you have to wait then angrily. Why would you want to force your customers to put their feet in dirty bacteria. I will never come to this place again."
1,"My flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas took one hour and 15 minutes. The wait for the ""complimentary airport shuttle"" took about one hour. The hotel is three miles from the airport. The excuse from the front desk? Bad traffic. So, I checked the traffic between the hotel and the airport on Google Maps. There were no unusual delays.

After the shuttle, a minivan, finally showed up, the driver, Rodrigo, told me that he just does what the hotel tells him to do. I asked where he was for the past hour. His response, ""I don't know."" Seriously?!?! After he loaded our bags and we boarded the minivan, he pulled away with the rear door wide open. And, SURPRISE, there were no traffic delays, NONE AT ALL, in either direction on the roads; no construction and no accidents.

I really don't appreciate a hotel staff that lies, specifically, the front desk and Rodrigo.

The room better be PERFECT."
1,"Let me start by saying it takes a lot to make me want to write a negative review as I understand no business is perfect. 

However, after my experience with Auto Tint Express, I feel compelled to put out a buyer beware review on them. This company is the classic example of ""Bait and Switch"" which happens to be against the law. 

If you call to get a quote, they will quote you a very fair price, but not let you know the price they are quoting is for the poorest of poor quality and even when you ask on the phone if this a low level tint film and if there are any hidden fees, they will not tell you the truth. Once they bait you into coming down to their location is when the switch begins. Suddenly they have 4 different levels of tint which of course is common in the industry and perfectly fine, but the prices increase dramatically and unfairly. Not to mention they will tell you that the initial quoted price will not be guaranteed, will not last and is of very poor quality.  

When I mentioned they tried the classic bait and switch technique on me and that it is against the law, he looked at me like I had lost my mind. I suggested they stop utilizing this very disturbing technique and he still looked at me like I am crazy and blamed the owner.

I will say that the tinting area was very clean and they did have a lot of availability which probably stems from lack of business due to their shady business practices. 

Again, buyer beware of this extremely low-class, shady (For lack of a better term) business.

EDIT: I want to add that Jose whom I am assuming is the owner has been nothing but classy and professional since he received my review. He has contacted me, apologized and has had proper communication. For my profession I am the VP of Sales for a large company and the sign of a business that wants to improve are the ones that reach out to the negative reviews and attempt to rectify the matter and learn from it. That is what Jose has done, so for that, I am impressed."
1,"Spent 10 days here. Service was rather sparse. We had to empty garbage, towels into hallway for pick up each day, as directed . Then request new towels from front desk. Only I once they came and did up the room. I don't expect it daily on a 10 day stay, but the could check to see what one needs. My husband is partially disabled and I requested a soft chair for the room and was denied. That would have helped immensely. We asked for a upgrade as the place as almost empty during the week and that was denied. I would not recommend this to anyone. We are seasoned travelers, been on the road 6 weeks now and this was the worst. Yes rooms ok but that's it."
1,"Acarei rude employee at Denny's 
I called dennys at 3:07 this morning and Acarei took my order, 3 moons over my hammy, egg whites, turkey instead of ham, no cheese on one, add avocado and mushrooms to all sandwiches, HASHBROWNS for all and 2 orders of fruit. She asked if I'd been to this dennys before because they don't have mushrooms at this dennys, I said yes you do, I always order from this location with Joe and ruby I'm a regular here. She states she's been working here for 7 months and doesn't think they have mushrooms, then she states she cannot find the mushroom add on button. She finally finds it.... I arrive at the restaurant, My food finally comes out after 20 minutes. I always double check my food, there was no egg whites on any of the sandwiches, and no avocado! The girl proceeded to roll her eyes at me and take the food and slam it into the garbage! I asked for a refund when I witnessed her horrible attitude! I worked all day and just finished moving, I don't need attitude from anyone who's helping prepare my food. This person had no idea how to do a CASH REFUND(give the money back duh)she had to call and wake the manager up(there was no manager or supervisor there on duty)from his sleep and he had to walk her through step by step on how to do a refund! Will never go back to this dennys again!! Better training definitely needs to be implemented at this establishment! Did not want to give any stars but could not post review without giving at least 1 star."
1,"Wanted to enjoy a nice Sunday brunch and get the deal of a steal at Denny's $5.99 you get two of each pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs. 

We arrive and we're not acknowledged and finally when we were hostess asks are you waiting to be seating? Strike One. My husband politely says yes and I say I'm not standing here for nothing. He asks for a booth young lady ""yes theirs booths, follow me"" then says wait. Umm sorry not booths but we have a middle table. ME: no we'll wait. 
After 10 minutes we get called for a booth. We walk over and a teenager has her feet on the seats just hanging out, Strike two. So we are finally seated after the young lady decides to move. Sadly her and parents had manners as not even her parents told her to move out the way. But whatever. . Server comes right away to get our drink order. Comes back takes our order got two of the specials and she starts to walk off. Me: I'm sorry does it come with toast? She says no and starts to walk away I say can I place an order of toast/white. Server: oh okay. At that point I tell my husband $5 bucks that toast won't come with my meal. Strike Three: Meals arrive pretty quickly. Less then 5 minutes. And would you know it. No toast. Young says anything else. I say just waiting on my toast. She looks at check and walks away. I end up waiting 10 minutes food got cold until we see our server and ask for toast. 
Food: Even though my food got cold their food is always yummy. Never a complaint from me on their food. Denny's always has great food. 
Unfortunately their service needs working on. We normally go to the Denny's on Las Vegas Blvd.  but my husband wanted to visit this one as their service is good. Hah obviously that has changed. 
Hopefully they can get better servers and host. You lady who doesn't do the register should at least be professional and let customers know waiting to pay that someone will be with them shorty"
1,"The worst pedicure and guest service I have ever experienced. My pedicure was only 15 minutes long I was charged $30 the A/C was clearly not to a comfortable setting and the chairs were gross, old and dirty. The manager lady who checked me out threw the receipt and slammed down the pen for me to sign. Then she started rudely started yelling something out in her language. I will never return to this place again nor would I recommend this place to anyone."
1,"I wish I could give zero stars. WORST pedicure of my life. Since I declined an extra upcharge for callus remover she decided my pedicure was over. It literally took 15 minutes. Quickest pedicure and worst, of my entire life. Will never return!"
1,"Similar to other lower quality AYCE places, this sushi place will not provide quality.
I ordered a green salad, Red dragon role, butter fish and salmon Sashimi, edamame and some tempura. The only thing that truly surprised me this time was the green salad! Cause it only consisted of lettuce and dressing. The rolls were miniature rolls as seen in the pic. I would definitely not visit again and don't recommend wasting $20.99 on a weekday for dinner. Once I find a good AYCE sushi would definitely post the review.
And last but certainly not least the salmon teriyaki that was suppose to be belly was a fin plus lil bit of meat left on it"
1,"I made an online reservation 2 weeks before our arrival. Check in was 4pm and check out will be 10am the next day. We arrived around 8pm and they made us wait for more than 30 minutes for our room. Apparently online reservation doesn't get any priority in room reservation but instead, they prioritized those ones that walks in to their hotel first. I find it very upsetting after paying ahead for online reservation, coming into this hotel without any available room at all."
1,"Update 3-26-18 So maybe my headline was a little harsh, but I was extremely upset and extremely disappointed and Frankly, I just tell it the way it is. I have since received a defensive message from the server, (which I thought was a little tacky), but at least I know they're reading the reviews. I only hope they can take customers reviews into consideration to help improve their business. Maybe instead of taking offense of my review, both the server and the owner could've asked the question, what can we do to make our customers experience more enjoyable? Sometimes a little constructive criticism from the people who actually spend money at your establishment is the best feedback of all. You have created an incredible atmosphere and a wonderful space. With just a few minor improvements, your establishment could be five stars, and be packed every night with happy customers.


Voted the absolute worst chicken wings in Charlotte!!!! HUGE disappointment!  For a restaurant that specializes in chicken, you think the food would be delicious. The wings are the tiniest chicken wings I ever had, with absolutely no sauce, and they only served six tiny little wings and two pieces of carrots for nine dollars. I have a 100% success rate of calling out businesses that are going to fail, and unfortunately this is going to be one of them. Even the service was bad. I ordered three extra blue cheese and when my order came there was 1 ranch on the plate?? No napkins on the table ( all of the bins were not refilled, on any table) and the upstairs bar tender was to busy texting on her phone instead of helping us...

I am going to anonymously give them another shot. If my second experience is better than my first, I will update my review and delete the old one and let everybody know the outcome."
1,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. The menu of services is drool worthy. The decor and style is by far the most professional in Madison. Similar to a big city nail bar feel. However, that's the end of my review. They advertise walk-ins but I've never been able to walk-in. Ive been completely ignored to this last time they said I'd have to wait and I said no problem, how long? The women literally stopped talking to me and turned away. I wish thier customer service reflected the level of energy they put into creating the atmosphere and decor."

1,"I've been getting take-out regularly during the day but decided to stop in on my way home the other night. When I entered, one of the two employees present was taking out the trash, he stopped what he was doing and followed me to the counter to take my order and payment. He then proceeded to prepare my take-out order without washing his hands. He not only handled my food but contaminated the food in the containers by just reaching in. Needless to say I was totally disgusted and threw the food away as soon as I got home. I didn't say anything while still there because I was the only customer at the time. I called today to speak with the manager, he apologized but then made some comments which led me to think he didn't believe me. I will never step foot back in this place!"
1,"One of the rudest manager I met that works here. He would give attitude to everyone even to his own employees. I never got his name, but he was a very old man. He was rude from the start of asking how many we were. We were trying to pay and then he just continued to give the worse attitude to everyone he spoke to. He deserves to be gone with his represents the place."
1,"I will give it a zero! Dont come to this place . It sucks. The staff is very rude and they are always observing what people do in scary way. ( mean looks) .It is definately not a comfortable place to eat . I felt like i was in a zoo. The waitress takes your plates away when you are still eating, they add their own tip which is about 15% with the bill plus when you are paying with a credit/debit card the machine asks you to give another tip. They make us pay double tip when they gave us the most terrifying and bad service."
1,"You get what you pay for here. $12 threading sounded great but left me HIGHLY disappointed. Twenty four hours later and my eyebrows still hurt, and I have multiple red cuts. When she showed me my eyebrows, there were multiple, obvious hairs still present. No soothing aloe or attempt to fix my eyebrows when finished. Worst eyebrow experience I've ever had!"
1,"My one star review is purely on customer service. The rooms were clean, and comfortable. They do try to deceive you online with their sister resort that has all the amazing amentities, which has the same name but located at the bottom of the strip. Now let's get back to it. Check in is not until 4pm, but they guaranteed a spot by 1pm if we early check in. Not only did we have to wait till 4pm, but they kept telling us in 30min, in a hour Oh not much longer. It took them 3 hours not to clean the room, but to inspect it?? Even if it does take that long check out is horrible as well. I had a late flight and asked to stay in a little later (checkout is 10am!) Which I figured shouldn't be an issue since check in isn't till 4pm. They said you can extend till 1pm for an extra cost, or stay an extra hour as a courtesy. They called me back an hour later to tell me management said I cannot do either. I apologize for the long review but when you and your wife are about to get married and you asked for an early room to prepare and they say yes and then drag you on until 4pm is a bit stressful"

And damn well rude ass staff as well - they can all s@uck it ..."
1,This place was absolutely horrible.  The rooms are the only thing nice about this hotel.  The showers only had luke warm water.  The clerks were not friendly or helpful.  We were told we could check in early but they wouldn't let us check in until 4 despite being there for 4 hours previously.  I would not stay again.
1,Deplorable customer service. Wrong product was delivered after sales person lied and said product was available. Instead tried to sneak in a similar but much lower rates appliance and then hung up when confronted with what he had done. Came into the store to have the issue resolved and he avoided any kind of service. Took care of people that came in after to avoid addressing and righting his shady service. Supposedly a new (and correct) product is going to be delivered. So disappointing.
1,"Customer Service is not a priority for On the Q. I tried to contact them by all means for two weeks!! I receive updates from various websites on our specific location due to the high desire of the community. I was very excited to see a home come available on our price range as well. I contacted them daily and didn't receive a response until today which was via text. I asked in every message and email that was left to please CALL me ASAP because I was very interested. The text was unprofessional. If I'm requesting a call back, that's how I should be contacted. Point blank. The house is no longer available and time was wasted attempting to contact this business."
1,"I went here after drastically searching for a color specialist when my normal place was unavailable for my engagement shoot. I even did a consult with her a week prior to my appt. I mentioned that I recently cut my hair and wanted to use hair extensions for the photo session as well as dye my hair lighter (which i do routinely every 3 months). She told me go get specifically the extensions that would be able to be colored just in case the color didn't match and that she would be able to do everything I mentioned. I show up a week later with my $150 extensions, she colors my hair, proceeds to start styling and says she won't have time to do the extensions. Not only that, but tells me this after she opened the box and took them out (making them non returnable). She tried to curl my hair but I don't even know what you would call it... it was an absolute mess and there was nothing I could do about it being my photo shoot was right after. One side of my hair in all of my pictures is awkwardly curled and the other side completed fell out and looked like I had slept on it. I won't be going back here... it's so hard to find someone you can trust and I spent hours looking for the right person and even did a consult! Just to be disappointed."
1,"My daughter and I stopped in for pedicures yesterday while waiting on my boyfriend and son to be done at the movies. HORRIBLE experience. First, this establishment is super in need of a facelift. It just looked grungy. Chairs in poor repair, etc. I was sat in a chair where the massage didn't even work. When I mentioned it she said, ""Well do you want to move?"" Yes, of course. Isn't the massage part of the cost of the pedi? She acted like it was a problem to move me to another chair. LIke she was miffed or something. Whatever. My daughter had shown a pic to her girl with the design she wanted. Pretty simple...big toe white with black chevron stripes and the rest of the toes hot pink. She is 13. They got started on her pedi. For whatever reason my daughter did not want the softening of her feet done...like the scrubbing, so asked her to stop. After confirming with my daughter I said, ""That' okay, just do a toe paint for her."" They, again, seemed super miffed. Well, sorry. I then hear my daughter say, ""Oh, no that toe is white with black stripes."" The lady literally YELLED at her saying, ""WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME BEFORE I PAINTED IT PINK?!?!"" Well sorry she wasn't staring at you the entire time. She had shown a pic of what she wanted and thought you understood the simple design. I said, ""Whoa! Don't yell at her, she is a child!"" Addressing my daughter asked what she wanted so I could intervene. We should have stood up and walked out then. The girl then was rough grabbing her foot, etc. Which I didn't know until my daughter told me after or we really would have had a problem. Anyway, so she gets done with the paint job on my daughter (pic attached) and it was really really bad. LIke my 10 year old son could have done a better job. My daughter came over to my chair with tears in her eyes. I asked her to show me her toes. I was like...no these need to be redone. Again, they acted like it was a huge deal or that we were a problem. Another girl did repaint her toes and they did look much better, but after my daughter had been yelled at and handled roughly. So, we go to pay. She says mine is $32 plus $5 for design. Totally fine. My daughter, who had stared to get a pedi, but then decided on just a nail paint was $20 then $5 for design. Um...what? Shouldn't we just be charged for a nail paint? They argued, no since they had trimmed her cuticles So I'm paying $25 for a cuticle trim and paint?! Well then she should have gotten the massage and everything else included with the full price of a pedi, which she did not get. I tired to explain this to them and, again, they got loud and tried to say it was our fault. They then offered me a $5 discount. Giving us her design ""for free"". Wow. Instead of $57 they charged me $52 then made a big deal about how they were fixing it. No, it didn't fix anything and we'll never be back. Please do not go to this shop and I wish I had read reviews before we chose to come."
1,"I have a hard time even getting my head around how disrespectful and unfair the customer service is at this location.  After researching consumer reports I found the washing machine I wanted in the storeroom for a very reasonable price.  I paid to have the machine installed the next day and for my old machine to be removed.  My wife and I left for vacation the following day and when we returned several weeks later to use our new machine my wife noticed it was missing some of the key functions she wanted to use.  (mostly steam).  I checked the model number of the machine and realized it was an earlier version than the one I had seen in the store and had paid for.  (Reciept confirmed we had paid for the machine I had wanted model number wf45k6500aw but the one they had delivered was wf45k6200aw)  After several attempts I was able to get a hold manager Larry  and explained the mix up.  Larry stated that the 500 model sells for several hundred dollars more.   No apology or refund was offered and no reasonable solution to their mistake was given.  Larry told me that he would give me the 500 model if I paid 200 dollars more on top of what I had already paid.  To add insult to injury he insisted that I would also have to pay shipping and handling fee's to have the old appliance removed and the new one delivered If I were to use that option.  Larry refused to discuss the issue any further at this point and began treating my concern very dismissively.

Receiving an inferior product to the one you paid for is fraud plain and simple."
1,Bad experience from the start-I walked in for a scheduled appointment for my friend and I to get manicures. The lady at the front insisted I get gel nails and I had to repeatedly tell her I just wanted a regular manicure. The nail color selection is terrible - there's maybe 10 different colors to choose from? They tried to sit my friend and I apart from each other (even though I scheduled an appointment for both of us) and they were clearly irritated when I asked we be moved together. The lady working on my nails was rude and didn't seem to have the skills to successfully complete a basic manicure. I will never go back. I advise you save your money and go to the next salon down the street.
1,"If i could give this place 0 stars i so would. They have such poor customer service. The lady at the front desk (old Asain lady, her name was like Oferiyza or something like that) was extremely unhelpful and very rude. I was trying to get information on the shuttle and she was not even trying to help and answer my questions. I've spent over $600 to spend the weekend here & i am extremely disappointed in how I was being talked to & treated. I didn't pay to get treated disrespectfully. I've worked customer service my whole life and i have never spoke to a single customer the way she spoke to me. At least attempt to help or make it seem as if you are trying. Extremely unhappy and dissatisfied. And to top it off, it's only the first day here of the whole weekend."
1,"Worst place ever the only good thing was the cold corona. Rude service had to open my own beer. No meat in our beef taco, cheese in the enchilada was not even melted! Chorizo burrito bland and tasteless! My advice never go there."
1,"Don't know what happened but no longer Todd English Pub but the Pub. Less good service, less good beer selection. Waited 20 minutes for my happy hour food, a hot dog. Twenty minutes... a hot dog.  Indifferent bartenders, pleasant,  but that doesn't make for an enjoyable experience. Sad. Used to be a great  bar."
1,"if you're looking for nail ladies with bad attitudes, this is the place to go. it's obvious that if you're paying for something you want to get what you want and how you asked for it but here, no, they will roll eyes and throw attitude if you budge to correct them. terrible service and for what you get, not even worth the price. I got gel fills and it was 27 dollars but save your money and just go to the one inside Walmart across the way"
1,"We came in on Saturday at 11:00a and asked if we could have an early check-in and was denied... we were told that possibly we could be in the room by 3:00p (since I need to get ready for my Wedding). We ended up not getting into the rooms till the check in at 4:00p... which okay.. understandable!

However, one of our rooms bathtubs jets didn't work, had a lot of mold inside the jet areas and surrounding the rings to them. The pull out bed from the couch was broken at the end... when we went swimming we found out that another couple had come in same day at 2:00p and received an early check in before 3:00p?!?!? The pool maintenance gentleman said he was cleaning the pools and left (never seen him after that... we were in the hot tub for a long time). 

We requested a late checkout and was told YES by the lady at the front desk and when I called and confirmed later that night (agreeing to pay extra) I was denied and told I would be charge full price and tax if we weren't out by 10:00a (what hotel kicks you out that early?!?) 

The towels were not completely washed because when I unfolded one of them it had really sketchy streaks on it.."
1,"I think their prices are kinda high and that's me coming from Costa Mesa California. $72 for a pedicure and a fill. $32 for the mid grade pedicure and $10 for the special  nail polish they keep in the back. But the problem was the fill. It is suppose to be $17.00 But Tom charged me an extra $10.00 for the ""special"" gel white polish without asking me if I wanted to pay more. The regular white would have been fine. Then he proceeds to tell me ""that it will last longer"".
Anyone that gets their nails done knows that the Gel top coat is used to keep the polish longer. So the White polish for a extra $10.00 wasn't needed. Then they charge me $3.00 more for the design of the white tip. Which wasn't a design it's a French Tip. Will not be back. Does a good job, but not good enough to be overcharged."
1,"What.is.happening. Perhaps I should've read deeper into the reviews before making my choice tonight. This place is a copy of Viva Chicken, but yet, not Viva Chicken. Exact idea though. Half avocado, street corn pudding, mashed potatoes were my choices tonight.  And sweet tea.  The girl behind the counter was so nice and she was the star of the evening!! I thank her for her outstanding customer service.  

After ordering my food, the rudest person in the universe came to bring it out, she brought the wrong order and tried to dispute that it was wrong..huh? I know what I just paid and asked for. Thank you. The sweet tea was gross so I asked her if they had or could make more and she was so unfriendly...basically saying no...& walking away without offering to help. I don't understand why she even works there. She shouldn't.

The nice girl brought our order out finally and also fixed up the tea for me.  It tasted a lot better.  The manager also came out to check up and she was really nice too. 

The food was not my favorite.  The avocado was good. The corn was not what I expected. It was like corn soufflé only not sweet and basically flavorless.  Mashed potatoes were ok. The beans that my friend had were meh. 

Overall...not thrilled, no desire to venture back. I wouldn't recommend nor go out of my way. Try at your own risk."
1,Woman did not even turn around to hand me take out food and continued to talk to colleagues.
1,"I didn't like at all my experience there, the service was really shitty, the waitresses looked like they ran out of fucks to give, after ordering my order took a reeeeeally long time to come and when it came the rice in the sushi was warm! 

After sitting down the atmosphere was so not welcoming I wanted to go away immediately but I stayed and even than, after the order came I could only think about eating the faster I could so I can go away 

TBH besides the ward rice the food was not that bad but the atmosphere was so heavy I would not want to go back"
1,"My family and I went here for dinner tonight. We have gone to many hibachi restaurants. First it took the waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge us and ask for drinks. We were in the hibachi section and there was 5 of us. We were sat in the middle of both grills. My mom and son got the best few of the cook. The cook cooked for the family of 5 next to us plus us. So we didn't even get a show. Just his back. 

Our soup was cold, our fried rice was burnt, all of us had shrimp it was over cooked. The waiter never came to check to see if we needed more to drink. The vegetables were ok, the steak had no flavor. Again the waiter was no where around except to bring the bill, he remember the receipt and left
My husband credit card in the machine. I never criticize but this place was just not worth the money. When there are other  Hibachi restaurants with better serve and food! Don't waste your money."
1,"Worst service ever. Not only did they not show up at the time frame they provided, but they didn't bother to call and let me know they were running hours late. When I called them to confirm they were still coming the delivery driver Elliot  started yelling at me. I called the store and they kept me on hold for a while.. the sales man who assisted me, Alan said sorry they're a third party company and there's nothing I can do... ask for manager and they said he wasn't available until the next week..after giving them 2 additional hours to show up no one ever did. I called to get a refund and requested a confirmation but was told they would not do my refund until tomorrow when they had the washer and dryer in their possession.. are you kidding. They refused to send me any confirmation via email even after requesting it twice. Buyers be aware! Do not buy from here. Poor service, their low prices do not make up for the horrible service. Very sad and disappointed."
1,Giving a one star due to the fact that my order was 9 bucks. No biggies however I have 20 bucks. Told server right after I ordered here's 20. So u will have a 100 percent tip. She was nice. However didn't come check on me one time. And didn't even say thank you. So let's just say I will now be the avg tipper. Which means in less then 10 bucks. I will give 2 dollars. That's 20 percent. Shame on these people today. Seriously. I was a servers in my teens many years ago and busted my butt for back then 10 percent. To get 100 percent tip these days is beyond rare. Food was fine but it's the principle of not checking on me and not thanking me. #rude #dennys #wow
1,"Other than the speed at which the food came out at, it is not good. Sushi was stale. Shrimp tempura in dynamite roll did not taste fresh and the rolls are very small."
1,"We were seated in a hibachi room, upon sitting down a mouse climbed up my sons chair. We shooed it away then it would not leave. We informed the staff and left. 

Will never return."
1,"Just went there for the first time yesterday and will never be going back.  We made appointments a week in advance (mani and pedi for 3), in the first half hour, one of us had our manis completed and the other two were still waiting. My mani was half finished before they made us go back for pedis (even after stressing we were here to celebrate a birthday and we wanted to stay together). Pedis were ok, but I had to finish my mani while sitting in the pedi chair.  My mani was not good, I felt both ladies were rushed, the paint wasn't spread even and there are air bubbles on a couple of the nails.  The lady doing the manis was rude to both my friends.  I felt like we were in there much longer than we should have been, especially since we had reservations.  I would not recommend this place, Madison had other much better options."
1,"The warranty company Spencer's uses is horrible!  Spencer's does not back up the appliances they sell with a dependable company, which is Centurian.  We have had problems with our washer for over 3 months and have had someone from Goldwing Appliances ( through Centurian Home Shield) at our home either to repair or diagnose 6 times in the past 3 months.  It is still leaking and sounds like a jet engine.  I just received a phone call and was told someone would need to come out again to diagnose again!  We have an extended warranty.  The woman I just talked to they would continue to try to repair it until it costs more for repairs than to replace it!  Entire days are wasted!  The only plus is that the repairman who comes to work on it is very kind and thinks it is fixed when he leaves."
1,"They charge 15% gratuity. That is very annoying and unfair. 

It makes it difficult to be cheap."
1,"I  used  them   to  manage  one  of  my  properties  and  thought  that  they  would  save  me  some  trouble  for  the  $ 80,-  a  month  that  I  paid  them.   Their  service  is  a  total  joke,  it  appears  that  the  only  thing  they  care  about  is  their   money.   They  would  not  even  care  to  inform  me  when  my  property  manager  left  the  company  and  when  the  tenant  moved  out  they  sent  their  handyman  company  to  give  an  estimate  for  the  necessary  repairs.   The   estimate  was  far  beyond  the  tenant's   deposit  and  totally  unreasonable.  It  was  also  a  mix up  of  repairs  for  which  the  tenant  was  responsible  and  other  services  not  related  to  damages  caused  by  the  tenant.    For  example: $ 150  for  a  broken  plastic  control  knob  on the  dryer  which  I  ordered  for  $ 5,-   from  Ebay.   I   did  not  use  their  handyman  company  to  mitigate  the  damages  and  at  that  point  On Q   refused to  communicate  with  me. 

  No  response  to  emails  or  faxes.   I   called  several  times  and  received  the  message  ""Everybody  is  in  a  meeting,  someone  will   call  you  back""  at  any  given  time.  (of  course,  that  never  happened....).

Until   now,  (several  month's   after  the  tenant  moved out)   I  never  received  a  statement  showing  what   they  did   with  the  tenant's   deposit.  Stay  away  from  this  company."
1,"We visited last Saturday night.  I have wanted to come here since I was a kid, always found the building to be intriguing.  Complimentary valet parking was nice, and the interior of the restaurant is really cool.  It's so old school, but remarkable with the carved wood and stained glass everywhere.  The lights were too bright though.  Reminded me of a well lit cafeteria.  

The service was OK.  It was weird how they were either all over us (rushing us, at certain points) or they were completely...gone.  The service, after we received our mains, was all of a sudden realllllly slow.   And then it became unbearably hot in there.  It wasn't just me, all four of us were actually sweating.  It just got hotter and hotter...

I liked the relish tray.  The bread was really delicious and the pickles were nice and sharp.  I was insulted by the price of the caesar salad, so I didn't order it.  The profit margin on a caesar salad is already ridiculous, but they think they can charge $17.95 a person?  For lettuce, egg, parmesan and half an anchovy?  Ha, no.  Instead I had a caprese salad that was chincy on the cheese, had only 6 tomato slices and with 2 drops (literally) of balsamic.  I'm pretty sure it was like $20.  Probably should have just ordered the caesar..

I then had a $60 steak that was honestly delicious.  it was cooked perfectly, well seasoned and juicy.  It arrived on a plate with two ugly, gray, wrinkly mushrooms.  Before I could inquire about my potatoes, they arrived on a side plate.  Ice-cream-scooped style.  Just like a cafeteria!  I inquired as to the whereabouts of my vegetables and was informed that veg is extra $..  I said fine and they brought me 3 pieces of broccoli and 6 carrots.  They were tasty and buttery.  May have been frozen. 

Basically, this place is a rip off.  The prices are atrocious.  And believe me, I knew the prices were high before I went there and  I honestly didn't care b/c I assumed the food was good.  And while the steak was good, the rest of the food was laughable.  

This steakhouse is almost identical in menu, same relish tray, same room decor as Peter's in Markham.  Only, Peter's is such a better value and the food is WAY better.  I think I will stick with Peter's."
1,"Very disappointed.  The pricing is an issue.  I feel I vastly overpaid, far more than I expected to, and I am not at all happy with the cut.  I brought a photo of what I had in mind and ended up with a quick ""chop job"" since many customers were being serviced by this stylist.  I felt the stylist was ""under pressure"" to get the business done-- get 'em in the chair and get 'em out.  There was no massage with the shampoo.  When I was brought back to the station for the cut, there was hair all over the floor from previous clients.  I was ""sold"" to buy product and ""pushed"" to have a consult with the makeup artist.  Will not return.  The very next day I scheduled an appointment with another salon to ""fix"" what has happened.  To reiterate, I was waaaay overcharged for a single process color and simple cut.  Maybe people are too kind to write a negative review, but this is nowhere near a salon; it's a beauty shop trying to be a salon.  Perhaps if you've been doing your own hair at home it seems okay, but if you are used to internationally trained stylists who keep up their training, this is not the place.  Just look at the way the stylists are wearing their own hair!  I feel I've been ""ripped off.""  I regret I trusted the Yelp reviews."
1,I got a pedicure here and it was the worst I have had in my entire life. It also was not very sanitary from what I could tell. They don't use a new sterile set of tools so who knows if they have even been disinfected. Also used a reused nail file and callus scrubber. Just overall a disgusting experience. When she painted my toes the color was so choppy and looked like a 3 year old painted them. Will not be returning.
1,"On Q has been withholding my property from me for 35 days as of 8/24/17.

July 21: I email my property manager, Rebeccah Arnett asking if they changed the locks to the main storage unit door without notifying me. 

Rebeccah confirms that they changed the locks and tells me she will mail me a new key.

July 25: I speak to Levi Hatch about scheduling my move out inspection for 2 pm on Friday, August 4.

July 31: I notify Rebeccah that I have not received the key in the mail.

August 1: Rebeccah tells me that she'll mail me ""another copy"".

August 4: I get the key in the mail, but it is the wrong key. 

I notify Rebeccah and Levi Hatch, who coordinates move out inspections, that I will be at the apartment for the move out inspection at 2 pm.

In her response, Rebeccah tells me that the key she sent me is the only key they have on file and clarifies that the key to my personal storage unit is the same key to my apartment.

I arrive at the apartment at 2 pm for the move out inspection and stay until 2:45 pm before returning to work. The inspector never shows.

August 7: I email Rebeccah asking her to please mail me the correct key ASAP.

Rebeccah promptly replies and schedule a new move out inspection for the next day with a new inspector.

August 8: The inspector brings THE SAME BAD KEY to the move out inspection. He calls Rebeccah, who tells him that she needs to get in touch with the locksmith to figure things out. 

I turn over all of my keys but keep one apartment key, so I can get my stuff out of my personal storage unit. The inspector and I make sure that the key works in my apartment door.

August 14: I email Rebeccah asking if she has been able to get in touch with the locksmith.

She tells me that they have been ""working on getting a key for the storage room"" by ""trying to get a copy from one of the resident's that does have a key."" 

August 15: Rebeccah emails me at 8:39 am to tell me that the tenant in unit 5 has the right key and he'll be around until 1 pm if I want to go get it from him.

I have a job, so I can't make it. I notify Rebeccah. 

Rebeccah emails me and tells me, ""We had a key left in a Home Depot bag under the steps."" (In downtown Phoenix!)

August 16: I retrieve the key in the Home Depot bag. It works. But the key to my personal storage unit does not.

August 17: I notify Rebeccah.

August 18: Rebeccah suggests that I kept the wrong key and states that there are two separate keys for the apartment door and security door even though I lived there for seven months and only used one key to open both doors and dear god why does it even matter at this point I just want my shit.

I suggest that they need a new locksmith, explain that I only kept one key on my key chain and that it opened both doors and either way, I need a key to my personal storage unit.

August 22: I email Rebeccah telling her that I'm getting worried and don't want to call a locksmith or my attorney.

That was two days ago.

No word from Rebeccah or On Q. 

Also, they stacked the dryer on top of the washer without properly securing it and did not respond to multiple requests to fix it. I'm 5'3'', 110 lbs and do not want to go out in my closet via death by dryer."
1,Well we just left there 8:20 pm on 2/24/2017. We walked in. The one person working the counter burly noticed us. Said he will bring menus to us in a moment. 20 minutes later still no menus. So we get up to leave. The guys says did you want anything to eat. My husband says well you seem to busy closing the restaurant to wait on customers. He said ok great then have a great night. Even though they don't close till 9:00 pm he locked the door after we left. Ummm really? I have only been there on other time it wasn't that great. Not sure I will be back especially if service is that bad. I do not recommend this place.
1,"Disappointed! This is one of our go to places for a decent Mexican food on the go. The crispy chicken tacos were ice cold! The shells were stale too! I will not be coming back anytime soon, used to come frequently."
1,"Lunch menu is advertised outside as all you can eat $12.99. 
We sat down at 3:30pm. Although the service was ok we were served the dinner menu without being told so and when this was brought to the attention of the waitress at the end of the meal, she informed us that last call was at 2:30pm... Not sure how we're supposed to guess. We offered her a chance to correct the situation and get the manager but she preferred to refer us to the fine print on the menu."
1,"Ouch! I had a painful manicure experience! She was so rough, I left bleeding! She also just wiped off the tools she used on me and stuck them back in the case. Yikes. She seemed to be in such a hurry, yet there was only two other customers in there (and probably six employees). I was not impressed and would never return."
1,Repairman came to fix the ceiling and management company had  not informed him that he needed containment to accomplish the repairs properly.  House inspector was here at the time and assured me that the problems would be immediately addressed.  Just got off the phone with a manager who said that they had seen my earlier review --- maybe that is why they are now dragging their feet?? Still waiting for ceiling to be fixed and mold removed properly.
1,"Our issues with On Q Property Management started early on. When we moved into our rental home it was dirty and I had to clean before we moved in because there was a lot of dust build-up from the last time it had been cleaned. There were also a number of carpet stains. I contacted the property manager to let him know and he claimed it had been cleaned twice and that he had receipts for it. He did say they were aware of the carpet stain. I took 92 pictures before we moved in to the home to show the dirt, wall scuffs and stained carpet and sent the property manager the link early on with our move-in form and he confirmed receipt. While we lived there, the owner's pool maintenance company allowed the pool to turn green for several weeks. We didn't have a choice in the pool company because it was included in the rent. We even offered to have the rent lowered and then we would pay for a new maintenance company so we wouldn't have these issues. The owner did take action and hired a new company. The pool needed to be drained and refilled to turn it back to a salt-water pool and they did a lot of work to it. We incurred around $400 in extra utilities for water and electric because of this and the property manager refused to reimburse us because utilities are a tenant expense.  We felt this was extremely unfair because we didn't have the choice of Pool Company. When it came time to move out, we had the home professionally cleaned and then went over it again to make sure it was in good shape. We even cleaned some of the wall scuffs that were there before we moved in so it would look better for the next tenants. We also had the carpets cleaned professionally and provided receipts. When it came time for our move out inspection, I showed up because I thought we would be going through the move-out form together so we can point out what was there before vs. now. The inspector told me that I didn't need to be there and that he was only there to take pictures to give back to the property manager so they can make a determination. When we got our security deposit back they took out over $600 to pay for light cleaning and extra carpet cleaning plus a few light bulbs. We provided them a receipt for one of the bulbs we purchased, but it blew out right when we installed it. The other two bulbs were out when we moved in. We responded by certified mail with the before pictures and asked to see the move out photos the inspector took and the comparison photos from after they cleaned so we can compare. We received a letter back saying that they refunded us for one light bulb, but consider the cleaning charges final, which did not include the photos we requested. If somebody does not contact us back to refund our money immediately, we will be taking it to small claims court and will also be suing for the utilities we incurred that we had no control over due to the pool issues."
1,"I'm a truly disappointed customer. I showed my stylist the ideal hair color I wanted and she tried to make me change my mind to just get highlights when I really wanted a balayage. She seemed like she was in a hurry but I don't understand why.. I booked an appointment with Shine Salon. If you couldn't fit me in then please let me know! 

I told her if she can't get me to the level I wanted on the balayage then its fine. Then I showed her the second picture that I wanted. All over brown and highlighted with blonde. I told her ""This is what I want"" She didn't ask much questions and she made it seem like she knew exactly what I wanted... I had a faded blonde ombre that got brassy and my roots were pretty grown out and I said I don't want to see any of my natural roots. I don't want to see any black. So she says okay.. and what she did was she put blonde highlights to only my grown hair. And that was it. YES. That. Was. It. She didn't touch my brassy old ombre at the ends of my hair. She didn't ask about it. She didn't communicate to me how she was going to achieve my look. She didn't have a clear picture what I wanted. She didn't educate me how the process was going to work out. It was my fault that I should've been more detailed but she kept nodding her head and telling me she ""got it"". I explained to her that this wasn't what I wanted. I wanted all over brown with blonde highlights and to get my ends retouched. And she told me that ""this is what you wanted. You said you wanted highlights and no dark roots"". 

What?  How is having just highlights going to cover my virgin dark roots? I wasn't going to walk around with bright blonde highlights, natural roots, and brassy ends! She apologize and told me she got it. She left to mix some colors... and didn't even to bother ask me what shade I wanted. This whole entire experience she didn't show me swatches or color scales.. or anything to let me know we were on the same page. I then told her I like to dye my hair often. I once was blonde, and I even had red pink peachy hair. And she was surprised. She said that She didn't know that and when I showed her the balayage I wanted she said that she thought ""Oh no. She's not going to like that"". What do you mean? I show you a picture.. and I said this is what I want. If I can't reach to that level today at least put me on the road towards it. At least educate me! I'm so sad.. she didn't get a chance to get to know me.

After ringing me up I felt like I had a mixed feeling. it was pretty expensive. I paid more when I came in last time but I was fine with it because Waverly did such an amazing job. I understand that sometimes working in a store and trying to make ppl happy can be draining... so I tipped her. She tried to engage me with starting up some conversations.. which I do appreciate. But it was more like she was doing all the talking and when I tried to say something I would get cut off. So I just listen to her talk about how she was training her puppy. When I explained to her I didn't like my hair she didn't get an attitude. That's very professional of her. She tried fixing it and toning down my ends and the highlights that she gave me. I was more upset that the total amount was pretty high. Because when I walked out the door..the only difference with my hair was just highlights. It wasn't worth it.

The next day I called to explain my issue and why I wasn't satisfied and Shine Salon said they're always willing to fix an unsatisfied hair job from their own stylists. But pricing may vary. Or may even be free. Is what they were telling me. The people there were rly understanding and they agreed to let me meet with one of their experts of hair coloring. She was sweet and very educated in her work. She was honest and understood me from eye to eye about how I felt about my hair disaster. She told me the salon would call me back to let me know about the pricing differences and then to set up an appointment. BUT they never did.

I understand its the holidays and they might be busy.. but I am a unhappy customer. I PAID and TIPPED for your services. There are no refunds. And its not worth my time to keep calling them and to complain about my hair. This will be the final time I go to Shine Salon."
1,"Horrible Experience going through the qualification process with this property management company! 
My parents also rented a property through them and had a similar bad experience (aka charging my parents SIX DOLLARS to replace a lightbulb after move out!!) 
Now my credit is not stellar I'll admit but I found a cute place thru an advertisement on craigslist, posted by a man who said he was showing the condo for the owner. He also said he helped the owner out, did the cleaning, maintenance etc. So I assumed I was looking at a place that was privately owned!! I had a conversation on the phone with someone named Patrick (owner?) while the  man that created the CL ad showed me the condo, I stated I was very interested even though it would not be available for 3+ more weeks. I offered to put down a  holding fee while we worked it out and Patrick asked  if I could possibly get a cosigner on the lease. Patrick asked me for $300, I promptly  got a cashiers check from my bank & I gave it to the man who showed me the condo. He also wrote me out a basic simple receipt.
Well this unit was actually managed by On Q property management, so I went through the application process via their website . There was some confusion as this particular unit was not listed on their website as being available so I had to apply under another unit number. I did an application/credit check for my son and I & paid $45 a pop and they charged us for 3 credit applications instead of 2. Sam at On Q was very nice and responsive via our back-and-forth emails! The original CL ad was also changed & replaced with a 1BR unit in the same complex. After they ran a credit check they said Patrick told them  I would need a cosigner to move forward with the lease. My situation changed and I was not able to get & did not want a cosigner for my lease. I contacted Sam ASAP at On Q and stated I am not able to get a cosigner and will continue to look for another rental. He asked me the reason so he could communicate that with Patrick I stated I was not able to get a cosigner etc. and you require one.
Patrick called me a few hours later & left a voicemail ( bullying) stating that my $300 deposit was ""a non-refundable deposit that's why it's called a deposit"" he stated his disappointment that I was not able to get a cosigner!! I promptly called him back and basically told him my situation changed &  that happens as he well knows with property mgmt and he required a cosigner. I stated if he thinks that he is going to try and keep my $300 I know landlord tenant law like the back of my hand and I will swiftly take him to small claims court. He changed his tune quickly and stated the legal issues have to be worked out with On Qmain office!! 
The next day I have to go back-and-forth with Sam at On Q who told me that I needed to work it out with Patrick to get my $300 back as they did not even realize that rental is available and they had no receipt of me giving them $300. I explained to them the money order was made out to On-Q property management, Patrick is one of their employees so it is their problem to deal with and I would seek legal counsel the next week if they do not refund my money ASAP! 
After that low and behold I get an email stating that my $300 deposit was ready to pick up from the man I originally gave it to & to coordinate it with him!!
I have received my $300 cashiers check back, the man I had given it to very nice and honestly was not part of this mess. He was just trying to help as was Sam! However I think OnQ property management is shady and I'm SO glad my credit was NOT up to par in this case because I can only imagine what sort of headaches I would've endured with this property management company!!
Renters Beware!!"
1,"If I could give this store zero stars I would. We bought a dishwasher there and after a few uses there was rust in the inside of the door already! When we tried to return it they tried to tell us that we would have to pay a restocking fee for a defective dishwasher. Then the sales associate said he would give us money off of a new one. 
After again only a few uses with a new dishwasher it started leaking and damaged my floor! 
Service comes out and says they have to order a part and I would be without a dishwasher again.
We then leave a message for the store manager who never calls us back.

At this point we are disgusted and take the dishwasher to the store and tell them to take it back. They then have the nerve to try and charge us another restocking fee! The store manager never comes out to face us. 
Spencer's appliances is the worst retail store I ever dealt with! I was a manager in appliances myself and never treated my customers the way we were treated. DO NOT BUY THERE and if you do, expect to receive absolutely no customer service if you have an issue."
1,Lucky I gave them a star.  Went in to purchase a washer and dryer.  Salesman try to talk me out of buying a gas dryer.  I said I want gas. He says why the washer usually drys the clothes. He didn't have gas in stock.  SO HE FIGURED I WOULD BUY ELECTRIC. Kept telling me there was no reason to buy gas.  As I was walking out of the store he said I'm trying to help you. I said no your are trying to talk me out of buying. And I won. I left and went to Best Buy where they were happy to see me and take my money. PS  Spencers was empty
1,Horrible horrible horrible wait. Did I mention the wait time to get your food was horrific? I'm talking about nearly 30 minutes for fast food. At that point any value in price has been erased. The food would have to be hand fed to you by bikini women fanning you with palm leaves. And seeing as how those were in short supply the food is only getting rated as mediocre. The owner was there during my visit and appeared to be part of the problem. Under staffed. Poorly trained. Kitchen manager guy was cool but after a 30 minute wait for some chicken and rice.... there was no saving this visit. I thought initially that I would give them another shot but after 2 weeks of thinking it over I have to vote no. Stay away unless you're just bored and have nothing better to do. Oh and after 25 minutes of wait..... THE ORDER WAS WRONG!
1,"I felt it urgent that I follow up on a post I

 made recently.After my manicure a week ago I removed my nail polish and to my horror I now have a nail fungus (which I have NEVER had in my life) caused by dirty instruments used at Beverly nails!! I will be contacting the health department!"
1,"After many bad dine in experience at this restaurant, we decided to order take out instead.  Went to pick up the food. Stood there for more than 10 minutes before anyone would acknowledged me.  Then when they found out it was for pick up, they started sitting the dine in customers who came in after me again and again before I had to stop them and said ""hey, I don't have all day.  The food is sitting right there behind you."" We won't be coming back to this place."
1,"If you have to deal with Kyle Barrnet just walk away. We had a difficult time connecting to him. We asked to meet one day and agreed just to tell us later that he has "" prior commitments"". We said we were very interested  in a property and we needed to ask the owner a question he said he would ask and get back to us. We never heard back we called to ask and kept getting he is busy or out showing. When we did get him he had no idea what we were talking about and later goes o yea I have not contacted the owner yet. 3 days later of trying to get ahold of him hesaid that there was an application pending and waiting for owners approval. A follow up or something would of been nice or just doing your job would of been great. If I could they would get negative stars never have a dealt with someone so unprofessional."
1,"Not a best place to have  jap  food. The teriyaki chicken was rubbery, veggie / tofu tempura were oily. It was not even close to good."
1,"First review.

Terrible service. We asked for wasabi like 5 times without an answer. Food is also leaves a lot to be desired"
1,"I was very disappointed that I left a voicemail and no one called me back.  That was very unprofessional.  A good business would call you back the same day.  I can't imagine what would happen if a customer of mine called and I didn't bother to acknowledge their phone call.  I'm sure I would get written up or fired.

I have to add that I ended up calling them the next day again to actually get a response but I don't even want to do business with them now."
1,This place deserves a zero rating.  Employees are downright nasty and unfriendly.  They don't care if you are there or not.  They all seem very unhappy and seem to have the same personality disorder - rude and obnoxious.  Never going there again.
1,"Terrible! I'll never go back again. My hubby and I got pedicures and both were awful. I had to ask him to file my toe nails, his massage was uncomfortable and he forgot to scrub my heels. I could've saved $22 and done my own, way better."
1,"They have a handful of noodle and rice dishes, curry dishes and some asian appetizers like gyoza and spring rolls.  The food is all pretty pricey at around 10 and the portions are smaller with way too little meat.

We tried mongolian beef and broccoli which was VERY bland.  I'm not sure if the broccoli was frozen, but there was water at the bottom.  The meat was overcooked so very tough.  We had to use the Siracha to make it edible.

The kung pao chicken I got with rice instead of noodles.  It was mostly cabbage and peanuts..  No heat pretty much whatsoever.  I think a school cafeteria probably could have done better.

I tried to get bahn mi but the 3 options were lemongrass chicken, chicken teriyaki and steak.  (What, no pork?).

Weird place, way overpriced, almost like Pei Wei - I'm not sure which one's worse."
1,"I have been a longtime customer of this salon. I have been a regular patron for the past seven years but today I experienced some of the most terrible service I've ever experienced. I went in today for an eye brow wax around 11:15 this morning. It was busy as it usually is and I never mind waiting for services because I do trust their process and am never dissatisfied. After only a few minutes an employee walks me back to their waxing room. She does not speak to me the entire time. She literally waxes a couple strips and that's it. Now I have never gone where my wax was not followed up by tweeting and even topical agents to remove wax or even cool down the irritation. However, she did not do either. The only thing she said to me was ""$10"" and sent me out the door. I was going to stick around and wait for the next available employee to do a fill for me but I was so disappointed in my experience I left with my eyebrows looking terrible and my nails undone. I am so disappointed that my longtime nail salon has disappointed me so much and that I am now forced to not only repay money somewhere to have my eyebrows fixed, but am also forced to find a new place to get my nails done regularly."
1,"Stay clear!!!!! Far away!!! I went here because it was Friday and everywhere was busy. Just needed a quick fill & wax. The opener did my nails, she kept leaving me while trying to do my nails and yelling at all her workers!! She began to argue with me because of the color I wanted!! Horrible energy she was being rude to me slapping my hand when I wouldn't take my hand out of the gel machine fast enough! I couldn't wait to get out of this place! Never again!"
1,"This has been a terrible experience thus far. I viewed a property, submitted my application and they stated they could not reach the owner to see if the owner liked my application or not. 3 days later they finally contacted the owner and said I was approved. Once I moved in, I signed the lease and was told I had 5 days to take pictures of pre existing damage and get rental insurance. OnQ never followed up about my pictures or rental insurance, on the lease it stated I received 3 copies of the front door, only one of the keys was cut correctly, I had to cut more keys. On the lease my mailbox number was wrong, I had to wait for the mail carrier to arrive on a Sat afternoon and ask them to check which box was actually mine. On the lease they stated I would have 2 garage door openers, but I only have 1. Now to the major issue, I set up auto pay to deduct my rent and called my property manager to make sure I did everything correct and she looked at my account and said yes. Now today they debited my checking account twice for one month rent and told me I need to wait until the funds actually post on their end and I would need to pick up a check between 9-5pm. Horrible customer service and once my lease is up I will not be renewing with this company!"
1,"See allot of good reviews.  I did not care for my chicken mush bowl at all... Was way over-sauced with a vinegar-ridden sauce.  Server even said "" Too much vinegar, huh"", like they know there is a problem.   Corn fritter things were raw batter inside.  Got scared the meal was going to make me sick.  Couldn't wait to get out of there."
1,"Came here on Saturday night, restaurant was empty with one server. Food came fairly quick, everything was hot and to temperature. My only complaint is how annoying the server was coming over to our table to micromanage what we eat, she kept saying if you don't finish this dish well charge you! And when we ordered dessert, she wouldn't bring it until we ""cleared our food""! How rude! They also added an autograt of 15%!"
1,"I rate my hotels on very simple criteria- #1- The smell of the rooms, and as far as that goes, this hotel gets a 1 star. The room I stayed in absolutely stank. Customer service was great, but at over $110 a night, I expect a room to smell good. Fail."
1,"Came here to look for a new refrigerator for our new house. We purchased all of our appliances from Spencer's when we purchased our current home. Boy, has the customer service waned since we were last here. When we walked in there were at least eight employees behind the counter. Some were eating, some talking on their cell phone or texting and one was even on Craigslist looking at motorcycles. NOT ONE PERSON ACKNOWLEDGED OUR PRESENCE OR GREETED US! We will NOT be patronizing this chain."
1,"Really used to like coming in to see Mary at the counter area but apparently she is no longer there. I always order the waffle and it normally comes out cold and is served with cold syrup but Mary's cheerful personality kept me coming back anyways. This last time, Sunday, November 16, 2014, we sat at the counter and seemed like an inconvenience to our waitress the entire breakfast. There is nothing worse than feeling like you are not worthy of someone's time. I understand that turning over tables is important but it's also important to ensure your guests are satisfied. Couldn't get our waters refilled quickly, food came out cold, waitress was impersonal and the cashier was awfully rude as well. I'd recommend sunrise cafe or protein house instead."
1,"Tried this for the first time. Got home and realized my order was wrong. No sauce and they added rice when I specifically said I only wanted veggies. Turned around and went back. All I got was a ""sorry"" from the manager. No reimbursement...or anything...nothing. Who wants to drive back to a restaurant after getting the wrong order and then just a sorry? Unacceptable. Especially for a brand new restaurant trying to gain clientele. Even more unbelievable, my order was wrong again the second time. The food is not good and is overpriced. Go to Pei Wei. Better food and overall experience for the same money. Horrible customer service. I would not give this place a try. Not worth it."
1,"Stopped in the store on Saturday, they didn't have what I wanted in house but said the had one in Tempe and could have it by Tuesday; I said I wanted to see if someone had it in house and would get back to him. We couldn't find one, so I emailed the salesman Saturday night telling him I wanted it and to have it brought out to the store; I followed up with a phone call on Sunday and I got it ordered. Today I went to pick the item up and it wasn't there; it was shipped to a different store and sold. Needless to say I am not very happy right now... I won't be going back to this store!!"
1,We parked our car here while flying. The price was decent but upon returning we waited almost 2 hours and had to call 4 times to get a shuttle. Would not do it again.
1,"TAKE OUT review: Take out portions are small, and they've seemed to take some items off the menu which is a shame. Food is cooked inconsistently. Sometimes its pretty good, sometimes not so much.
I do appreciate their ""free delivery"", but on a $35 bill (gave the guy a $50 bill) the guy was asking me ""how much money do you want back? Remember the bill only covers food and tax, no tip.."". What is that? Give the customer their money back, and then if they decide to tip (which of course I was going to), then they tip, if not then, unfortunately it happens.
But they way this guy was coming off was that he basically wanted to walk away with $15. 

Much better local take out Chinese food in the neighborhood, with better service."
1,"Unfortunately you can't give a company or business zero stars, so I will be forced to leave the review with one star. My mother and her fiancee purchased a very expensive $11K SubZero refrigerator only one week ago. This particular refrigerator was not available to see in the store, so it was purchased without being seen in person. Given that their website states they have ""top notch customer service,"" little was thought about if there would be a potential problem with the unseen refrigerator. The first delivery team to come to the house could not install the refrigerator, as they were unprepared. They did not bring the right tools to install the refrigerator, and the installation had to be rescheduled. The next team installed the refrigerator and after using the refrigerator my mother and her fiancee quickly realized this was not a good fit for them. This was for a variety of reasons, the most important being that my mom suffers from RA and back problems and the refrigerator is too heavy and bulky to open and close. My mother and her fiancee spoke with salesman, Brian, who was incredibly rude to both of them on the phone. They also spoke with the manager, Larry Flake, and finally the owner, Rick, who were both very unprofessional, rude, and offered terrible customer service. My mother and her fiancee explained their concerns and wanted to exchange the refrigerator for a different model of the same price. They had only had the refrigerator for 8 days and were willing to pay the extra delivery and setup fee, but Spencer's insisted that they would also have to pay a 25% restocking fee. To pay $11,000 for a refrigerator that does not work for an individual due to medical reasons and be forced to pay almost $3,000 for a restocking fee is disgusting. This is far, far from ""top notch customer service."" Spencer's also said it didn't matter if the refrigerator was only one day old, they would not take it back or exchange it. This business has been ""family owned and operated for over 40 years"" and all the employees are masters at ripping people off and treating them with disrespect. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! BEWARE!!!"
1,"No Star!
Great customer service latrish/katrish la shit whatever your name was manager! Time 8pm on 2/20/2018 
Put in for two separate to go out orders. Hubby's was done but mine they couldn't see weird since I only put it in 3 mins after his and I gave them well over 30 mins from the 20 they quote for ready for pick up. Still took another 20 to get all together 50min total not 20.  Anyways finally get my order get home to see that my food is not cooked to order so I still had to finish cooking it at home and my order was incomplete. I call them and the manager knew they did not complete my order great customer service NOT! They have my number they could have called me.  Her excuse for the time it took was because she only had one cook and two servers and it was busy. And the website does not know how busy the restaurant was.... really!!??
 How about talking to me when I arrived plus greeting me would had help your case too. But no you had attitude because you only had one order and you couldn't see my other order and walked away leaving standing there like I did not matter you could've said ""let me check on your order I'll be right back""
i honestly believe this was done on purpose. No excuses.  Up to 20 mins she also kept saying to me."
1,"While our experience buying at Spencer's started good, the service from our salesperson, Kent Webster, went south after the purchase.

We bought a complete kitchen of appliances 2 months ahead of our remodel. I then scheduled delivery with Kent 2 weeks ahead of our install date. Then, the day before delivery was scheduled, Kent calls to tell me the microwave wasn't available and would be delivered the following week. Our entire remodel went without a hitch until Spencer's got involved and it was Kent's lack of attentiveness. Our appliances should have been pulled 2 weeks earlier to ensure availability on our scheduled delivery date. Kent was not apologetic whatsoever.

When the appliances were delivered, I noticed the extended warranty was not on the dishwasher. I called Kent to get this corrected and to confirm the microwave was still scheduled for delivery and install. He said yes on the microwave and that he would add the warranty to the dishwasher. That was in February.

Then in April, I get a past due notice from Spencer's for $99. Having never received an invoice from Kent for the added warranty, I thought maybe he simply added the warranty in exchange for his mistake on the microwave. I was wrong! He charged us, which is OK, but he never sent us a bill. So I had to deal with corporate on something Kent failed to do.

The delivery crews were fantastic. Suggestion: shop at Spencer's if you have to, but don't buy from Kent Webster."
1,"Horrible wait experience, even with reservations!  First off, I can't even rate the food because we never got to sit down and eat and had to go somewhere else for dinner.  We had a 4-top with reservations for hibachi at 6:30 last night. We get there and check in and the place is packed.  They were a little delayed so we were able to get drinks in the bar...thats fine, it happens to every restaurant. However, after about 30 min of waiting I check with the hostess and she says they are working on the table now.  We wait about another 15 minutes and still nothing, so we check in again. Another hostess/waitress helps us and notices we had been crossed off and they buzzed the wrong number...so someone else had gotten our spot and we werent even on the list. She takes us into the dining room to look for openings I presume, but then we are brought back out to the lobby to wait some more.  15 min later we check with the original hostess again and they hadn't even put us back on the list after realizing their error!  They offered to seat us at a regular dining table but it was still going to be a wait. They gave us a small gift card but otherwise didn't seem very apologetic.  I should mention many other customers that night were also experiencing big delays and seemed unhappy. We left Sumo and walked to a really great Indian food place nearby with amazing food and service, so the night was not lost.  We may try Sumo again but not on a busy night like that until they learn to manage a crowd."
1,"we went to Congee Queen in Christmas Eve. It is not our first choice. We went to Mr Congee but we couldn't find a parking spot there so we decided to give this congee restaurant a try.

Since it was christmas eve and there were a lot of people waiting there. We waited half an hour before getting seated. The restaurant is very noisy as any other busy Chinese restaurant so we wouldn't expect any difference. However, the food is very disappointing.

we ordered a congee with seafood and minced winter melon. The seafood was not very fresh, so the entire congee had unpleasant smell. There were a lot of ginger slices inside the congee, which was very annoying since I don't eat ginger so I had to take them one by one. As for the winter melon part, it was so undercooked that it was very crunchy. I have had seafood and winter melon congee in other restaurants and this is the first time I had raw winter melon in it.

We also ordered Fried Eggplant with minced pork and spicy sauce. The sauce was nothing but salty, and there was a lot of starch in the sauce, making it very unpleasant in texture.

Another dish we ordered was fried handmade udon with beef and soy sauce. This is usually a signature dish in any cantonese style Chinese restaurant, and every good chef should be able to serve a good one. However, what's on our table was very bad. The noodle was broken badly while some of the noodle sticked together and undercooked. The soy sauce seemed to be burnt and tasted bitter.

The only decent dish that night was the stewed beef tendon. 

I don't know whether the food was always that bad in Congee Queen, or it was because of the Christmas eve and the main chef was taking a break. The dining experience was so terrible that we wouldn't give it another try."
1,"Went there last night for dinner. Oh boy, won't return. My lemon dill salmon was SOOOOO over cooked and flavorless I had a hard time even swallowing it. I tried to eat it cold on a sandwich with some doctored up dressing this morning and still a no go. Sad too, I spent almost $14 dollars on it. My husband had steak hibachi. Now, he's easy to please but said it wasn't really good; wasn't the temp he wanted it (over done) and the seasoning was ""off"". And the least of my concerns, but still......my 2 year old's chicken nuggets and fries had to have been microwaved from the freezer, so gross. They were both cold, dense and flavorless. Again, really sorry I spent good money on it all."
1,Don't come here .... Please don't come here no no no no no HELL to the NO... My daughter can do a better job then this... Stay away and I warned you... they did the worst job of nails .. I paid $37 for this crap
1,Service was great let's start with the positive. Our server was super friendly! My daughter and I had the hibachi - so sweet! The sauce ruined the entire dish. Not like other hibachi I've ever had before. My husband got the Ramen - it tasted like it was out of a package.
1,"Very poor service and very expensive for what you get. First time I ever went in here and will be the last. Ordered fajitas and when I got home no tortillas in the bag, called and was told I realized when you walked out the door, no attemp to come after me and not apologetic. $24 for 2 meals and no chips and salsa included  unless you pay extra, cheaper in a restaurant and then to get home and not have all your order. Not a happy customer."
1,"Lame food, drink, and service.  Not Tod English anymore.  To top it off oysters were bad, ""spit out of mouth bad"".  

Will not be back again."
1,"Worst experience I've ever had. Came here to get a pedicure... started out by the lady yelling at me to ask what I wanted when I walked in the door then once I sat down the lady doing my nails was turned away from me talking in another language to the other nail lady next to us the WHOLE TIME. 
The nail lady next to us had her shoes off, legs spread wide open the whole time too. This place is so unprofessional I would rather not get my nails done then come here again. 
Oh and when I handed the lady the tip (shouldn't have even tipped at all), she didn't even say thank you, she just said ""k"" and walked away...LOL"
1,"if i could...i would rate this place -5 stars 
i can't believe that a place like this is still in business
me and a bunch of friends went to this place, in search of a good ayce place. 
sadly when we ordered our sushi, they decided to place salt in some of the pieces of the sushi, after arguing for five minutes with the waitress(lanuage barrier) she took the pieces away and decided not to charge us. 
as well we has piece with sugar in it, and pieces with avacado in it as well. which were not advertised on the menu. 
i'll never go back!"
1,"I placed a takeout order tonight and when I returned discovered that the order was not what I placed. I attempted to call the restaurant twice; no one answered, nor was there voicemail (there was no one in the restaurant when we picked up the order so I do not think it was too busy to answer the phone). I attempted to send an email to the address listed on the website (eat@coaltraneschargrill.com) and my email bounced back. I tried to fill out the comment section on the website and immediately was met with a message stating ""Failed to send your message."" Wondering why I would ever return to a restaurant that does not appear to want business (how can someone call to place a takeout order when no one answers?), gives incorrect orders to patrons and has no way to contact anyone."
1,"Lame white romaine lettuce on cob salad,, weird salty dressing on arugula, small portions, slow service"
1,"This was the worst manicure I have ever received. To start off with, Danny was extremely rude. When I asked for a regular manicure rather than a shellac, he gave me a facial expression I've only seen on 15 year old girls who've just seen someone wearing an outfit that was so last year. He told me that ""manicures don't last at all"" as though the concept of a manicure was completely new to me. I should have taken his admission as proof that he was about to sell me a subpar product. The manicurist cut multiple of my fingers with a cuticle clipper. She followed that by dousing the open wounds with acetone despite the fact that I had no polish on. While painting my nails, she basically painted my whole finger. In between each finger, she took her long nails and dug them into my finger to wipe away the polish on the skin, which was both painful and seemed sort of unsanitary to have her dirty nails digging into me. On my way out, Danny wasted no opportunity to again reprimand me for leaving too early (""your nails are SO wet"" - I had sat for 15 minutes waiting for them to dry...) Definitely the worst manicure I've ever had. Peace out, Danny. See you never."
1,"Will not be staying here again. Will be telling friends and family to stay away. Walls and floors are so thin you here everyone and everything. Have to leave the TV on to try and drown out the next door rooms to be able to sleep. The bathroom tub, sink and sink in room don't drain. There was no dish washer in this room. You have dishes but no rack to dry them. The jacuzzi jets didn't work by the pool. If you have AT&T you won't have cell service only the slow wifi. We were here for 3 days. Not worth the money! Was like staying at a cheap hotel. Thanks for a horrible Anniversary get away."
1,"How do you burn pancakes and have the server bring them to you table? There were two people that saw they were burnt. It's pathetic that we only ordered pancakes and you ruined them. You both had one job and neither one of you were willing to do it. 
Before we could say anything to the server she said ( they are burnt). Are you kidding me? Get a clue!"
1,"Bad Curry
Tried this place for first and last time today.  I do red curry and panang at home. Order paste from Thialand, add coconut milk, add fish sauce and palm sugar.  You got curry.  Dont know what they served me for the chicken curry, or my wife for malaysian peanut curry, but tasted sour and like it has a vinegar  base.  Each of us took two bites and threw it in the trash.  Samasosas and chicken ginzo small bites tasted like grocery store frozen.  I had great hope for this place, but dont waste your time."
1,"Pretty awful. I only went here one time, and I got a full set of acrylic. I had a picture of what I wanted him to paint on one nail of each hand, and he did an absolutely awful job. I don't even know if he realized that his drawing looked nothing at all like the picture he had right in front of him the whole time he was painting. I could have forgiven that (although it was hilariously bad) but even up to 2 hours after I got my nails done they were still denting at everything I touched. Also, the tips of my nails were all crooked.  I had to get my nails completely redone."
1,Purchased whirlpool duet washer and dryer.  We set up delivery and told them the only time we can't have the delivery was between 11:30-1:00pm or they could come any time the following day.  The salesman assured us they could deliver around the 11:30-1:00pm.  The delivery driver called and said they would deliver at 11:30am-1:00pm.  We told the driver that's the only time day we can't have a delivery.  The driver said the washer and dryer was loaded on the truck. I told the driver we would reschedule my appointment to 2:00pm.  At 2:00pm no delivery the finally showed up at 2:30pm.  They only had the washer  but no dryer.  Also they didn't have the stackable kit.  The driver said the dryer is back ordered..  The salesman insisted the dryer was in stock.  The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  We waited all day for nothing.  I called the salesman and explained my frustration and he blamed me on the delivery and the fact that they didn't have the stackable kit.  The manager called the next day and apologized.  A day late!!!  Very frustrating!!!!
1,We had a great experience. It was a younger girl that did my daughter's nails. Very pleasant..the next day 3 nails came off in whole pieces..I came and spoke to her and she said no problem she will fix.. but they normally don't guarantee..I said I understood and thank you. I came to day and owner immediately said we no guarantee! I said I already talked to worker and she advised me and it's all taken care of!! She was doing pedicure and I said we'd wait.   And some guy came into picture and called my daughter to counter and I told him we would wait for girl and he ignored me 2 times..I asked his co-workers Does he not understand English?? And he became rude and said..OH YOU WAIT FOR HER??? She will be hour...I said No she is almost done with pedicure.and he can't even see her and said NO SHE BE 1HOUR!! I said no I get pedicures monthly..I know how long they take!! And he got rude and said..YOU GOT SIT 1 HOUR....I went to sit..then thought ...YOUR VERY RUDE !! I told owner I will take my daughter to different salon to fix her nails..!! It's too bad because I was going to tip her enough to have paid to repaint her nails!!! I hope she finds better salon to work at. . It's too bad there isn't a 1/2 star....they original girl is the only reason they get 1
1,I just moved to the area so wanted to try something new and closer to me.... Needless to say I will never go back! It was horrible worst service and I could have done better myself went in for pedicure and manicure left after the manicure didn't even want to finish. Nails look like shit went home and fixed them myself. Waste of $42!
1,"As a server myself I'm always very observant about what's going on inside the restaurant. I start nit picking on every detail. 
I understand it's diner food, can't expect much; but there are still some great items. My food came out cold. Not once did the server drop by. I was already half way done, I honestly didn't want to make a big deal about it because I had just gotten off a late swing shift at 2am. I was starving!! He was behind his station on his phone watching videos with his buddy.

Whatever man, not everyone that comes in is an asshole. I'm sure they get that a lot. But you never know who you're serving, and not every industry people are going to be nice about it but I let it slide, only because I had a great night at my job. 

I've had better service at the Coronado cafe after hours at southpoint, and that's for $4 steak n eggs. Won't be stopping in here again, I'd rather try my luck back at southpoint. 

I wish more wait staff members would start acting like they cared more about their jobs. Your customers pay your bills!!!!"
1,"Not a huge fan.
Not a lot of flavor and while it comes out hot.. Doesn't seem fresh. With other options in the area, I don't plan on returning."
1,"Horrible communication...moved into a filthy house, yard filled with garbage, exterior windows and screens caked in dirt, aweful smell in the house and a pool that they expected me to fill up with a hose that I had to purchase and with no compensation. I came from across the country and had to put a non refundable 2000$ deposit down so I had no recourse once I saw the house. This market definitely allows renters no rights, we have to just deal with it. Its been 9 days and they've sent no one out to fix anything and they expect me to not only schedule all of the appointments but have all the vendors out on MY PERSONAL TIME. This is certainly bordering my rights to enjoy my home and management's failure to maintain property and landscape. Self-Help laws may allow me to hire someone to do these things and reduce it from my rent. Beware renters.....this is what you get for $2000/ month in Mesa from On Q."
1,"Ughhhh!!!!!
Don't do it. You'll be sorry.
So I make an appointment, come in and when I show up, I am told it will be 10 more minutes (since the nail technician was running behind.)
I sit down, and wait. Two minutes later the owner comes over and asks if I want a Pedicure? I say no, I have an appointment for my nails. Then she asks me if I need my eyebrows waxed? Nooooo, I have a nail appointment. Really lady?? Quit pushing your sales on me! Thirty minutes laters, my nails are done. Two nails are crooked, one is too wide----wider than my thumb, and it's not the shape I asked for. I proceed to pay for these services and they charged me an extra dollar because I used a card. Wow! You have doubled your sales in a year, opened an extention to the salon, hired more people and you can not afford to pay your credit card machine fees? Are you kidding me? And the best part is that there is a Lexus parked out front every day but you can't take on those credit card charges??? 
Can you say money hungry? 
I did voiced my opinion on what I wanted fixed/repaired and the nail technician screamed at me across the room in front of other customers, as if I did something wrong. I was mortified. What ever happened to the customer is always right. And for the record, I wasn't trying to get free anything, since I double tipped you. I just wanted it fixed. That's all. 
Well good thing Madison has a ton of nail salons. And cheaper prices."
1,"I ordered egg in a basket and it comes back with the egg fried hard. I asked the server to take it back and have the eggs over easy more or less and the manager grabs the my plate from the window and stands there arguing with me that it's ""cooked in a bun"" well no shit it's an egg in a basket genius! After he rolls his eyes he brings it back to the kitchen and this is what the server brings me back. It's not rocket science on how to make an egg in a basket! You toast the ""basket"" first then drop your egg in the center. I could've made this at home saved myself the money and the attitude. Lesson learned. No wonder this place looks depressing. I would never recommend this place"
1,"Decent food for the price, but don't expect high quality ingredients.
The major issue though is they automatically added a 15% gratuity to the bill for a party of 2. Their credit card machine will also ask if you want to tip on top of the already added tip. That is just dishonest. Beware not to tip twice."
1,"OnQ Property Management is the WORST possible rental company to choose from. ****NEVER think about entering into an agreement with them!  They are negligent in their business practices, untimely in getting help to tenants/customers and resolving issues and they are unethical and sketchy to say the least.  Pease, please beware that this company is only here to take your money and walk away.  Look at their fancy new showroom!  Who do you think is paying for that? The sorry sot tenants, that's who. OnQ is the worst establishment on the planet!"
1,"Renter beware: this management company is one of the most unethical I've ever dealt with. They rented me a house that was falling apart, literally: the porch ceilings on both front and back were caved in and dropping to the ground in chunks. The carpet, windows, walls and floors were filthy. The appliances were rusted, the sprinklers broken, and toilets leaking, and on and on. Every single repair request or maintenance issue was a long drawn-out argument, which I usually lost. My children were bleeding from exposed carpet tack, and when I asked the company to fix it they raised my rent. Not kidding: I have documented proof. Why did I sign the lease, you ask? Because I was desperate and couldn't find another place in my price range. So fast forward five years of on-time, in-full rent payments, and when I move out they charge me for ""repairs"" for things that were broken when I moved in (clearly noted on my move-in checklist) and carpet cleaning (even though, against my better judgement, I had the carpets cleaned and have the receipt to prove it) as well as an extra month's rent, in complete violation of the terms of my lease. Apparently, legal documents are no barrier to the greed of this organization. If you're looking to rent a house, seriously, save yourself a lot of grief and go elsewhere."
1,"I stopped here because of all the excellent Yelp reviews and people raving about the food.  My experience was quite the opposite.  Absolutely the worst attempt at ""Mexican"" I've experienced. The chips smell of rancid grease the beef? was cold full of gristle and the guacamole was a Christmas green.  Salsas were bland at best. Do yourself a favor an move on to a more appealing restaurant."
1,"Was greeted at the door with a menu and offering of a drink. I asked for an iced tea.. sat down to peruse the menu.. noon lunch ""rush"" there were maybe 5 tables occupied. I watched and waited rather patiently and made my selection.. combo seemed most reasonable the menu on the drive through is $.75 cheaper on tacos than inside the items looked good on the menu.. no tea ever arrived and no one asked for my order nor approached to direct me towards the counter for service so I got up and I left....
Hoping that they turn the place back into a long john silvers"
1,"The food was so nasty it made us sick

Eggs were watery with cheese burnt on top

Hash browns were rock hard 

Everything was just horrible

Service was so good the staff was super good staff was super nice wish I could say the same about the food"
1,"About 30 minutes ago me and my girlfriend walked in and took a seat the server noticed us and said he would be with us shortly after about 5 minutes go by and then I noticed the two other empty tables got sat and then he gave them menus and drinks instantly he walked by and ignored us 3 times and about 10 minutes went by so we just left on our way out I was hoping he would say something to get us to stay or at the least apologize but he just made eye contact and continued, then I mentioned the great service to him out of frustration and he then replied commenting about our patience and I am pretty upset just because this isn't the first time I have experienced terrible service here and I truly do love the food but if I can't even get menus or a guy to take my order then I guess I just will not try anymore."
1,"Hardly worth it. the steaks are less than average and the service is poor (we ordered french onion soup which never came, and they mixed up a medium rare order with a rare one).  Overall, one of the worst dining experiences I've ever been to and thoroughly disappointing considering that they have built up a reputation of being one of the best steakhouses in toronto"
1,"Godawful.

Unless you like your food cold (twice) and the kitchen staff to huddle and point at you whenever a complaint is lodged.

And another memo to the kitchen: a hotdog is not a sausage, despite similar appearance. I didn't think it was possible to mess up ""sausage and mash"" but congratulations - you did.

Hopefully this restaurant will close before it's even a year old."
1,"Our Spencer's salesperson, Justin, told us our frig would be available by our closing date and that there were three of our frig in stock; one with our name on it.  The day before planned delivery, I called Spencers confirming the delivery and they took final payment.  Then, two hours later, Justin called and said that they didn't have it available after all.  When I asked what they were going to do for us, he said they would give us a loaner, but it may be a ""junker"".  I was furious and said that wasn't acceptable.  So my husband took over at that point and after speaking to someone else at the store, we were told that we were getting a loaner, next day, that would work fine.  But that turned out to be a lemon (temp kept rising).  After hours on the phone trying to trouble shoot the frig, we were told they would send us another loaner the next day, right off the floor, because they were coming back to install the w/d. 
The next day, when the deliverymen came, they did not have our loaner frig, stating that their boss told them not to bring us another frig, because we already had a loaner.  .  We lost 4-5 hours, again, trying to get the second loaner.  Finally, 6 p.m. in the evening, they delivered the second loaner (more delivery men trekking through our new home).  
Two weeks later, we did receive our frig and it is fine, so far.
Bottom line, we should have stuck with Lowes.  Lowes is much more customer friendly and do not make false promises to get a sale.  Also, they aren't on commission.  Lesson learned."
1,"Let's start with the big issue. Room 120 A had a BED BUG infestation that I only found out after the first night. I have pictures of one I killed and another I captured. Hotel moved me to a new room and that was it. 

2nd issue, I had 3 packages shipped to the front desk for work and they were lost. 

3rd issue my reservation was not on file when arriving and took 30 minutes to rectify. Not sure if this was expedia or the hotel.

I would advise everyone to AVOID AT ALL COST just due to the bed bug issue alone. And now looking at other images in Yelp seems I'm not the only one to find bed bugs."
1,Really wanted to leave a good review because this is a local instead of a national chain. Products were delivered when I wasn't home; my husband was. He didn't look things over like I do. The stainless steel refrigerator had a dent in the freezer-side door and the freezer was missing a freezer bin. The TV was hung on the wall a little crooked. I got home and noticed these things right away but of course by then he had signed for the delivery. I will say that I thought something was wrong with my dryer and I received very prompt and under-warranty service (it turned out to be a clogged vent in my new-build) but I am not at all happy with receiving a banged up refrigerator with missing parts. That thing wasn't cheap.
1,"I went to this restaurant because it is supposedly the ""best"" AYCE sushi in Toronto. 

The one word to describe my experience here is ""disgruntled"". The quality of the sushi isn't bad, per se, but the whole experience left me vowing to not come back. For the record, Kyoto House on Dundas is much cheaper and has better quality. 

The quality of service was virtually non-existent, making it very difficult for me to even muster a 10% tip. 

I found a fruit-fly and a piece of plastic in my Udon soup. Upon telling the server, she gave me this ""what do you want me to do"" look, without even attempting to make amends. 

I left the meal feeling nauseous, furious and wondering whether my stomach was going to survive this ordeal."
1,This place used to be good until new management took over. Currently two people are sitting on their phones while they all speak in another language. Service is terrible.
1,"I frequent the Congee Queen chain regularly. Good food at fair pricing. I cannot, however, recommend this new location (Yonge and Steeles). With the restaurant staff's kids sprinting through the aisles all evening like it's a playground as they play hide-and-seek, and no responsible parent to address the situation, eat elsewhere. It is a danger to both child and patron. Not to mention the annoyance to the paying customer. There is another location a little further east at Leslie and Steeles. I suggest going there instead."
1,"It may seem uncharitable to give one star but this is the worst place ever.  If I could give a zero I would. I've been there 4 times only because it was where I was invited each time, and after tonight you couldn't pay me to go back. 
Aside from the food being carelessly made and randomly served, the 4 staff members they had were ignorant at best. Words can't describe the lengthy list of neglectful, complacent and rude service we received.
What could have been a pleasant 1 hour meal was a 2 hour ordeal, they would bring stuff at random some things taking an hour or simply forgotten, there was one grimy i-pad for the whole table of 7 to pass around instead of menus.. very self serve, and the staff stood around texting or chatting with each other, and even out right ignored you when politely asked for anything. I found myself having to be outright bossy and rude in order for anything to happen eg. cup of tea, beverages, condiments. I have many server friends and am very conscious of how to courteously treat servers, but this was unbelievable. 
On top of the worst service I've had in my life, and I'm not exaggerating.. everyone had AYCE and felt bloated after.  
Two of use were was wise enough to order 2 dishes each a la carte, which the waiters resented us for because AYCE is easier and more profitable for them. 
Despite the small amount I ate, I felt indigestion, not only from the bland greasy food, but from worrying about how sanitary the preparation was. The bathroom was gross and if the servers were that careless, I'm terrified of what the kitchen was like.
If it wasn't a friend's birthday plan to eat there, I would have walked out at once or better yet, never set foot in there. 
It's my version of hell!"
1,"I've dealt with some pretty sketchy leasing agents throughout my house hunt, but this company has by far the worst. For 4 days I continuously attempted to reach out to this company about one of their rentals via email, phone, and text to schedule a viewing on this home, in hopes to get a jump on the beautiful property. Every single attempt I made went unanswered. I couldn't get a yes, no, or even a maybe. It wasn't until the fourth day when more of my calls went unanswered and voicemails went without response, that I finally decided to once again try to text the leasing agent, only for him to FINALLY respond and tell me that the property was no longer available. Honestly, after the neglect of even potential tenants this company displays, it's probably for the better that I didn't get the house."
1,The food was a huge disappointment. I ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box. You get an iceberg lettuce salad and some watered down soup with stale fried onions in it. The tempura had no crisp to it and was soaked in oil. The chicken teriyaki was a bit overcooked and tasteless. The sushi roll was unremarkable. The bowl of rice was the best thing on the plate. Service was good though and the food wasn't expensive. At least the place was decorated well.
1,"I'd leave zero stars if I could. I ordered from them on just-eat and they left out my tempura. When I called them to rectify the situation they were not helpful at all, acted as though they couldn't care less. The owner was horrible to me! After feeling mocked over the phone I told her I'd call her back and when I did, no one picked up. When the customer service rep at just-eat also tried to contact them they didn't pick up. Now onto the food: one of the special rolls I ordered had TWO pieces. Such a rip-off. The seafood udon had bland, overcooked pieces of fish and shrimp that they had clearly just thrown in with the same amount of carelessness they display in their customer service. The chilled tofu was bland and drenched in a ton of sesame oil. I would NOT recommend this place."
1,"PLEASE KEEP PERSONAL BELONGS SAFE AND HIDDEN AWAY BECAUSE HOUSEKEEPING CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!!!!! 
At first I would've overall given this place a great review. HOWEVER, on the day of checking out when inquiring about what were the best buffets to eat on the strip and other various questions the front desk clerk was very vague and  unknowledgeable. Also, I forgot a couple of items in my room and called to inform them. They told me they would get back to me as soon as possible or by the end of the day but day after day they never contacted me. I had to go out of my way each day to contact them to get an update and it took them FOUR days to tell me that they finally checked with housekeeping and the items were not found or there in the room(obviously they'd be gone after not checking right away) I know for a fact my items were left behind in that room and the fact that they took so long to get back to me was absolutely RIDICULOUS!

Hopefully Hampton Inn can hire more knowledgeable and trustworthy employees. I hope everyone else has a more pleasant stay there but we will no not be back and I hope that this review can help anyone else out so they don't have a shitty experience like we did."
1,"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! We just finished our meal. We went for the AYCE option. Everything we ordered was subpar. The salmon sashimi quality was quite low, the shrimp tempura was not freshly made, the 'steak' teriyaki was hard to stomach, the new bacon shrimp tempura was gross, you get the point it was terrible!!! We had eaten there just a few months ago and it was pretty good so we returned, but never again."
1,"Today  (9/24/2016) we went to Jimmy Hulas based on all the great reviews. This was one of the worst experiences at an establishment I have ever encountered. We were a party of six, and we seated ourselves, as instructed, outside in the patio area. We did not get any service for about 20 mins. There was one waitress working the whole restaurant, and the Manager brought us our drinks. He then informed us that he had been hired ""four hours ago"" and was unable to answer any questions we had with the menu. Later, the waitress informed us that the entire staff was let go the day prior, and they had new cooks in the kitchen, ect. 

We arrived at 7:45pm, and our food came out at 9pm. Our food was cold, the tortillas were cold, the fries were burnt and soggy. And, to top it all off, the food arrived in to go boxes. We did not make a fuss, we calmly waited for our food thinking at least the food will make up for the abhorrent service and wait.  They also did not bring out correct orders, and a few members of our party did not eat, and that was extremely disappointing. 

The food was mediocre, not much to judge when it was cold, burnt and arrived an hour later. We were really overlooking the lack of service and awful wait, but this was a terrible terrible experience. 

I had high hopes, and today was a disaster of epic proportions."
1,"On May 7th I checked Into the Tahiti All Suites on 5101 W Tropicana Ave
Las Vegas, NV. I originally booked a Studio on Orbitz but after arriving to the hotel on May 7th and getting into building A room 201A. I wasn't very impressed. Room was dirty. After calling and was on hold for 10 minutes I was finally told to come down and switch rooms. Well come to find out I paid the extra fee which I didn't mind $71.00. The lady which was the manger said I'll put u in room 201 which is right next door to the old room. When I walked in the room I was happy to have a bigger room but there are problems.The room itself was okay, not something you should see in a 4 star hotel or a timeshare like this place. Maintenance and house keeping seems like they either don't care anymore (photos will show). I had many problems with the room. Dirty walls, worn furniture, crumbs on the floor, main door doesn't shut all the way, fridge ice maker does not work. I ofcourse went down to complain more and the manger said well it's because it's been sitting vacant for a while. I said so you leave a room for a guest dirty? She said housekeeping cleaned it before we put u in it. After showing her photos I taken because she didn't want to come up to the room and see for herself as she's the only employee on duty in the lobby. The manger didn't seem to care other then refund me my upgrade. 

I have stayed at other timeshares and I also used to own one and this is one of the worst places I've ever stepped into."
1,"So basically if you are the renter - forget it.  They don't care about you except for the rent income.  If you are the owner of the property, then you are important.  We have been renting from them for over a year and they always want to come and inspect the house and take pictures 2-3 x a year but when we need something fixed they interrogate us like terrorists.  We rented this house with irrigation system - which has never worked and still does not even though the INHOUSE maintenance company (owned by the same person as ONQ) allegedly fixed it.  I am certain they did this so they can say we broke it and keep our deposit.  My husband has taken off work for them to come and do repairs and they don't show up.  Or they scheduled for the ""wrong"" Tuesday so we have to take another day off.  When we don't work, we don't get paid - so we have lost payroll money in the repair process.  When the owner wanted the house painted - the INHOUSE maintenance company (Mammoth) came out and painted it the wrong color.  They had to schedule to have them out again to paint it the correct color.  We are looking forward to our lease ending and getting away from Taylor Tenney (owner of ON Q) and the whole group of callous individuals.  If I were the owner of this house - I would want repairs to be made to keep the property in good repair - apparently that is not a concern by the owner, or at least that's the way ON Q makes it sound.  Run far and fast away from this company!"
1,"I wasn't happy with my stay here at all.  My family and I stayed here for our Summer vacation in July.
Typical timeshare will stalk you every day to listen to a presentation to buy more credits.  It's a rip off, don't do it.  I've owned Worldmark for over 13 years and since the ownership changed to Wyndham, the quality of the resorts has gone down significantly.
When I checked in, There were dead ants inside the fridge, very unsanitary...  Also, it's obvious they didn't clean the tub jets, because when I turned them on a bunch of mildew started floating around in the water.
If you can, stay at another timeshare  facility..."
1,"Purchase went fine. They sold us a warranty saying how great the service plan is and that we would go directly through them. They sure sold us a load of crap. You call and they have you call someone else. Then it's a game of pass the buck. If you don't like what one does that have you call the other. Spencer's takes zero accountability for the warranty they sold. ""We are just salesmen"". Yeah sales men who sold us garbage. 4 weeks to fix a fridge is completely unacceptable. Spencer's says appliance repair should have overnighted parts. Appliance repair says there's nothing they can do. Warranty people say oh well we can't schedule till we have parts and those take 10 business days. So a week for first appt, 10 business days for parts, another week wait after they get parts to get another repair appt. Meanwhile we have a fridge that doesn't work. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!   Will never buy there again!!!!'"
1,"Went here for breakfast and it was a very sad experience. We sat at the bar and our waitress was super sweet and tried to accommodate our order the best that she could since the menu is has a very limited selection. I asked for egg whites instead of regular eggs, no butter on my toast and eggs. As she went back to the kitchen to explain the order to the chef he yelled at her for all the accommodations and so when she came back to us to explain that we could no longer as for anything else to be changed because the chef was mad it put us in a very very uncomfortable situation to where we were hesitate to ask for anything else such as condiments, hot sauce, or anything else. This was the worst experience ever and we will never go back. It wasn't worth the money or stress that it put on us. We where there to enjoy ourselves and that did not happen. We felt like we had to sit there with our hands crossed and not say a word because we were going to get scolded by the chef again. Never going back."
1,I wish I could give this salon zero stars. One of the most UNFRIENDLY nail salons I have ever visited. The staff was very rude. They acted like doing a pedicure was a total bother even though the salon was practically empty. And it was the middle of the afternoon. Very mediocre pedicure. When I inquire about callous buffing I was told $5 more dollar. Ridiculous. This basic pedicure was $34! I would recommend taking your business elsewhere. I did not complain at all and was very courteous. When I gave her my $5 tip (in cash as she requested ) she practically snatched it out of my hand without any acknowledgment. Sad. I realize this is a tough job but a little courtesy goes a little no way.
1,We had a great time here and the service was great at the beginning. The room was nice and very clean. Due to problems with them giving us back or deposit the manager Charles was very rude and hung up on my wife. He was so unprofessional how talked to her. For that I will never stay here again. If you can't resolve a matter with respect then you don't need my buisness. So I don't recommend staying here again.
1,"Worse experience ever , was so upset and the lady was so rude doing my nails . My nails were already quoted & as she was doing them I didn't like the shape then told me it was gonna be 5$ extra & started clipping my nails off .. she then didn't even shape correctly & didn't even put my gel coat on so horrible !!! SAVE UR MONEY GO OTHERWISE !!  Nails wernt even ; even !"
1,"Bad.. I truly can't believe they are still in business at this point. I ate here with 2 other people and not a single one of us liked what we ate. The manager that took our order was rude and not friendly at all. I over heard a conversation he had with a customer and he was so 'matter of fact' and not considerate at all. We left the Wok Box saying 'Well, we found a place we will never go to again.' Bad service, bad food, and bad vibes. Not a fan..."
1,"Came in Saturday with a friend upon entering we were loudly told ...no appointment you must go come back...called on Monday and made an appointment for 2 pedicures at 6pm the next day...arrived at 5:55 ..waited until we were told to go back to the pedicure baths at 6..the pedicure baths were still dirty and the foot support had lotion and something else gross  on it...a women came in filled up the foot bath with plain water and there we sat and sat for a half hour ..we finally had to leave when the pedicure water got cold...the entire time we waited Danny and Vincent were at the nail bar doing another employees nails while her friend who appeared to have too much wine kept placing her dirty pedicure slippers on top of the nail bar...Danny nor Vincent seemed to mind and cont chatting and laughing...upon leaving I told the rude young man who is always at the front that this was unacceptable and I would be leaving a bad review on Yelp..he responded with ""cool"""
1,"So this place has a free shuttle?  Well we scheduled our shuttle, and they much rather pic up someone at the airport than give someone A ride who has two rooms vs one, from the airport!    Ill never be back here and ill let everyone I know to ignore this place!  Being on your game is awesome!  Way to go!"
1,"Me and my boyfriend have been going here for a very long time. We always give cash for a tip, last week we went to eat for lunch and then when my boyfriend paid our bill using machine he put some 44cents tip and the rest is cash and then when I was supposed to ask my boyfriend to give me my wallet the waiter arrived to take the copy of the receipt and he then asked my boyfriend ""Why you give 44cents for tip?"" (That's the exact word) my boyfriend was shocked and then he told him ""It's not good you know"" with a disappointed and angry look , I told the waiter ""We're giving cash for the tip""then he walked out. When we looked at him he went at the back of their restaurant and hide. We're so disappointed because we always go here and this was the first time that we were treated like this, after that incident we decided to not give anymore additional tip, my boyfriend and i are both working in a restaurant too(customer service) but this is not how we treat customers, they don't even smile. We will never come back anymore!!!"
1,"Wasn't impressed at all in this place I went on a Friday around 4 somewhat close to their closing time. They were somewhat busy but not slammed, the whole time I felt very rushed. The ladies were rushing us so bad that they cut the back of my boyfriends foot from scrubbing too hard and fast. I don't have high Pinterest expectations on my nail design so I said whatever you're good at I'm fine with. The design came out looking horrible the simple flower looked like I did it and there is a reason why I don't do my nails. I ended up having to go somewhere else the next day. Also it wasn't very clean and I had these little gnats flying all over me. I don't like to leave bad reviews but this is the worst place I have been to."
1,"Just finished getting a pedi mani and under arm wax. Took about an hour, so not bad. I was spoken to exactly 3 times. Once to ask if I wanted additional services, once to ask what type of pedi I wanted and once to ask my color preference. They were so busy talking they couldn't even ask me to put my foot in the water, just shoved it in. Worst service. I used to come here quite often in the day time early hours. It's 6pm now. I asked when the owner was in, if he still came in during morning hours - I chatted him up often. ""Oh no he sold the place"" was the answer. Terrible staff. They might survive because of spring training is here now but GOOD LUCK in the summer. My advice to others seeking decent nail care - Tempe Marketplace has a salon or Spa and Nail Creations on McKellips and Stapley by Starbucks. 

Terrible service!!!!!"
1,"This is the worst management company ever!!!! I have had nothing but issues since moving into a property in Gilbert. We have issues from dead trees not being removed, smoke alarms continuously going off and a crappy air conditioning! These are just some of the issues we are dealing with! I would issue negative stars if I could!  On Q is not worried about their renters just that they get paid!"
1,Do not come here! I came here with two friends and the place was empty. I sat down to get a fill and there were ants everywhere. The lady doing my nails did not even say anything about the bugs so once I told her that there are ants all over the table and floor she cleaned them up. After taking color off one nails the ants were all back again. I told her I was done and she insisted I move to another table. I was so annoyed and grossed out that I just wanted to leave. This place is super dirty.
1,"Not really a fan. The mongolian beef was blah.  The meat was tough and some parts were crunchy.  The meat is very cheap quality.  Definitely not the same meat that's pictured on their display.  The rice was a bit raw in some of my bites. And overall they drowned my rice in the sauce.  I forced myself to eat half of it.  It's also pretty expensive.  $12 for my rice bowl, soda and 2 small eggrolls.  I would not come back again."
1,"So far this is a one star. Maybe it'll be updated. 
We called about resos & were told they wouldn't take any for under 10 people. 

While waiting I saw & heard people who had reservations for 4 & 6. So ok. I guess those numbers are bigger than 10. 

We came here to celebrated a bday. Three of us. Just the core group. & were told that our wait would be an hour.  

94 minutes later. After approaching hostess to check in at the 45 minute mark, I'm told it would be at least another 15.  While the  manager was looking at the list, I saw that two other 4 tops were seated before us although they were added to the waitlist after. I regret not taking a snap of it. 

We're hungry. Crabby. Pissed off. & no one, gas apologized for the delay. 
 Every time  I went to talk to hostess either the hostess or the manager were fielding other's complaints about the same thing. 

Highly unprofessional. Very rude. Non apologetic. The food better be amazing.  I've been here over 90 minutes. I'm. Not. Leaving. Without. Eating.   

Rant over."
1,"-No recommended at all!!! Racist and 
horrible customer service.  ZERO starts be better!!
Talking about been RACIST well then this is the place.  I walk in got an bad welcome and got seated to wait since I did not have an appointment. Ok with that since i did not have an appointment. 
15 minutes after, a couple walk-in asking if they can be seen ""no appointment either"" few minutes after they got seated and a Vietnamese guy start doing their pedicure, even though I got there 20 minutes before them. 
Waited few minutes though to my self maybe the other girls will see me in few minutes but to my surprise I guess I had wait even longer and not been see right away for been a latino person.
I will not recommend this place to anyone, for the bad customer service and been racist."
1,"I went there for lunch with a friend. They sat us at a table, and I noticed a dead fly on my plate. As the waiter sat us, he noticed it also. He took the plate, and the tried to throw the dead fly on the floor without us noticing. He didn't replace the plate. I told him that I saw the dead fly, but he said that our server will get us another plate. 

We obviously left the restaurant. Poor service means poor quality food. DON'T EAT HERE!!!"
1,"BUYER BEWARE!!! Horrible customer service. San Tan Location!!! 

Bought a new KItchenAid $1200 dishwasher. Paid Spencer's to install it. Installer had to read manual while sitting in my home to understand how to install it (gotta be kidding me!). 

It didn't work after being installed!!! (installer didn't stay to check if worked properly). 

Called to speak with Manager (Wayne) who said Spencer's would only REPAIR IT and not allow me to return it OR even send me out a new one. Unbelievable to me that I am repairing my $1200 KitchenAid dishwasher before it has even run one full cycle!!! Someone should have stayed or at least called me a few hours later to make sure it works properly. And if it's broken, replace it or give me a refund... 

A service tech (not the original installer) came out a few days later to inspect the dishwasher and he said it was broken and needed parts. Would take days to get those in... 

Called Wayne again and he said this is ""HOW THE APPLIANCE BUSINESS WORKS"" when I asked him about repairing it instead of replacing it or giving me my money back. Wayne promised to call me Tuesday after repairs were made and, of course, he never called. 

After multiple service attempts and my wife having to be at home from ""8 to noon"" multiple days to accommodate service repair techs, and after 2 weeks without a working dishwasher, it was evident that the dishwasher was bad and Spencer's was forced by KitchenAid to replace the dishwasher. Wayne should have offered to replace it to begin with! 

As for Wayne's statement about ""this is how the appliance business works"", I called 4 competitors to see what they would do in my scenario: 
COSTCO - return to store within 90 days for FULL REFUND 
BEST BUY - return to store within 15 days for FULL REFUND 
HOME DEPOT - return to store within 48 hrs for NEW PRODUCT or FULL REFUND 
SEARS - return to store within 60 days for NEW PRODUCT of FULL REFUND 

Spencer's wouldn't even stand by their product for 2 hours, let alone days/weeks like the above merchants would. They basically just sold me a faulty dishwasher, installed it for $150 and then washed their hands of it without even making sure it worked once! Then left me dealing with the KitchenAid 1 year manufacturer's warranty to try to fix it. Spencer's never even followed up once to see if the overall issue had been resolved. 

Next time, I'll take my money elsewhere and you should too!"
1,"Where do I even begin?

From the get go, this company has been difficult to deal with- unwilling to work with us or mitigate any problem we are having.  Here's a little highlight of what we have been dealing with, starting with the most urgent.

1.  The dishwasher has been broken for 3 weeks with 3 inches of putrid water sitting stagnant at the bottom.  Mold and mildew is growing (https://www.epa.gov/mold/mold-and-health), and we now have a disgusting black fly problem as a result.  We run a practice which requires us to be at the office from 8 am until 6 pm Monday through Friday and so it is nearly impossible for us to miss work.  They required us to miss work for the technician, who diagnosed the problem not worth fixing (as the serial number on the machine is missing and he said this meant it likely 'fell off a truck' if you catch my drift) and recommended it be replaced. 
Now, I am not an expert on dishwashers, but when the technician says it will cost $450 dollars to replace a pump on a cheap dishwasher w/ several broken rollers for the racks, or $600 dollars to replace it with a german designed Bosch dishwasher with a 5 year warranty and Home Depot/ Lowe's happy to install it on Saturdays for free and remove the old broken machine, what is the decision here?  It seems to me like a no-brainer.  

  Instead of taking his recommendation, they contracted a different technician from another company. We personally called the first technician, who was very nice and honest who said his boss, who owns the company,  would have been happy to make a special trip on a Saturday to accommodate and I highly recommend, us who undercut their prices to fix the broken part.  As we already missed one day of work to accommodate them, we are unable to do so again in such a short period of time.  They are unwilling to work with us and requested we pay the difference for the new maintenance company who undercut the other excellent technician and his company, if we want service on the weekends.  

They are also unwilling to send a representative from their company to supervise maintenance during the week when we are not home (we are not comfortable leaving a key, we have already had someone steal several items from a car left outside in the short month we have lived here.)  

We first contacted them on September 22nd regarding this, today is October 12th, 3 weeks after the fact and this picture posted it what it looks like today, with disgusting putrid water that has been sitting stagnant for 3 whole weeks.

So, as they are unwilling to work with us at all with this, a broken machine has been sitting growing mold and flies for the past 3 weeks.  Meanwhile, we are getting plenty of practice hand washing dishes.  They do seem completely capable of depositing our rent checks on time, however.

2.  When we moved in, the silicone lining to the washing machine was embedded with mildew and black mold.  (See above link that highlights the connection between black mold and cancer.)  We asked them to replace or clean it, and WE ended up cleaning the machine by scrubbing it with bleach.  Why were we cleaning a washing machine in a home that was advertised as ""move-in ready""?  We did enjoy spending our Labor Day at the local laundromat on the weekend we moved in  (who had clean washing machines at least.)

3.  They require professional cleaning of the house and pristine maintenance of the lawn but the house was not move in ready and the lawn was absolutely unkept (sunburnt to oblivion).  The lemon tree in the backyard was encroaching upon the neighbor to the back of us who in our first week of moving on contacted us to trim it.  Which is of course our responsibility and my sweetheart spent the weekend at home depot to buy a saw and spent our weekend off to trim the tree which had been obviously overgrown for months, if not years.  Additionally, why must we professionally clean the house when we were provided with a washing machine that required deep and intensive cleaning before we were even able to utilize it..

4.  When we moved in we were given a mail key but not the mail box number or the location of the mailbox.  Their answer was, ""let us ask the owner"" and it took a week and a half for them to get us the answer.  How do they not know the mailbox number of a property they manage?

5.  They have no authority whatsoever.  Every decision must go through the owner, this makes every decision take twice, or thrice as long.  In my past experience w/ property managers, usually small repairs and appliance repairs under a certain dollar amount are repaired or replaced even asking the owners and the owners just pay the bill when it comes in the mail.  I thought that was the entire point of property management - so you don't have to deal with trivial matters such as dishwasher replacement."
1,"I don't care how affordable this place is, you're getting exactly the quality that you're paying for. Went there with a friend last night for dinner & drinks. Between us both we ordered oysters ($1/ea with the purchase of a drink), the ""must-try"" spicy squid tentacles, the salmon crackers and the vegetable tempura. The oysters were AWFUL - served only slightly colder than room temperature and all the shells full of melted ice water. This was SO bad that my friend and I, huge fans of oysters, didn't even finish our orders. The ""must-try"" squid tentacles were overcooked and over-battered, making them not only chewy, but hard as well. The only thing that hadn't been screwed up was the vegetable tempura, and I imagine you'd have to be pretty hard-pressed to really mess up deep-fried vegetables.

Our (main) server was really nice, and offered us 10% off for our unfinished oysters. However he explained that this resto has just recently come under new management and are still working out the kinks. He also explained that between the English/Korean/Chinese waitstaff and the Mandarin-speaking cooks, there is often a communication issue. I hope that this is indeed the sole issue, and one they can fix. I, however, will not be returning to find out."
1,Worst service ever !! Been here several times and none of the bartenders actually want to be there.
1,I first walked in and they were rude. I Paid $35 for a crappy full set of nails. The guy messed up on my nails and didn't bother to fix it. In the middle of my manicure he was on the phone the whole time and I noticed one of the other guys doing nails stops and goes in the back to do pull ups... I will ever come here again.
1,Do not come here. I went in and asked for acrylics for my engagement pictures this weekend. I told the young nail tech doing my nails I wanted short oval/ rounded nails. She gave me long coffin nails and I thought she was just giving herself the room to work with the acrylics and really mold them so I didn't say anything. When I asked her if she could make them shorter she got ANGRY and rude. She began ANGRILY clipping my nails. She clipped them down and I still can't type this because of how long the awful nails are. She was super rude and telling me it couldn't be done. Then she started telling me it was going to be 5 extra dollars. Of course i told her it was fine I didn't mind paying but if she was going to be rude I could just go someplace else. Her manager had to come over and take me away from her station. I am leaving- paying for whatever half asses job she did and never coming back. I hope I've saved someone from an awful experience. Getting my nails done is something I look forward to and I love relaxing and ending my week with it. That was not my experience today.
1,"Yikes. So awkward. Ladies just yelling (""talking"") back at forth at each other. ZERO client interaction. The few customers that were in here looked uncomfortable. Good for just getting a pedicure and getting the hell out. If looking for a relaxing experience, go somewhere else"
1,"The guy doing my acrylic nails cut me with one of his tools and it was very painful. Not to mention he was very rushed and rough with my nails. My friend who had been there a few weeks prior had the same employee as me and she was cut as well. Needless to say, I'm scared to go back!"
1,"Last straw for me! I've been coming to this place for years and I loved the previous owners. There was a noticeable change when the place changed hands, but I continued to come here because it was close to home and conveniently located near other stores where I often shop.  That being said, it hasn't been a great experience most the time. I have vowed not to return on several occasions. There is one technician who is obviously not thrilled with her job. She always rushes through my manicures. And I can't even tell you how many times I've watched her answer her cell phone and YELL and CUSS at whoever is on the other end.....in the middle of doing someone's nails!! She's done this to me...using both her hands to paint my nails, using her shoulder to hold her phone to her ear and screaming and cussing into the phone, but also screaming into my face since I'm sitting across from her. I guess the only reason I put up with it is because it's a hassle to go somewhere else further away. But this last visit was the last straw!! I went in for a pedicure on Aug. 9th. (Today is the 25th, so it's been 16 days) The tech, who I had never seen before, cut me a few times while cutting back my cuticle on my toes. This is not a big deal...it happens from time to time. The problem doesn't come til she puts her gloves on and starts applying the callous remover gel. She puts it all over the bottom of my feet BUT THEN PUTS IT ON TOP AND ALL OVER THE TOP OF MY TOES!! By the time she's got it slathered on top of all my toes it's starting to burn more and more. I told her it's burning and she just nodded and said, ""Almost. Almost."" She got out a file/grater thing and scrubbed the bottom of my feet and used a loofah thing on top of my toes. By this time I was in real pain. I said, ""It's really burning bad."" She finally put my feet into the water and I was rubbing my feet together to try to get all the gel stuff off. Long story short...it burned and was painful all night. We were catching a flight that night or I would've went back and complained. I had to spend my entire vacation with red, puffy, infected toes. And one place on the inside of my foot was eaten away from the callous remover and it became very infected too. I'm posting pics of a few of the effected areas as they look today. Keep in mind, it's been 16 days. I should've taken pics of what they looked like 2 weeks ago, but I was on vacation and busy doing other things...like finding ways of hiding my hideous infected toes."
1,"I love Hibatchi, but sadly Sumo did not live up to my expectations.

They really need more servers, as ours was spread very, very thin. Plus they really should have cooled the restaurant down more than they did. Everyone at our table was very overheated.

Our chef cooked ALL the proteins at the same time, and was not quick enough to avoid overdoing the shrimp and calamari.
I've never seen a Hibatchi chef start all proteins at the same time, and now I understand why. Quality goes down for all.

The prices were decent, and Hibatchi dishes included fried rice. The ingredients seemed fresh, if only they were cooked properly.

To us, Sumo was just not worth the 30 minute car ride to eat dinner there."
1,I had an appointment at 630 sat there for 30 mins waiting this lady comes in sits for 10 mins doesn't have an appointment and gets service I don't want to say they racist but I feel like they are ! That was so unprofessional and pissed me off !
1,"My wife and I went today for breakfast, and the restaurant was somewhat crowded, but it cleared up after about 15 minutes.  We were seated quickly, and my wife ordered the French Slam, and I ordered the All American Slam.  I told the waitress before she ever left to bring extra butter and hot syrup.  She said okay.  When our food came, the eggs looked like they had been sitting for a while, and the bacon was not cooked all the way, even though we both specifically asked for well-done bacon.  There was no hot syrup, so I asked the waitress again, and she said she'd bring it.  After about 10 minutes, I got up, because I saw the waitress, and she looked like she had no intentions whatsoever of bringing the syrup.  I went over and asked another waitress if we could get some hot syrup, and she said, ""We don't  do hot syrup."" She then looked at our waitress and said, ""We don't do hot syrup anymore.""  Our waitress just shrugged her shoulders and turned around, so I spoke to the manager who was nearby.  She explained that someone, maybe an employee, had burned themself once before, so no more hot syrup.  If that were the case, why would our waitress acknowledge that she would bring some each time we asked?  Why not just say when she took our order that they don't do that, and my wife would have just ordered something else?  Don't they serve hot coffee? This is our fourth time going there in the last two weeks, and they have served us hot syrup in a cute little ceramic container each time, along with many other customers, so maybe this is something new?  The manager heated up some syrup in a small bowl that they usually put creamer in, and told us that if we wanted hot syrup next time to ask our server to place some under a warming light while they are making our food so that we can get it warm.  I don't think I'll be eating syrup that's been sitting open in a bowl, under a light, for 10? 15? 20? minutes while my food is cooking.  Like I said, this was the fourth time going back there, and the service was great twice and lousy twice.  To all the other customers we saw receiving horrible service today, stick with Black Bear Diner or the Original Pancake House."
1,"06-25-18 Walked in to Spencer's at San Tan Mall immediately approached by a sales person named Kent. His pitch went fine. I purchased three items: 
Water softener 
Clothes dryer [Gas]
R/O water filter
Pricing was same as everywhere else, Kent was personable. 
Used Spencer's for delivery and install of all purchased items.
At the time of purchase Kent stated ""an email confirming delivery is on its way""  I Still haven't gotten that email. 
6-26-18 Day of delivery for my new dryer. The delivery driver Carlos was professional and courteous. However Kent ordered an electric dryer to replace my existing gas dryer. When asked about this via phone at delivery time Kent's answer was ""I assumed you were electric, 99% of the valley is"". 
Unfortunately, I wasted an entire day waiting for a late delivered wrong item. The gas dryer Kent then ordered for me added an additional 100.00 to the cost and an additional $123.00 for install after Kent ""discounted"" the purchase price. I can neither verify or deny if there was a discount because this was done over the phone and not at the time of my original purchase.
No service recovery offered by Spencer's except to deliver the correct dryer two days later Kent did say he was ""not going to charge me an additional delivery fee"". 
Carlos was definitely the saving grace on this portion of my Spencer's Appliance experience.
 
I do know that after install of the the 499.00 dryer it actually ended up costing me $622.00. Oh yea, it also cost me two full days out of work. 

07-06-18 A week in with my new dryer and it works great. But, I'm waiting for my other two items to be delivered and installed today by Ameri-flow. 
I was given a delivery/install time of 7a-11a , it's now 12:15. I was supposed to get a call this am...  That didn't happen either. So at 10:15 I called Ameri-flow. The person that answered was very apologetic and told me the tech was tied up, that ""I could go run errands, if I needed to"" that ""the tech will be there well after 12"". Again no offer for service recovery. 

At 12:15 I called to speak with the Spencer's store manager Larry, because I still hadn't gotten my delivery Larry was tied up.
12:30 Larry the store manager called me back. He was courteous and apologetic. Larry explained the tech would be at my house in 15 min. He offered to double my dryer warranty from one year to 2 years at no charge, to make amends for the dryer issue. I accepted. 
1:15 Tech still not at my house but he did call.  
1:30 Matt the technician arrived from Ameri-flow. He was very apologetic, courteous and professional. He did an excellent job on all of the install work and his explanations of the equipment made it all make sense when he completed the install. He cleaned up all of the mess and left no trace of any work done. 

I give one star to Spencer's for dropping the ball several times. They did very little to make things right.
I also give Ameri-flow's office one star for zero effort at service recovery.

I give Carlos the Truck driver/deliverer/installer 
5 stars. He was a pro and it showed!

I give Matt the Truck driver/deliverer/technician/installer 5 stars. He was a pro and it showed as well. 

Spencer's should send all of their people out with these two gentleman to train on how to provide great service and customer care. 

7-7-18  Called Spencer's today to ask Larry to clarify the charges on my invoice. This time Larry was curt, less than helpful and actually hung up while I was mid sentence trying to explain there were no hard feelings to him.  

Bottom line: Spencer's customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. Knowing what I know now, I should have spent my 2000.00+ dollars elsewhere.
When I purchase the other appliances I need later this year, I will absolutely take my dollars elsewhere."
1,"I went for pedicures with a girlfriend as that is ""girl time"" for me.  I asked them to wait to start my pedicure as my girlfriend was a few min late,  Not only did they disregard my request to have our pedicures together, but they defended this decision, saying they had a lot of people to serve and had to keep things moving.  We essentially were separated for 90% of the time we hoped to be together.  Moreover, what they have advertised on their website did not match the pedi offerings in their on site menu and when I pointed this out, they again took no ownership and blamed me for not reading the menu on site.  In today's world, I cannot imagine defending incorrect or outdated info on your website when that is the primary way people find your business.  I would discourage my friends from even considering Lotus Nails Bar and Spa- awful customer service and the actual pedicure was of poor quality."
1,"When searching for new digs, it doesn't get much worse than a property management company that never responds, despite your multiple communication efforts, persistence and patience. 

Zero responsiveness is a red flag to be taken seriously. Score of ""FAILED"" to On Q."
1,"Spencers has the worst customer service ever. We bought a top of the line Whirlpool Washer & Dryer. $2600.....It had issues from the first week. It shuts off trying to start and won't dispense soap. Sometimes it takes 30+ tries to start. We have been using soap pods since the first week.That was December. It is now mid April. The service company they contract..Goldwing Service has been here 3 times attempting to fix. We requested they replace the washeer & dryer. . Spencers says Whirlpool,has to do that. Whirlpool says it is up to Spencers to do it. Back and forth. Now they want to replace the computer board. The only day I can be here is Saturday. Goldwing calls at 8:30am and says they'll be here 3-5PM...I said I would like it in the morning...they say they have no control over the days schedule...now is has been scheduled 3 weeks ago.....this is the 4th attempt to fix it. I call Whirlpool and what a coinidenece..they don't find any service records of the other 3 times here. they say they have no control over Goldwings scheduling. Yet they subcontract them. And I find it funny..we went to Spencers to complain and the unit we choose was off the floor. My guess is they gave us the demo. Of course they say not. It's just out of stock and on order. I was told by my son not to use Spencers as he had a bad experience with a Fridge he bought from them. I would never go to Spencers again. Unfortunately I'm stuck with this piece of crap washer now...unless I play the Discount tire lady and return it to them...DO NOT USE SPENCERS"
1,"Had a very bad experience with Spencer's and their service company, Gold Wing in Mesa.  These guys are recommended by Spencer's?  Really?  Wow...Spencer's needs to get a new service company, because these guys are HORRIBLE.  

My two year fridge went out...yep...two years...Whirlpool...how do you like them apples?  I called Spencer's on 2/12/15.  After I bitched about the refrigerator dying after two years, all Spencer's did was ask me if I had an extended warranty...nice, eh?  Really showing a lot of compassion there Spencer's...last time I drop thousands there.  So they gave me the name of Gold Wing.  I called them on 2/12/15 and they said that they could not get anyone out on 2/13 and that it would have to be 2/14, and that someone would call me BY 8:30 on 2/14 and give me a two hour window for that day.  I said fine.  2/14 comes and no call by 8:30.  Of course I have to call them and I did and they said that someone came by yesterday...caught them in that lie.  I work from home and was home all day.  No one came by.  No one.  No doorbell, no nothin'.  They lied.  Flat out.  The girl on the phone was quick to blame ""Virgina""...and I said oh no...it's ""Gold Wing's"" fault, as a company.  So she said someone will call me sometime during the day, so I still have no idea what time they are coming, or even if.  No one has called yet.  So I called Spencer's to file a complaint and Spencer's gave me the run around as well.  Doing the same thing that the receptionist at Gold Wing did, BFD...and thanks for selling me this $1,200 piece of crap Spencer's.

So now I sit, on a Saturday, living out of a cooler, with a 2-year old fridge that is dead, with absolutely no help from the manufacturer, distributor, or service provider, all of which asked straight away if I had a service contract, sure enough, but not if they can provide anything remotely resembling service.  Stay away from Whirlpool, Spencer's and Gold Wing...      

I gave everyone one star because I had to...if I could I would give them NO stars, and even that would be generous.  Stay away from Spencer's in San Tan Village Gilbert!"
1,Been there a few times and the experience with my nails is decent but today I kept telling the lady I didn't like the shape or color and she added the gel without my consent and decided to charge me more for the crappy nail shape she did when before I never got charged $40 for plain nail if I had a design maybe but this was plane ass. Hate my nails don't know why I paid I just didn't want to be there anymore but I'm going back to complain and demand they fix them.
1,"The worst property management company ever. They should be reported and have their license revoked. They do not care for your property, they overcharge for the work they do have completed if they ever get around to fixing things. Beware! Tennants and landlords both should avoid on q at all costs!"
1,"We have visited this particular location 3 times and the service is just terrible. The staff is rude and arrogant. They may not be fluent in english but they can atleast be courteous and polite and greet with a smile. The light fixture above our table was covered with dust. Although the food is decent, the attitude of the staff compells me to not recommend this location. Poorly managed.
I have been to Congee Queen near Steels and Woodbine and its far better in taste and service."
1,"This is the worst company that I have ever dealt with. I saw an add in the paper for a dish washer. They did not have it. I ordered another dishwasher. It worked for a short time, and it stopped working. Spencer's wanted $80,00 to come out and look to see what was wrong. I called an electrician. He said that the wiring was shorting out. He fixed the problem, and said he would get his money from Spencer's. He said that he had run into problems with their repair men before, and that Spencer's would pay his bill. Now the dishwasher isn't attached properly. Spencer's guy said that someone took out the piece of wood holding he dishwasher in place. He said he would get 'clips' to attach it. He never called back. The person at the store said that they would get in touch with the man, and have him call me. He never called. Now the store will do nothing, and I will need someone to install the small piece of wood. I hate being lied too. If they were not going to send someone out  the second time, why didn't they just say so, instead of lying? I would never deal with this company again, nor would I recommend it, to anyone."
1,"Our family placed an order.  Not only did the order take 45 minutes but it was literally served to other folks across from us.  Thankfully it didn't go unnoticed.  Food was contaminated, picked up by one server and taken to the back and brought back out by a different server.  GROSS

The food was literally going to be served to us until I mentioned what had happened.  I wasn't given the option to have a whole new badge of food made instead I had to ask.  I felt uneasy so decided to let management know we were leaving.  

One star it too much..."
1,"I want to start by saying if I was only reviewing the pedicures I've gotten here, this would be a 4 star rating but....

Absolutely, hands down, the worst manicure I've ever received. I can't believe I even agreed to pay $45 for it. 

First, he was going so fast in an attempt to just get onto the next customer that as he was filing my nails, he sliced my finger open and fixed it with basically super glue with no warning. Just threw some on a cotton round AFTER I pointed out the fact that I was bleeding and smeared it right on. Not generally what I'm used to when getting a mani. 

Second, when I asked to have the corners rounded a little bit he told me ""in a little bit"" and then completely ignored my request the next time I brought it up before he applied the nail color. His response after was that they would round out as o typed through the week. So far my furious typing on this review has left my nails solid squares. 

My nails are all different lengths and not consistent at all. My cuticles look terrible. He scraped his hand against one of my fingers while applying the top coat and did not fix it so now I have a smeared nail. The acrylic doesn't even cover my entire nails so the sides are just open messes of extensions, glue, and poorly prepped natural nail. And the underside of everything is just a mess of chunks and rough. His response to me when I came back from washing my hands and he told me I was done, was to keep washing my hands- it will come off eventually. 

Now, all in all, I could maybe consider a two star for this except for the fact that I had my nails done for the wedding I'm in tomorrow. 

I will never be returning to this location."
1,I hate to give this place a one star. We always eat here when we come to vegas. We did not know it was not Todd English anymore. The food became before we even got our water!!!  And the food sucked and so did the service. NEVER AGAIN!!!
1,"Ive been coming here for a few months.  Girl that originally did my nails did a perfect job.  Fast forward to this past week.  Came in last sunday, got a fill. Added gel polish for extra $10.  Went home, took shower and gel starts snagging everything.  Gel eventually chips off 8 of 10 nail.  Granted they fixed and repolished that next tuesday.  However the lady i believe filed too much with electric file.  I went home after and 2 nails broke same night.  3rd next day.  I came in yet a 3rd time this week and had to pay again. Between me and my daughter we spend over $400 a month on services at this salon.  I will take my business elsewhere. Its not the fact that i had to pay, its the attitude and lack of customer service"
1,"Not worth the money. We were in their yesterday and based on the good reviews we tried it out. I should have taken a picture of my steak sandwich. There was hardly any meat. I could have gotten more at Dominoes for half the price. It was mostly just bread, tomatoes and onions. 

My wife got a quarter chicken which was about the size of a quarter lol.

Seeing as this place has only been open for 2 weeks you would think they would be serving it better. We won't be back.

Oh and btw, the terrace bar upstairs which supposedly had views of the city I guess meant views of Plaza Midwood since I couldn't see uptown at all."
1,"Worst place ever.  Went for a pedicure and left bleeding and going to the ER.  26 stitches later.  Extremely negligent.  Do not go.  They do not clean properly and inspect their equipment.  They use plastic bags over the bowls so they don't have to disinfect.  The bowl broke on my foot.  My foot was bleeding very badly and they tried to put cotton on it to stop the bleeding.  I drove myself to the ER.  They didn't even call an ambulance or even offer.  As I was leaving they were mopping the floor with a dry mop to soak up the blood, and water that was everywhere.  Would not even give it a 1 star."
1,"My sisters and I went in to get 1 manicure and two pedicures. We were in a time crunch and they took us in very quickly. Nice. Once my feet hit the water, the lady working on my feet started clipping away. It wasn't until she started scrubbing my feet, that I noticed they don't use sterilized tools. After she scrubbed my feet, she scrubbed the tub and let the water drain and put the tools right back in her basket. The man working in my sister dropped his tools multiple times, picked them up, tossed them back in the basket, waited, and grabbed them to use them again. Once we were finished, toes dried, my lady dried her hands, pulled her basket over to another customer and used the same tools to do her manicure. Very unsanitary. Without shock, two weeks later, I am still trying to treat a toe infection from how poorly she cut my big toe and cut my skin. 

Very quick service. Just very unsanitary!"
1,"We got there and grill by us were just finishing up. We got our food as other people left. As we were eating, the grill next to us was being clean. Imagine our surprise and disgust as the lady cleaning the grill dumped the water from the people who just left on the grill to clean it!!!! Needless to say, lost my appetite!!!! No desire to go back!!!"
1,"I wish I could give this company zero stars.  I rented one of their rental properties in Scottsdale.  I had to move out due to a domestic violence issue (where a restraining order was given) for mine and my son's protection in the home.  I had to leave before my lease was over (by law with a restraining order, you can do that). I reached out to the company to notify them of the issue.  They were not sincere nor seemed very concerned about the issue.  They took several days getting back to me before letting me out of my lease.  When I vacated the property, I took pictures and a video walking through the house to show that I left the property in excellent condition.  Normally a representative would meet at the house to do the walk through together, however the company said that no one was available to do that.  About a week later, I received my security deposit back in the mail, I only received $275 OUT OF A $2000 security deposit.  The company and owners stated that I left the house in a horrible condition, they had to replace the wall plaster left from curtains that were hung (the curtains were hung with Command hooks that stick to the wall, NO HOLES were drilled), there were large holes drilled into the roof for a Directv dish (I had permission from the owner BEFORE moving in that I could install the dish), and that the front door lock was broken and needed to be replaced.  It was also stated that a door slat was broken on the lower floor, it was not.  I called and asked to see the receipts from the work that was done on the home and they stated that they did not have receipts, they just billed me for what it was the usual ""going rate"" for someone to fix these items.  I was enraged, I even asked to speak to the lead manager, Eric Dixon.  He told me that there was nothing he could do and that I should be happy that they even let me out of the lease in the first place because they didn't have to (and that I really needed to let it go on what they charged me and just walk away).  He also stated that normally the prices are much higher and they actually gave me a ""deal"".  I couldn't believe this.  I was desperate to leave with my son and I knew I was being taken advantage of because I did NOT leave the house this way.  Coincidentally, after I moved out, the owners put the house on the market.  They had an open house about a month after I moved out.  I went over to the open house with a couple of witnesses to see the finished ""work"" that I was charged for.  The curtains were STILL HANGING in the house!! The SAME curtains that they had charged me for that had put ""holes"" in the wall.  The front door lock was THE SAME front door lock that I had at the time I occupied the residence.  The cleanliness of the house was the same as when I moved out.  I took pictures of everything and contacted an attorney (and then sent my before and after photos).  My attorney sent a letter to On Q within a couple days stating that they had to send the rest of my security deposit over immediately due to no proof/receipts of ""work"" and that they simply had lied and took all of my money when they really didn't do what they had charged me for.  I received the remainder of my security deposit within 48 hours.  Seriously, DO NOT DO BUSINESS with this company.  SUCH SCAMMERS and VERY VERY SHADY people.  They do not have your best interest, they only want your money and will find anyway to take advantage of you if given the opportunity.  YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED."
1,"Please read my entire review, the most important is the last part of my review. They are a Terrible company all the way around. All they care about is $. Have a problem, send the work to the other company they own, then over charge and do shoddy work. As a landlord, I had 4 different property managers on my account in less than a year. Then the assistant property managers changed like musical chairs. No coordination and no follow through. I had to educate the property manager about landlord tenant law. Completely unknowledgeable. Save. your money and frustration and find a different company. They are just terrible. I had something go wrong every month this last year. Not one month did everything go smooth. They were completely unable to admit their problems and work towards being a better company. They are stuck in reverse. I was a fool and and idiot not to have fired them the first month I used them. They emailed me to get permission to replace my water heater. No questions, just wanted approval for a new water heater. What they didn't know and didn't ask, was that it was brand new, only 2 weeks old and never used. If I had gone along with them, I would have gotten another new water heater. They jumped right away to get their other company business to just put in a new water heater. They refused to make anything right that they screwed up. Terrible management and customer service, just terrible. If just one person stays away from On Q because of my review, I have done my job. I just hope you people reading this understand that I have never done a review on anything before. This was so bad that I felt I had to try to help people save their money, time and frustration. Let me list one more experience. They called me to tell me that the A/C unit was ""dying and needs to be replaced"". They sent their company out, who didn't give me a report, but charged me $87 to tell me that my entire system needed to be replaced, for a total of over $7000. I called another A/C company I just picked out of the phone book. They went out and reported back that the system is fully functional and working as it should and meets all Arizona codes. Lets see, their company charges for a proposal which should be free and my guy says everything is fine. I have had 3 inspections this last year and all say everything is fine. Why was the only company that said it all needed to be replaced their own company? They have hounded me and hounded me to ""just replace everything"". I finally fired them yesterday. I have had enough.

Here is an update, I sent them a bill for my time for teaching their property manager about Arizona landlord tenant law. One of the owners, Eric responded by offering to bribe me to take down my review. I have attached his email below. This is the most unethical company I have ever dealt with. 

According to the BBB, the following is considered a bribe and illegal in Arizona. 


Hi Jim,

I'm reaching out on behalf of On Q, as an owner and the Designated Broker.  

Based on the e-mail communication alone, my understanding is that you are not satisfied with how things have gone recently.  I'm sorry it has come to this... Contrary to what you probably believe, we take these types of situations very seriously.  We've seen landlords get sued, lose thousands of dollars, lose in court, etc for this exact thing.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe we'll see eye-to-eye on what needs to happen with this air conditioner.  That is why it is best we terminate our business relationship.

That said, I don't hold it against you that you disagree with what our stance is.  That is totally fair, and you're going to either manage the property yourself or hire a different PM firm to handle things your way.  Fair enough, and I do hope it works out for you in the future. 

Frankly, I would like to end this on positive note, as best we all can.

You feel like we haven't held up our end of the deal and in turn, are now demanding $250.  And if we don't pay, you'll sue us and write nasty reviews online.  Well... nasty reviews have already been posted.

I propose that we figuratively *shake hands* and go our separate ways... you remove the reviews (Google, Yelp, etc), and I'll write you a check for $250.  Simply, let's put this behind us.  

Getting into the nitty gritty of responding to the reviews, fighting back and forth, and so on will not get us anywhere.  I want to learn from this as a whole, and move forward.  I'm sure you'd like to do the same.

Thanks for taking the time to understand my point of view.  Look forward to hearing from you and putting this behind us.  

Talk soon,"
1,"My family is a big fan of PEI Wei, so decided to try wok box as an alternative for take out..... Not a good experience. Their ""large"" portion actually come in a small box and the dish is mixed with the rice, which means by the time you get home its mostly a soggy mess and there is no recognizable sauce left... I found the chicken and or steak to dry and tasteless (it looks like its pre-cooked and reheated)....
I should have taken a hint when I walked in on a Friday at 7pm and I was the only customer....
Sad to say, but I will resume driving the extra mile to go to pei Wei."
1,"Our car was robbed in the Tahiti parking lot.. at 2 am... No staff warned us at check in... We left 3 bags in our vehicle as it was raining in Vegas? Smashed window. We spent the night getting a new car... No sleep spoke to manager on duty in the AM... They know they have a problem, yet they have no cameras in parking area... the night staff couldn't even give me the number to the police...STAY AWAY"
1,"So we recently stayed at this hotel. We stayed there partly because we are Hilton members and partly because they have Global airport parking provided on their property. Never again. The first night was wonderful. I don't know if they upgraded our room or what but it was beautiful. When we returned 4 days later it was hellish. Or room had one of those air conditioners that sounds like a truck, but only when the compressor was running. 

When the compressor ran it was like having a semi in the room. The television could not be heard. This wasn't just noise it was unsleepable noise. After trying to get moved at 10:30 they promised to comp our room. Hurray! No sleep but the night is free. Only it wasn't. 

I just checked my credit card bill. The prepaid room was not only not comped but it was double billed with an extra $50 incidentals charge. I did talk to someone in the Hilton organization about this and they say they commonly bill a $50 incidental charge in case you bill anything to the room and they remove it when you check out. But we checked out two weeks ago. Hilton promises to resolve the situation but I didn't need the stress of finding $350 in unexpected charges in my bill and not finding my refund. Btw. The refund still isn't showing. I won't be staying there again. 

The first night was great. The second was horrid and they are still being horrid as I still see those pending charges on my credit card."
1,"So many amazing and delicious restaurants in Vegas - but this is absolutely not one of them. Do NOT make the same mistake as us. Avoid at all costs. Just awful. They're not even trying or care. 

1/2 hour wait for patio seating? Even though tables are empty and are not reserved. Fish and Chips, Burger, Fries, Wings, Breakfast - ALL terrible and cold too. 

The place is nice and bright enough though with plenty of TVs to catch sporting events. Shame. In an emergency it may be alright to have an overpriced drink/beer only. But you will most definitely be disappointed and rank this as one of your worst dining experiences ever. 

Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money."
1,"I travel every week.  I stay in Hampton s a lot.  
This one is not up to par.   The shuttle never arrived after an hour.  No one cared.  It's in a warehouse area and doesn't feel very safe.  

So disappointed"
1,"When there is a hair in your food it kills your appetite. When the workers aren't very apologetic and friendly it makes it even worse. When we came in they weren't very friendly. Getting our food didn't take very long. I asked for sour cream but there was a misunderstanding because I wasn't given any. I went back up and asked for it and was charged $1.08 for a small cup. I started to eat my food and it was very good. I noticed a black hair in mine. I went back up and pointed it out to them. They acted like it wasn't a big deal. They got me another taco. So if you want unfriendly service, good food, and a hair in your food then come here."
1,"We moved in to a messy house that we spent 6 hours cleaning prior to moving in. We were told the house would be clean at move In. Instead we were welcomed with burnt out lightbulbs, garage openers that didn't work, garbage disposal that didn't work, paint debris left all over the house, and filthy uncleaned carpet. Upon move out it was difficult to get response from the leasing manager (who ""had no idea"" of these things from move in). They took money from our deposit for paint and lightbulbs upon move out. I feel taken advantage of and robbed of our money. The deposit took 3 weeks to receive. Any issues we had took way too long to address and it was a terrible renting experience."

1,"I got a ""gift certificate"" in the mail for this place. When I went to redeem it, they said it didn't count for anything we bought. I brought up my concerns with the manager, who was equally unfriendly and unaccommodating.

Beware of their shady, false advertising! Don't use their ""free"" gift certificates you get in the mail."
1,"If only Yelp had zero star ratings... this company would get one. 

If you have a three year old in your family, you'd be better off having them do your nails then going here. 

I personally haven't been here, but my sister and her friend went here last night. That's when the day took a turn for the worse. When she told me that the owner is the one who did her nails, I was expecting a fabulous review and nails that looked stupendous. You could imagine my surprise when she was rather upset - and more importantly - uncomfortable and in pain. 

As you can see in the attached photos, the salon owner (she believes his name is Denny, but it may be Danny), either doesn't know where a cuticle ends and a finger begins or simply doesn't care - both which make him not only unqualified to own a nail salon, but even more so to do nails. 

Obviously, my sister and her friend displayed a level of annoyance, as I'm sure many would do in a situation that they were in - where someone providing a service doesn't take responsibility. This resulted in both of their nail totals being up charged $5.00 from the displayed, and agreed upon, price. I can only imagine this would have happened because he didn't think he would have gotten a tip - which at least he would've been knowledgeable enough to read the room and understand that. But to up charge because he did an awful job... why is the customer paying for that?

This... 'business' was contacted today regarding this matter. Logical, reasonable people would generally assume responsibility when they injure a customer, but the response that they got was that ""that happens sometimes"". 

Do your nails at home or go to a reputable business, that stands by the pricing displayed & that doesn't injure their customers (and the people who keep them in business) ""sometimes"", and when they do injure or do wrong to their patrons, they promptly fix it. Unlike this business owner. 

*For reference, these photos were taken 24+hrs after the incident, and after being soaked & coated with Neosporin."
1,"BUYER BEWARE!
Shop anywhere but here!
Bought 4 brand new stainless steel appliances from this store and within three months had issues with the refrigerator! 
$2500 dollar refrigerator was junk!
Within 3 months had repairman out to fix loud noises in unit. Lucky my wife bought an extended warranty and have had to use it 6 times in 18 months! Lost food in fridge twice! Each time Store Manager, Mr. Flake ( aptly named) said it was out of their hands and they couldn't help us!
If anyone is interested, I would like to take out full page add against this company so that other customers will shop elsewhere. 
Also, need to notify the better business bureau and any of the tv stations that will investigate and shed light on the obviously common practice of fleecing the patrons of this store!
Finally, if you are a KFYI listener, contact them and let them know they are advertising for a valley company that does not stand behind their sales!
This comes from a customer that has purchased several items from this store in the past! Company only cares about selling, can't and won't supply customer service!
AGAIN, if you don't believe me go ahead and waste your time and money at this store!"
1,"Find another property company, they are neglegant in doing walk thrus, following thru with tenants etc. They allowed tenants to thrash our property. We were clients for 3 years and they never did their job, followed up or returned calls on time, when we decided to end our contract they did not communicate nor explain the process and they tried to force us to use their maintenance company who did not do their job, even after we paid for it. Save your money and go somewhere else where they value their clients."
1,"Heard a lot about this Steakhouse and we knew it wasn't cheap either... never the less, we decided to go there yesterday to celebrate my birthday. The service at first was nice, and then as we were about to finish our food, not quite finished, they already started pushing us to finish and started taking all our plates away, we had to literally tell them ""we are still working on this..."" So as they stopped taking our plates away, and they immediately handed us the bill... we weren't even done eating! for God's sake... after handing us the bill, they came to the table every 30 seconds to see if we are ready to pay... my wife had to tell the waiter ""please don't check on the bill for at least 20 min... we are not done yet.""
I'm assuming it was because our daughter started crying and it was bothering them. Still, it was very very rude! So I wouldnt plan on this place if you have kids...

From the food point of view, and only from the food point of view, I had the Bone in Rib Steak which costs $65.95CAD, the steak was ordered Medium, and on the inside it was close to that, however, the outside of the Steak was all burned and had a bad taste to it, I had to pill off the burned parts. The Fries that came with it were pretty much a joke for a $65 dollar Entree... they looked like they came out of MacDonald's.
 My wife has a fillet of Sol and it was OK, but not great.

All in all we will probably never come back here nor will we recommend it to any of our friends. For the same price I would recommend harbor 60 steakhouse which is a true 5 star Steakhouse"
1,"To start off if you need a home to be ""managed"" by a property management company, you can't find a worst one than this one. You can call the office 5 times in a row and not get an answer. Obviously that's a problem for home owners as well as tenants. I don't think these people do anything but collect fees from their customers and find where they can collect additional funds or deposits from tenants. 

To start, when living in the property I began documenting all of our conversations and interactions, because as a tenant, from day one it was easy to see that we were going to have some problems. We moved in and had a load of trash in the back yard. We also had a broken ice machine and RO water filtration system that didn't work. After they sent a repair guy out who stated ""he couldn't fix it"" those were problems we lived with for the next 11 months. OnQ from there couldn't even respond to us to try to fix it further. Very quickly we gave up on trying to get OnQ to work with us. 

Now let's fast forward to today. I have moved out, hired professional cleaners for all aspects of the home. Did my due diligence and left the home better than how I received it. Trash feee, working fixtures and features. I took care of the home... I am now having $500 held from my deposit due to a trash haul. Well the documented ""trash"" are all things like the metal flamingo, metal frogs, white pillars, cleaning supplies in a closet, a random tire?  Along with other piles of trash that were there to begin with (remember how I said we had called to have the trash removed?). These were all things that we had called on to be removed. Not to mention in the pictures I posted, half these items are documented in pictures that OnQ used to sell us on the house, and are still currently using to sell new renters the house. So am I having to reimburse the owner now for the ""metal props"" they just threw out?

... also with four girls in their early 20's living in the home I promise not one of us had any business changing a tire. I can fight for what's right but I can't change a tire. As embarrassing as it is that is the reality. 

Got off the phone with the ""Director"" at OnQ today after 5 calls, redirections and multiple voice mails. She confirmed and I quote that "" I am suppressed by the the lack of communication on this property"" after we had asked if OnQ had ever even gotten any of our many emails, voice mails, and calls. It's just super assuring working with a company that even the Director can't put words to their lack of accountability. 

Here is the problem with this. We are being charged for things that the owner had left and did not want removed from the home. As after we called he came by and took some trash away but very clearly left what he did not consider trash. 

In short, do not rent a property managed by this company or let them manage it as an owner. They are collecting fees without any management, communication, or simple respect. 

Looking at it as a whole I'm surprised they even have any business at all. As they can't even answer their phone to take on any new business that may present itself."
1,"We eat here at least 2-3 times a month, but had the worst experience tonight. The Carnitas street tacos were dry, hard and so tough I couldn't chew them. I asked if I could exchange it for something else. She said well just this once and gave me grief...like I was trying to get away with something. I said never mind just give me a refund and a lost customer. Really, really disappointed as we like to support local businesses"
1,"My Wife went to Shine Salon to get her hair colored before being in a wedding. They told her that there were different levels of experienced colorists that were priced accordingly, and she selected a $200 hair coloring job--TWICE what she usually pays. She explained to the colorist how important it was that she look great as it was her best friends wedding. 

When she came home she had a half inch stripe at the root that was virtually untouched, next to another stripe a bit larger of the LAST dye job, and finally the new color. She has asked my opinion of every single color and dye job she's ever gotten. This was the WORST DYE JOB I'VE EVER SEEN. She was miserable, embarrassed, furious and felt deceived. 

It took several strategically placed clips, bows and touch up spray to make it through the wedding. She avoided the photographer the entire time and was only in 2 photos of her best friends wedding.

I can only imagine it must cost $800 - $1000 to get a good dye job at this place.

RUN AWAY!!!"
1,This is the WORST place ever and seems like a scam to me. Couldn't get a hold of anyone at first then when we put in app and paid a fee they gladly took the money and fee but said the house already had an application on it. When I finally did speak to someone there she was rude and condescending. This is just a GROSS place.. don't use them!!!!
1,"I would love for someone to explain the rationale behind this terrible menu planning. You offer a vegan burger (it's the impossible burger). You offer a vegan cheese (server didn't know it was vegan but it said so on the menu) but you don't offer a vegan bun or any alternative form of bread you may have. Got it in a lettuce wrap. It was $21 for my bunless sad burger. Then asked if I could have the veggies instead of fries as my side. Server said yes. Then I was charged an extra $5 for the frozen looking peas and carrots that were terrible and I didn't even eat. $26 for nothing. It was bad. If you're vegan, go elsewhere. Try burger bar at Mandalay Bay. To the restaurant, find a bun and don't charge $21 for the impossible burger that sells at Whole Foods for $6 for a package of 2 with no bun, a few onions, slice of tomato and piece of cheese and oh yeah, a lettuce leaf. No thank you. Save your time and money, don't eat here."
1,"Great selection, good prices and comfortable seating...BUT, the food quality was very poor...its greasy and sits in your stomach. A few hours after eating, I started to feel very sick and nauseous. Would not recommend!"
1,"Unfortunately this company has continued to get worse and worse. Not returning phone calls or e mails for days and weeks.

Just a matter of time before they are no longer in business with this type of poor customer service. 

Very sad as they were once an excellent property management company."
1,"I have never had such a bad experience dining in a restaurant as I have with this steakhouse. We came with a party of 15 people which, originally, was supposed to be 20 people. At the end of the meal they put the cheque as a single one, which wasn't really an issue since we expected that, but we also noticed a $300 surcharge on top of an already $1000 bill!! We asked why they put that there and they said that because some of the party members didn't show up they had to ""make up for the lost profit for the scheduled staff and the room we put aside for the party. There is also an average of each person spending $100 and we were expecting your table to average $2000. Sorry but this is business."" I'm sorry but what sort of restaurant does this without first telling their customers? Their reasoning is also a load of BS because they put their business expectations on the customer rather than anticipating that maybe some people don't show up when there is a party like other normal and decent restaurants do. 

Now, they put this on the bill and did not mention this the first time when we called them to reserve for the party, nor the second time we called to tell them that there would be less people coming. They did not have this policy on their website either and the bill had the number 15 printed on the bottom for the number of people. 

Had this not happened I would have rated the restaurant much higher because the food was actually decent (though really not worth the price in my opinion). However, the trick with the $300 was such an underhanded and disgusting practice that I don't recommend this place to anyone, nor will I ever, and will find a way to let the business bureau know so that they cannot do this to other people. Our party was fortunate because we had someone contest the bill on our behalf but I am so sure that they have gotten away with this in the past with other poor victims. 

My final advice: stay away from this place and go to a McDonald's instead if you can because at least at McDonald's they don't try to pull this mess  with you."
1,"My son had a decent meal so we decided to go back.  I didn't even get to taste the food because the service was so bad. I tried to call in an order and was told to ""use the app"" because the counter person was too busy with the ""lunch rush.""
Except is was 1:50 pm on a Saturday!  App was hard to find on the site.  Would it kill you to put it on the pull down menu?  We'll try again, but service matters!"
1,"We have bought all of our major appliances from Spencers in the past.. but man have things changed. They are rude, rude, rude! I will not be giving them any more money."
1,"Worst property management company I have ever used in my life. They only get 1 star because I can't give them zero. I had a water leak in a wall, no ones fault, it happens. Leaked into the wall and into a closet that is rarely opened, hence the time frame before noticing. Called the emergency line, left a voicemail. That was a week and a half ago. Plumber showed up later that day, still not a single phone call from On Q. Restoration showed up 5 days later, still not a single phone call. Wall in the bathroom, entire bedroom, hallway floorboards all torn up and out. 8 industrial fans a 2 other big old machines have been running NONSTOP for 6 days now. I've left 3 messages at this worthless company and not a single return call. I have no access to the bathroom or bedroom as the walls are torn out and taped up. All supplies in closet are molded and ruined. And not a single person is capable of returning a phone call to advise what the heck is happening. I guarantee they expect a full rent payment even though I don't have access to half my house and they haven't done a single thing to get this moving. I could go on and on, this is a tiny little piece of just how terrible this company is. Don't rent from them. Don't do it. Find somewhere else, anywhere else."
1,"Word from the wise... DO NOT RENT FROM THIS ""Management"" company. I have had absolutely nothing but horrible experience after horrible experience. I went months without work orders completed, calls never answered, messages never responded too and now I'm out my entire security deposit plus some. On Q is hands down the worst decision I have ever made. I wish I went with my gut feeling regarding this company and avoided them. Shady company. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid."
1,"I'm new to Charlotte. Today was my first time to Shine. I explained to Hustin that my natural light brown hair with blonde highlights takes time to process to blonde. I showed him pictures of what my hair looks like when it's properly done. Also, pictures of the highlight-lowlight dimension in hair style color pictures. I only got highlights? Hmm, this time, because my hair needed a conditioning treatment. So, I got foils, a conditioning treatment and toner. The result: roots somewhat match the previously grown out portion, however, the overall color is not anywhere close to the light blonde pictures I showed him. He said it will take time to achieve that blonde. Hmm, why wasn't I informed of this prior to my highlights and hundreds of dollars? Is it possible that: A. He didn't listen and miscalculated the amount of time necessary to let the color process? B. He had another appointment waiting. C. He wanted to make sure I came back to try to achieve what I requested in the first place? Equalling more money of course. OR  D. All of the above? Now, I'm stuck with this (color ?) for months. Wow, what a waste of time and money. I'm so disappointed."
1,$4.50 for a cat fish taco? You've got to be kidding me. With a name like Jimmy Hula's I figured it would be a little more exotic like maybe ahi tuna or mahi mahi. All my years in Hawaii I don't remember ever seeing catfish tacos.
1,"Our first visit here (Wednesday 12/27) had a very sour start as we were greeted by an extremely unfriendly and unprofessional manager. We let her know that we had a reservation at 6 for the hibachi grill (it was just a few minutes past) She tells us there will be a fifteen minute wait and we try to reiterate that we have a reservation. She rudely states that she is ""not even opening the reservation book yet as there are no tables open"" but says it'll be no more than 15 minutes until we are seated. We patiently wait and at 6:30 we have still not been seated but we do see a group that arrived a significant time after us get seated before us. We try to go up and ask about when it will be our turn and get cut off by the same manager who brushes us off and says ""yep, we're working on it."" We do not get seated until 6:45 without even an acknowledgement or apology for the lengthy wait. The saving grace was the gentleman that cooked up our dinner. He was very friendly and entertaining and the food was great. We have been to hibachi grills before and understand that there is some strategy that goes into filling up the tables but a 45 minute wait is unreasonable, especially when we had done our part in making a reservation. The manager, who was dressed in a way-too casual grey sweatshirt, had glasses and  her hair in a bun, seemed to have no sense of customer service skills or how to respectfully speak to people."
1,"We bought a new dishwasher from Spencer's and paid in full. When it was delivered, we noticed dents and scratches. We called the store and the manager admitted that they, without any notice, had substituted the floor demo model. He tried to blame the warehouse. Who believes the installer walked into the store, unhooked and removed the floor model without notifying someone at the store? Don Paul was our salesperson and was defensive and unapologetic. It's fraud, plain and simple."
1,The waiter kept wiping his nose with his hands and serving people their food. Without washing his hands. Ugh. Unfortunately I didn't catch his name. His hat was turned backwards.
1,"Love Denny's but this one isn't that great! They always miss bringing me something I ordered and most the time my sons food is cold smh 
Tonight I ordered a side of gravy MORE THAN 3 TIMES and still didn't get it!!! 
I only come here because it's the closes to the house.

Under staffed and they don't pay attention!"
1,Thank you for going out of business and sticking me with a bunch of unusable gift cards
1,"If I could have given negative stars it would be more appropriate!  Got a full set costing $35 not including tip. It has been 3 days all of my nails are lifting and the ""gel"" paint I paid extra for has worn off. I went in to see if I could get them fixed and was told they didn't have time to fix them. Horrible  horrible customer service since change in management.  This used to be my go to place. I will not be returning here. Ever."
1,"Too many mistakes, new employees every 3-6months, every time I call someone new is managing my properties . 
The quotes for repairs are 4times more expensive, that if you hire someone yourself, the communication and administration is horrible, and they let my tenant leave without charging him for the repairs and I have to pay for the broken window.
And they take 14 days to pay you after the tenant pay rent on the 1st of he month.  Today is the 10th of the month and I was just told that my rent money is not going to be in my account for another 4-5 days. Worse management company, they give me more headaches than anything also. I had less problems managing my properties my self."
1,"Disgusting steak. It took them 45 minutes to prepare the disgusting steak that is full of fat.
I don't eat 90% fat steaks.
They didn't even apologize. They said ""I am sorry you didn't like the steak"". 

This restaurant deserves to be bankrupt. This is the second incarnation, this new one deserves to die, and not be replaced."
1,"I stop to see what was this place was about , really disappointed , we have a party of 6 wanted to try something different but when I saw the menu was like a copy of Viva chicken , we order the chicken with green beans,chicken was overcooked green beans from a can , I work in the business so I know when something is from a can, the rest of the party order the chicken sandwich , chicken was cold and hard  , for sure we are won't be back"
1,"The TL;DR Version 2015-2016: On Q Property Management is the epitome of greed. I rented a small unit in Scottsdale. The proximity to Downtown Scottsdale, my company, the waterfront and the ""diamond in the rough"" rent was not worth the headaches nor the proposed legal action I had to take against On Q Property Management. They try to con tenants out of their security deposits and lie about how the money is used (it's not, the company pockets it). They say services are provided but cannot provide proof of these services, they say invoices are ""lost"" when in reality they could call said ""company"" and have said ""invoices"" reprinted. GREED. Thankfully, I was able to recover the money that they wrongfully kept from me, however it was not without headaches and proposed legal action. 

The Complete Story: On Q and JD Jarvis had me sign a lease, pay $930 as a security deposit, pet deposit + $700 in first month's rent by July 30, 2015 to secure the unit and move in at the start of the lease, August 1, 2015. The only accommodating thing On Q Property did for me was to split my security deposit in  1/2 and I could pay the remaining  1/2 with September 1, 2016 rent (this was a documented and carried out accommodation). Standard practice in securing a rental space. 

The unit was not cleaned nor move in ready at the start of the lease and I was not given keys to the home nor allowed access to the home for approximately 1 work week. * This is illegal and against Arizona State Law + Arizona Tenants Rights and Responsibilities *. 

Documented and certified demand letters were sent before I could receive keys to unlock my front door. After I received the keys, I went to inspect the home. I submitted a 2-page report of my findings + photos to On Q along with their move-in inspection paperwork. 

Upon move-out, I gave over 30 days' written notice, cleaned, photographed, documented the cleaning process and left the unit in better shape than was given to me. Breanna Smith inspected and commented on how clean the unit was. I received a refund of $730 ($200 less than my security deposit). On the check invoice was ""General Cleaning of Unit"".

I sent Rebeccah Arnett a request for an itemized list of cleaning provided; the company, the date, the services provided, etc. and a deadline to provide this. She did not comply with my request for 15 days. 

30 days after my lease ended and I was still requesting documentation. This matter turned into a back and forth (via documented e-mails) from August 19 to September 7, 2016. 

On September 7, 2016, I sent a certified demand letter requesting an itemized list of services and the $200 owed, or else I was taking On Q Property Management to small claims court to seek the amount owed + punitive damages for their violation of Arizona State Law + Arizona Tenants Rights and Responsibilities (again). 

On September 9, 2016, I received a check in the mail for $200 with a signed letter from On Q saying: ""...The owner was unable to locate the receipt, so has agreed to refund additional $200 that was held"". 

I am 99.9% positive there were no services provided and On Q / the owner was trying to pull the wool over my eyes ... As a property management company, they are only loyal to themselves. They could care less about the tenants whom occupy their properties and in some cases they could care less about the owners they represent. 

I realize I am lucky. However, a lot of On Q Property Management's tenants/victims are not. 

So I write this review for those who have been taken advantage of and traumatized by On Q Property Management's greed and their inattentive, dismissive employees. 

Conclusion: This company cannot defend themselves against tenants like myself and others whom I have read similar reviews from who have documented e-mails, photographs, text messages and certified demand letters. The fact that they could not provide a simple document and in turn refunded the remaining $200 of my security deposit, speaks *VOLUMES* about their role in the situation."
1,"I don't know how this place has so many good reviews every time I have been here with my family the always take forever they have brought out other people's food before our food and we got in,seated, and ordered first and the other people came sometime after. Dennys is just a horrible place to eat they have been going downhill for 20 years they have had so many problems and it still seems like they can't get there s*** together. We stop going to Dennys for long time we just decided to go back and give it another chance but nothing changes. They need  to just close the doors and start fresh"
1,"I don't write bad reviews unless I am extremely disappointed.
I was.
If you're going for the food don't bother.
I asked them to give me whatever they recommend and I got this ridiculous bowl of some greens and awful pieces of steak.
These guys won't stay in business long.
Place is clean though and the staff ...
Oh well  worst spent $15"
1,"I was in this store earlier today with my friend and small daughter. I was looking for a subzero fridge/freezer combo. I was not greeted or acknowledged the entire 20 minutes I was looking on the sales floor. There were at least 5/6 salesmen that didn't even make eye contact. My friend noticed the same awkward and unprofessional behavior. Such a shame, they seem to have a nice selection but I'll have to purchase from someone who is knowledgeable in customer service as well as high end appliances."
1,"Had burger.  Didn't taste too great.  Wait service was sub par.  They did that thing where they make you leave a tip while they wait for you to see how much tip you'll leave..  Will not visit here again.

  I think just had bad luck and got a bad server and cook, or maybe their burgers aren't that good. It was 1pm Saturday"
1,"Absolute WORST property management company EVER! My fiancé and I have been renting our past couple homes in recent years (planning on finding the right one to eventually buy) and it was that time of year again where our lease was up at our current rental home and it was time for me to start looking for a new rental for us to move into. Preferably something a little closer to my fiancé's office and I really wanted to live on the water in One of those communities like Val Vista Lakes.  I had been looking through Zillow and Trulia for almost a little over a month when I had finally found the perfect home I could tell right away without having ever seen it in person that it was the home for us I scroll down to the bottom to make a appointment to view it and I see On Q property management was in charge of the listing,so I put in my information and I sent a request.  My request went unanswered for about two weeks I tried again at least four different times my request was never answered. I finally tried calling their office I did get a hold of somebody to talk to about the rental.  When I told the guy on the phone what the address of the home I was interested in was he replied ""OK well can you meet someone there tomorrow around 10 AM?"" He said ""it will either be me or someone else showing you the home"" (He didn't even know who is going to be showing me the home!!!). I said yes that would work out perfectly not wanting to lose this amazing rental and I hung up the phone.  I realized after I hung up I didn't get a direct phone number from the guy on the phone considering I only had the main office line. That was probably my fault I should've called the guy back, but my mind was at ease because I had given him my phone number and information. So the next day I'm on my way there and I don't get a call from anyone saying that they are on their way or to confirm that I even have an appointment to view this home today.  I lived very far from that particular rental so I was driving off faith & trust that someone was going to be there to meet me.  Yesterday on the phone the guy had given me the gate code since it was in a gated community.  When I got there and I punched in the gate code it didn't work (of course) so I waited for a car to come out the exit gate and I went through there then proceeded to the house.  To my discomfort no one was there to greet me. I waited for about an hour, never got a call, never saw anyone pull up to the home, nothing.  I was completely and utterly blown away by their unprofessional customer service.  I noticed that they were the management company for many of the homes that I was interested in and every single inquiry that I put in through the real estate websites went unanswered.  I did get one reply back from a girl about the home I originally wanted asking me what time could I meet her, I replied to the email and then never heard back again. I can't believe that a property management company that is in charge of this many homes is this unprofessional and just plain AWFUL!  Needless to say I never got my dream rental that I wanted because of their flaky business techniques.  You would think that this company is made up of a bunch of teenagers working at a fast food joint getting paid minimum wage! McDonald's has better customer service..STAY AWAY!  I've read at least five other reviews saying that this shady company does not reply to your emails, phone calls, or even make an effort to respond to possible tenants. Bottom line, this company shouldn't be in business!!!"
1,"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  I drove 13 miles to try this place after having passed it a few times on my way through Tempe.  I walked in and the red\brown haired female employee at the bar had her back to me.  Waited for a few more moments and eventually just picked up a menu on the table behind me but it was actually a listing of their sauces.

After waiting another ten minutes she finally turns around and makes eye contact with me.  I ask ""Can I place a to go order here at the bar?""  in response, she scowls and rolls her eyes at me and says.  ""Look, you're going to have to wait, okay?""  Keep in mind, there's about six other people in the restaurant and no one else is anywhere near the bar.  I give it the benefit of the doubt and decide to wait and I say ""Sure, is there a menu?""  to which she replies ""You know?  We're closed!""

This is odd because I was standing there for some time with no greeting, no acknowledgement and no signage telling or showing me they were closed.  I'd be happy to leave it at that but her attitude for no reason at all was really a surprise.  I would encourage anyone I know or reading this to AVOID this restaurant at all costs.  It's too bad that employees ruin it for their ownership with this kind of behavior.  I definitely will not be going back here ever again."
1,"I bought a wine and bar fridge in August, I was told that the wine fridge had two temps, it only had one.  Delivery was a joke, only had one of the items and wouldn't switch the door handles, spent more time taking off work waiting for delivery.  Then wine fridge hasn't worked since, Spencers said it was out of their hands, the manufacturer sent an appliance person to fix it, still hasn't worked.  Have called Spencers numerous times and gone in person to no avail.  Months later, I still can't use it unless I like frozen wine. (bottles have been ruined) Gary, the sales person who said he'd check with the manager and he'd call me next day...over two weeks later STILL waiting.  But he did ask me if I knew how to turn the temp knob.  Seriously. Do not deal with these people.  They get their money and don't care and are insulting to women.  I have filed with the BBB."
1,This was the worst experience ever. So much so that I'm in the parking lot writing this. Girl took off my entire eyebrow basically when I asked her to clean them up ONLY. Not to mention I'm taking maternity photos tomorrow. I literally cried in the chair. Never again. HORRIBLE
1,"As locals we used  to the this place when it was still Todd English however since the new owners took over it has gone down hill fast!!  We have tried it 4 times now since it changed over and each time was disappointing.  The food is not very good at all anymore, most of the wines are gone and the prices seem to have increased.  This particular time we went to have dinner and watch the hockey game last week.  We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed annoyed to even have to wait on us.  After waiting for several minutes I finally ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered an iced tea.  By the way there were hardly any people in the bar or restaurant so they were not at all overly busy!! Then it was time to order food this is where it gets interesting.  I asked what was on the cheese plate and the bartender had to go find a sheet, when he came back he litter just read the sheet and had no idea what he was riding to us.  I regretfully ordered the cheese plate since nothing else appealed to me.  I then asked if I could get just plain French bread or something besides the cranberry toast that cake with it, he replied we don't have any other bread really.  My husband ordered roasted chicken and fried mozzarella appetizer.   The mozzarella appetizer came out and is in the attached picture.  It was 99% breading and looked like maybe the cheese accidentally crossed paths with the breading.  It was dry and over seasoned, I don't recommend ordering it.  Typically when you order fired mozzarella it is gooey and cheesy this was not at all!  Then the chicken comes out, mind you I still didn't get the cheese plate which involves no cooking what so ever!!  Then they bring out bread drenched in butter/oil, I asked if I could get it dry, I had ordered it with no oil or butter.  Still no cheese plate anywhere on site they take the bread back.  Several minutes pass and I ask the bartender if he could check on the cheese plate since my husband is now half way through his meal.  He basically rolled his eyes and said I'm going to get it now, again as if we have inconvenienced him.  He comes back with the cheese plate which was not at all what I was expecting and one of the cheeses definitely had some type of truffle oil or spread on it.  He went to check and another several minutes pass, he comes back and says no.  At this point I'm over it and just say i don't care for it and he takes it away.  Now onto my husbands roasted chicken!  First of all it lacked any seasoning and was so dry it was hard to swallow.  The au jus sauce was basically chicken broth as well.  The roast chicken we get from Costco is 100% better than this was.  The waiter asked how my husband liked the chicken and he replied it's a bit dry but it's ok.  The bartender again rolled his eyes and literally just walked off.  We ended up leaving and going to Mastros to watch the rest of the game and so I could finally get something to eat! There are plenty of other options and based on how dead this place has been every time we've gone since the switch I'm sure other people are thrilled with it either!! Todd English was always packed, had great food, drinks and the service was always fantastic!!"
