3,"Ambience: Would not expect something this nice at Cannery Hotel but it is the nicest looking restaurant there. More for couples than group gatherings.

Service: The ambience & food make up for this, which unfortunately for us, the service has been terrible. We have come fairly close to restaurant closing both times (within the hour), but they do close very early for Vegas. The staff makes it VERY clear that they want to go home right from the start in hurrying orders and are more aggressive as time goes on. Unfortunate.

Food: Very good. A little salty on some items during our first visit but good overall and again, warrants the overall 3 stars. Steak. Scallops wrapped in bacon. Calamari. Cobb salad. etc."
3,"Not a bad little pub. Had the sliders, salt and pepper wings, and mushroom burger -- forgettable, but good. The fries are what I will remember, and come back for."
3,Food was just OK. Seemed like microwaved dinner. The price is OK. Just a one time visit for me
3,"The location at WT Harris and Statesville Road is like the cafeteria for our office staff.  I'm in there at least twice a week. Had lunch there today in fact.

Good enough beer list, good enough food, good enough service so we keep coming back.  Mostly because it's accross the street from the office and therefore really handy for lunch or after work.  

Oyster night (Thursdays) is a great deal.  Pint night on Tuesdays is great too."
3,"We arrived one cold December evening for a gathering of friends for our annual Christmas dinner.

We had made prior reservations for party of 14 and were told that we need half of the party there by our reserved time to claim our table.  We all arrived on time to a restaurant that was barely full than half.  I guess reservations were not totally necessary after all? 

I am by no means an expert on Italian food.  My knowledge of Italian food doesn't go beyond spaghetti and pizza!   I've been to Grazie's Yonge & Eglinton location previously and I enjoyed the freshly made pasta I had that evening. I was expecting the same here.

Our waiter was very friendly and inviting, he promptly took our drink orders and was able to answer all the questions we had about the specials that evening.  

I actually ended up ordering one of the specials, a seafood pasta made with spicy tomato sauce.   When it arrived, I noticed there were a lot of mussels, squid rings, shrimp and clams swimming in tomato sauce.  It looked delish.

Taste though, was not what I expected. The sauce was great, seasoned perfectly with a balance between hot and sweet.  However, not all of the ingredients were fresh. The squid, mussels and shrimps tasted dry. Like it was re-heated from the day before. The squid rings reminded me of the ones you get that are frozen from the market.  The pasta was a bit overcooked.  The sauce was the only redeeming quality.  

Then it struck me, specials are often left over ingredients that the restaurant couldn't clear for whatever reason.  It would explain why despite having a positive experience with the food at their Yonge & Eglinton location, that I am having an average plate of seafood pasta right now at this location.  

Needless to say, I didn't finish my food.  

However, I would advise future diners to stay away from their specials, and hopefully, their main food offerings would be better cooked.  I would revisit Grazie, just not at this location for now."
3,"Ok so we stopped here after a walk in Charlotte. It's not bad. First let me say if you want friendly service this place is probably not for you. If you want a good burger than your in luck. It's inexpensive and good. We sat on the street which was nice. The fries were a little spicy so if your stomach can't handle a little spice then avoid the fries. All in all, I give this place 3 flushes. The service could have been a little better."
3,Way overrated because the place is sooooo small and parking sucks so bad.....great quality food and price but thats it.
3,"Last night our experience at this Outback location did not live up to our previous visits. It took about ten minutes to be greeted after sitting down. This was not to bad but we were right on the cut off of happy hour so I wanted to make sure that we got our drink order in on time. I ended up getting my drink order in two minutes before the cut off so that was okay.

I ordered the new steak flight that they have as a current special. You can get two or three mini sirloins on top of potato cakes with different types of sauces. I got two mini sirloins one with diablo sauce and one with a peppercorn cream sauce. I have had the diablo sauce in the past and I knew that I really liked it. My fiancé got a 8oz sirloin with a baked potato, his usual order. My fiancé also ordered a house salad to come out before our meal. It came out with no dressing and no side of dressing. It took five minutes to flag down our waitress to let her know we needed dressing. We got our steaks and as soon as they came out we could tell that they were not going to be good. We both asked for them to be cooked medium and they came out at least medium well if not well done. My first mini sirloin was just a big piece of fat and grizzle, I could not even cut into it. My fiancé's was not quite as bad but almost. We asked to send them back. My fiancé asked for a filet as a replacement and I just wanted a new order of the same thing that I got.

The manager Gabby did come out and apologize for the quality of the steaks. She was very understanding and told us that she would personally make sure that they came out right. The second time around when Gabby brought them back out they were cooked much better. She also stepped it up and brought a third mini sirloin with an option of three sauces to try on top. I thought that this was great customer service and she really did a great job trying to turn the situation around. We were there much longer than usual but it was not a big deal and Gabby did her best to make sure we were happy. The steaks were still not the best that we have had at Outback but I will give this location another shot because of the fantastic service we received in the end. Gabby also made corrections to our bill and made it right. Good job on turning the situation around. It was still only a three star night but I will give Outback a chance to earn the other two stars back."
3,"We stopped by for dinner on a Wednesday - pretty quiet inside. We were intrigued by the Beef Tips special on the board outside, as we enjoy some New England Steak Tips and thought this might be similiar - wrong. Turned out to be  more like stew beef over rice, not what we were expecting but also not notably tasty. It was served with big broccoli stalks randomly covered in cheese - also not my fav.
The saving grace of this meal was the Salt & Pepper Wings. So good! I asked for a side of hot sauce in case they were bland but it wasn't needed. Super crispy and tasty, I might go back again just to have those. The wings saved this from being a 2 star adventure.
Service was OK, could have been more on-point given how slow they were that evening."
3,"I went to this location to eat one evening.  The waitress was great the food was okay.  I prefer the Arbors or Gastonia locations.  However, each is consistent in the staff is very friendly."
3,"I enjoyed my dining experience here. The salt and pepper chicken wings were excellent! They brine them in vinegar and garlic for a few days, then deep fry them and season them with salt and pepper. It was simple and delicious!! I'll definitely be back for them.  We also had an order of Greek fries, which are potato wedges seasoned with oregano. They were also good.  They weren't exceptional (like the chicken wings), but they were tasty and a good accompaniment to the wings. One member of our party ordered the nachos, which were average. I wouldn't recommend them.  

We sat outside on the patio, which was very pleasant. There are a bunch of bars/restaurants on this little strip and it's a bit secluded. So, it felt like we were in a small neighborhood, not in the middle of uptown.  I definitely recommend sitting on the patio if the weather permits. The inside seemed a bit dated and stuffy. 

Our waitress was very friendly and she knew the menu well (which I always appreciate). We went on a Wednesday, so the wine was half-off! The selection is limited, but I enjoyed the discount.  

I definitely recommend this place. The chicken wings alone are worth the trip.  The restaurant is also located across from the new baseball stadium for the Charlotte Knights. Stop by before or after a game!"
3,"My family and I frequent this establishment often. We never have a problem when we dine in, the waitresses are very nice I wish I could remember their names...there's a older lady with long blonde hair she mainly works over by the restrooms and their a younger lady with dark hair that's always in a bun on top of her head. They are your best waitresses. Now we never or dered take out. So we decided to try take out on a Sunday. December 18th to be exact. We ordered some food for about 4 to 5 people. My son came to retrieve our food and after waiting 30 mins they told him they gave away his food to another take out order. He had to wait again for the order to be cooked. Which took 20 mins he finally got the food took it home and the order was not exactly what we ordered. Which means we had to return with some of the orders to show them the mistakes. We finally got another order of food which was waiting at the front because the waitress put in another order. Which we took home as well.....we will only dine for now on...."
3,"For a ""fast food BBQ joint"" I really thought this was pretty good.  They give you A LOT of food for your money too.  The brisket was dry but the pulled pork was really juicy and full of flavor.  Everyone in my group liked what they had, no complaints.  I'd go back given the chance."
3,"trader joe's is pretty good for basics.  however, i've purchased some things there -- bread and yogurt -- that within a couple of days were covered in mold. and twice, i bought fruit yogurt that didn't actually have any fruit in it. (it was just plain white yogurt.)

the upside is that they seem willing to refund for bad products. the downside is the hassle involved in finding mold on your food two days after you buy it and having to go back to the store."
3,"Went with my friend as he said he wanted pasta, and we were in the area. Upon entering, I really enjoyed the decor and ambiance. With a rustic, Tuscan villa look, it gave a wonderful, Italian feel!

One of the best parts of Italian restaurants are the bread they give you. The crust was crispy and the insides were soft, but the bread itself was a bit cold. Always better to get your bread freshly out of the oven, but a good pairing with the olive oil and vinegar.

The pasta options were very diverse, but one the slightly pricier side. With $15.00 being the lowest ticketed pasta, it was pretty good. I got the Avellino and my friend got the Penza. Quite the contrast between the two, but both had their own delights. The Avellino was light and flavourful without being too oily, since it was with an extra virgin olive oil and garlic sauce. With beautiful prosciutto and spinach, it paired well with the al dente fettucini.
The Penza was nicely creamy without being heavy. The pancetta created a nice contrast in texture to the rigatoni that was cooked perfectly. 

Service was quite good overall, as we got a second round of bread for our table and constant topping of water without having to ask. Could have given us more olive oil and vinegar for the bread, but our pastas had come so it wasn't a big deal. 

Overall a nice experience. Would love to sit on the patio if I ever come again, but with pastas slightly pricier than I usually have, I probably won't plan a visit back here. May just stumble in like this visit!"
3,"Shopping here makes me long for my Trader Joes back in Tucson at River and Campbell. There are four in Tucson and only one had killer produce. I don't have another choice here, and so I go. Too often though I'm met with wilted greens and beans that have seen better days. It's not a ""past its prime"" sort of thing... it's a ""the produce just isn't as good as I'd like"" sort of thing. I dig the layout, there is an abundance of staff, but if I'm being completely honest, nobody says hello, asks if you need help finding anything or is quick to make a tasty suggestion... the reasons I don't mind spending $5 on a bag of salad. I'll still go because there are things I can't get anywhere else (love the laundry detergent and price of organic taters) but it'll never be a place I do all my shopping unless the greens get better."
3,"It is only fair to update.  Post last review, a woman by the name Linda called me the following day about my experience, I have to say this did really impress me and she obviously cares about her job and the salon.  Linda offered me the services again I accepted the facial, I didn't feel it was necessary to comp me the entire day.  

Linda selected my facial artist Lucy who I have to say was amazing and was probably one of the better facials I have received.  1 hour felt like an hour and half and she did a really nice job and made it all about me and relaxing.  

I am really impressed with management reaching out and giving me a better experience.  I will probably go back to Lucy because the facial was wonderful.  I still think that the spa lacks certain amenities like steam and sauna.  With that being said I am going to increase my rating of Red Door and recommend Lucy."
3,"OK, so I'm not a big fan of chains but my hubby and my bff's hubby love it here so we recently did a couple's night and I realized I had not written a review. I think The Keg or Flemings nearby do a way better steak but of course Outback is a lot cheaper. I will say that I'm happy they have some fish options, especially ones that are grilled without a lot of fattening sauces. That plus the asparagus makes for a yummy and healthy meal. I do wish they had a better wine list, though."
3,"This place is pretty good as a step up from dingy bar atmosphere and fried food, but it's nothing out of the ordinary and much like an Applebee's, TGIFridays, or Chili's. 

I've been a few times. They always have certain beers on draft for a decent price. The most recent time, we shared the nachos with chili with a few friends and I've gotta say, they were good. Huge pile and great for 4 people to share. I ordered the Moose salad with grilled chicken and balsamic. Again, huge salad so I poured dressing on half and ate half. It came with pita bread like Rocknes salads do, but mine was on the stale side. I will say, I think the croutons were homemade and they were good. 

Basically, this is the kind of place you stop when you've been out and about running errands and realize you're starving. The selection and quality of food is pretty average, as is the atmosphere."
3,"The food here is pretty good, and we keep coming back for that. Price is ok. However, service here is weird. There are different people working there every time I go in. And 3 out of 5 times, they'll get the order wrong - especially if you go through the drive-thru. Don't ever leave here without checking your order! Seriously ... they get it wrong all the time. They've got free ice cream which is cool if you dine-in. My 9yo son doesn't think they care about their customers, lol. Sometimes, the restaurant doesn't seem well cared for."
3,"A perfectly serviceable steakhouse; nothing to recommend it over other steakhouses (both food- and ambiance-wise)... but if you're in the area and want steak, this will do! Reasonably reasonable prices ($35 for petite filet, $20 for chicken) and bland-swanky decor...sort of like a Marie Callender's of steakhouses, for boring married couples or retirees on budgets who never go out to a steakhouse. If you rarely go out, you'll dig it...otherwise, it's pretty solidly Meh. In fact, I would have given it two stars...except it gets an extra star for its blessed un-pretentiousness (no stupid all-caps name, no deconstructed or fusion dishes, and no douchebaggy club music playing)."
3,With a name like Chef Ben I was kind of apprehensive to try the sushi but I was actually pleasantly surprised. I ordered a miso soup and the red tiger roll during happy hour (3-9pm) and it was very reasonably priced. The staff was attentive and I would definitely eat here again.
3,"This is your average casual food establishment. We were greeted by some nice hostesses and quickly taken to our table. The table was a bit dirty with trash around the floor but we still sat down. We started with the spinach dip, which was pretty good. However, my kids order the chicken tenders and they were greasy and the chicken was tough....ugh! My husband and I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and the smokehouse burger. Those meals were delicious! We will go back on a drunken night but we won't be regulars!!!!!"
3,"Came here around lunch time on a Friday. Wasn't too busy. You can see yourself if you desire to. There is only one waitress working the tables. Service was pretty quick no issues there.

Location is close to Midwestern University. In a Plaza. Parking is easy due to parking lot. Inside is clean. Restroom was okay as well.

Price:
Price for most of the pho, were around $9 -$11 range, which is okay if you get the right amount for the price you're paying. Definitely not on the cheaper side.

Food:
I got these pho Tai with out tendon. Number 16.

Check photo for visualization.
So, quantity of the noodle is little. Quantity of the beef is even less. There was maybe six slices of beef. The amount of noodle is definitely on the Lesser side compared to other places. The broth was okay, it wasn't too greasy, but nothing spectacular.
The side plate with the bean sprouts in the men in the jalapeno, is like all the other places. No issues there.

Overall, for the price you're paying, I was expecting to have more quantity in terms of the noodle and the beef. However that wasn't the case here. But I may need to compare this place to other pho places in Arizona. Because I'm basing my comparison with California and Texas.

If this is the only pho place in this area, you could come check it out. However if you're really hungry, you probably won't get full.

The service was good though.
And they just open recently I believe."
3,"Initial impression was awful. As we parked we saw the manager or host (guy in a red shirt)outside talking to what appeared to be a friend of his. Went inside and were  not greeted until about fifteen minutes later when the waitress greeted and sat us. From there it was great. Service was fast and extremely friendly, and food was great."
3,"I come to Madison every year for the half marathon and it is close to my hotel. They have gluten free stuff and plenty of tj brand stuff which is great. staff are OK, always seem very busy, wish they would slow down a little."
3,"It's good - the food is especially good, and reasonably priced.  If I have an issue, it's with the service - inconsistent and hard to predict.   Appetizers and food come out at the same time, so you end up with a table full of food that you have to race to eat before it gets cold.

The food is actually good enough that I put up with the service - so, it's definitely a keeper, just don't be surprised when things go a bit off the rails..."
3,"-There is no ventilation in this place so you gonna walk out smelling like korean food. 
-Bad service but that's to be expected anyways. 
-Food is decent for a 24 hours joint. 

My fav dishes were the bulgogi stew and the short ribs. Incredibly flavorful stew and the short ribs were perfectly medium rare. 

Pass the kimchi stew, bland and kimchi was not sour enough."
3,"The food is pretty good but staff is totally clueless I asked if they were St. Louis or baby backs and the chef didn't even know what kind of ribs they sell he could only tell me they were pork ribs.
Train your staff dickies......"
3,"The place was pretty good and very well-priced ($9.99 for an all you can eat lunch). 
The pork was my favorite of the meats.

The main negative thing that I really have to say about this place is that the waiter consistently took a long time to bring out more food. I mean I know it's a business strategy, so that the food could settle and digest, and they can save more meat, but this place was a little over the top. 
Like 10 minutes for another order of pork and a refill. 

Another thing was that when I paid him the money, I have him $30 for a $24 meal (the six dollars was tip), but he never bothered to ask if it was tip, and he just disappeared into the back with the $6 for like 15 minutes, until we left, pretty unprofessional. 

but food-wise, this is a decent Korean BBQ place, and definitely good for the price."
3,"It was ono grindz. It did broke da mouth.  This my experience from less than an hour ago.

I drag along 3 of my coworkers and we come here to try the place out.  I see lunch specials at the front door and get excited.  Here we go!

We sit down at a booth, the lady there is very nice and friendly.  We get waters all around.  A few minutes later we order.

Friend 1: ""Da Surf Rider"" with Fried Noodles.
Friend 2: ""Da Surf Rider"" with Steamed Rice.
Friend 3: ""Kauai boy Breakfast"" with scrambled eggs and potatoes.
My Order: Teriyaki Chicken with White Rice, 1 Spam Musubi and 1 Malasada.

Food come out shortly later.  In the meantime I notice the place is nice and clean with ample seating.  The lady checks on us multiple times and gives good service.  That is awesome.  The moment of truth comes when our food does and we begin to eat.  

For my personal experience, with my Teriyaki Chicken, it was a nice sizable portion.  It came out nice and hot and was very flavorful.   
- The chicken tasted good.  Was this chicken sitting in the teriyaki marinade?   It is probably just me though.  It isn't settling well with me.  Maybe I am spoiled with the chicken breast choices from other places around town.  It definitely isn't chicken breasts, I'll give them that. 
- The steamed rice was perfect.  They gave me two scoops.  They are from Hawaii, they should know how to cook it. :)   I, again, wish they had a brown rice alternative.
- The macaroni salad was OK.  The macaroni was a smaller and thicker than what I am used to but it was just me again as I would have preferred a healthier choice like a green salad instead.

The malasada was just OK.  It was a little to hard on the outside, but when I bit into it was nice and soft.  It tasted good.  But, I hit an actual cold spot in the middle of it.  :(

The spam musubi was good.  One side seemed to be a little watery from sitting in its on steam.  Happens.

My friends loved ""Da Surf Rider""  It looked delicious.  My other friend liked the Kauai Boy Breakfast.  He commented on how he didn't need ketchup to finish it.

In the end when we were ready to pay, we were a little confused with the prices of the food.  I thought I was going to get the lunch special price.  But then, when other people came in and started ordering I heard that the lunch special price got half portions.  I wish I would've known sooner.  I happily paid full price because for what I got, it was a fair deal.

I will give them a try again soon.  I see ""Da Surf Rider"" in my future at least. :)   I also need to give their loco moco a whirl.

Awesome people, great service.  Probably just me because I wanted more healthy choices, but otherwise GOOD food.

I really wanted to love this place and give them five stars.  Really.  But, I have to be honest in my reviews."
3,"24/7 blessssss these places because man I love me some Korean food! So this place is quite packed whenever I go so be warn! The food here is quite good! I had the pork cutlet and it is a fairly decent size compared to other Korean places! They have a seating area with no chairs so you take your shoes off and sit. Another area is with chairs, which is much better in my opinion (since I have big thighs). 

It does seem a bit small hence it can be quite packed at times. There is another 24/7 Korean place nearby but I think this one is much better then that one. The side dishes are similar to most Korean restaurants. They didn't bring us any tea or cups or any sort. Even when they gave us chopsticks and spoons there wasn't any napkins and anything said from the waiter. He just dropped it down and went back to the middle and just watched people. 

Will probably come back here again. Hoping for better service!"
3,"The food at this location is almost identical to the one at Yonge/Eglinton except that the service here isn't as warm as I remembered. 

We ordered the Parma Foccacia as the starter, and heed my warning - don't overstuff yourself with the rock-hard complimentary bread they give you, save room for the foccacia, it's super fluffy and I would probably eat one whole as an entree.. 

I always order the Seafood Linguine special ($28) - it's one of the most priciest pastas on their menu but so worth it. The portions are so enormous (more so at Yonge/Eglinton) I have to pack half up for lunch the next day. This dish is loaded with mussels, decent sized shrimp, fish and cuttlefish. You certainly get the bang for the buck! 

This Vaughan location isn't as packed as the midtown location, and it has plenty of parking available! I'm not too picky about the poor service here because of this convenience factor - at least the food is just as good!"
3,"It was certainly about time that Madison got a Trader Joe's and it has become a staple of my grocery shopping.  I can only give it three stars, though, because it's only possible to go there for only very specific reasons.  My biggest complaint: 

EVERY PIECE OF PRODUCE IS WRAPPED IN PLASTIC.  Thank you very much, but I am perfectly capable of cutting my own broccoli.  And I actually don't mind if my asparagus is exposed to the air, it doesn't need to be in packaging.  And don't worry about it- if I want a green pepper, red pepper, and yellow pepper, I can find all three separately, they don't need to be wrapped together. 

Other than that, I have just realized that you can't go to Trader Joe's with your usual shopping list- you have to go there with a specific Trader Joe's shopping list.  They have some great simmer sauces and frozen dinner items (mmmm.....gorgonzola gnocci), but if you want staple cereals, crackers, or boxed items, you'll probably have to make a separate trip to a different place. 

But that's what Trader Joe's is for, I guess.  Stock up on the cheap, but delicious, Charles Shaw wine and grab a few things to compliment your cheaper and more environmentally-friendly shopping at other stores and you will be content."
3,"First time being here in nearly 10 years. Denny's is dependable American fare at reasonable prices. Met family here for a quick breakfast. 
We had the Supreme Skillet with jalapeños and scrambled eggs, supreme omelette with jalapeños, and two grand slams. 
Food was served hot and quick.  However, I remembered why I don't visit  often. Loud children and half-assed service. We fed four people a hearty breakfast with tip for $55. 
I prefer Black Bear Diner though."
3,"I am not really a huge fan of trader joe's. It has got some nice food and some interesting options, but it seems a little superfluous in terms of ""gourmet,"" ""fresh,"" and ""organic."" I like a lot of the food, but there are a lot of options also that just don't live up to the expectations. If you are going to be cooking for yourself, you don't need to come to trader joes. If you want to switch it up a little bit, than yeah, trader joes is a good place to browse."
3,"First day of spring! We were in downtown toronto and we decided to go to korean grill...So I am back to my favourite korean restaurant and I forever love the bbq!!! Unfortunately,  service here is slow and not that good compared to the other branches.."
3,"The restaurant on Queen Street was closed due to exhaust fan issues so we hiked over here.  The service was pleasant for the most part from all other helpers except one insolent server who took our order.  As far as the food, the wonderfully marinated single orders of lamb and higher quality steaks were amazing and what earn every star.  The vegetables were indeed weak, deep fried garlic was a tough disappointment and for the rest you get some tiny rings of green peppers and like one cut of onion.  Not worth 3 x the required every party.  The rules were overbearing.  We all ordered plenty of food with 2 single orders of meats and veggies and drinks, but ""no sharing.""  Seriously, I spent forty dollars, let me try a shrimp without fear of reproach.  Also, if one person orders all you can eat, all have to for they fear your tablemates would mooch off yours.  This may stop me bringing a group as I'd prefer better steak cuts and there's no way I would be able to upgrade this."
3,"Love the area this restaurant is located.  Unfortunately we didn't get to spend much time, but will definitely plan to do so when I return to the city. This restaurant was okay.  The food was pretty good. We sat outside amongst smokers...unfortunately.  The inside appeared small and extremely casual.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful with providing the popular and her fave dish on the menu. I ordered the gyro and ate it all! The fries were pretty good too.  They say they have the best burger... I will have to put that to the test next time."
3,"Nice sports bar and great wait staff.  Food is very good.  The steak sandwich is a great cut of meat.  The grilled wings are also fantastic.  I especially like the fact they have free Wi-Fi.  

What is disheartening is the smoke.  Like most of NC eating establishments the bar area is filled with smokers.  The air handles do a decent job, but your clothes still smell in the suitcase when you get home.  Also, the liquor is a bit pricey so if you can bribe the bartender you get a better deal.  

The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  But don't expect to eat on the cheap.  Choose carefully and you will do fine.  I will give it 4 stars when they make it smoke free."
3,"Went on the Sunday before Memorial Day, the only race in NASCAR was on at about 8:15. Had 2 beers. Asked for a food menu and we were told the kitchen was closed at 9:00. I could understand that on a regular Sunday but before a holiday was disappointing especially since the burger that the girl received looked delicious."
3,"I had a gift card from my birthday for Outback, Roy's and Carrabas and my wife had fond memories of the Salmon dinner she had at Outback in Tucson a few years ago.  The greetings upon arrival and seating process was very nice.  We ordered the salmon which came with mixed vegetables, and baby back ribs which came with french fries.  The vegetables consisted of broccoli, squash, cauliflower and carrots.  We told the waitress that we didn't like carrots and she said she would ask them if they could be removed, and they were.  Unfortunately the veggies were overcooked, almost tasteless and without seasoning, as well as a skimpy portion.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and reasonably portioned, and had a nice flavor.  The ribs were tender and fairly flavorful, with scant BBQ sauce and I had to request some sauce on the side.  The fries were excellent, seasoned well, crisp outside, tender inside, the best thing served to us that meal!  A small warm mini loaf of dark bread was OK, but wasn't good enough to tempt us to ask for more.  We skipped the dessert.  All in all an average meal and at almost $30 was acceptable but certainly not memorable."
3,"It was really good, but they should reevaluate their pricing.  You can get the same mixed bbq plate down the street at L & for about $4 less..."
3,I was there on a Friday night a couple weeks ago and ordered the fresh tuna appetizer. ..my guest order the same with  a side of broccoli and his portion was smaller... my tuna was extremely and I asked if that was the norm ... the waitress immediately asked if I wanted to have them prepared again after we noticed my guest portion was not as salty... it was prepared again and came back okay!  I wasn't overly impressed and although I just recently moved to the area... I won't be in a hurry to return.  I remember frequenting the restaurant about 10 years ago at the same location ...but recall it being more inviting of an atmosphere and the food being superior... it feels like a different place now. ..What happened?
3,"I treated my mom to a very enjoyable facial at Red Door Spa today... it was for her birthday, but of course I treated myself to a facial as well!  

I chose Red Door Spa because I remembered hearing good things about it from a friend, and also because of their convenient Biltmore Shopping Park location.  We were able to have lunch and do a little shopping together prior to our facials, so that worked out really well.

We both enjoyed our ""EA Essential Facials.""  My esthetician was Christine and my mom's was Alina.  They both seemed knowledgeable and professional and had a fair amount of experience.  As with most facials, they also recommended some products for us, and we did end up making a few purchases as well.

It's worth noting that I made our appointments last week and we did not get confirmation phone calls.  We also were not told exactly where they were located and hence wandered up via a back entrance, which was very shady.  If you're reading this, note that you'll want to enter via the Royal Coffee - next door to The Capital Grill, and then head upstairs via the stairs or elevator from there.  I shared this feedback with one of the staff members working at the front desk, but she didn't seem to be interested.

So, while the facials themselves were fine, the overall experience was dampened a bit due to the fact that the ladies working up front were not the friendliest or interested in my feedback.  It's also just as pricey as the local resort spas but the facility does not compare.  If you're looking for a full spa experience, I'd head elsewhere, but if you are just about a service or two and the Biltmore is convenient for you, this may be your spot... pamper it up!"
3,"Fantastic venue, great food and location. Service was amazing for how busy it was on game night and we will absolutely return for another visit."
3,"I wish I had an option for 2.75 stars because I do love this place but not sure it gets the 3 stars.....The specials are always 'just fine' such as beef tips and rice.  The gyro is fine, nothing to write home about.  I always get the club sandwich when I go here and never can finish it (it comes with a ton of fries to share...)  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is super fast and efficient.  

I guess what bugs me about this place is the consistency of the quality....leaves something to be desired at times.  Such as weird brown lettuce on the taco salad, overcooked meat on the gyro....it is almost as if the menu is too big and they should cut back and improve the quality of several best-selling items.

Overall I would say A-OK!"
3,"Enjoyed their bacon burger lunch special but not so special price. It was good to be expected, nothing special though. I would have liked to have more french fries portion but it was adequate."
3,"I used to really like korean grill house. now with my new resolution of not doing so much all-you-can-eat anymore, this place lost its appeal. good food still."
3,My wife and I really like this place and their 20 dollar special. The staff are really nice and friendly too. This place has average food at best... but its cheap enough to come back every now and then because of their  deals during dinner. We really like the sesame chicken. No major complaints... It worth a try if you want cheap sit down place on a tight budget.
3,"So The S family was in Vegas this weekend for a wedding, and I put in a call to my Las Vegas liaison, who recommended Waverly's for nice dining in NoLaVe (um, North Las Vegas, c'mon!).  
Tucked in the dimly-lit corner of the new-but-second-rate casino The Cannery, Waverly's serves up juicy steaks and other meats juicy, flavorful, and hot as hell just like they deserve.  The staff were so attentive that they were almost constantly apologetic.  This came in handy when due to a large party, our dinner was delayed at least 15 minutes.  Luckily we had the two dark, moist artisan breads toasted to perfection and doused with butter to whet our collective whistle while whaiting a WHile.  I had halibut-the best halibut I've ever tasted, and nibbled on the S's veal (tender and covered in yum) and prime rib (almost quiveringly rare but delish).  
Good wine list, tasty side dishes, and good atmosphere compliment the mighty meats.  Prices are appropriately high.  
Check it out if you need steak and you're in NoLaVe."
3,"Good Korean grill near Eaton Centre. The marinate is good. We got beef, ox liver, salmon, fish fillet, chicken, pork, pork belly. The fish fillet was bland and liver was meh. Salmon and chicken was really flavourable. Such a fun place to eat at for a date or group of friends. Even alone. No judgments here. 
The staff is attentive, nice and considerate. Bigger groups will most likely be seated on the second floor which is way bigger.
Caution: will smell like BBQ grill after."
3,"Nice place , I like the menu.  Cucumber rolls are my favourite. Service can be slow though, specially when there are a lot of people.  One time I went there Iand after being done, I discovered that I forgot my wallet.. They were very nice and  although I offered to go home and bring the money, they saiid do nt worry it is on us..I came back the next day and paid. The manager  and the waitresses are very nice."
3,"This is a good place. Unlimited meat grill. Cheaper cuts of meat, but they aren't complaining if you don't eat or grill the fattier pieces. The side dishes are fantastic. The bean sprouts are the best. Huge wait for dinner on a weekend. So big in fact it isn't worth it. But late night dinner (after 10pm) has a reduced price, so check that out!!!"
3,"I was really hoping is finally found good bbq relatively close to me. 

While not completely disappointed, I'm not totally thrilled with this place either. 

Walking in, I had hope. The place smells like a genuine pit bbq joint. But that's about it. 

The brisket sandwich I had was good, and the meat tender, but there just wasn't much flavor. I do like a smoky brisket.  moving on..

There are three types of bbq sauce here. ""Original"" ""sweet"" and ""spicy"". I didn't try the sweet. Unfortunately, I mixed up the cups of original and spicy so I didn't know which was which. And I never found out either. Both had the same bland store bought taste. 

Bummer. 

I had a side of ""creamy cole slaw"" which was fairly decent. I'd prefer a little more kick but it was ok. 

The last thing I had was the house made ""sweet tea"". Unfortunately, it tasted very watered down. 

On a better note, the atmosphere is nice, the place was fairly clean and the service was pretty good. 

I do wish the portion sizes were a little
Bigger. 

That's why this place earns a solid 3 stars from me."
3,"If I cant think of a better spot, I go here.  The food is decent... not French, not Cajun/Creole, but there is decent variety (as long as you aren't a vegetarian.... though the Portabella Pita is quite good...)  It's not a bad place, there are just better spots downtown.  It just seems like the ownership is going with the flow instead of making the bar a better place than it currently is.

It is NOT a place I would go to unless I was on a quick one-hour lunch from work.  They don't have draft beers worth mentioning."
3,"Went here last night for a nice dinner with the man & it wasn't to good. We were seated right away which was nice. For an appetizer we ordered the blooming onion & it was good other than the fact that it was drenched in oil & grease. My boyfriend got the Caesar salad with broccoli and the 6 ounce steak and the salad had way to much dressing & we got two small broccoli and the steak was cooked really good. I got the chicken tender platter and it was good other than the fact that they had forgotten to give me any sauces with it, so I had to wait to wave someone down. We waited about a year and a half to come back from getting food poisoning last time & it'll unfortunately be the same wait again just cause we didn't feel it was worth the time anymore."
3,It was my first time there and the atmosphere was really nice. The food was good and I was surprised at the selection because all I had heard about was their wings.
3,"Trader Joe's is my steady dealer that gives me a straight shot of Kashi when I need it most.  So, how is it that Kashi costs 33 cents more in Madison, Wisconsin than it does in San Francisco, California?  Bah-humbug.

Overall, this t-joes is like most other t-joes.  Quality stuff at ok-prices if you have trial-and-error patience ... though you'll be lucky if its still in product-rotation the next time you return.  

Yes-yes's include pizza dough, greek yogurt, walnuts, dried montmorency cherries, unsulfured-oh-ya apricots, hummus, valrhona chocolate, frozen green beans, moochi ice cream, stone ground crackers, bubbily waters, and macaroons.  

No-no's include produce, OJ, chips, TJ brand chocolates, cheeses, wine, most of their overpriced frozen dinners."
3,"That's good and cheap. But I'm not really fan of it. The meat is really thin. 
The good point is all the vegetables served with the meat and fish. I liked it :) 
The place and the staff are really good."
3,"one of two location locations in the GTA! 
Grazie is located by a group of restaurants surrounding Vaughan Mills.  Their original location is situated at Yonge and Eglinton.  Though north of the city this second location is just as busy.  Coming here to meet up with family friends, the restaurant's interior is lovely with its dim and rustic interior its definitely cozy and bustling during peak dinner hours. 
Like the other location, Grazie does NOT take reservations, so wait times can vary, fortunately for us it was only a 15-20 time wait.   

My meal started off with their house made Caesar salad which was quite good. 
For mains, accompanying our glass of red, I ordered their Penza cooked in a creamy tomato sauce tossed with some greens and pancetta (Italian bacon)

I ended off my meal with an espresso

Overall the place is okay...."
3,"French Quarter was a little dark and divey but it has character. It's an older bar, but was a great place to go and watch the World Cup. Even though they were busy, the service was still great! They have a lot of local beer and a typical bar menu."
3,"Was here for lunch. On principle, I absolutely hate restaurants that make you wait ""until your entire party is present"" before seating. I think it's obnoxious and pretentious. Especially for an establishment that's really just glorified bar. And equally especially if it's just lunch and not busy. (At least 3/4 of the tables were empty). The food was ok. They got my order wrong twice. Waitress had to prove to the kitchen that she placed the order correctly by showing them the ticket (apparently they don't believe their staff.) The only reason I gave this three stars instead of two, is the waitress - she was very sweet and apologetic. I likely won't be back - so many other options."
3,Affordable cheap sushi and Chinese food. The staff is friendly and always nice. Their bento boxes are a pretty good deal for all the food you get. Sushi is also good and the Chinese food is good and cheap. Good place to grab some cheap sushi and Chinese food to go.
3,"We went early evening on a Saturday and even then there was a 15 minute wait which is fine...tells us the place can't be that bad.  Typical Outback decor and was clean and decent.  Amanda, our server was fantastic and friendly which kept the third star because the food was just plain mediocre at best.  My daughter had the filet and lobster tail.  The lobster was overdone and a bit chewy, but since this was her first time with lobster and she didn't seem to care for the taste, I didn't send it back.  My wife had the chicken and filet and she liked it but didn't care for the mesquite taste the chicken had.  That was not Outback's issue, since it was wood fired LOL! Point is, if you like the wood fired taste then it's definitely there.  I had the 10-ounce Rib-eye ordered medium rare.  It was served with barely any pink in the middle.  In other words, medium to medium well.  The manager came by for a visit and I pointed this out and she agreed that this was definitely not medium rare and offered to get me another which was nice, but I chose to keep it and not make the rest of the family wait for me.  So, two over-cooked dishes out of three.  One of which was a steak.  If you bill yourself as a steak house, like Outback does, you should never, ever serve an improper steak.  I just don't get that.  We had some gift cards which is why we went, but the experience was just so-so at best.  There are other places that I would prefer to spend $$ and a weekend evening out."
3,"The room is tastefully decorated and service throughout our meal was excellent.  
We decided to pass on appetizers/salads in favor of an order of delicious sautéed spinach.  We each chose grilled halibut for an entree that came with au gratin potatoes.  Everything was excellent though our halibut was overdone and dry.  We did not return the fish because we were under tight time constraints since we would be seeing a show immediately following."
3,"Food was OK.  Rice is very dry.  I got kind of grossed out by the amount of raw food around.  I have done some ""cook your own"" style restaurants before, but the sliced meats and fish grossed me out.

Also, where do they buy their chicken from?  And what the hell are they fed?  I have never seen chicken with so much fat.  Very strange."
3,"Went on a Saturday at 9am.  We were seated immediately.  This location looks new.  

The menu had odd options like salted caramel pancakes.

Enjoyed our breakfast.  Service was ok.  I like how the credit card machine automatically shows you the tip amounts.

Restroom was clean."
3,"My friends and I came here during lunch for the AYCE kbbq. It was about $20 a person which is pretty standard for AYCE bbq so don't let the $$ rating of this restaurant scare you. In comparison to a lot of the korean bbq restaurants at korea town I definitely felt like this place had better meat then the rest. The short ribs and beef were our favourite meats. The fish was came apart pretty quickly and the chicken took a really long time to cook (but this is all typical when it comes to kbbq) so beware of that. My first complaint about this place is that they wouldn't accept debit card but they still took credit cards for some reason... I don't know if it was just because their machine was down for the day or what but it was very frustrating for me and my friends. However, my biggest complaint was the ordering process at this restaurant. The way it works is you fill out a form and state how many orders you want (ie 2x orders of ribs, 3x orders of kimchi, etc). We found that the kitchen often ignored our orders and gave us what they felt was best instead of what we wanted. Since we all really like kimchi we ordered 1 for each of us (5x kimchis total) but they only gave us 2 at a time! The same thing happened when we ordered other side dishes and sometimes with the meat too. I feel that if they aren't willing to give as much as the customers want, then they really shouldn't be offering an AYCE option because it gets frustrating."
3,"I personally have had good experiences at Red Door both of the times that I've gone there.  However, it is way too pricey.  If your wallet can stand it, then it's perfect.  If not, it becomes a place that you go to if you want to spoil yourself once in a while. 

But  I no longer care for them since a former roommate of mine had an ""unwelcoming"" visit with them.  A couple of us put money together to give her a nice spa day as a birthday gift but instead she came back with a broken spirit and a badly done mani-pedi.  She said she felt unwelcome by the way the specialist treated her.  It was a vibe that could not easily be shaken nor dismissed.

I complained to management immediately and vehemently when I found out and she was quick to recompense us for the bad service.  But regardless of the offer she made, this former roommate would rather pass it up than to go back.

I believe that if you are offering beauty services, you should accept beauties of all kinds.  You can't be intolerant."
3,"Very friendly and fast service, and they offer free soft serve!  The bbq itself is a bit pricey for the amount and quality you get though.  Although the bbq chopped brisket is one of their signature dishes, I found it was a bit too chopped for my liking, since the pieces of meat were very tiny which made it hard to eat.  They offer 3 different types of bbq sauce to go with your meal: original, sweet, or hot.  They all seem to originate from the same base, with a few extra ingredients added."
3,Recalled how great their Thursday lunch special was so called in my order for pick up.  Crowded as usual which is fine...used to that but got dark meat instead of what I had requested and potatoes were not great...felt like someone new is in the kitchen.  Too much sauce on brocoli.  Maybe it was an off day...sadly I can't make it there often so was disconcerting.  Good price and very sweet tea.
3,"BBQ sirloin beef with lettuce wrap and rice $40
Came with a tofu soup and a bunch of side dishes all pretty good
The beef was not really fresh as I have seen in other places
The cuts of meat were frozen and many pieces were frozen together
A super filling meal for two people and it probably would have fed three"
3,"Price was good for the quantity of food. Flavor was a little bland and the chicken and beef might have been cat, it was hard to tell but tasted good. Make sure to ask for plastic utensils if you need them."
3,"I've been here twice and both were for family functions.  The food is decent at best but I'm not really a fan of their pizza.  I don't know how they make it but the crust seems far too thick and tough (overdone?) to be anywhere near authentic Neapolitan.  

Their pasta is just OK as well.  The flavor and presentation are ok but the serving size was sort of small and it wasn't anything that blew me away.  They did have some other good items like the baked goat cheese inside of a phyllo pastry with red peppers and eggplant and an arugula salad.  

We had a couple antipasto platters to start and they had a nice mix of some items like pear with Gorgonzola, parmigiana cheese, olives, soppressata, and prosciutto.  Also they were overly generous with the bread that seemed to keep coming which is good to soak up the sauces but they also offered us olive oil as a dipper too.

My wife and I had a pizza each.  Hers was called a Romana ""Potatoes, fresh rosemary, pancetta (cured bacon), diced tomatoes, mozzarella & parmigiano cheese"".  I had a quattro formaggi ""Gorgonzola, ricotta, crotonese and fior di latte"".  To me the pizza seemed dry and overcooked perhaps.  The crust seemed harder than my liking or what I'm more used to which is wood oven type crust which is chewier and softer.

For my main I had the breaded veal which was in a red wine sauce with rapini and roasted potatoes.  The veal was good and the portion size was actually large.  Between the pizza, bread, antipasto, and pasta I was pretty full but we ended up taking home the leftovers.

While I thought the service was very good, the food here is just OK.  The dining area is nice but as far as Italian food goes this is by no means the best there out there but it's not bad.  The prices ok, the service is very good and the ambiance is nice.  We had 2 tables of ten for our large party so they are equipped to handle large parties."
3,"We had 12 in our group and service was slow. 
The food is fresh and delicious, my linguini marinara was very good.
Lots of mussels, cod, cuttle fish and shrimp and fresh handmade linguini.
The atmosphere was the typical Italian restaurant around the Vaughan Mills area, sterile and not much character."
3,"Not a bad place for Korean food. Although their tables and set up is kind of awkward especially if you're going with a big group.  I went with 8 others and we had to split up as they only have 2 large seating areas for big groups which were taken. 

The place gets pretty busy and they dont take reservations on the weekend (starting Friday), so if you have a large group, be ready to wait from 45 minutes to an hour for a split table. 

Service: Really good service. All waiters/waitresses are very attentive and quick with your ordering and refilling of water, sauces, extra lettuce, etc. Never had to wait for more than 2 minutes for anything we asked for. Turn around time for tables is very quick and the place is clean. 

Food: Food is pretty good. I wouldn't say it was anything crazy special, but you will enjoy your meal. They bring your dishes to you very quickly!! We ordered and got all our apps and food within 7 minutes. We ordered the porkbelly lettuce wrap, medium size fried chicken dish and a seafood soup. The large soup was better in taste at OGBG, but still pretty good. Porkbelly was not overly fat and as I said before, the refills on lettuce was spot on so we were never waiting for more lettuce as the food was cooking. The only thing is that they don't allow you to grill the jalapenos on the hot grill. We attempted too (cause we were able to at other restaurants) but one of the waitors asked us to remove it from the grill due to ventilation? Not a big issue, but it was different I suppose. 

As most Korean restaurants, you will come out smelling like what you've cooked and ate. The smell is VERY strong here since the place is kind of small and ventilation (I assume via jalapenos remark) is not the best. I would come back to eat but nothing to rave about. 

Other bonus is that it is open 24 hours."
3,"Yummy local place, I do believe the staff could be a little more cheerful. Very quiet, lots of tables but there was no one else there. We decided to take the safe rout and order a cinnamon roll. It was very delicious. Place looked rather clean and also had kind of a homie feel to it which was nice."
3,"Middle of the road lunch place..nothing more nothing less, French quarter salad is alright"
3,"Was getting my car washed next door and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  Since I love BBQ, this was an easy decision for me to give this place a shot.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try:
4 oz BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich, $4.50
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=Erry3muhVFQdFZQPCJRHzw
2 oz Hot Link Sandwich, $3
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=qxTdcqqimxhFcmoW1Iyj9g
I got them both ""dressed"", which means they give you Onions & Pickles on the side to put on the Sandwich.

Next to the Soda Fountain, there are vats of Hot & Mild BBQ Sauce for self service.  I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.

The food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.

Next, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.

The Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.

Overall, it was a pretty good experience.

Return Factor - 71%"
3,"I was really hesitant to try anything aside from American food in Arizona. Especially pho. Our waitress understood and spoke Vietnamese when we asked questions about some of the food.  

The banh canh had a different flavor than the typical broth I'm used to. Different but not bad. I love soup so any good soup is a win for me. The pho was descent too. Overall I'd come again. 

The spring rolls had shrimp and grilled meat inside of it. It was interesting but flavorful. The flavors caught me off guard but it wasn't bad. 

Next time, I would get the freshly squeezed orange juice since they ran out."
3,"Grazie is Grazie at the end of the day. It's reliable to a flaw. 

The food is good (but not excellent - so there's always a better option for Italian out there).
 
It's branding really and a fun place to hang out with friends."
3,"Trader Joes is great for some things.  The staff  is friendly.  I feel like you really have to know what you are looking for... I don't go there too often because I try to keep my trips down - and usually prefer Woodmans, Willy, Metcalfe's, or Jenny Street.  I also prefer to go to more local establishments.
The parking lot is below!  Just one of the many ""have-to-live-here-to-know"" charms of Madison :)"
3,"I had this chain in Corvallis, OR and really enjoy the cinnamon rolls. Last time I was in I tasted the sourdough, strangely too sour for me but the fact that they bake fresh bread will keep me coming back when I'm in the area."
3,"The locker room and quiet area were dirty, towels on the floor and old water glasses left behind. The restroom was out of toilet paper. The relaxing features that were supposed to be incorporated into the massage were not- eye mask, hot towels, etc. Overall it was a mediocre experience at a high price point."
3,"The hubby and I went here to meet a large group.  They were easily able to accomodate our group at a super long pub table.  The inside of the restaurant seemed huge and the atmosphere was nice for a sports bar.  They have a pretty decent menu.  I ended up getting the smothered chicken with sweet potato fries.  My food was really good.  The sweet potato fries are pretty amazing because they drizzle some kind of sweet honey butter sauce on top.  The service was just ok, nothing outstanding.  Sadly the one thing that stands out to me for this restaurant was the sea salt hand moisturizer in the bathroom.  This stuff was amazing and left my hands nice and smooth after visiting the restroom.  They actually sell jars of the moisturizer at the hostess station but I couldn't justify spending $25 dollars for it.  I'll definitely be back to this restaurant to give it another try."
3,"Trader Joe's is fun to visit occasionally, but not for regular grocery shopping.

Things I like about Trader Joe's include:
-bright and fun atmosphere 
-they have little shopping carts for kids
-good prices on oils (especially coconut and olive)
-2 Buck Chuck
-Nice (and affordable) selection of cheeses
-Lemon turnovers

Despite this, I think Trader Joe's is very overrated because:
-Poor selection of ""basics""; what I mean is that if I have a recipe in hand and go to Trader Joe's, it is likely that I will not be able to find every ingredient
-too much pre-packaged and heavily processed foods
-it's small and hard to navigate when crowded
-produce is sometimes of questionable quality
-I don't love their cereals

All-in-all, Trader Joe's is ok, but there are better places to go."
3,Nothing to write home about really. The place is clean well staffed and the food is average. Nothing to really make you want to come back. This is also a chain with several restaurants in the area. Seems like the are more concerned with a restarunt on every corner than a memorable dining experience.
3,If you wanna stuff your face with meat this is the place to go. I've been here twice for lunch and I don't think I've had a more filling $10 sit down lunch anywhere else. The side dishes are good as well. The service could be a little bit better but I wouldn't classify it as being horrible.
3,"I got the black & blue burger & my girl got the pulled pork sandwich, both were very good & I would get either one again.
Now the wings are a different story. Wouldn't get the again. They were to chewy for me. Plus I got they're equivalent to a sweet heat sauce that was bland. No sweet or heat. Potatoe skins were ave."
3,Tried to call in an order today & the phone was disconnected.
3,"Visited on a Friday for lunch to try their blackened fish and it was just ok...nothing special.  What was worth the visit was the RED BEANS & RICE!   It was delicious and we would go back just to eat that again.  I ordered the chicken pita with fries and it was ok, nothing special either but I would get it again if I had to come for lunch.  The crab soup was not the best, but the service was fast and on point.  It is worth maybe giving this place a second shot."
3,"I apparently went to alternate-world Dickie's because I liked their BBQ just fine. We chose Dickie's because last year I had tasted their BBQ at the Scottsdale culinary festival... their stand had a super long line and it one of the more popular stands I saw. We ordered Dickie's take out for our Super Bowl party and got a variety of dishes and sides including pulled pork BBQ, sausage, brisket, rolls, cole slaw, beans, and more. 

I made myself mini sandwiches with the rolls (nice, soft bread), pulled pork, a mix of regular and spicy BBQ sauce, and some cole slaw. I didn't try the sausage or brisket, so can't comment on that. Everyone at the party said they really enjoyed the food.  

I would agree that the actual restaurant left a lot to be desired. I think I'll stick to take-out. Maybe I just like anything doused in BBQ sauce?  Maybe we got lucky? 

Not as good as Dave's Famous BBQ or Texas Roadhouse, but still very decent."
3,"I recently stopped by to celebrate a birthday with a group of 7 and our waitress was great. 
We had several orders with various changes and all of our orders were correct.

When we arrived for our 6pm dinner and the dining room had a lot of availability; however, within the hour, the tables filled up due to the games that were on that evening.

Great location with meeting people, with easy find.

-Wally"
3,"Monday night is buy one get one burger night! Can't go wrong with that. Burgers are great.. tots meh. Typical bar food with an okay draft list. 

If your looking to watch the game it's a decent place, fried food & burgers/sandwiches is the go to here."
3,"A staple in terms of lunch place diners in the downtown Charlotte area.  I finally got my first trip here the other day and was amazed at just how packed out this place got.  Shoulder to shoulder is the best way to describe it and that's a con because of the terrible acoustics when it's that crowded.  That made for hard to hear conversation and hard to really get engaged with my girlfriend during lunch.  That stunk so I think I'll come back at an off hour some other time.

The tuna salad sandwich I had was fantastic and delivered to the table in lightning speed.  The service was good but don't be fooled they are obviously trained on getting you in and out here during the lunch hour."
3,"My most recent experience at this location was awful. The service was lousy and unfriendly. My friend and I ordered the same exact thing minute apart. We were told they had no sourdough bread, so we both subbed for honey wheat. My sandwich came quickly, and was delicious, but SMALL. After 10 minutes, we still didn't have my friend's sandwich (same exact one). Another 10 minutes passed and no one really looked like they were doing anything. When we finally get their attention, what do you know? They lost the ""ticket"" so they forgot about making the sandwich. Only a few minutes after that the sandwich came out (with sourdough bread), with no reference to the fact that it took almost 25  minutes longer to make that one. We noticed a young girl behind the counter handling the bread without gloves. It was the same girl who works the register, so I can't imagine it's hygienic to handle money and then handle ANYTHING without gloves. When I went up to ask for the manager the girl simply asked, ""do you want a cookie or something, or do you want me to comp your meal?"" But still no apology, and didn't even ask for feedback. They wound up refunding both of our meals, but the young employees should probably receive training on how to be more attentive and customer service oriented."
3,"Pretty decent Italian food. I ordered their seafood pasta special and it was enormous. It's not jump up and down good, but can definitely satisfy a pasta craving. I also consider myself somewhat of a tiramisu expert I give their tiramisu two thumbs up. I copied them and started serving my tiramisu in little balls. Very creamy and yummy! Service is not the fastest but I am generally in no hurry so it's fine by me."
3,Decent food. Good price and opened 24 hours. We got their pork bone soup and LA ribs for a late night snack and it was exactly what we needed!
3,"Very close to my work so I come here for my lunch time to time. Love all the foods served here. They have much more taste than most of the places. However, I would appreciate much more if the service was better. The waitresses seem stressed out when they are serving (at least during busy times they are..). Other than that, a great place to eat Korean dishes."
3,Kind of an odd duck. More of a resteraunt type feeling but with a very expensive menu. Service was good. Apple pie shot was amazing. Very loud for not having that bar/club type of atmosphere.  So ...id say was just ok.
3,"À notre arrivé à Toronto, nous cherchions un resto car nous étions affamés. Grâce à l'app Yelp, nous avons choisi ce resto. Quel beau concept, qui semble plutôt populaire dans les restaurants coréens de Toronto. Le midi le menu populaire est AYCE. Alors au milieu de la table une plaque chauffante de style BBQ alimentée au gaz autour de laquelle nous sommes assis. Sur le menu plusieurs sortes de viandes; poulet, boeuf, porc. À cela s'ajoute du filet de sole et du calmar. Alors, pour le AYCE, le serveur remet une feuille avec les choix de viandes et les accompagnements (soupe, riz, tofu, fèves germées épicées et nature, Kim chi). On fait le choix de ce que l'on veut puis remet la feuille au serveur. Il ouvre le gaz sous notre grille et nous attendons notre commande. Les viandes et poissons arrivent crus à la table, nous les mettons sur la plaque chauffante et faisons notre cuisson. Les viandes sont biens assaisonnées et gouteuses. Le choix est restreint pour le dîner, j'imagine qu'il est plus élaboré à l'heure du souper. Les portions des plats d'accompagnement, à l'exception du riz, sont petites. Le resto était plein et semble populaire et apprécié. Pour un bouffe qui ne demande aucune cuisson du chef, j'ai trouvé le service extrêmement long. C'est une bouffe légère qui demande de la patience, mais c'est très agréable. Mon mari dit y avoir bu le meilleur smoothie à la mangue."
3,"Good place to go for a nice bite to eat.. 
Check the daily specials.... (lunch).... good food all around.

(A bit pricey) for what its worth.

A little tight if you plan to sit down during lunch. You will have to go outside to exhale. 
Service is prompt
Call in service is as expected

I onced ordered a buger, fries and drink... tab came to almost 10 bucks. I don't know if I would call that a bargin. (the burger was fine but NOT 10 dollars FINE)

During the summer months when its warmer (who am I kidding, its Charlotte, it may be 80 mid Dec) they have a few tables posted up outside where you can sit and eat, sit and eat and watch other patrons from several other food places walk past, or sit and eat and people watch or be watched... ekk ekkk ekkkkk!!!!

Try it out... Fridays... ""SHE CRAB SOUP""

CHEERS'"
3,"While Grazie usually gets a 5 from us, this last visit was a bit disappointing.  

We ordered all our usual favourites. The Varese salad was perfect (arugula with prosciutto, pear, and parmesan). The Catrina (spinach long pasta with pancetta, onions and chicken), and the Torino (stuffed pasta with ricotta and spinach in rose sauce), and Margarita pizza for the kids. 

The Catrina is supposed to be seasoned with peppercorn, which usually is very balanced, but today it totally masked the dish and I could barely get it down. We mentioned t to the server who although very nice, spoke to us like we've never had the dish before. We couldn't taste anything but pepper! The Torino was too el dente (again more then usual) and the bottom of the pizza was burnt, and the kids didn't finish it bc of the aftertaste. 

The banana chocolate chip cake was ok, and the coffees were smooth. 

This visit was far from perfect. Hoping it was just an off day. Will likely come back again in hopes they will redeem themselves."
3,The chicken in the pad thai was rubbery. The portion is large. The garlic chicken was decent. The teriyaki chicken again the chicken was rubbery cheap quality meat. Don't think I will return. Staff was friendly and attentive.
3,"A little disappointed when I purchased the white chocolate cherry bread yesterday, it only had a few white chocolate chips and not a lot of cherries either. Please make it the way you used to."
3,"Why do so many places around Phoenix do Teriyaki so poorly? I'm always looking for a good Teriyaki place in the west valley and they all seem to just throw a piece of chicken on a flat top and serve a dry, flavorless and WHITE piece of chicken with some sauce poured over the top. Teriyaki should be char broiled over a flame and have some flavor before adding the sauce.

I ordered a Spicy Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl but it came on a plate for some reason. The chicken was flavorless and the sauce wasn't spicy and very mild in flavor. I would never order the Teriyaki Chicken  again from this place.

The California Roll I had with it was decent for the price and I would eat this again. I will try it again but will try something else on the menu and skip the Teriyaki Chicken."
3,"My opinion of Outback hasn't really changed.  It's an adequate steak house.  Nothing special.  In the past I said some locations seemed better than others.  My visiting is not very frequent now so I don't know if that's still true.  One of the big differences was always the Blooming Onion.  Some places were limp and greasy, others were light and crispy.

I felt like something simple, and had a gift card, so we came here today.  I had a simple burger and fries.  Also ordered was the soup/salad combo and a chopped steak.  Everything was fine.  Not outstanding, but solidly good.

And we do like their bread service.  Nice little warm loaf.

An OK place to go in a pinch, but I don't think it will ever be a destination we plan on.  Except that I still have almost $10 on that gift card, so I do need to make a point of using that soon."
3,"Get there early for lunch or be prepared to wait. The place has the feel of a frat bar, but it's not. Their world famous baked chicken was good but nothing earth shattering. All in all good experience and will definitely go again next time I'm in Charlotte."
3,"A friend and I stopped in here earlier this year during a festival uptown.

The place was packed but it was sort of between shifts so we were seated quickly.  Our server was great and very efficient.  

The food is typical bar/pub fare, nothing I would really consider to be associated with the real French Quarter but what we ordered was good food but nothing you couldn't find any any other neighborhood pub.  But the prices are very affordable here, even for the drinks are affordable and they don't try to be pretentious here like many other places uptown."
3,"Tried Kauai cafe for the first time. Would have given them 4 stars if we didn't order the poke. The poke was on the daily special so we thought we'd give it a try. They give a pretty good amount for the price, but it was not fresh at all. It had a pretty fishy taste and you could tell it had been previously frozen or something. 

We also ordered the bbq mixed plate which came with char siu chicken, teri beef and kalbi. I was totally looking forward to trying the char siu chicken and was totally happy with it. It was the best part of the plate in my opinion. We will definitely go back to try other things. I'm drooling over everyone's pictures of the Lau Lau and lomi."
3,"It's another Hawaiian food place, it's located by Tropicana and Hualapai on the north east corner in the plaza with the Smith's. 

So my favorite thing to do when I visit Hawaiian food places is to order the Loco Moco, it determines if I will go back usually. The presentation was very nice, it was clean and layered well with the rice, patty, gravy, and egg. They also topped it with some green onions (you can see it in my picture). My other two friends got Fried Chicken with Fried Rice and Chicken Katsu with rice each of which came with a side of macaroni salad. We also got Spam Musubi on the side. 

Onto the taste, my Loco Moco tasted dry, the patty was over cooked, there wasn't enough gravy to counter the dryness between the patty and rice. The egg came over easy, but I usually prefer sunny side, not sure if you can have them change it or not (but it doesn't hurt to ask). Overall I was disappointed with my Loco Moco. I honestly haven't found a place here in Las Vegas that could top it back in Oahu (Zippy's anyone?). 

I believe my two friends were happy with their food choices. The Spam Musubi came with mayo in it, which to us was weird as we don't usually see that, but it was still good. I sampled their macaroni salad and it was a little too salty and watery for me, I normally love macaroni salad so I was disappointed with this as well.

The overall experience was okay, I won't be going out of my way to come here though. If I happen to be in the area and want Hawaiian, then sure, but outside of that it's nothing special."
3,"I was introduced to Great Harvest Bread when I lived in Virginia. It was very popular there, but it's not quite so at the one in Henderson. I was hoping to find the same bread that I got in Virginia--one that had all seeds, but they told me they all do their own thing. That bread was the best bread I ever had. I still get their white bread and honey bread. The bread is pricey, but I do love them. I love how they give free, huge slices of bread with butter on them to try. I've taken advantage of this to try some of their desserts. Sometimes I'll like them enough to buy them. Although I love their bread, this store only deserves three stars (possibly less) because they are seriously lacking in customer service. The cashier seemed plain miserable and needs to take some happy pills or find another job where she doesn't have to help people!"
3,"Pho KC (oh how those Vietnamese love their inappropriate wordplay) is a brand new restaurant at the time of this review (October 2017). It's always nice to have more places opening up in such a bland area, although I'm certain we probably should have waited a few months before giving them a try.

We both ordered a couple of eggrolls and Thai teas. The eggrolls were decent, while the Thai tea, which took forever because they had to cook the boba, was just okay. I ordered a plate of shaken beef, which included rice and an egg that I could mix at my own will. My girlfriend's plate included noodles, veggies, and both beef and chicken (sans the shrimp). 

My dish, which the server said was one of their more popular choices, was excellent. Beef was well seasoned and great quality. Everything meshed well together. My girlfriend, on the other hand, immediately noticed that the chicken was pink and obviously undercooked. Not good. You get a bit of wiggle room with beef, but definitely not with chicken. It was one of the few instances where we had to point it out to the server. Not to kick up a fuss, but just so they're aware for future consistency purposes.

The server apologized and gave us an extra percentage off of our meal. Apparently, since my dish was prepared first, she took the blame for rushing the cook to hurry and finish hers so that there wouldn't be a long gap between servings - a common problem that I've noted in other reviews of similar places.

Overall, the place does have potential, but I think if we return, we'll let some time lapse in order to allow them to iron out their wrinkles."
3,"I'm from KC and I think this bbq is just so so. Nothing they make stands out where I could give them better rating for their food. As for staff, cleanliness and things like that I would give them a 5 though. I wish there was more to say but it and average bbq place"
3,"Food was great! Pasta's are super fresh. However we waited for an hour. But I guess that's a compliment to them that they are so busy. 

I just have no patience and don't like waiting.  I also don't think they take reservations. That's what one of our friends told us. 

Great place to have in Vaughan and you feel like your in Italy. I really like the authentic glasses we had our wine in. 

I do recommend if you go mid week rather than weekend."
3,"Stay away from the oysters.  The steaks are not bad (you can do better).  The staff are somewhat friendly, but they mean well.  All in all, if you're ever in Charlotte and you don't get a chance to go here, no worries.  My only suggestion is to go here when you need to meet up with large groups..."
3,"I'm going to slow the hype train on Trader Joe's for a bit. The produce, seafood, and the meats are pretty gross compared to what you find at Metcalfe's or Whole Foods. (Not to be a wet blanket, but frozen ""organic"" chicken breasts preserved in some ""special"" preservative doesn't inspire confidence.)
Trader Joe's is best for stuff like nuts and raisins. People I know have also recommend fruit juices, which I don't drink because I'm trying to limit sugar, and also liquor, but I don't drink so I can't speak to that.
Layout of the store is great with plentiful underground parking!"
3,"$16.95 for AYCE BBQ. $3 extra per person if you want veggies and pineapple to grill alongside. Not terrible. 

My only complaint is I can never eat $20 worth so it's not an especially appealing concept for light eaters/small ladies. My 270lbs brother, on the other hand, was in heaven. I occupied my time doing all the cooking for him and stacking the meats on his plate as he ate.

You get a few banchans alongside, bean sprouts, kimchi and potatoes, which our waiter was happy to refill over and over.

Our service was great - there was only one guy serving a room of 5-6 tables but he was super fast and friendly"
3,"My little piggies and fingers were in for a treat! And so was the rest of my body - no, I didn't get a massage, but this place... the ambiance was upscale, relaxing and trendy (fruit-infused water, anyone? Iced tea? Hot tea? Keurig coffee?). My expectations were high the moment I stepped in the salon.

1.5hrs later, it turned out to be only an okay experience. 

The salon is very time-oriented, as opposed to task-oriented, i.e., they'll do the best that they can to prettify your nails within your appointment time, which in my case was 1.5hrs (45min each for mani/pedi). This could work for people who are on a tight schedule, but I'm not sure if I really like that...

Also this is a $$$ salon. Little piggies and fingers did come out nice and pretty, but I couldn't really tell it apart from my $ task-oriented Asian nail salon -- which might not have all the fufu, but at least I get to keep the extra $$ for the same quality! Or buy my own refreshments? 

I probably won't be coming back here unless I get bribed, but I will definitely recommend this place to friend$$$."
3,"Was in Vaughan visiting a friend of mind and she suggested we go to her favourite Italian restaurant. We started with salads she got her favourite Sea food salad and myself I got the Verse salad which was arugula with pear and prosciutto, I quiet enjoyed the salad it had a really nice balance of savoury and sweet. 

For our mains I had a gnocchi with chicken and snap peas in a cream sauce. The gnocchi's were prefect soft and fluffy. The chicken and snap peas were a nice addition to the gnocchi that is usually served on its own. The portion was quiet large so be prepared to take the leftovers home. 

My friend had a spinach pasta with mushrooms and Italian sausages. She had asked them to substitute the sauce for a red sauce and there was no issue. She quiet enjoyed it and again portion size was quiet hearty. 

We finished the meal with the famous homemade. Tiramisu and it was very delicious, and such a nice light and airy dessert to finish the meal was perfect. 

My only minuses about the experience was our waitress was very sly about the split of a bottle of wine. When we chose  the bottle she said oh get the bottle it will be 25 and we thought oh yeah 13 bucks each is good! But the fine print when the bottle arrived was 25 each cause it was a 50 dollar bottle which was Quiet steep! Quiet over priced I am sure. 

But overall the experience was wonderful and I would return, I guess i will just pay a little closer attention to the fine print. LOL"
3,Normal sports bar. Nothing special about food. Experience a hair in my avocado on my salad
3,"Good daily specials for lunch and excellent portion for the price you pay. Service is also always spot on. If you work uptown, this is one joint where you can sit down to have a meal and be back at work within the hour, as long as you work within walkable distance from the restaurant. Gets busy during lunch, so I would suggest getting there a little early - has limited outside seating as well.

I, for one, love the Friday special - Cajun grilled fish with rice and beans. Can never clean the plate unless I starved the morning of.

Not quite the authentic French Quarter food, but still a decent place to have lunch at in uptown. Would have rated higher if food was more authentic instead of being ordinarily good."
3,"I do not love Trader Joes. I am fond of them however. 

By far the biggest issue I have with them is size. Everything about them is small and cluttered. Even the parking lot is too damn tight. Not sure how people with large SUV's or trucks manage to park CORRECTLY ( key word) in their lots because it is impossible. You cannot walk down an aisle without there being 20 other people clutter there. It's way too busy for me. 

There are 2 items I am a huge fan of which are their box of Jasmine White Rice and their Penne Arrabiata. I am a huge rice junkie. Never thought I would be a lover of microwavable rice. You get 3 packs of rice in a box. It takes 3.5 minutes to steam in the microwave compared to the 20 minutes it takes if you make it on the stove or 15 if you make in a rice cooker. That alone makes me a fan. The Penne Arrabiata are amazing. There is so much you can do with them. Add chicken, add shrimp, add sausage, add veggies, etc. Like the rice, they are time friendly. Take only 7 minutes to cook in a saute pan.

These are the main items I like buying from here. By boyfriend is a fan of their chicken strips. Me? Not so much. 

I cannot grocery shop here. I mean, buy all of my groceries from here. They are too limited on what they stock and quite frankly, I don't get down with the whole "" Eat Organic"" thing which most of their items are. Also, they are a bit $$$$. I saw their beef stew meat range from $8- $11 and only be enough to feed 2 people. I can go to Costco, get a pack that can feed 8 people for $17. Yeah... I just ain't about that life."
3,"Food was good...we've had Dickeys' before but in the Huston airport where they had these unbelievable breakfast brisket tacos, 2 for under 6 bucks!  Unfortunately this location does not have these:(.  This location seemed a little pricy too...so feeding a family of 4 won't happen very often here.  Checked in from my yelp app and got a coupon for a free ice cream!  When my son tried to redeem the staff said the ice cream is already free. Anyway, food was good, location was clean, and staff were very helpful."
3,"Don't get me wrong. It's a good place for bbq. It's generally good. However, this one time, it was pretty bad when we ordered soups. I came a few more times after that and it was fine. I guess my bad experience was one off. If you are worried, stick to the bbq and you should be alright."
3,"Totally hit or miss.  We used to love the salads here, but too many bad experiences lately,  It's obvious sometimes some of the stuff they serve is leftover/reheated from the previous day.  Not acceptable...esp for a $10 salad!  We finally need to throw in the towel on this joint though...not only does the price seem to change depending on who rings it up (and its always more than what the online menu says it is), but last week we got take out salads again, and they were the worst yet!  We can always tell when they don't serve us fresh pitas, but these were SO bad, we could see just how stale and old they were just by looking at them.  Could not believe they actually served them to customers.  Disgusting.  AND, the chicken was dry and definately not freshly cooked.  I will pass on last night's leftovers from now on."
3,"I remember coming here for the ""Grand Opening"" a few years back.... and I remember really loving the food. I have made the trip back a few times over the last 3 years... and each time have been a little more disappointed than the last. 

I went there for lunch yesterday after ""selling"" a co-worker on how good it was. 

I was sorta wrong! :(

The prices have gone way up... and the quantity of the dish was way less than I remembered.

And it was not overly good, or bad... just mediocre BBQ. And I can get that anywhere. 

I made a big deal of the free ice creme to my coworker.... and wouldn't you know it... the machine was OUT OF ORDER on our visit! 

Sorry Dickey's... I am not sure when I will be coming back."
3,"If you're hanging around downtown Toronto and want some buffet action, this is the place to go.  Korean Grill House offers a wide array of Korean bbq meat along with side dishes, select veggies and some sea food.  There are various options you can go for, but most people come here for the all you can eat menu.  

I usually come here for the beef ribs, beef slices, and side dishes.  Everything else could be removed from the menu and I would still be happy.  The meat is usually pretty decent, although not the most fresh you'll see.  If you want the night owl special after 10pm, you'll get an even better value as it's served at a discounted price.  Keep in mind the late night owl menu is only limited to certain meats though.

Overall a great value for the money and be prepared to eat endless trays of meat.  Come with a loose pair of pants and some clothes you don't really care about, as you'll be full and smelling like BBQ when you're done here!"
3,"I've found that Outback isn't consistent from one location to another.  Based on this visit I would say this location is good.  The service was good, and the food was very good.  It's nothing fancy.  Just a steakhouse.  But a good steakhouse.  I had a steak, my wife had the prime rib sandwich, and the kid had a burger.  All were happy with their choices.

I liked the flavor of the fries, but they weren't crispy at all.  My wife didn't like them as well because of that.  She likes a soft crunch of the outer part and a tender inside.  It wasn't as big a deal for me, but I agree with her that is the ideal fry.  But they still tasted good.

We will likely return."
3,Little below average Pho place. Good flavor. Good price. Good service. But very little meat in the Pho bowls.
3,Decent atmosphere and beer selection but for 59cents per boneless wings it could be of decent size.  I got some chicken nuggets size and it was really small.   Maybe not pick the special next time.
3,"This is place is just A-OK for the first 5-10 minutes of grilling...then it goes downhill. I find this place to be a little stingy with their meat portions. You only get so much and if you are with a group of friends it may not work out that well. I find that only certain parts of the grill really do work and the rest takes forever to cook. The worst part about this place is after cooking for awhile, the burner begins to burn and giving your fresh meat an awful taste. Most of the time I find people ask to have their burners changed but this can be time consuming. 

It is a great experience and something new to try out in the city however after awhile the food quality just isn't that great, the portions aren't the best and everything is just average."
3,"Fun if your looking to party but not if your looking for a true New Orleans style menu. The was only one ""creole"" dish on the menu and the rest of the menu was typical bar food.  However, the food was good and there is a decent beer selection (unless you are looking for ""Abita"" which is a NOLA beer...)"
3,"This has been my go-to place for quite a while, but it has been slipping lately.  At the very least I think I should be able to go into a sports bar and get a great draft beer.  This has not been the case recently, with the Yuengling being off colored and bitter tasting.  The Miller Lite has also been bitter.  The cooling system must also be off, because the chilled glasses aren't doing it.
The salad selection is great, but some variety in the menu would sure be welcome.  The menu never changes and some healthy entrees would seem to be more family and/or couples friendly.  Bar food is not for everyone.
I really like this place with it's many big screens and friendly barmaids.  It's just time it becomes less complacent and proactive in addressing issues.  If you are not trying to progress forward, you are moving backward."
3,"I am not sure if I want to eat hot pot or grill meat or even noodle any time of the day. But I am happy that Huh Ga Ne is open 24 hours!

The wait staff here is pleasant and speak good English but I shouldn't have any problem to read the menu as it is printed in Korean, English and Chinese!

Duck with Vegetable in Hot Pot ($30) Ori Jeon Gol is labelled as spicy but lack the spice even when the lady reassured me that it is spicy. She did go and get extra seasonings to help spice it up for us. The duck though was a little tough, I probably won't be ordering it again. But It was not bad for a cold day.

There are also other traditional Korean comfort food: soup, noodle, bbq, blood sausage, pig's feet and more.

At first glance, the pricing seems to be a little higher than other neighbourhood's restaurants but the pricing includes HST. 

I will be back, especially at the strange hours on a cold day.... eating Hot Pot and other Korean's comfort food just make me feel nice and warm. Or I come back to eat some pig's feet with a cold beer?"
3,"Picked up a loaf of coconut walnut bread today.Delicious as usual.Service is lacking.Need to get people behind the counter that are more customer service oriented and treat it like a business and not a joke or, like they are inconvenienced by customers."
3,"I have been to this Korean Grill House location for a few times with my friends. The obvious choice is to get the All You Can Eat Special for $14-$16 plus taxes. The service was all right since the restaurant was full of customers. The waiters kept walking by to keep taking our orders, refilling our cups with drinks, and they were very friendly as well. The marinade for the meat was very decent. There are a  lot of selection in the All You Can Eat Menu such Salmon, Beef Ribs, Squid, Chicken, Beef, Pork, etc.  The side dishes that come along with the meal (Kimchi, Tofu, Bean Sprouts, Beef Bone Broth) were nice compliments with the meal. I will keep coming to this location due to its location in the Toronto downtown area."
3,"Not the most authentic or wide range of AYCE kbbq. If you're willing to pay the price for a better kbbq experience, I would suggest somewhere in koreatown. 

For the $17 AYCE dinner, you only get around 8 different meat options plus banchan which is kinda a disappointment to me. You get so much more variety at Chako for instance. And the meat wasn't even great quality either. On the slip of paper to reorder more food, when asked what was the difference between the liver or some other meat listed, the server wasn't able to identify it......

However, servers were nice and attentive - checking in on us and constantly refilling water (don't know why they didn't just give us a pitcher of water). They are a little slow.. But are apologetic. 

Meh. Decent place."
3,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had high chairs as it looked very bar-y when we walked in.  We ordered the fried pickles, which were pretty good.  The wings were just ok and the bill was huge for what we had.  It just felt very overpriced for very average food.  We didn't even finish our wings, and that's saying something.  Our service was mostly attentive, however.  This would probably be a good place to drink and watch a game."
3,"Wait time is looooooong.. just for eye exams to see if you qualified

But the lady who explained us about the different procedures was very nice, knowledgeable and no pressure. Its just too expensive. Lasik of nv quoted us 2k less than wellish.

Why go to more expensive when both services are great."
3,"This place is a good option if you are craving for some pasta or pizza.  The restaurant is close to Vaughn Mills mall and parking is plentiful.  I believe they have another location in the Yonge/Eglinton area.  The Vaughn location is newer.  

The food is decent here. I got the capri pasta which is linguine with shrimps and clams in a garlic and olive oil sauce.  They make their own pasta which is very nice.  The dish was very tasty but I feel for the price they could have been a little more generous with the portion size.  I also got a margherita pizza to share with my table mates.  The pizza was good but nothing to write home about.  I don't think I will be back as there are so many other italian places in York region that are just as good and better value."
3,"Trader Joe's is what chain grocery stores like Pick'n Save (or anything under the Roundy's umbrella including Copp's and Rainbow), Piggly-Wiggly, Cub Foods, etc. should aspire to be like in terms of service and product.

That said, the one in Madison is especially clean and very tidy--things are pretty well organized that you can find what you're looking for by just looking around at the area of food it would be under. The prices are on the higher side of being affordable, but understandable as they attempt to make them a little more beneficial and ""healthier"" to some extent (not always true, but they try in a lot of cases.)

Here are some of my favorite products I'd recommend trying: Korean Short Ribs, Dark Chocolate Mint Creams, Sweet Potato Fries, Chili Pepper Sauce (not as spicy, but has a great flavor), and many of their meat cuts are pretty great too.

I'd avoid: the breads are only so-so, Sweet and Sour Chicken, TJ's soy sauce (you can get better and cheaper elsewhere), and milk (if you're getting Kemp's this is, again, cheaper elsewhere).

TJ's is great, but if I had a choice, I'd prefer Whole Foods at a cheaper price. Regardless, this is still a solid store and I go here when I'm particularly craving some good meals I can stick in the oven while I do homework."
3,"Great wings, great sandwiches & wraps, and even my salad was awesome (I don't expect much out of a sports bar salad, but it surprised me!). I've had friendly and attentive service both times I stopped in. The bathrooms smell terrible-- I think they have plumbing issues, but if you can get past that then it's definitely a place Streetsboro was in need of (sorry Chuggers!)"
3,"I personally think this place is nothing special. The food is mediocre/similar to the rest of the Korean restaurants on finch and Yonge. There was, however, a huge menu.. So I kind of liked that. We ordered four dishes - Bibimbap, tofu stew, kimchi fried rice and.. I don't remember the name for the last one lol (refer to pics). I've had all of these dishes elsewhere and I personally don't think it was the best here. The tofu stew was good, kind of different. They added garlic to it, which gave it a kick. I haven't had this with garlic at other places, so this was a genuine surprise even though it's something so small. Service was quite slow, but it was full house so I didn't expect much from that department. Overall a decent experience but nothing extraordinary. Given another opportunity, I may come back.. If I'm in the area. Otherwise I wouldn't bother coming."
3,"The food is fine, the price is fine, the service is what it is (straight forward, not rude not nice, just order). But check the food inspection on the wall folks ""conditional""! You want to eat at a place that's not sanitary? I don't."
3,I agree with David. Tons of TV with all the games on. Good bar food. Nice open atmosphere. A beer list that rivals that of any bar I have been to.
3,"This is a good 3 - 3.5 star.  We really like this place, but I am not going to say I am a 'fan' just yet.  

There food is pretty good but a little on the pricey side.  You do get a decent portion but you may struggle a little when the bill shows up.  The service has always been really good.  

They are focused on being a sports bar though and at that, they are pretty good at.

Inside is a little industrial, so if Moose makes you think it is going to have a warm woodlands feel, don't.  But that being said, it very comfortable and open."
3,"Excellent pork sandwich..hot, fresh with good flavor. Nice interior, clean and well decorated. The only downfall.. very under staffed. Incoming phone orders was annoying since no one picked up the calls...so the phone rang constantly while one of the employees in the kitchen was apparently on the phone texting with no concern to answer the phones. Solve this issue.. and all would be great."
3,"It's good to see a family owned restaurant in the fast food capital of Streetsboro Ohio.  I've been traveling here for many years and have long since given up on finding any remarkable food.  This restaurant is no exception. Food was okay at best. I had chicken wings that were a bit under cooked. They came drenched in sauce. It was literally floating in it.  Salad was decent. 

Beers were good. Service was fast but without personality.  If you put this place in any other place I would pass.  In Streetsboro however it offers at least a choice."
3,"This place is pretty new and it looks more modern than many Korean places nearby. But they are still traditional enough to have a ""take off your shoes and sit"" area. Service was pretty good, but it's a non-factor to me in general. 

The menu looks good. They have lots of standard stuff like bibimbap or BBQ pork belly + a few dishes you won't easily find elsewhere. I saw top shell stir fry (or maybe it's called sea snail? Korean name is goel beang e). I also saw lamb hot pot. 

It took a while for me to decide what to eat as I didn't really intend to get Korean that day. We ended up getting a table hot pot. We had the Octopus/Beef hot pot. It's $30. I thought it was steep but apparently their prices include tax already (but not tip). The portion was decent in portion and they were not skimpy on ingredients. 

The hot pot was very flavorful and the side dishes were plentiful. But I was expecting it to be spicy. It wasn't. Oh well...it's still delicious in its own way. We couldn't finish it all (but mostly because my partner is a small eater). 

All in all, it's a decent place to eat, especially if you want to try a few unique dishes. I could not find a special reason to come again, or to avoid. If I'm in the area, it's certainly a valid choice if I want Korean."
3,"after reading all the poor reviews I figured give them a chance. my home warranty sent them to my house because of  a leaking pump. Daniel came to the house and fixed the leaK, great. but after my pool pump shut off the skimmer blew up. To find out there was air in the system.  I called Daniel he said that shouldn't happen, but it did. I found that I had to prime my pumps every morning, I knew that wasn't right. I finally got the air out on my own after many questions to friends. I called and left messages with Aaron pools, it was the Memorial Day weekend and knew no one would be there until Tuesday.  They said they called and left a message, never happened probably dialed wrong. my understanding is that 2 men came on Tuesday at 2, I was home, they never rang the bell. they changed o rings, the pool turned all white and the skimmer blew again. I called them to come back but they wouldn't until I called my warrenty company. they said it was a filter problem and that was a different issue. the receptionist was no help she didn't know how to handle people that are upset. I spoke to Nancy the office manager,  a little more understanding. finally 2 days later they came back. the tech who's name I thought was Stetson but from reading another review it might be Westin, he was early, great, he walked in the backyard took one look at the pool and said your water level is to low. I said should the other guys have noticed that? he just smiled. he said once the pool fills you will never have to prime it and there won't be air in the system. He double checked my filter he said there wasn't any problem with it. everything has been working perfect since. so what I am really saying is make sure Westin or (Stetson) is the tech to come out. he really is very knowledgeable. and a gentlemen."
3,"Am I the only one who hates to pay to park?  Trader Joe, I love you but I would visit more if I did not have to pay. 

You always seem to have new and interesting food. I can find frozen riced cauliflower or great seasoning mixes. If you need anything obscure, chances are you can find it here. 

I really like your gluten-free products and wine options. That is 75% of what I purchase. I would probably shop here more regularly if I was not charged to grocery shop."
3,"Fun place to bring a group of soccer players. Lots of TVs and good atmosphere. It took a while to get our food, but it was 8pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. The tavern chips are excellent. The California chicken sandwich was good but the bun was so soggy I couldn't pick it up - had to use a knife and fork."
3,"Another 24/7 korean restaurant.

Ordered their pork bone soup.. great portion size, but the flavour wasn't all there, something was off about it. I love it when my soup is served when its still piping hot and bubbling, and it wasn't at all when the food came. So I was pretty disappointed. 
I went around 2pm and only a few tables were taken. Not sure how busy this place gets but service was good overall. 

Three stars just based on the pork bone soup. Will prob go back some other time to try other things on the menu."
3,"The restaurant itself is very clean and well kept, everything is new as well, seeing as it recently opened a few months ago. My son was given a pristine high chair. There seems to be only one server, which did not pose an issue until more patrons arrived. The server did not fill our waters once, as he was either too busy serving the other 2 tables, or filling napkins/ condiments on other tables. Immediately, we ordered shrimp spring rolls and egg rolls. No small plates were given, so we had to use our napkins to avoid dropping drips and crumbs. Both the spring rolls/ eggrolls were not the best... definitely have had better. I was hopeful there was a tofu pho dish, according to other photos I saw on yelp, however the server informed us they cannot accommodate... so I had to order the chicken pho ga. Upon arrival, the bowl was much smaller than most pho spots (only one size, no options). The broth SMELLED amazing, however the taste was nothing special. I may return on a Monday (as my favorite Pho spot is closed that day), however would more than likely opt to not. Sidenote, while leaving I ordered a Viet iced coffee-- which just may put the Starbucks beside them out of business- it was delicious. :)"
3,"Typical sports bar and Grill type of place with some hits and some misses. You could do worse in Streetsboro. 

Decor: a little odd. Has a sports bar feel but a lot of big Windows letting in light confuses the concept. Central bar with tvs everywhere. 

Menu: Easy enough to understand. Think BW3...wings, wraps,  burgers,  salads, sandwiches, and maybe a few entrees. Very large wine and beer list. Beer list also explains the flavor profile for the various beers...love this! 

Staff: Service was fast and attentive, but our waiter was weird! He did help me rearrange my order into a combo to save money,  which was great. Was not a fan of him telling us to take our time looking at the menu because he ""really had to pee!""  TMI buddy. 

Food: Huge portions. Fries and chips are made in house.  Fries are the skin on boardwalk style and chops were large cut kettle style. I got boneless wings with loaded chips. Wings were good and chips were very crunchy with good stuff on top! Others got chicken tenders, pulled pork sandwiches and burgers. All were above average quality and a great deal for the portion. 

We brought kids during the day and felt it was kid friendly. Have not been here for dinner. 

Good food, good portions and pretty good deal. Not and blowing experience, but a great stop for something a bit different on a budget in Streetsboro. Will go again!"
3,"We had a party of 7 on a busy Saturday. After paying for our drinks from the bar before being seated @ our table, the wait staff appeared a bit rushed to take our order. In fact, while our friends were just digging into their Caesar salads, the staff brought out the mains. The food was quite good and we did manage to monopolize the table regardless of the impatient staff. We ordered a piece of chocolate to go. PS the Cosmo costs $12.00! A bit much for a few sips!"
3,"It doesn't matter how many other places I go, I am always down for a late night dirty breakfast. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, and hashbrowns make for a great late night dinner. Free wifi and cheap. Nothing fancy here, just Denny's."
3,"Lots of protein!!!!!! So much protein!!!! If I lived around this place I would come here after workouts. It's a pretty standard all you can eat Korean BBQ place. The service is fairly good and the good tastes okay. The reason it's not 4 stars is because it doesn't taste amazing and the seating could be better. 

I recommend going late at night for their night prices! Cheap!"
3,"Was looking for a quick brisket sandwich and headed to Dickey's. The brisket was average, but the the staff was weird. No one was at the drive thru and I went in. There were several Spanish speaking employees kind of wandering around and finally(after about 5 minutes of standing around) a white guy finally took my order. The brisket was passable, but the experience was not good."
3,I love BBQ but this place is less than average. The bathrooms sure could use a deep cleaning too!
3,"I got the smoked wings and requested drums only (no up-charge). Most restaurants usually add a few bucks, this was a welcome surprise. They tasted fine and came with a side of horseradish for dipping. The onion rings were a huge disappointment. The rings were touted as a house special, but tasted like school cafeteria mush. 

The beer selection is decent, but by no means enough craft options for my liking."
3,Pricey. We never walk out of there spending less than $50 - includes a tip BUT that is splitting a meal. We typically get 3 beers and 2 chardonnay. It's pricey. We only. Go there if we can't get in at chuggers.
3,"Been coming here weekly ONLY because the Boro has limited choices. Wine is $6.25 a glass, service at the bar is really good. Food is pricey but most often good. Can't get out of there less than $30 plus tip. The bartenders are very attentive so that is why we return."
3,"I was very excited to get Lasik or PRK done here but now I have some serious doubts based on how the office is managed and their policies.

I went in for a consultation, they said I would be a great candidate for PRK, may possibly be approved for Lasik. They said it had a speedy recovery time. I went ahead and booked the $300 pre-op battery of exam tests. 

The wait time wasn't terrible, I had all of the tests done, and then the doctor came in to explain that I was only a candidate for PRK, that I wouldn't be able to drive for 10 days, and for six months afterwards it was sunglasses 24/7 outside, vitamin C, fish oil, special prescription eyedrops, all this other stuff. OK - fine, it's *a lot* of recovery time - it would have been nice to have been told in the consultation appointment. 

The doctor was nice enough -- he has great reviews here --  and said he would rather I wait 4 months to get the procedure done to make sure my eyes stabilize - which is fine. I'm glad he is being conservative in his treatments. 

But in the meanwhile, I need glasses. I called billing several times, left a message each time and they got back to me a few days later. From the hours of tests, they couldn't even provide me with a prescription, and I would have to pay for my medical records (hello - the records are mine. I paid for all of the tests. why can't I have a copy of my own medical records without having to pay you a per page fee!?). The person in billing referred me to a woman in the office who said that for $79 they could do an exam so I could get a prescription. When I called back, they didn't honor this, and said they don't do any exams at all. The guy I talked to then said that they refer out to an optometrist (so... who is doing all of your tests in your office??) and then forwarded me to another black hole voicemail. It has been two weeks since I was screened for PRK and I still don't have glasses. I'm going somewhere else to get my prescription and my glasses because I really would love to be driving legally and I really don't see the point in going back to these people for PRK."
3,"One of the Go-To places for Korean BBQ downtown, but since it's very popular (especially amongst the univ students in the area), it gets very crowded. Service is very slow in busy times, and depends greatly on your waiter. It's cheaper price for AYCE after 10pm iirc, but it's also way more busy. Your mileage may vary..."
3,"Located next to Starbucks on Marks St., I've been coming to Great Harvest for sandwiches, loaves of bread, and the occasional cookie or gift for years.  The food quality has been consistently good, with the exception of one really undercooked loaf of sourdough.  The service, however, swings wildly from stellar to terrible; depending who is working.  It's become a game guessing what service we'll get.  

They are open for breakfast and lunch Mon-Sat, but are closed on Sundays. There are 6 bread choices that they offer daily, and another set of breads that rotate.  See the Bread Schedule to know which breads they have on what days. What's nice is that you don't have to buy a loaf without tasting it first because they offer free sample slices of that day's breads, with or without butter.  They also sell day old loaves for 50% off.

I mainly come here for their delicious lunch sandwiches, but they also offer soup and breakfast items you can eat there or take to go.  They can also make up baskets, bags, or boxes with baked goods for gifts, plus they have other kitchen items you can include or purchase individually such as aprons, jam, oils, spices, mugs, etc.

On my most recent trip a friend and I bought two lunch combos (comes with a 20 oz. soda-coke products, and a bag of chips or pastry); and split the two sandwiches.

Turkey Pesto: Turkey, provolone, and pesto sauce grilled on sourdough with lettuce, tomato, and red onion, and a balsamic drizzle 

Chicken Berry Pecan: Chicken salad made with chicken breast, roasted pecans, and cranberries served on our Honey Whole Wheat bread

The Turkey Pesto is my go to here.  It is absolutely delicious every time.  The Chicken salad is good too, but tends to be a little dry."
3,"We stopped by here for a quick drink and snack before the baseball game on a Tuesday afternoon. The outside area was crowded but we managed to grab a seat outside! It was nice weather and the waitress was attentive! We orders the London Broil Pita and the Monte Cristo with Greek Fries. The Monte Cristo was to die for, it is basically a ham and cheese sandwich deep fried topped with powder sugar! Definitely a different type of sandwich but so worth it! They also have a $3.50 Local Draft for the Happy Hour Special on Tuesday! 

So bottom line, get the Monte Cristo Sandwich & a local beer!"
3,"First of all...no mistake that this place is actually good---BUT not today. :(
We ordered take out which consisted of oxtail soup that was so utterly disappointing. There were only 2 oxtails and one was so skimpy.  There was no flavor like didn't have any salt/seasoning. For $10.95 we were so disappointed.  Beer battered chicken was really dry....burger was ok but chips were over done. I know this place has good food because we've eaten here before and did take out once before but maybe these particle items are not so good for take out. Overall we spent about $50 and were not satisfied and just really disappointed because we like to support Hawaii restaurants....."
3,"Just what I wanted, quick massage to spoil myself on my birthday.  I was happy that they got me in within about 30 minutes of calling for an appointment, but the 20 minute wait in their back waiting room was boring and a waste of time.  Massage was wonderful and the only reason I'd consider going back, the wait and the price will probably keep me away from now on though."
3,"I don't buy into the trader joes hype to the level that many do.  I acknowledge they have a unique experience and interesting food options,  this particular location is difficult to shop because it is very small and difficult to get to by car.  Parking is a nightmare, especially on the weekends.  The only thing that gets me in the door is their $3 Charles shaw wines which do live up to their name."
3,"Stopped by here when I came to see if a certain baking company was still open. Nice little casual joint, with everything that you would come to expect from a barbecue place. Had a few meat items, baked potato, and a few sides. Everything was absolutely fine, but that's about it. Nice place to come for a fix, but there wasn't anything that jumped out at me enough to make the 30-minutes drive out here again. If you live close by and are wanted a halfway decent piece of brisket, then you could do a lot worse. However, you could also do a lot better elsewhere."
3,"I do miss working downtown since this is a nice spot to get some after work beverages (or 10).  Very laid back, no frills atmosphere to this place with an eclectic menu so I am sure there is something everyone can find to eat here.  Location, helpful staff, and tasty food/drinks makes me give this place a solid 3 stars."
3,"Its a chain restaurant.  Consistent with their other restuarants, this place offers a sports bar ambience. Family friendly and typical burger, chicken wing and 200+ beer selection.

The food came out right, nothing to be surprised , its standard bar type food. The beer was cold, the TV's are all  working.  

I am glad to say that , when the food is not the focus, they did a good job with service. Our servers, 2 of them, was quick, friendly and happy.  We also tried their oysters here and its the standard gulf oysters."
3,"Good pulled chicken and pork sandwiches.  Somehow the chicken has a great smokey flavor and is not dry like so many other places.  The managers special is $8.00 for a sandwich, side and a drink.  They have really good slaw.  Great value!"
3,"Good doctor but TERRIBLE WAIT TIME!!! 
2 hours (after scheduled time!!) wait time for 3 minutes with doctor!!! Totally unacceptable!!! Nobody came to inform us that will be long delay or to tell us anything! After exam the Back Office manager came out (after 2 times requesting to see her) to tell us that she's sorry but that they CAN'T CONTROL doctor's timing!?!? 
I'll think if I'll return there - soooooo disrespectful because if a patient is late 2 hours to appointment they CANCEL IT!!!"
3,"definitely make reservations

food was 4 stars
service 3

overally 3.5/5! Not bad, not amazing, I prefer the originally Grazie in uptown toronto, it just tastes more fresh and much more attentive service. Here they just have a bunch of teenage boys"
3,"I ate here on a comp and the service was very good. the food was OK, the rib eye steak was a little tough and no flavor, the lobster bisque was quite good though. The prices were somewhat reasonable. I mean, you cannot really expect high quality on these prices. Also, it is at the Cannery and I do not think they are gunning for a 5 star rating. The place is nice and clean. This place could either be a hit or a miss. For a steakhouse the prices are better than others and it's worth a second visit."
3,"Service is slow. Servers tend to serve European ethnic people rather than a group of Asians. I sat there and waited 20m until they came and asked if we're ready to order. (?!)
The food is good tho. I ordered the Penza. It's just really good and I think it is the best dish there. The creamy tomato sauce is not as creamy as I expected. I don't like creamy dishes but I enjoyed it. 
I will come back again for the food but no comment on service."
3,"Before you read this review keep in mind I only go here after 11 PM at night as I often work late. I usually come here once a week for a late night dinner/snack. I usually come with a group of 3-6 people. The food is good for what you can expect from Denny's. I understand they are short staffed at night but all to often we get poor service. Sometimes we walk in and it takes an employee 5 minutes to notice and seat us. Another 5-10 to order drinks and food. The food typically comes out quickly for the late shift. The number one thing that bothers me is refills, it takes forever to get a refill of water or coffee. Sometimes we do get a good waiter (our favorite waitress), but its usually the same handful of waiters that don't pay attention. I will still continue to come here because its really the only option for a decent 1-3 AM meal."
3,"I allowed the current 3 star Yelp rating to influence my rating if this place because I am truly torn. We had a great time and a great experience, but being with positive people caused that more than the restaurant itself. 

For those that are unfamiliar, this type of restaurant has you cook your own food on a small gas grill positioned in the middle of each table. If you want the ""all you can eat"" option, everyone at the table has to get it, so that there is no sharing if food that you didn't order. If you get that AYCE option, they give you a small slip of paper on which to select the items you want to order; similar to the way many sushi restaurants do. 

There were 4 adults, 1 teenager and 1 infant.  Our server must have been under the impression that we came for the experience. He learned very quickly that we came for the food! We had just finished a day at Caribana at which we had walked no less than 6 miles. We heard that the place was AYCE and we came to eat all we could! Mission accomplished! 

I told our server that we had never done this before, and asked for advice on how to ""do this"". He said that it was fine and we could do it any way we wanted. Big mistake! You can't tell a bunch of black people from South Carolina to do whatever they want because they will move into your house after that! 

We started rather modestly; each person ordering 1-2 items. The trouble with that was that the portions are Asian-sized, but none of us are Asian. We began to drop our pieces of meat onto the grill and we even asked for reassurance. ""Are we doing this right?"". The server smiled and nodded and told us we were fine. That little bit of food was gone in no time. Lesson learned. On to round two...

We ordered a bit more this time and started to establish which items were our favorites. We still had empty trays on the table from the first round and the table was becoming a bit congested. My buddy knocked over his cup of water. The server came over with a towel and apologized with vehement enthusiasm. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" We found it quite amusing that he was apologizing for our screw up. Only in Canada!  

At this point, we've got a nice spread of food going and the meats were seasoned to perfection. If you don't like your food at a place like this, who can you blame? You cooked it! 

The kimchi was deeeeeelicuous, though I could have taken it with a bit more spice. We had beef, lamb, chicken, squid, pork...all flavorful and tender. Our server turned the heat down on one of our grills, which at the time seemed to be for our benefit. The grill had started to burn a bit and the food was now cooking more slowly. By round 5, it appeared that this was his tactic to slow us down a bit so that we would fill up.

By round 7, they had switched servers in us and they stopped checking on us altogether. We had to call them to get our drinks refilled, and they were probably afraid to come over in fear that we would order more food. The last couple orders had food left off and even food on it that we didn't request. By the end of it, we had tried everything; except the tofu. 

The service wasn't great, but they remained polite and professional though they were often inattentive. The food was excellent. The experience was really cool. If you're into new experiences, you've gotta try it. Just don't be surprised if they've changed the AYCE rules since we left. It May now be AYCE with a 6 plate max!"
3,"This is our go-to cheap sushi place when we are craving sushi. Food is usually pretty decent for the price but service could definitely be improved. We always order their bento meal that comes with chicken  teriyaki, dumplings, soup/salad and sushi. Today the sushi rice is too vinegary sour and our food took over 20 minutes to arrive at our table. Our server took forever to ask for our drinks and even longer to give us water refills."
3,"The salad I got wasn't bad. Just super small. I think it was the fiesta salad. It came in a small bowl. Thought its be bigger. The chicken that came with it was about 3 fingers big. And well say it was Girly fingers. Haha very small pieces. Thought there would be more chicken. Panera Bread has the same salad for way cheaper and the portion is way bigger. When it comes to dinner time, they shouldn't serve lunch sized portions to hungry ppl."
3,"I used to be a very frequent korean bbq customer with this chain of restaurants and this was my first time coming to the new Yonge and Dundas location. In short, it is very similar to all the other korean grill house restaurants, AYCE for low prices and tons of MEAT MEAT MEAT.

A quick rundown on how korean grill house restaurants work. You can order AYCE or you can order off the menu (everyone gets AYCE), however if one person gets AYCE in your table, nobody else can order from the menu, everyone HAS to get AYCE. Basically, they give a you a large selection of meat and there is a grill in the middle where you essentially cook the meat yourself given a pair of tongs per person. Meats include beef, marinated chicken, lamb, squid, fish, etc. 

Let me start off with the food. If this is your first time coming here and you are CRAVING tons of meat and grease then you're going to love it here. It is essentially unlimited meat grilled to your heart's desire (not really since all your arteries will be clogged up afterwards). However, the meat here is  LOW quality meat and full of grease and nasty preservatives. The food is very very greasy and may give you a stomach ache afterwards if you eat way too much. Also, although they say it is ""Korean BBQ"" the chain is actually Chinese owned and the BBQ here is not authentic korean bbq. Authentic korean BBQ has much higher grade meat and is generally not AYCE. If you are craving a lot of meat and/or are with a large group of friends and you want some AYCE this place is great. However, if you are on a date or want a nice classier dinner, this is definitely not the place to be as you will smell like grease and your stomach will feel horrible afterwards.

The service here is mediocre, it is not amazing yet they are not generally horrible. It was a problem for us getting the attention of one of the servers as they do not constantly come and ask if everything is ok or not, you have to call them down (in typical chinese restaurant fashion). 

The decor is quite nice and the place is large enough to fit a lot of people but it is not overly popular unlike other restaurants around the area. We arrived on a friday dinner and there were tons of open seats whereas places like salad king were full to the rim. 

In short, come here only if you are CRAVING all you can eat greasy meat and don't mind the low quality cooking. It's alright, I have to admit we always have these cravings every now and then. Don't expect a nice, classy dinner with a date, this place is just a lot of fun cooking and hanging out with a large group of friends."
3,I'm giving 3 stars for the food. But overall this is a nice place to drink a beer and watch the game.
3,"Big Screens and Bigger screens, great location and decent food.
Located right off Harris Blvd @ I-77 near North Park Mall this place is a great stop for good Pub Grub.
The Turkey Club is excellent and the Super Nachos are a meal for four or more.
You want to go here on game day to watch the Panthers. You can enjoy the view from many Plasmas or the huge Big Screen.

They do serve Guinness but the day I went there was a problem with the tap so I had to settle for the Fat Tire....meh..."
3,"A good, not great prenatal massage.  I liked my therapist a lot, I just think the places that have the tables specifically for prenatal (a hole in the middle) are better.  Here, you're just going to be massaged while lying on one side for the whole time.  Regardless, the ambience was nice and a solid massage is a solid massage!"
3,"My wife has been craving a Monte Cristo so we found this little dive. Nice place, staff was very nice. My girls each got a Monte Cristo sandwich and my son and I got a steak sandwich. The sandwich was good, but my recommendation. Some Salt and Pepper or some other seasoning. The Monte Cristos was pretty good, but not what she was looking for. The search goes on..."
3,"The Hawaiian plate was okay.  Kalua pig was good,  lau lau was a little dry,  squid luau didn't have the sweet coconut taste and the luau leaf wasn't cooked long enough. The lomi lomi salmon tasted great, Mac salad had enough mayo,  poke was good but I've had better.  I wouldn't try the Hawaiian plate again but I did try the Mahimahi sandwich and it was crispy in the outside and moist in the inside.  Quality is average.  I would eat there again. I just wouldn't go out of my way to visit.  I still have other local Hawaiian food spots that I take family and friends when visiting."
3,"We have always enjoyed this location, but on this visit we noticed that the entire restaurant looks like it could use a good scrubbing.  Sink around faucets is black, my hands felt dirty after washing than before!.  Silverware dispenser is covered with splatters of bbq sauce.  Door handles dirty.  It makes it hard to enjoy the bbq, which is quite tasty, when you see how dirty the surroundings are.  I'm surprised manager or owner doesn't notice these things and insist that everything get a thorough cleaning!  Also, the large pots that hold the bbq sauce should really have nozzle dispensers.  When people use the ladle to pour sauce into small plastic containers, sauce runs over their fingers and back into the pot.  Not appetizing."
3,It's not the greatest food you will ever eat but this location has a very friendly staff and very clean environment. It's a great place for kids and if you go on a kids eat free night that's an extra perk!
3,Okay so My family and I are out enjoying the Romare Bearden Park Sunday around 9:15 p.m.and decided to grab a bite at my Favorite pizza joint. No way. The restaurant was closed so we strolled into French Quarter. Very tight when you first walk in. We were immediately greeted with a warm smile from the bartender. We were seated in the back where we could see the fireworks from the baseball game. Ordered Wings and the Monte Cristo. The waitress was nice. Food came fresh! Best Monte Cristo ever. Wings very crunchy. Waitress not very attentive after that. Matter of fact she never came back. Poor service Great food.
3,"Hanging out with friends in Uptown and decided to stop in for food, drinks and reprieve from the Charlotte heat.

We were greeted immediately upon entering by a very nice and pleasant bartender who directed us to seat where we wanted. 

After being seated, our waitress came by to offer water for the table and take our order. Great start so far with service and hospitality.

We ordered 2 hamburgers one plain and the other with bacon cooked medium. Nothing worst than having a dry burger. I personally ordered the steak sandwich with a salad and Stella's for the table.

We weren't happy with the burgers coming out more well done than medium but they weren't horrible either just a burger. Our waitress mentioned the burgers are typically made medium unless otherwise requested. The steak was also ordered medium which came out more well done so it was a little chewy. Otherwise our meals were fine and the fries with the burgers were apparently a hit lol.

Overall, we will give this another try since our service was great and good wasn't horrible. I have to mention my steak sandwich was served without lettuce/tomatoes although the menu mentioned it. We also had to get our own napkins but again the service was actually good lol."
3,Responding to James a review. Perfect analogy. It's Denny's. Service was prompt and friendly. Wait time for food was minimal. Everything was hot and cooked properly. It's Denny's and will return when I want that experience.
3,"Went here tonight for a work christmas dinner (we have a very small staff), and overall we all had a good time. The service was pretty good, nothing that I can complain about. It wasn't too loud in there or anything so we were all able to talk and hear each other okay. They were quick with refilling the waters which I always appreciate. 

In terms of their menu, I wish they'd have more of a mixed option for people who eat meat but also like to eat vegetables... there were very few veggie options on the all-you-can-eat meat sheet that you got, and you had to pay 3$ extra PER PERSON to get unlimited veggies! That seems a little silly to me. They should add an in-between option with some of the less-favoured meat products taken off and replaced by vegetables. 

The bathrooms were kind of strange, and super cold but they were cleanly. Same with all of the utensils. The grills definitely get super dirty, but that's sort of expected.. they let you change it once I think? We didn't get around to it because we had 3 at our table but yeah. Kinda gross, but like I said, expected. 

Overall, we had a good night. The staff were very accommodating to us when we did our christmas gift exchange, and they all said Merry Christmas! :)"
3,"I love Trader Joe's, but this one is just not that great. 

1) The produce at this TJs is pretty awful. I steer clear of most of it, the few times I have bought produce here it has spoiled way too quickly.

2) Things that are always stocked at other TJ locations will only be stocked here for a few months tops. They'll introduce an item, which I'll fall in love with only to find it gone in a few weeks-a month! If you ask why, the people who work there won't know either.

3) Prices are not consistent with other TJ locations! Some of the items have prices hiked way up.

4) Worst parking lot EVER. Glad I live within walking distance, that lot is a complete mess.

5) Employees don't offer to help you/check that you're finding everything ok. Given issue number 2, I typically am in need of assistance hunting down something/figuring out why it's no longer in stock and have sometimes spent minutes following a TJ employee around the store to ask for help!

Despite these issues, I come here pretty often to stock up on my TJ favorites (and for the free samples!). This store is definitely not the store to come to for your one-stop grocery needs. Come here for yummy snack items, the granola and Valrhona chocolate."
3,"I hate, hate, hate the parking garage. I like the location and the atmosphere. Trader Joe's has some good products, but usually I just find them over priced. I love the samples here. They're always fantastic and I always end up getting something. The staff is very friendly as well!"
3,"Loved the live piano music.  Our waiter was very attentive and had a great attitude.  The food was just not completely up to par.  

We started with the calamari and Portobello Frites.  The calamari was really good, but the frites lacked flavor; one was also a bit dry.

As for the entrees, the ribeye was cooked nice, but was not seasoned enough.  The lamb chops were too small (given 3; should have been 4 at that size).  The pan roast was good, but pales in comparison the Palace Station's Oyster Bar.  The cheese potato side was really good though.  

Overall, still a good experience, but the food definitely needs to catch up with the ambiance and staff.  Officially 3 1/2 stars, but since I can't do that, I'm trending downwards."
3,"I don't see it.  Order the beer battered chicken for take out.  was two pieces, thigh and drum. It was ok, I had better.  The mac salad was so-so.  All for $9+.  3 stars is being kind."
3,"Came as a group recently and ordered the Nico. Had good portions of meat (slightly overcooked and tough) with mushroom juice over a thick pasta. In my opinion I found this dish to be very similar to standard Chinese food as silly as it sounds. The Nico was under the white sauce category but it what came out was something alot more on the brown - soy sauce salty base. I'd try something else on the menu next time. But the price is steep 25 dollars after tax and tips. 

The portions are fair and the service was decent. But I would be more inclined to try a different pasta place"
3,"You won't miss this restaurant as you walk along Queen Street from University westbound.  Within the area, you can smell the BBQ.  So be prepared to dress appropriately so that you won't leave the place with the BBQ smell on your body the whole night.

This is AYCE Korean BBQ.  There is the base AYCE for $15.95.  If you want lamb and shrimp then pay $2-3 more.  The basic covers lots of meat but if you want any vege, then another $3 more.  We like the AYCE Kim chi as starter.  Here come the many square dishes of meat that you can pile them up.  There are beef slice, ribs, liver, chicken, salmon, sausage, pork and so on.  The meat is marinated to be on the salty side.  So you have to drink a lot while BBQ.  

The service is quick at the beginning.  There is a long line up right after the baseball game.  The waitresses are fast enough to remove the trays once they are empty.  At the end, I can see my empty trays keep piling up at the edge of the table without anyone taking them away.  But what do you expect for an ACYE restaurant.  For the price, it is a good deal."
3,"Woooo, doggies buckaroos and buckarettes!  Texas barbecue is back in Scottsdale.  With the closing of El Paso Barbecue (Damn the economy!) I've been jonesing for some good ol' TexBBQ.

How is TexBBQ different than others?  Mainly, we ain't much for puttin' rubs on the meat.  Salt 'n' pepper the stuff and slap it on the pit; smoke it and eat it.  

Anywho, I was sittin' here at the house and in walks the BF with two bags of Dickie's To Go.  Pulled pork.  Smoked turkey.  Macshells und cheeze.  And holy of all holys, fried okra.  

The pulled pork was just right.  Not overly smokey.  No fat in sight.  Not pre-sauced.  Hog heaven folks, hog heaven.  

The smoked turkey, though, needs help.  Its juicy consistency was on the ""sliced deli"" side of the spectrum.  And it just plain wasn't smoky enough.  Real smoked turkey is smokey, smokey and not a whole helluva lotta moisture.  Reload and fire again, Dickies boys.

Macshells und cheez was a little creamier than I liked it, and needed more cheeze but a tidge of salt cured what ailed it.  

I liked the fried okra and am grateful for a source for it.  With fried okra there's no gray area.  You either like/love it or you hate it.  I love it.  (My Momma's fried okra is coated in cornmeal, salt 'n' peppered; and the cornmeal splits and some of it chars and the rest is brown as a berry.  Folks, it's like eatin' popcorn!  I'll stop there.  I'm makin' myself miserable.  Momma and Momma's fried okra are back in Texas.).  Anywho, Dickie's version needs a dash of salt just after it's taken outta the fryer.  For a treat, kiddies, sprinkle some parmesan cheese over your fried okra.  Yeah, I know puttin' parmesan on it is like puttin' a tux on a frog, but everything needs to go steppin' out up every once in awhile. 

And Mr. Clark, I'm givin' Dickie's a solid three stars.  It's gotta good beat and it's easy to dance to.  Check it out and chow down."
3,"My boy and I were in Toronto for a wedding on Saturday and visited the Grillhouse on Friday night. We are both a bit familiar with Yonge Street and remembered that there are great spots to grab inexpensive meals. We were sat immediately and the spot was lively. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.
I'm a veggie and had my requisite Bi Bim Bap and he had beef barbeque. While my meal was overall tasty, I was a bit disappointed. At any other Korean spot, my meal has arrived with my veggies, egg, etc sitting atop or aside the pot of rice. That works for me as I typically do not eat the rice (or have a bite. I'm not getting younger after all). At the Grill House the server mixed it all together. Oye. Way too little rice to the amount of veggie stuffs. Also, I missed having a whole fried egg to delight over. That said, the dish was still fresh and tasty. Boyfriend mostly enjoyed his meal. His dish consisted of strips or pieces of beef that we were able to throw on the pit. That's always fun. Our service was great and the prices are of course beyond resonable.
While not my favorite Korean spot ever, most certainly worth visiting."
3,"I was here with a couple of friends from work for dinner.  I was instructed to come up a set of stairs when I walked into the restaurant.  Once upstairs, I found my friends and sat down.  They were already halfway into dinner service and they let me know that the service was horrible and no one really understood english.  I wasn't going for the All You Can Eat so we asked the waiter for a menu so I could order an item from their dinner menu.  It took them at least ten minutes to bring the menu over and another ten minutes to get my order put through and fill up our cups with water and tea.  The dinner itself, surprisingly, was not too long of a wait and I decided on the Beef Bibimbap, which was very tasty and I demolished the whole thing myself.  While I was eating my dinner, my coworkers were on dessert.  Little did they know that ice cream was not included in AYCE and you have to pay an extra $2 something to order ice cream (which only consisted of chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, green tea and red bean).  Other korean restaurants I've been to for AYCE has always included ice cream and a wide variety of desserts in their dinner service.. None the less, I think I'll stick to my regular korean BBQ restaurants that charge more for AYCE dinner and includes dessert and sushi with better customer service.  Korean Grill House will probably be my last resort for last minute cravings for korean BBQ, the food is delicious don't get me wrong.  They just need to work on including dessert and having more staff in house to serve and cater to good paying customers that are cooking their own food in their restaurant."
3,"Be careful what you wish for.

I ordered the cucumber roll on the happy hour menu, expecting it would be like all the other cucumber rolls from other sushi restaurants with fish inside,  but instead got a roll with just cucumber. That's all. Lol I Asked the restaurant if I could exchange it, and they said no because the owner said I already ordered it, which is not the way they should have handled it. Although I was disappointed the food was good, and fresh. It was clean and quiet. No waiting at all, but my rolls were small, not sure if that's only on the happy hour menu."
3,"I've visited Trader Joe's twice in the past two weeks. It has been my first two visits as well. I was excited to see that they carried things like coconut flour, ghee, and coconut creamer. I can probably get these things at larger super markets, but Trader Joe's is located right in downtown Madison. My other grocery store options include Madison Market and Capitol Center Market. Both of these places either don't carry these items, or they are priced towards the expensive end. Trader Joe's is not as expensive as I anticipated it to be. I can find some very reasonable prices for certain things. I will continue shopping at Trader Joe's for the things that I cannot get else where. Organic eggs, chicken, coconut milk/creamer will all be on my list. Beef, vegetables, and fish not so much on my list."
3,"Decent bar food. Wines are pretty high in my opinion but Draft Beers aren't bad. Food is spot on BAR food. Don't go expecting anything fancy. Burger was tasty albeit SMALL (5oz?). Tuna app was decent but no mistaking it for sushi quality. 

It is loud especially during game day.

Not a bad option when in this area...... just keep the expectations low....."
3,"Great service, Great smell of bread, Free samples, cant go wrong here.

The one thing that made it one star less than a perfect five was the breads they had on sale made specific to each day. 

i was craving the walnut coconut bread (as I saw on the menu). Come to find out that it was only made on tuesdays and sundays. :(

I got another bread to sub for the bread I wanted. Its not the same. Also, I find it weird that they closed the store when they sold out of bread. I thought whoever owned the business should know what their sales are per diem and make enough product for that day. I guess they dont teach franchisee's cost management  info."
3,"My husband and I visited the French Quarter a few weeks ago on a gorgeous day outside. We went for an early dinner, hoping to avoid big crowds -- it worked! We were able to get a nice seat outside and enjoy the beautiful weather. The staff was friendly. No downsides to that. 

The three-star rating is really all about the food. My husband got some salmon which was beautifully cooked, however, the rice he got on the side was completely flavorless. The beans in that mix as well or underseasoned. I ordered the Cajun pasta with chicken. They did a great job of blackening the chicken, however, again the rest of the dish was underseasoned. The sauce was too runny for my taste and overall I felt that I could have made that same meal or better at home.

I think if you're coming here, you're coming more for the atmosphere and the bar. You won't find a gourmet meal at the French quarter. I think we expected this, but were still hoping for more with the food. There are plenty of other Cajun restaurants that would trump the quality of the French quarter."
3,Our table service was amazing and the food was good. But we waited over 5 minutes to cash out at the register. They seemed very understaffed on the front..
3,"A little disappointed

I have been to Chef Ben a few times and the food has always been okay.  However, on this last visit I was a little disappointed. 

On this visit I had the happy hour special, which consisted of egg drop soup, dumplings,  and teriyaki chicken Mind you, nothing tasted bad, its just nothing was really good either. 

I was served my soup almost immediately after I was seated, within 2 minutes my entrée was also served.  I think it would have enjoyed my entrée  had I was given  an opportunity to finish my soup. 

Maybe it was just an off day, but the food and serves were mediocre at best."
3,"I walked in. There was a group of four ahead of me. It took 15 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge that I was standing there, 3 feet in front of them. Another 3 minutes to be seated. It was not completely full, as there were at least 15 empty tables/booths. At least they support our military veterans."
3,"The place is nice enough and very casual. The service is ok as well. Not too bothersome and just the bare minimum. The pricing is standard for pho in Phoenix, maybe a bit high. I just did not feel a wow factor. I tried their spring rolls which had a mediocre peanut sauce, just a tad bland. The size of the portion was average and it cost $3.99 for the pair. I also got the veggie pho which I felt was also bland. I liked that they gave an ample amount of bok choy in the soup but otherwise it wasn't anything special. I felt that the broth lacked boldness and the noodles were a bit overcooked for my taste. Basically, everything was just ok and I feel like it could be better. There wasn't hassle and I appreciate that it was close to school, but otherwise I probably wouldn't come here. I am still on the search for delicious pho in the west valley."
3,"Trader Joes is successful because of it's campus location.  As typical with most TJs a lot of the items are competitively priced.  They have some items that are all out steals.  But, because the store isn't very large sometimes there are inventory issues.  We've stopped in for pizza dough, coconut oil and some other things and they were out.  I get it, out of stocks happen.It just seems to happen a little more frequently here.  Good selection of cheese, frozen dinners, sauces etc.  Produce is bottom of the barrel though.  Thats what farmers markets are for!"
3,my coworker brought some sushi from this place on my lunch break and it wasn't that bad. I had about four or five different rolls and only one of them I did not like. the quality wasn't too bad only one of them had fish and the fish was decent. now I got my lunch for free but from what she told me the prices are pretty cheap so you get what you pay for. May try this place again but by myself so I can try other rolls and see what they really have
3,"Came here on a Tuesday at like 5:30 am since me and my boyfriend couldn't sleep and wanted Korean stew.  
Flies everywhere and the side dishes did not seem fresh. Really didn't enjoy the meal. 
It's too bad. I'd like a good Korean restaurant that's open 24-7."
3,"First review of the year!!!

My boyfriend reallyyyyyy wanted outback so being the amazing gf I am I just had to take him. =) I've actually never been to an outback. For drinks I ordered the gingerbread martini. This drink was amazing and really tasted like gingerbread!! I wish it wasn't only seasonal.  

The reason the bf likes outback is because he loves their prime rib. And what happened? They were out. This was his second time here and the same thing happened with this location. We asked to speak to the manager about it and he ended up price matching us for the ribeye. He really enjoyed it. I ordered the special sirloin. I always get my steaks medium. But it was a bit on the dryer side and tasted more towards well done.

The manager came back and ended up taking the ribeye off our check. We really appreciated that and that really shows good customer service. HOWEVER, apparently they ALWAYS run out of the prime rib right around dinner time. That to me is poor service. If this is happening on a daily basis why would you not be more prepared and have more on stock? We pretty much have to call ahead to see if they'll have it. Which I find ridiculous."
3,"Come on people, it's Denny's, if you're looking for five star dining, you're looking in the wrong place. On the other hand, if you want simple diner food and a decent breakfast, this is your place."
3,"Had a side salad and wings-
    Salad good - warm bowl ?
     Wings Great - dry rub Smoked way to go.
Service - two girls short handed with no leadership 
       Seems like whole staff hides in kitchen 
Good beer selection"
3,"Love the food here, been many times. Service is usually above par too. Everything is tasty, and all the side banchan are good. 

I do feel like its gotten a little grottier over time, used to feel like it was clean and slick and now it feels kinda dirtier."
3,"Food is typical bar food. However, I did have a salad which was pretty good. The service was better than most for a bar and grill. They have plenty of tvs for watching sports. I would say give it a try for the atmosphere and drinks, not necessarily the food."
3,"Just ok, very typical sports bar. The food is good and the service is decent. They have a large variety of beer and liquor which is always good. No much to say about this place. Its typical. I did love their tavern chips and cucumber wasabi."
3,I went to Ben's since Jimmy Johns had not so great reviews next door.  The waiter was nice and quick (I was the only person in there) and he was cleaning and setting up while I was eating.  I got the Katsu Chicken and I thought the sauce was too sweet.  I was expecting thin strips of friend chicken over rice.  The friend chicken was over cooked with some pieces uneatable and I think I also got at least some fat.  It was served over veggies which may be something they do in AZ but I had never had that before.  I ordered a salad and a sampler of fried foods that was very good.  I probably wouldn't order the Katsu again but it's a sushi place so I would probably order that if I ever get there again.
3,"Eh nothing crazy here. I came to French Quarters on a Friday afternoon for happy hour last week for the first time. We asked to sit outside and were provided menus. We were just ordering drinks, but I glanced over the appetizer menu. There weren't many options and not 1 dip on the menu!! What!! Dip is life! But like I said, we were only getting drinks. 

They had HH specials- $5 house wine (originally $6) and Moscow Mules for $6. Our server didn't come to our table for about 15 minutes. She didn't seem too interested in working. We all ordered the mules and a glass of wine, which took another 10 minutes. I don't mind waiting, but they were not busy. The drinks were good- the outdoor area is nice- not sure if I would return. I'd pick Valhalla over French any day. Hands down."
3,"3.5 my go to table cooking for years. There's 2 things on the menu we always order: the kalbi table cooking for 2 and the beef japchae. The table cooking dish is actually good for 4 people if you order a variety of other stuff. This dish is marinated very well and the meat is tender. They also give you rice, lettuce wraps and sauce on the side and a free tofu soup!! The japchae is very flavourful and cooked well. Would definitely be back !"
3,"I have been to this place for 5 times over the past few years. 

Food quality is consistently good, however, price has been raising (both wine and food).

However, if you enjoy fresh made pasta, this is still a good place to go."
3,Disappointing!! It is 9pm and we can't get a burger... Because they don't make them this late --- what? We left the Panther's game early! Oh well. We're here and it will be the last time.
3,"I love to go to Grazie Ristorante at their Yonge and Eglinton location for dinner. We usually goes there for dinner on the weekend since they always have the seafood linguine special that my hubby loves. 

So when this location just North of Vaughan Mills opened, we decided to stop by after shopping at Vaughan Mills. 

When you walked in, the decoration is identical to the other location with the same colour theme, same furniture and same lighting. The only thing that is lacking is the atmosphere... The Yonge Street location is always busy with so much energy..here it is more subtle. The patrons are little more mature. 

There was no wait for the tables when we got there around 7 PM on Sunday..and with tons of empty tables.

The menu is the same. So we ordered our usual pasta and the Seafood special they have. The food were as delicious as we remembered. Their tiramsu was great as usual! 

The nice thing about coming here are plenty of free parking!"
3,"Trader Joe's is cheap!  However, you get what you pay for in some cases.  For fresh fruits and vegetables you are better off going to Willy Street Co-op (I joined after a few weeks of going to TJ's for all my grocery needs...I'd rather pay a little bit more for fresh ingredients).  Case in point: their bagged tuscan kale.  Sure, it says organic, but what you get is mostly the hard-to-eat kale stems.  In fact, the stems are pretty much inedible (in my opinion) unless you pickle them!  

Do yourself a favor and just stock up on the cheap wine and pre-made frozen foods at TJ's.  Don't bother with the cheap TJ's beer (like nametag) though unless you like brown, carbonated water...instead buy boxes and boxes of chocolate hazelnut cookies to go with the wine!

One final note: my dog really loves the organic chicken and brown rice treats.  They're pretty cheap at three bucks a pop, which beats major pet stores any day.  Also, the sponges they carry are pretty rad (try cutting them in half before you wet them to make them last longer!), which consequently go really well with the lemon hand soap they sell in the same aisle."
3,"Hickory Tavern is a small but growing chain in the North Carolina.  Serving dependable bar food with a great beer list, I can see why it's gaining popularity.  They brand themselves as a steaks and oysters place, but they are really a sports bar basically (a tastefully decorated one though with minimal tschotkes).  

And a biggie for us, they were open Christmas Eve.  This location is relatively new and has a large, airy atmosphere with high ceilings and tons of TVs.  I've been to the Pinehurst location before, and ordered the same meal at both locations, the delicious Carolina burger.  As anyone that knows me knows, the best condiment for a burger is more meat.  The Carolina burger offers that meaty condiment in the form of chili paired with mustard.  The burger is above average (mostly due to only having two options for temperature, medium well or well done - they may as well ask if I want my burger bone dry or burned), but the fries steal the show - in between steak and shoestring in size, they were cooked perfectly.  They also have 1554 (in addition to Fat Tire), which helps soothe my New Belgium beer cravings.  I can imagine this place being great to watch NFL games on Sundays.

All in all, you can't really go wrong with Hickory Tavern - dependable food in a low key atmosphere with good beer.  Things could be much worse in life.  Now to get Red Oak onto the Hickory Tavern taps, and 1554 onto other restaurants taps."
3,"Was here by myself today. Probably should go with 2 or more to make it more fun. Service was OK. Food overall, very salty. Cheap though. All you can eat for $13.95 with probably 7 types of raw fish and meat to cook your self plus kim chee, tofu and Korean spicy potato salad plus rice is dang cheap. Started slow because this was my first time doing this grill your own meats thing. But after abut 10 minutes, I had that table grill thing dancing with sizzling meat and fish. The trick is get a good load going of a little of everything. As soon as its done, re-load with more raw before you eat which will be done by the time you finish eating the first round. Not sure exactly what meats they brought. Could have been German Shepard for all I know but it was good overall. I 'd try it again with a group next time."
3,"This place is not bad for a 24hr place, certainly better than the other 24/hr places at yonge and finch, like dingy kayagum and barely-passing-their-health-inspection pyung won house.

The restaurant is large, for a korean place, Half the restaurant is normal seating, the other half is traditional ground seating, which is a bit uncomfortable since the tables seem smaller than usual. If you're a normal sized asian or bigger, this isn't going to work well for you. My boyfriend was definitely bending and twisting into every shape before he got (barely) comfortable.

The service is blunt, but at least they're quick. The food came fairly fast but nobody brought us napkins or even water. They just put two spoons on the bare table, which is not cool. The workers are all busy even though they're definitely not understaffed. They're very rushed and that's not good, because one ended up dropping a whole 24 case of bottled beer, which made a huge mess and commotion. R e l a x ! 

The food is good though. Kalbi tang was very warm, soothing and tasty. Boyfriend surely enjoyed his donkatsu. Portions are large and the side dishes are fresh and tasty. I definitely want to come back to try the korean bbq!"
3,"Pretty decent 24hr Korean food option serving a whole variety of dishes. This place will satisfy your craving, whether it be pork bone soup, grilled meat, or hotpot. The dishes I tried were the bossam, spicy rice cakes, and spicy beef soup with glass noodles.

The bossam here is a little different from the other places I've tried. The pork belly is sliced a little bit thinner, but the pieces are bigger. The spicy radish and lightly pickled cabbage help cut the fattiness of the meat. The rice cake didn't come with a lot of sauce, but I didn't mind because the flavors were strong, just a little on the sweet side. The rice cakes were super soft. It came with a lot of side dishes, but the assortment weren't my favorite. 

There are plenty of seating to accommodate large groups and feels pretty clean. It was really cold in the restaurant because the door kept staying open, had to keep my jacket on for most of the meal. Prices were pretty typical but slightly higher than other places."
3,"We went here on a Sunday afternoon and they weren't too busy. Sunday is when the kids eat free, so we were happy.  The food was great, maybe not the ambience of a Kansas City smoke house, but good BBQ none the same.  Try the pull pork, sausages or brisket.  Enjoy!"
3,"Dropped in for lunch with a friend while in Charlotte on business. Very loud, but good service and a very tasty Monte Cristo sandwich.. but very loud."
3,typical bar type fare .. my mom & I split the 8 wing w/soft pretzel combo .. bourbon street wing sauce .. my husband had sliders (kept raving how they were cooked to a perfect medium rare) .. with the had cut fresh french fries .. those dipped in the cheese offered w/the pretzels was a wonderful combination .. would go back in a pinch ..
3,Pretty great place for a set down lunch. They have a great salad selection and the calamari is delicious! I have been here a few times and they seem pretty consistent. It is a typical sports bar. The staff can look a little overworked at times but they always get the job done.
3,I have been coming here over 20 years--since it was by the smiths on sunset.   Great bread and great service.  What has happened?  Are there new owners?  The employees aren't nearly as friendly and what is up with the shrinking pumpkin bread?  It's become sooo tiny and my grandkids won't even eat it anymore because there are always big chunks of what I believe is unmixed flour and they think it looks gross.  I'm really sad about the decline in quality
3,"When I worked Uptown, this was one of the regular haunts for me & my co-workers because it is inexpensive and offers pretty good variety.  I woulldn't consider this place as a cajun/creole place but the food that they serve is typical American-Greek fare with a couple of New Orleans style dishes thrown in for good measure.  Usually the specials are pretty solid."
3,"We have been searching for a BBQ place closer to our home and my Dad, who lives in Colorado and eats there all the time there, recommended we try Dickey's. 

Our conclusion was that it was decent food, not too expensive given the normal Scottsdale prices, but it was nothing to write home about.

I ordered the 1 meat platter with Chopped Brisket, Green Beans and Bacon and Baked Potato Casserole. The meat was really tender, but didn't carry a lot of flavor on its own. The green beans were mushy and mostly flavorless (definitely not my favorite). The Baked Potato Casserole was great, but what's not to like about mashed potatos that taste like a loaded baked potato? My husband ordered the Beef & Cheese Baker and a side of Coleslaw. Same conclusion regarding the meat, but the potato was cooked right and tasted great and the Coleslaw was good.

The BBQ sauce, both the sweet and spicy versions, had good flavor. The consistancy is pretty thin so it doesn't really grab the meat, but that just means adding more and you can have as much as you want.

I would go back to try a couple different meats, sides and a couple of their salads - and if you're craving BBQ on a budget and don't want to make it yourself, this is good food.

UPDATE: Recently found out that Dickey's are individually owned franchises. Ate at one in Highlands Ranch, CO and it was outstanding. So... I suppose this one in AZ has potential to be better, owners just need to work on their quality and cleanliness."
3,"This restaurant gets pretty good reviews and while I was here it was super busy and there was always people waiting for a table. To be honest I don't see the hype for this place especially in an area with so much selection. The menu here is pretty well rounded and has a lot of options, and it is pretty cheap. But all the dishes that my family and I ordered seemed to have a lot of fillers in them (like onions and random veggies) rather than the good stuff you actually want and order the dish for. 

The appetizer dishes here are great, as you get a good combination of things. I ordered the gamjatang (pork bone soup) which was super disappointing. The broth tasted bland and the pork was not the easy fall-off-the-bone type you typically expect from this dish. It was a chore trying to get the meat off the bone, eventually I just gave up. I also ordered a spicy rice cake dish for the table to share which was good in texture, but the sauce tasted a bit watered down. 

There's a lot of hustle and bustle going on in this restaurant, as it is a small space and there was always people waiting in the doorway. I think they need to do something about the outside of the restaurant, which isn't too welcoming looking. They put all their garbage and recycling around the doorway which takes away from the exterior. However, the inside is pretty and quaint, as there are regular tables as well as traditional seating where you sit on floor pillows.

I was impressed with the speed of service and attentiveness the servers were able to maintain during such a busy time. One thing that I really disliked was that twice during my visit two separate workers took the garbage from the back through the restaurant seating areas to the front outside. I'm pretty sure this is some type of violation and it seemed like a normal occurrence for them. This shouldn't be happening at all, but especially during such a busy rushed time and small space, customers don't need to see that when they are trying to eat. 

Overall, I don't think I would come back here especially since there are so many other competing restaurants on the strip. Yes the food is cheap but I would rather pay the few extra bucks to get better quality food that isn't just fillers."
3,"The first time I walked into this McDonalds of Japan was after a Frat party at University of Southern California.   I don't know if I was drunk, but some how this bowl tasted like the best thing I ever ate, and was hooked thereafter.   During my stay in Southern California, I often drove 20 miles just put down a combo bowl.  Then I moved back to Hawaii, and sadly, Hawaii doesn't have any franchises of this company which totally weird, because there enough Japanese tourist in Oahu to fill Sam Boyds stadium 

So years go by, and then I move to Las Vegas.  Still no Yoshinoya, but a few trips to LA, and I get my fix to settle my cravings for this cheap bowl of meats,rice, and vegtables that ruled of my early college years.

Finally,  Yoshinoya sets it marks in Las Vegas!   YES!     I always love eating here back when they first opened this location, but on my last trip.   Something is different about the chicken in the combo bowl.

The chicken isn't the same at all, and I liked it better when they broiled it with the skin on, and it had a crispy bite to it.   Thankfully, the beef is still the same, but the vegetables lacked the taste from what I'm accustomed too, and  now kind of hate it!   There was a nice chicken broth, buttery taste to the vegetables, and now it has no taste.  The plates has gotten bigger, but it's all about the memory of college days at this point, and I want my original taste back.    

McD's changed their menu, but they never screwed with the Big Mac...come on Yohinoya, bring back the original  taste.  It's not too late."
3,"I was driving by this place and thought I'd try it. I ordered the burger combo with fries. 

First the positives:

1. The fries were amazing! I love these fries. Thick-cut, fresh not frozen, potatoey insides, crisp exteriors, not overly greasy. Absolute fry perfection. Like the best chip chuck fries. Oh my golly. I will come back here again and have the fries. So yummy.

2. The girl taking my order was super friendly.

3. They had Just for Laughs Gags on so it was fun to watch while waiting for my order.

The negatives:

1. Took a while for my order. At least 15 minutes, maybe more. No one was in front of me, but I guess they were busy making call ahead orders. Calling ahead is probably something you want to do if you're planning on coming here. If you're just driving by and come here on a whim, be prepared to wait.

2. They're renovating the bathrooms and so they're not available for customer use. I just wanted to wash my hands. The contractor was in the ladies' so I tried that men's room. It was obviously in the midst of being renovated as well. There was no mirror, no handsoap. I did find some handsoap outside of the washroom and brought that in to wash my hands. 

3. My burger patty was dry. Really dry. No moisture to be found anywhere dry. I was hoping this was a one-off bad burger experience, but another reviewer warned that you should be prepared to like your burger overly charred and over well done. That's a shame. This place could be a real contender if it didn't insist on cooking their burgers to the point where every bit of moisture has been obliterated. 

I may go back and try another burger hoping for a more juicy patty, but even if that doesn't pan out, at least I know the fries are exceptional."
3,"I love to eat, but I didn't ""love"" eating at Burger Factory. The orders can take a while and they're not bad... but they're not worth the wait when you have as little time left as I do. Maybe it was because I was forced to watch Just for Laughs on their TV, but overall I had a below average dining experience. Tornado Fries were too salty, regular fries were pretty good, burgers were good and fresh. It'd be nice if there were hot dogs on the menu, but overall I'd say 3.5 / 5. #itiswhatitis"
3,Satisfying my every-five-year craving for a beef bowl. Also gotta have the chicken wings.
3,"Comedy Bar is one of those places I just can't get sick of. I've been here numerous times now and have had a great time every time. The comedians are super funny and talented (especially when they involve the audience) and the employees are friendly. The funniest show I've seen here was the Undiscovered show with headliner Peter Johansson, he was such a natural.

The bad: The venue is super crammed as many others are saying so be sure to come early to get a good spot. I wish this place would learn something from Absolute Comedy when it comes to their seating environment! Seats are mehhhh, not too comfortable. The bar also gets super crammed before a show so it can be a bit difficult to get a drink. They never (or seldom?) have drink specials which makes me sad.

Tip: Groupon occasionally has $20 coupons for 2 tickets and $20 worth of food. Check to see if they have it before you go!"
3,"9 pieces ????? for $3.99 was good deal.  It was deep  fried one not pan fried.  I still expect Yoshinoya to be Yoshinoya in Japan I know ""Cheep, Fast and Tasty""...
A regular beef bowl which is main dish here is over $6, that is not cheep meal to me.."
3,"I quite liked this place, it is small but the staff are super friendly. I did have food here, glad I had the wings and a side salad...can't really go wrong with hot wings! Others in our group had sandwiches and burgers, which I believe were disappointing. 

I agree with most other reviews re the temperature of the room, i am always warm but even I was cold inside."
3,Food is okay. Nothing to go out of your way to get. Had a chicken teriyaki bowl and a beef bowl with a 6 piece gyoza to share. It would have been better to go to Aloha Kitchen for the chicken teriyaki. It seems that Yoshinoya is missing out on dimensions of flavor. We are not sure that we will be back as we were not overly enthusiastic about what we ate.
3,"PROS: delicious white sticky rice, juicy beef, good teriyaki wings

CONS: unpleasant odor in restaurant, food was dry on this visit, new walnut shrimp have mayonnaise sauce not depicted in photos

I grew up going to Yoshinoya in Cali. It has a small menu, but there are some delicious options. I have been to this location near UNLV many times in the past, however this visit was a little below par.

I was excited to see the new Honey Walnut Shrimp bowl, but was dissapointed when it arrived covered in mayonnaise.  The vegetables were the standard vegetable medley that you get in a frozen bag from the store.  They usually have a broth that covers the rice but were dry on this visit.

The beef bowl is their signature item. The beef is thinly sliced and cooked in jus with onions. This is typically my favorite but was also dry on this visit.

Overall this trip was dissapointing. Too bad because this restaurant is usually delicious."
3,Visiting from San Diego and wanted chicken & veggies.   Counter was very disorganized- at least 15 people waiting for food to come out. Finally got to order. Waited 10 min for my food. From where I was sitting could NOT hear them call my order. Food was fresh but cold. Not sure if anyone here knows or cares about customer service.
3,"A new gourmet burger joint that opened some time ago. The difference from the other similar places being that they give you some value for your money in terms of  large burger (when compared to the competition). I like to go here every so often. I usually get the triple ""compressor"" burger combo with the fries on a stick/skewer and a pop. What kills this place is the horrible decor,  less than spectacular service, and lack of fruit juices, etc in place of pop. Small changes would yield large dividends."
3,"Me and my family visited but this is definitely not a sit in family establishment. There were many to-go orders and sitting down wasn't a pleasant experience. The burgers were ok, the Cheesy Lucy was good with their Factory Sauce, BBQ Sauce and Lettuce, Onions and Pickles. The Utility was filled with too many fried Onions and not as much beef. I compared it with Top Gun Steak or Burgernator but this is nowhere near their l"
3,"Came here in  Thursday at about noon and there was quite a good lineup of people waiting for burgers, always a good sign. 

I got a regular burger combo with fries and a drink. The menu is slightly confusing in terms of the pricing for a combo and it should be clearly reworded. Take your burger price and add 4.99 to add a combo, which throws your cost over $10 right away, so unless you're getting just a regular, veggie or chicken burger, it won't be under $10 for lunch. Not a bad price, considering the serving size of fries you get. 

There was quite a wait for my burger, at least 10 minutes, if not more. They were churning them out but I found the space to be too small for that kind of wait. We were all crowded on one side and it just got more crowded as the line got longer. Come early to avoid the line and wait.

I got a combo, burger with cheese and my usual toppings, nothing from the extras menu, and fries and a drink, cost me over $12 with tax. Based on the photos I saw on the Yelp page, they've changed their fries opting for more of a shoestring fry that's fried to a dark brown. Tons of flavor and while the serving is huge, you just can't stop eating the damned fries. Far too tasty.

As for the burger, it was good, but far too small for me. I get the price is good for the serving size, and the whole better quality beef thing, but there wasn't much burger between the buns once it was flattened and cooked. Yes, it had that lovely griddled crust on it, but if you like any kind of toppings at all, the burger will get lost. If you want to appreciate the meat, try just cheese and maybe one or two toppings. Nothing about the burger stood out as incredible to me and I missed that lovely feeling of biting into a nice, thick, juicy burger (you just won't get it here). Nothing to make me think that this would be the best local burger I could get. All in, not a bad burger, but nothing to write home about. Perhaps I need to try one of the specials people keep talking about, but this place did not live up to its high yelp reviews.

For my money, I'd go two blocks north to W Burger Bar to get something more substantial. This place is a good quick stop for those days you're craving a burger, but it's not a place I'll go out of my way to get to."
3,"Good place to meet people and have couple of beers or drinks. There are stand up comedy shows almost every night. It is very friendly, but still, it's missing a spark... I didn't find anything crazy about the place."
3,"I've been here a few times years back, seem to recall that their pho is ok but nothing else really stands out.  Came here for quick bite on a cloudy Sunday.  Had deep fried spring roll as appetizer and pho tai nam for the lunch.  It's a small, family run business so one can tell they are under staff and service tends to be slow in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Spring roll comes with bean sprout and lettuce, it was perfectly fried with good flavour, but skin tends to be wrong.  Onto the pho itself, I'd say the broth is clean and subtle, obviously not the best I've had but one of the better choice around Chinatown.  They use ho fan instead of dry vermicelli like many use, which is good.  But all pho comes with one standard size and they do skimp on the meat tho.  
As for the service, it's of minimum as they just bring you food and tea and disappear, they won't try to spend any effort to be friendly or make you feel welcome.  It's a passable choice for quick pho Chinatown, but I may suggest ordering extra noodle or extra meat of one wants to get full."
3,"# of Visits: 1
Date of last visit before review: 12/28/2013

3.5 stars (though I'm going to round down to 3 because I don';t think it deserves 4)


Ordered veggie burger, which was made of fava beans.  It had a nice crisp to it.  What I also liked was that they have a good choice of toppings and it's fully customizeable, which is great.  

I think this is a decent burger place and better than your typical Harvey's, McD's, etc, but not super and nothing special.  Of course, I'm trying to stick to a primarily pescetarian diet these days, so I didn't have their meat burgers, but I see they have lots of options and they were fairly busy at 3 pm on a Saturday, so that's a good sigh.  Their beef is all fresh, ground in house and halal.  

However, its worth noting that they have funnel cake (which I've never had before) and a 15 oz burger.

Verdict: If you live close by, eat halal meat, and want funnel cake or if you want a 15 oz burger, this place is right for you."
3,"This use to be a decent Vietnamese restaurant. Their rice use to be a great dish that stood out from other Viet restaurants. However as time progresses, the taste of their food diminished. Variety is good, but none of their dishes stand out anymore. Taste is ok. I guess this is a decent restaurant to try out other Viet dishes besides pho, and dishes that aren't broth based. No specialty, but the overall food you get from there that aren't broth based are somewhat decent compared to pho restaurants."
3,Nice place. Not too busy in the evening. Had a cheese burger. Tasted good. The french fries were good as well.
3,"This place would be a solid 5 stars if it weren't for the burgers. 

Came in last night to try the meals for the first time (usually the hubby and I just do the frozen custard). We both tried a number one, which is a double burger, fries, and drink. The burgers were so thin I could have ordered a triple. They were also extremely crispy... I can now check off eating a thin, crispy burger from my bucket list. 

The custard and fries are great though, especially with their signature fry sauce."
3,I have been here a few times and it is from my visits a good hospital.  The nurses are always friendly.  When walking lost through the halls several workers have politely stopped me in reference to the dumb look on my face to ask me if I needed help.  This was nice cause I would have wondered forever without asking for directions out with my determination to complete the maze one my own.
3,"This place is just OK for me. I do not understand the fascination with this place. The meat is a little too thin and mashed up for me. The sauce is way too watery for me. I do appreciate the price on their meal combos. It is very affordable. If you are on a tight budget then this place is for you. 

This place used to be a WENDY'S"
3,"Too bad this is the only Yoshi in town. This place tastes just like any other Yoshi, so that's good, but you can tell the owner is a cheapskate.  Tip jars at fast food joints always irk me. They've got one here. Then they took away the Sriracha bottles, then the ginger. Now you have to ask them for the ginger. And I love ginger so when we asked for 3 containers for two bowls, I could tell the girl didn't want to give us more than one each. We did use all of it though. Next I'm sure the soy sauce and pepper will be taken away too.

Also the prices here are higher than what I remember them being in CA. $8 a bowl (large).

But another plus is they do offer a free regular size bowl for your birthday with the purchase of a drink."
3,"I have mixed feeling about this one, but I will explain why. 

First off,  food isnt the problem. The meat is freshly ground and grilled so no precooked frozen generic patty, so plus there. The topping are alot but  some have quite the extra charge like avocado but if you stick to signature as is, you will be fine with the way it prepared and taste.  Food get 4/5 for me

Its price and quantity that is issue with that give me the mixed reaction. Most signature burger are around 10 buck and the size of what you expect a double cheeseburger which are usually small in size which these are, I feel like for the size it should be 6 dollar burger at best. So if I were to just review it on that price would get 2 for me. 

But the special offer of a signature burger of the day were it 2 for 1 deal means you get 2 for 10 buck or 1 for 5 which I think is a reasonable deal. The deal is what save this place from 2 star for having overprice burgers while it still there taking advantage of the deal make it more of better deal so the get 3-3.5/5

So overall my rating would be between 2.5 and 3.5 so 3 if fair rating on this place"
3,"Classic - need to get the bologna sandwich, and the soda isn't bad either!"
3,"Pretty nice burger. Got the Oh Canada (beef patty, bacon, egg and cheese). The patty was fairly thin but cooked well and the burger itself was equal parts patty, bacon and egg so the whole thing came together pretty nicely.  I think they'd benefit from 2 over a single patty so I might try that next time. Food was fresh, hot and fairly tasty though."
3,I had brisket. Good but a little fatty. Portions were small. Good atmosphere. Corn bread was tasty. Service was very good.
3,"The burgers are made fresh, all natural, without any preservatives or taste booster. Tastes good... nothing amazing, but definitely good.

The place is bit crampy. ...and as almost all the seating places are near the open cooking area, it's better to leave your jackets and handbags in your car, unless you want those to smell like food and smoked meat  :-)"
3,"After hearing so many things about this famed place from various food critics and personalities, I finally decided, on a particularly humid Montréal day, to check out this place for myself and see if it was worth all the hype. I proceeded to order the most common meal here - a cherry coke, a Special with Swiss, and a sour pickle. In my opinion, everything was A-ok, and upon first glance it stereotypically looked like what I jokingly call ""white people food,"" except it was actually pretty good and tasted better than it looked. 

As someone who doesn't particularly like lunch meats, the bologna was actually pretty tasty and the Swiss cheese/bread combination complemented it nicely. The mustard, however, didn't come through for whatever reason. Maybe the sourness of the pickle I was eating at the same time ended up drowning out the flavor? I don't know, but it was a bit disappointed given that mustard is one of my favorite Western condiments. As for the cherry cola, classic fountain drinks always give me a cool vibe, as if it could make a person cooler just by drinking out of a glass of it. For a place with so much history to it, it didn't disappoint on that aspect.

Overall, come here for the old-school vibe if you're in the mood for a throwback and some simple, cheap eats. Maybe I'll go back and see if I can actually taste the mustard in the future..."
3,Decent tasting burger. Many varieties to choose from. Best as a late-eats destination.
3,"Came here again yesterday, ordered a Chicken Breast Pho.  Unfortunately the chicken was very dry and hard.  So I'm updating the rating accordingly."
3,"I will begin this review with the hope that a few months in business will improve this restaurant. We have been looking forward to the opening of Smokin' Q's since we heard about it! We sat at the bar for a late lunch on Saturday, June 10th. As other reviewers have stated, there were so many employees standing around and talking that it made us uncomfortable and no one seemed to have anything to do. The two employees behind the bar spent a good 15-20 minutes complaining about how many hours they were working. The bar is not a large area so there was no avoiding their conversation. We were ready to order, after the shock of $5 sides slightly wore off. Our server was taking our orders, and as he turned away from my husband to take my order, the manager said to our server ""So I heard you came in a little late today, huh?"" How is this at all appropriate to bring up in front of customers!? I said ""Please have your conversation after I'm finished ordering."" 

My pulled pork with $5 mashed sweet potatoes was, for the most part, enjoyable. The bread that it came with lacked any flavor. A friend of ours ordered the brisket, and got nearly an entire piece of fat, which they replaced for him at no charge."
3,Not the best care on the inpatient side. Facility appears new on the outside but is a little rundown on the inside. They do have a lot of ancillary services on the campus.
3,"Tried this place out yesterday after reading these rave reviews.  I gotta say I was a bit underwhelmed.  First, they had no lunch specials, which for a student like me is gold!  Second, our appetizer came as I was almost finishing up my meal.  Not sure why that took so long.  And it wasn't even that tasty -- was actually quite bland.  I ordered a simple beef on rice dish.  The beef was meh, rice was good, and the little salad on the side was fine.  But this dish felt very much like something you could get at a Ginger restaurant (which I love).  My friend ordered a seafood soup, and he commented that the seafood entailed 2 shrimp.  It was a big soup, but he was a bit disappointed too. 

I took a peak through the rest of the menu and they didn't offer many choices that I liked.  For instance, they had only chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice -- not beef, no bbq pork, no yung chow.  Also, the prices weren't particularly cheap.  Most of the meat platters were about 11.95.  So for lunch (and as a student!) this was a bit steeper than what we were hoping for.  I'd still rather grab sushi for 5.99 and get a nice variety of foods.  I probably wouldn't return."
3,"Fun place for a few drinks and laughs on a thursday. 

We had coupons from dealfind that the staff were unaware of ? (wierd)
The appetizers are yummy and the bartender was sweet.
The stage is small and the show was put on by 5 different groups of comedians. 
Some were funny, but most were just alright. Its mostly improv and  the crowd seems to be mostly with regulars and a few friends/family members of the comedians that are performing.  

The show area itself is tiny and would only be able to fill upto 30people MAX. So its a fun place to hang with a few friends on a weekday.

xoxo. 
M."
3,"Unless, you've been in LA, you don't understand.  Yoshinoya is all about these fatty, beef strips that make your mouth punch you in the face.  It is the most savory, delicious, juicy beef you ever tasted, dare I say better than a ribeye or Philly cheesesteak?  Of course, the rib eye will fill you up, but this is like a delicacy, an amuse bouche.  It won't fill you up unless you have like four orders of it, but think of it as bacon.  You don't want to fill up on bacon.  Maybe I should get a Smashburger across the street and put three strips of the Yoshi beef on it.  Wow.  I'm doing that my next trip to Vegas.  So why only 3 stars?  Well, everything else is gross.  Sorry.  It's fast food for crying out loud.  I'm not taking a date here.  You also don't get a lot of the beef for your money.  The gyoza is frozen and nuked or something and has freezer burn.  Seriously, it's not a gourmet Japanese restaurant.  It's Japanese junk with the most amazing beef strips you ever had in your life.  Go there just for the beef, seriously, and put it on your burgers and sandwiches."
3,Service was extraordinary vey impressive business but I'm hesitant about the sanitation of the food. Taste great but watching them prepare my quesadilla and the environment it was prepared in was sketchy.
3,"Nothing special besides the nostalgic look of this place.  A small sandwich for $5.  And since it's in a touristy spot, a few couples came and ordered one sandwich to share between them. Apparently some guy behind the counter wasn't too happy with that. You don's miss much if you skip this place in Montreal."
3,"Its your basic overcrowded liquor store and grease grill serving their version of mexican street food and american junk food. I go for the fries because they are hot and spicy, but you have to look and make sure its not the ones they cooked already and doubling dipping in hot oil again. Unless you really like grease. Its a decent grease trap place and oozing with male testosterone from all the staff and workers. Long before the current do what you want leaderless american bullshit occurred."
3,"The guy working there was very friendly, and that alone makes me hesitate to give a poor review.

I love the concept. The inclusion of gluten-free buns is great (though holy crap at the $3 upcharge).

The fries were tasty, but the burgers didn't live up to the descriptions nor the photos of the options on the wall (which showed 1/3 or 1/2 pound burgers). The size of the actual patties made McDonald's burgers look generous. The enormity of the gf buns wasn't helpful; they dwarfed the toppings and meat.

We felt really 'meh,' which made me sad and made me sorry to part with $30 for two gf burgers, one order of fries, and one bottle of water.

They could learn a lot from Roam Burger in San Francisco, which has a similar concept with excellent execution."
3,Ordered from here for the first time last night and gotta say not my favorite Mexican food place personally. A bit dry for me . they do have good portion sizes for sure and the spicey guac is good . but the meat and the tortilla were just to crispy and dry for my liking.  Not the worst Mexican food by far . but won't be my new late night Mexican food place either.
3,"Mmmmmm... it was okay. A good time for $20 with the Groupon deal, for sure, but I wouldn't be as impressed if I had paid regular price.

The show was hit-and-miss. Some sketches/acts were genuinely funny, but others fell pretty flat. Most just went too long. Ok, ha-ha, let's move on. No need to beat that joke to death. I found most of the comics/actors to be decent, however it seemed like all the men were ""shouters"". The host in particular just seemed to shout angrily at the audience, rather than actually being funny.

The bar and waiting area were a little scuzzy, but I guess I liked that. The place filled up as everyone was waiting for the show to start, and it kind of had an underground, hipster appeal. Again, better because it was at a discount.

Definitely worth $20 as an opportunity to do something different or fun with a friend or date, but I wouldn't want to become a regular here."
3,"Stopped here for a bite after walking the downtown area for couple hours.  Seemed like a place that took its food serious and it delivered.  The burger had a real nice crispness on the outside with juicy bites.  Handformed patties really work with the simple hamburger bun they chose.  Had white (comes in whole wheat and gluten free), was fresh and substantial enough to hold my - and I may be paraphrasing the name - Canada Eh burger (recommended by the counter person).  Patty, bacon, fried egg and mayo.  Worked well together though the bacon was only crisp on edges as they cook the bacon on the burger and not added later. Had fries - really very good.   Would have been 4 stars but the counter person failed to ask if I wanted any additional toppings and the price point was a little on the high end of inexpensive.  Fries were good but enough for 2 people and they would be great as poutine.
Small dine in area at back of place - 5 tables for two.  Will be going back to try the philly cream cheese stuffed chicken sandwich."
3,Came into his location  for lunch with my boyfriend and daughter. We got the Angus  beef plate with walnut shrimp.  Which was good. Then the beef bowl & Angus beef bowl. Which I order the Angus plate so they got that wrong. And there beef bowls are very nasty idk what kind of beef it is. It taste nasty no seasons. This will be the first n last time here. Thanks but no thank you...
3,"Ordered a cheeseburger. It was ok, nothing memorable. Not bad but certainly not awesome either."
3,"My boyfriend and I ventured to Smokey's on a Monday night at 6. We were seated promptly at a 6-person booth for only  the two of us, when the restaurant was relatively empty. I did notice the restaurant didn't have a distinct hostess seating customers. We were seated by a waitress. Another party just wandered in grabbing menus and a spot themselves. Our waitress, Peggy was really sweet and very attentive. 

We started with the BBQ Pork Nachoes to start. This was perfect portion for 2 people. It might be too small for a larger party. It's crispy tortilla chips, pulled pork, quac, jalapenos, gooey cheese, & black beans. 

I had the PB&J Tacoes. These are two tacoes in housemade tortillas. They are crispy pork belly chunks, red cabbage slaw, pico, mexican cheese, topped with jalapeno jam. All that somehow did not break the homemade tortillas...magic?!!

BEWARE! The sides are á la carte! I had spicy cauliflower. It was 3 florets of spicy cauliflower topped with goat cheese and cilantro. It seemed kind of pricey for a small portion."
3,"Food was good as always and the cashier was bright and cheerful but after finishing my burger I ordered a concrete sundae and it took over 20 minutes for them to make it. 

Maybe if the place was packed I would understand why it might take a while but the diner was barely at 30% capacity so I'm not sure what took so long. Maybe the drive-thru was busy but still."
3,J'ai pas tant aimé le Spécial : c'est juste de la charcuterie chaude et trop salée dans un muffin anglais et de la moutarde jaune et ça pour 4$!  Par contre le lieu (autant la devanture que le bar) fait que je ne regrette pas d'y être allée je pourrai même y retourner pour goûter un soda float.
3,food is great but service is slow. if you have a short lunch break you will probaly be late after going here.
3,"The burgers and fries here are ok.  Personally, I prefer Culvers, but they are very similiar.  
My problem with this place is that I had to return my food due to finding a big black curly hair stuck to my food.  I know it happens, no biggie, but I do expect someone to offer an apology.  The manager came over to assist with the refund, but failed to offer any sort of an apology.  Actually, he failed to say anything to me at all.  I don't know about anyone else out there, but after spending $40 on burgers and fries for 4, I like to know that my business is appreciated.  And in this case, they did not do that.  And for that reason, I wont be back."
3,"Came here with a friend to get a burger. Tried the juicy Lucy with jalapeño and like it's name says it was juicy and really tasty, but there wasn't a lot of heat in the burger. I also got the combo with the fries and they were thick cut fries. It is a good place to eat but t me it was nothing special."
3,The pho was good and the soup broth was delicious. However as others have said the service sucks. Our server didn't seem to care when one of our friends told him that her noodles were too spicy. He then said rudely that we can only have extra noodles if we paid for them. Also I too heard the microwave being run just like Jennifer K when I ordered the spring rolls. I won't be back.
3,"We went for BeerProv and bought tickets in advance...but this doesn't mean a lot apparently. The email receipt we received didn't say anything about picking up tickets. In fact we were by the box office wondering what to do and someone (maybe staff?) asked us what event we were here for and then directed us to the entrance of the staging area. When we got into the staging area, we showed the bouncer the receipt on our phone and he started to freak out telling us to sit where we could see him and swearing. Our friends who arrived closer to show time paid $15 to stand at the back...they left soon after.

I really enjoyed the comedians and improv games and I would recommend to friends but I really hope the Comedy Bar gets their act together. It's not cool to oversell tickets and even less cool to not be clear of what to do when you get there. It's not like you can identify staff.

Also the bar kind of sucks. There were 2 people on a Friday night trying to serve everyone through 5 minutes of intermission. Lol.

The space is ""different"" but definitely not grungy or dirty in anyway. I love the informality of the stage/audience set up.

Drink somewhere else, go for the comedy."
3,"I was cruising down Williams Field the other night and Freddy's just kinda jumped out at me - had never noticed it there before, apparently because it just recently opened.  Brak loves a good burger, and being hungry at the time, I had to pull in and check it out.  I ordered some sort of double burger and fries.  It wasn't bad, but I wasn't terribly impressed either.  The burger patties were thin with some weird consistency that I can't even describe.  They were somewhat overcooked.  The bun & fixins were fine, and that helped somewhat.  The fries were super-thin and coated with some sort of thin coating of batter before frying, and while they were tasty enough, their thinness made them somewhat of a pain to dip in Heinz's finest and made for having to grab a bunch of them at a time to mow through them without taking forever.  I'll probably give Freddy's another go at some point, and maybe try something else on the menu.  This joint requires further study for a comprehensive conclusion.  Brak will be back!"
3,"If you want to order rude with a side of laziness and sarcasm, be sure to order from: Vero, who doesn't seem to enjoy her job.

Poor customer service. Love the food though."
3,"In 2018 there is a HUGE portion of us who do not carry cash...
Walk a bit to bank machine, pay 2.50 at Grossmans for withdrawal. Fortunately this place has fair prices. No DEBIT, CC in 2018 is LAME.
Also turn on AC, hot as %uck."
3,"I was on the Strip and remembered there's a Yoshinoya not too far away. I had a weird, nostalgic craving for it. I grew up eating beef bowls in L.A. when I was young. I would eat it before or after clubbing in Hollywood. I would get smack from my husband, my sister, and a few friends for liking this stuff. Hey, we all have our embarrassing fast food likes!

So this is my second time coming to the Vegas location. I ordered two large beef bowls. I never liked the fluorescent veggies. I ate one bowl there and took the other bowl to go to eat the next day. It was alright and not as good as I remembered them. I had the same thought the other time I came here.

The next day, I reheated them. It wasn't good. I felt gross after. I would not recommend eating it the next day. I guess my taste buds have changed. I don't think I'll be craving this for a while.

Also, it's kinda ghetto here. I was trying to eat as fast as I can so I can get out of there. I was too hungry to take it to go."
3,"We went and got two concrete's. One was a regular mint oreo and the other was a large oreo. The smaller sized mint concrete actually cost 70 cents more than the large concrete that inly was missing a pump of mint flavor . A little odd, you would think they'd be the same price or the regular size would still be cheaper.

It looks like they barely put any oreo topping in the $5 large concrete. The larger size should have more topping in it. Almost seems they put the same amount as in the regular which did seem to have the right amount of oreo. Mint stuck on bottom. Tip add some custard first then mint then more custard. Would turn out better. 

Overall it was decent but expensive for the mistakes made. Total bill for two ice creams was $11.51 a little high. May or may not go back..."
3,"This little place is hidden in a rundown like plaza by Dixie and Eglinton. Unless you have heard about this place and wanted to try it out, it is very easy to miss and drive by.

Despite the small restaurant, they still have lots of seatings available for people who wants to withstand the heat. Bonus, they have tv's and at the time was showing ""just for laugh"" to keep you occupied while you wait for you order.

Lucky me its burger week and found the nearest participant burger joint to work. Burger factory is it and off I go. The deal is the Lucy Burger. One of their signature burger I supposed, but I don't really know what the history or description of this burger since I had to put my own toppings on it anyway. So to me it's a burger from burger factory :)

For one burger, it was a long wait, I was there for a long time. But I still waited. Fast forward to my office, this Lucy burger was equipped with a big burger patty, lettuce, mayo, relish, sirracha and the must try burger factory sauce. The presentation is sloppy, it fell apart as I took my first bite and hot sauce all over my hand. Was it delicious, it wasn't heavenly but good enough for me to finish and wipe it clean. Beware thou have yourself a fork and knife.

Was it worth the wait, I don't think so. The presentation is a turn off and the toppings was sloppy. I would suggest a harder bread that would sustain itself after the toppings are place so it doesn't breakdown. Sloppy burger just doesn't do it do it for me, but might be really good for others. I definitely recommend if one wants a fatty burger with loaded of sauces.

3,"Really good prices, very filling,,Had  pork chop rice. and satay vermencellie beef. Both  were great quality and left satisfied. Place was empty so food prepared quick.  

Place was rated one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto. It's hard for me to say this was much better then others I've tried but worth a visit."
3,"3-1/2 stars.

Went here for lunch on a Saturday and the place was 1/4 full which was fine by me as I was looking for a good quick meal.

I wanted to have some Pho, but I was a little disappointed with the lack of selection of Pho in the menu. Other Pho restaurants had countless combinations of meats you could choose for their Pho, but Anh Dao just had maybe 3 or 4 (I was hoping for rare beef, tripe and tendon).

Don't be mislead by the prices, the portions are large. I ordered the Bun with spring roll and BBQ beef ($5.95) and a fresh spring roll with pork and shrimp ($3.95). The spring roll was twice as long as what was pictured in the menu and the Bun was of your typical sized bun at other restaurants.

The spring roll was good and the sauce tasted like a thickened soy sauce sweetened with honey, similar to teriyaki sauce but lighter.
The bun was also good, but not spectacular, but at less than $6 it was a great deal. I dumped all of the side sauce and added a little soy sauce and chili sauce which made the bun much more tasty and not as dry.
The bowl was a good mix of fresh greens with the meat and vermicelli.
Word of caution, do not eat the fried spring rolls first! I scorched the roof of my mouth by doing so.

The complimentary tea was tasty but served scorching hot in a large tea pot.

The service was fast and the waitor always acknowledged you with a smile.

One really minor gripe I had was that you helped yourself chopsticks and spoons that were bunched up at each table, some were sticking with the spoon or tip side up. For germophobes like me that could be a bit of a turn off."
3,"This is definitely a divey type comedy bar.  

Pros
-tickets are cheap
-on Bloor street so easily accessible by subway 
-There are 2-4 shows everyday so no matter what time you arrive, you should be able to see a show

Cons:
-small venue
-wine seemed watered down
-the seating is all just basic chairs and you have nowhere to put your drink (i.e. no cup holders). 

In terms of the comics, I guess it depends on the night.  We saw a show on Saturday night and there was about 5 comics. I found 4 of them funny, but the headliner didn't impress me much. 

Verdict: It's okay. Something to do if you can't find anything better."
3,"Executive Summary: Food's not great, but it's quick, it's really, really, really cheap, and it fills you up.  Did I mention it's cheap?

No, Yoshinoya isn't the greatest food.  It's not haute cuisine.  In fact, it's probably just barely edible, but when you consider the price/value proposition, Yoshinoya should be on the top of your fast food list.  How much does a value meal at your typical fast food restaurant cost?  Probably $5-6 (depending on what size you'd prefer your cholesterol delivery system).  For $6, you can get a crappy burger, fries, and a soda.  What can you get at Yoshinoya for $6?  You can get a steaming bowl of rice, topped with hot beef and onions, a dessert, and a soda.  If you could go without the soda and desert, you could walk away from Yoshinoya spending less than $4.  It's a great bargain.  Yes, the chicken has the same texture as the styrofoam container it's served in, but it's still more fulfilling than a Big Mac.

If you're on a budget, and you're in a hurry, and you're sick of burgers, go to Yoshinoya and you'll think twice about ordering a value meal ever again.  Bonus: UNLV students get a $3.99 beef/chicken bowl and soda.  Bring your student ID."
3,"Ran through the driveway late night to get some food. Ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a Diet Coke. Nothing to really write home about. The fries were good but I felt the burger was a little dry. I don't know that I would go back again for a burger. Being from Wisconsin I really wish I would've tried their custard so I could've compared it to back home. The next time I'm down in Arizona I will be sure to try the custard."
3,"Nice historical place. The food is nothing special and the options are very limited, but it's just fun to go for a quick cheap snack. It's biggest attribute is definitely its classic decor."
3,"Went to the new restaurant last night. Place was packed, including the outdoor seating, so we sat at the bar. Decor is rustic and such an upgrade from Fishers that was once there. Bright, airy. Very nice. Bartender was spot on. Friendly and competent- just what you want in a bar tender. Way too many wait staff. I counted six trying to look busy stumbling over themselves. Ordered the pork tacos and 1/2 pound ribs to divide with the hubby. Pork tacos were delicious. Would definitely order them again. The ribs were a disappointment. Fatty and did not have a smokey BBQ flavor. Came with sweet brioche buns, red slaw and pickles. Hard to think of a BBQ place with sub par ribs, especially when oak & embers is down the road with some pretty incredible BBQ ribs. Bud lite at $5. No happy hour as of now. Felt like the price point was a bit high but would have been fine if the BBQ quality and quantity was high as well. It was not.Keep trying."
3,"Its fast food, so its hard to go above 3 or 4 stars.  In my opinion better than the mainstays like McDonalds, BK, Wendy's and just a bit below In n Out.  Burgers are different but very flavorful.  My wife was excited as she is a huge Steak and Shake fan, she said these were good too, very similar to her favs from the Midwest.  I liked the thin shoestring fries very tasty.  I didn't have a custard of my own my the wife did and it was good.  A great place to take the kids for an above average fast food meal, heck, if i was driving by and was hankering a burger in the middle of the day I certainly would be back."
3,"I came here for a Jewish comedy show last night and it was a really good crowd. Some of the comedians were really funny and the atmosphere was nice.

It was unfortunate that everyone could not get a seat. Everyone had paid for their ticket, so I expected us all to have seats but this wasn't the case. Many people were standing. 

The bar seemed okay. It was a nice cozy bar featuring rich deep wood along the walls and tables I believe. We didn't stay to drink here as the lounge area was packed but I would definitely come back to try their regular comedy shows."
3,"Good fast food but this location does not take coupons!
Also bit hot and humid inside."
3,It all started when Yousaf vwas like this is the best place to get a burger when all Zaeem wanted was waffles. Then YS was crushing on AA and then juicy Lucy shows up. Awesome
3,"Family owned restaurant that's been around since the beginning of time.  Their location looks very nostalgic, with everything looking like it hasn't changed since they first opened.  (except the rack of 80's music cds).   They're known for their Wilenksy special.  It's a beef bologna sandwich with mustard and it's pressed flat like a panini.  Good sandwich, but nothing i would crave."
3,"Not great vegetarian options if you're not in the mood for fish. But there's a quiet friendly feeling here, and the ingredients are fresh."
3,"Note: I give this 3 and a half stars.

As a pretty inexperienced comedy club guy, I went into Comedy Bar for their Wednesday night festivities unsure of what to expect. What kind of humour would be thrown at me? Will the audience be forced into participating? Would there be dwarves, vegetables used in inappropriate ways, full-frontal nudity, and 2 guys in a horse costume?
I was pleasantly surprised, but it definitely had its pitfalls for a filthy noob like me.

First off, when you first arrive, it's pretty confusing to get your bearings. In fact, I'm pretty sure I found Bobby Fischer and Jimmy Hoffa before I found the stage.I went downstairs to the bar area, and (shockingly) the ticket booth is empty. To your right is a lounge-type area with a couple of couches and arcades. Next to that and on the far-left are hallways, presumably leading to the staff areas.

So I plunked my ass down at the bar and had a drink, which was surprisingly cheap! I asked the bartender what the deal was to see a show, and he explained to go down the left hallway, and that's it. Well, my drink and I went down the hallway, which branches into 3 directions, one left, one right, and one straight and up the stairs. Thanks, barkeep! Luckily, a couple of girls went into the theater area on the left, and I followed.

After that, things were great. You pay the girl 10 dollars inside, and watch the show.

The seats were not unlike your typical pub seats: uncomfortable prison-sex posterior probes. Small complaint, but hey, if you shift around long enough, people will assume you either have 'roids, or you're trying to do drugs rectally, and that's just not cool. Up with hope, down with butt-dope!

The show itself was phenomenal! Both the Wednesday night scheduled show, and the free improv session that followed were quality comedy shows, and I laughed pretty hard throughout. For 10 bucks, you can't go wrong!

I could see this place becoming pretty insane on a Friday or Saturday night, as even on Wednesday, the lone bartender seemed pretty overwhelmed, and it was practically a full house that night. Judging by how the people were acting, I got the impression this was a really tight-knit community, and a lot of them were there to support their family/friends.

I didn't sample the food that night, and points got knocked off because of a confusing layout (I mean, come on, a sign with the word ""STAGE"" and an arrow won't kill you) and anal penetrating chairs, but I otherwise loved the place, and I can't wait to return!"
3,"They used to be amazing. But now the quality has gone down n so has the service. The staff has an ""I don't really care kind of attitude"".. No apologies given when order was messed up. Told to wait in line again as order had missing items.. Buns were stale n stiff.. Im rather disappointed to say the least.."
3,"Good pho, but the Vietnamese crepe pancakes didn't wow me; as they were quite flavorless without added hoisin sauce or fish sauce. Really crispy, but just didn't taste like much!"
3,"Went here on a recent trip to Toronto and I enjoyed myself for the most part. It was extremely crowded and our show was supposed to start at 10 but didn't start until 11. That being said, I am a big fan of improv and I enjoyed the show immensely. My fiancé wasn't as impressed, only because he was more looking for stand-up vs. improv."
3,"Pretty decent place, they used to have buy 1 get 1 free all day, but now they only do it from 3pm-5pm, which is very inconvinient hours for most people."
3,"A tasty new Canadian standalone Burger joint! Although JACKSONS BURGERS' themed Burgers are delicious and original, they're daily specials are now only available during a short window of time so we've stopped going there to eat as its not convenient and paying full price is not worth it when there is so many other affordable options for burgers downtown. My personal favorite was their Polish inspired Burgogie and  they do have some of the BEST fries in the city! Wouldn't be Canadian without friendly staff and great service! Note that orders can take a little longer because ALL burgers are made fresh on the spot which is a good thing and rare these days!"
3,"Came here with a few other yelpers and for me it was pretty good but nothing amazing.

The food was good and pretty good value and I manage to stuff myself for under $20 which was not the best idea as I missed out on the food at the following event.

It is not a flash place but then again not many of the good joints on Spadina are.

The guy who was serving us was quick and welcoming.

Although the menu had a great variety of food for such a small place they really need to make them easier to handle. The flip board was kind of annoying.

We were the first group here by 6pm and by 7pm nearlly all the other tables were taken so its definitely a popular amongst the Asian crowd."
3,"Juicy Lucy is the only reason why I decided to try this place. 
I have not tried anything else on the menu but Jucy Lucy (stuffed meat patty with cheese) is delicious!!!!
Fries - not so great 
Customer service-needs improvement"
3,"More of a 3.5 - I'll have to go back (which I will) and try it again.  I had the spicy beef pho, which was worlds more flavourful than your run of the mill Vietnamese restaurant (i.e. the place across the street).

The prices aren't amazing - their fried rice/noodle dishes are downright expensive at around $12, and their condensed milk coffee - always a favourite - is an unjustifiable $4. The main dishes themselves are more reasonable at around $7-8."
3,"Walked straight in around 9 and nobody else in line! Sweet. The menu was small and I didn't really read over what they had. Ordered a side of beans, carne asada fries, and a quesadilla with carne. The carne asada comes with a side of whatever (sour cream, pico, hot green salsa, hot red salsa, cilantro...) 

The green spicy salsa was so good! It was very hot but had great flavor. The pico was decent. 

The quesadilla was very good but I'm used to chunks of carne, not shredded carne. Didn't try the fries but the boy devoured them. Both entrees we're perfect for soaking up alcohol but nothing INSANELY good. Now the beans... I got a side of beans and they were so gross. They were undercooked and under seasoned..it was so bad I had to throw out my first bite. SAD.

Customer service was friendly. Will I be back? I'm sure but it is not something I was crave."
3,"I have been wanting to come and try Anh Dao Restaurant, but every time I came they were closed until last week!!

Timing is everything... but when the restaurant is empty and passed the prime lunch and dinner hours.. my showing up was not the most exciting thing that can happen to the staffs...when all they want is having their afternoon nap...zzzzzzzz

Spring Roll and BBQ Beef Bun ($5.95)
- I heard a lot of microwave beeping in the kitchen when my food was being prepared... not really a good sign, so now my food is being heated up instead of cooking??
- Beef is a little cold... maybe they should have be put in the microwave for another 10 sec? 
- Spring Roll was freshly deep fried..since it cannot be that crispy if it was just heat up in the microwave
- I do love the mix of lettuce, basil and coriander in the noodle, giving it a more complex flavour

I did not find Anh Dao Restaurant really Amazing but is A-OK for the price. Maybe i need to try the House Speciality  Nem Nuong next time!"
3,The food was not too bad. A little bland and I feel a bit over priced for what you get. I hit this place up at noon at it was dead inside. The seating area just feels like it's lacking in decorations of some kind. The staff were nice but the service was slow.
3,"Came here today for a take out beef bowl.
For some reason, the entire store smelled weird today. 
The last time I ate here, everything tasted OK. Just like any Yoshinoya in Japan.
Today, their beef bowl was way too salty and the beef had a lot of fatty parts in it.
Maybe I came here the wrong time. 
I'll come back next time I have Yoshinoya withdrawals."
3,This place was good but I wouldn't categorize it as amazing with the best burger I've ever had for that you have to go to downtown and either get food from Burgenator or Ozzie's. The food was good did you see Lucy was delicious but there was not too much cheese on the inside of the burger. I got the Philly cheesesteak was just called the utility that was delicious but very wet and soaked up the entire bread. I've been here a few times and the food is good it's OK for a burger place in the suburbs but nothing spectacular. They should definitely offer some more options and I thought that the burgers were a bit dry on the inside.
3,"This place is sketchy AF but they always have a large selection of alcohol, so that's a huge plus. I've never eaten there but all of the alcohol poisoned frat guys I've partied with enjoy the food"
3,"I rarely go out, and this would be why. Sunday Night Live is proof that sketch comedy is incredibly hard to pull off. They gave it a good go and some of the acting was dope but I think I laughed twice all night. The pub itself seems fine - great beer but sickly nachos with old, watery salsa, and eh? Did you say something? Sorry, my ears will be blown out for a few days because of the the talented but outrageously high volumed house band."
3,"VIBE 
I came here with a friend on a Friday night who knew a few of the performers here. That said, I can see how first-timers to this place can get confused about where to go. 
We dropped in during show time and since the box office was closed, we decided to sneak into the main show. 

Prior to the sneak-in, we decided to go to the right side of the basement and sit and chat. There's a mix of couches and tables. There's a transparent window dividing the smaller room, which is a bit awkward (for me anyways). Another smaller show was to start and we went into the room but wanted to sit at the back of the room where there was a couch. I didn't feel like sitting in an upright chair. The camera man for the show decides to put his big ass bag on the couch, refused to move it so we could sit there and told us we had to sit near the front so he could film the backs of our heads to show that there was actually an audience for the show. Needless to say, it was a bit off-putting.

That's when we snuck into the other show. 

THE SHOW AND WHAT WE DRANK
We saw the Rap Battles and if you get a few of the good regulars, it's great! 
Each of the performers have a character and rap/battle in that character. I highly recommend MC IMDB and MC PHD. These guys have a lot of skill and wit that is very entertaining.

The show was PACKED. My scene: standing on my tippy toes at the back of the theatre and glimpse through gaps of the audience. Again, we didn't pay, so I was fine with it. If I paid $10 I'd be a bit pissed but this show is worth the money. 

The bar scene afterwards was very friendly and chatty. It's a cool place to mingle with other locals. The bartender was great to us but again, my friend knew her. We got served right away and had Southern Comfort shots (very tasty, by the way). Then it was the regular Heineken. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Setup is a bit of a joke (cue symbols).
I recommend the Rap Battles but go early on a Friday night so you can get a decent seat. I'd recommend getting a drink at the Piston thereafter, if with friends."
3,"I was here a couple of months ago, and had their $9.99 combo. I respect that the beef is all fresh ground and organic and all that jazz, but it was BLAND. I usually like sauces on my sandwiches and burgers, but even after drenching this burger, the patty was underseasoned, bland, and tastes like chewed up cardboard. Service was just okay, really not worth it."
3,"Got the Canadian Burger and Poutine on seperate occasions. The $12 burger was only okay and nothing special. For a $12 burger (before taxes), I expected something better or bigger. 

My friend got a $6 milkshake that was quite small.

The poutine was also only okay. For better poutine quality and variety, go to the nearby Philthy Philly's.

I don't think I'd come back again.

Quality: 7/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 5/10. Overall: 6.5/10 (Not an average)"
3,"I've enjoyed yoshinoya since I was a kid. But this one just wasn't that good, I ordered the rice bowl and it tasted pretty plain. I don't know if it's just me or the restauranr but I overall didn't enjoy this yoshinoya that much compared to the other yoshinoyas I've eaten in."
3,"Good burgers for a decent price. Juicy Lucy on Fire has remained as my favourite. I didn't know they had funnel cakes until my recent visit. The funnel cake was pretty good too, crispy exterior and soft interior with a side of jam and a scoop of Ice cream. Wait time was quite longer than usual."
3,"First of all..  I LOVE YOSHINOYA.  I've been going to YOSHINOYA since I was a kid in Los Angeles.  As an adult, I moved to Las Vegas and would make it a necessary stop to pick up YOSHINOYA for the trip back.  The usual was the Combo Bowl.  Beef and Teriyaki Chicken with veggies.  My husband would get the Teriyaki Chicken bowl with extra teriyaki sauce.  My girls would get the beef bowl with extra beef juice (I like to think of it as sauce).  The only differences from the past would be the fact that the chicken piece is no longer sliced in long strips.  You get chunks of chicken that has been tossed around.  Also, the containers have changed.  Instead of the large rectangular bowls, you get a short flat box plate.  The food stayed the same.  No issues there at all.  

My issues have to deal with the dirty seating area, oddly decorated space, and customer service that you have to scratch your head at.  Today's experience had to do with the fact that the cash register didn't want to work.  And then.. when asked about the special, they still rang it up wrong.  $5.69 large bowl + $1.80 for a large drink, when the special didn't say what size fountain drink you had to purchase.  Truth in advertising, please!!  This YOSHINOYA also doesn't seem to follow any standard rules.  Sometimes they charge you for extra sauces, sometimes they don't.  Sometimes you can get the advertised special, and sometimes you are told it's something else.  Frustrating, YES!  Will I go back?  ...  I won't make a trip that's out of the way. 

If you're in the mood for cheap japanese food, on the go.. stop in.  :""D"
3,"After having a great first experience at the Comedy Bar, I decided to come back and check out a different show, ManTown. I'd love to give a clear description of the premise, but to honest, I have no idea what's so manly about ManTown. The most that I can say is that it's an improv show.

This time around my experience was much different than the first. The show started with plenty of excitement as the emcee came rushing in with pump-up music blasting and lights dazzling. Sadly, that was pretty much the height of the fun times. Put simply, the show just wasn't that funny. Similarly to the BeerProv show, ManTown featured a wide selection of different comics, including my favourite from the BeerProv, Rob Norman.

At this point the Comedy Bar is at a 50% success rate since this is the second time that I've been, therefore I'll refrain from making general conclusions. That being said, when discussing the show later with my friends, we all agreed that mid way through the show we individually and independently considered suggesting that we leave. Fingers crossed for a better showing the next time around."
3,"I generally like freddie custard, but after going to this location today I will never go to this one again. My husband and I bought regular Sunday's which were almost 4 dollars. When I looked in my bag, the cups were not even full of ice-cream. The serving was extremely skimpy and it seemed like they just were trying to put as little in there as possible. 

I would not recommend thus location. I have been to 2 others and they were both better. I would suggest the location on baseline because I never had that issue there and have been many times. 

Overall, the ice cream is good, but not a great value for the money."
3,"So you looking for the Japanese version of McDonald's?

Well you found it here.  I was told this place was good, so we took a cab all the way out to here, the cab driver was a bit confused himself....

Anyways I picked up a combo platter.  It has both beef and chicken and came with a side and a drink.  The beef was really fatty, felt gross eating it.  The chicken however had a crunchy skin that reminded me of crispy pork and it was covered in a brown sauce that was very tasty.  They did make a decent japanese rice for a fasts food joint.  I was hungover so I decided to give their chicken noodle soup a try, it was super salty.  I also got the miso soup which you really can't mess up.  I tried my friend's cheesecake and it tasted like the ones from jack in the box which was right next door."
3,"***1/2 stars

Was looking for a place to eat prior to the Yelp Elite Pimp Your Profile Pic at Lomography.  We arrived around 5:30PM to a relatively empty restaurant.  It really is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant with attempts of decor such as the paneled art on the walls (typical of a Vietnamese restaurant).  The kitchen is towards the rear of the restaurant and makes you not want to know how your food is prepared.

In terms of service, it is totally non-existent except for when they bring you the menus and pot of tea.  You will have to do cartwheels and somersaults to get service at this restaurant.

Food-wise, I am torn.  We ordered the Nem Nuong as other Yelpers recommended, in addition to Pho Dac Biet (Special Pho) and a rice dish that came with steamed egg, shredded pork skin and grilled pork.

It should be noted that all of their Pho dishes come in one size at a price of $6.25.  You do get a decent portion.  The beef was not the best, but the noodles and soup base were amazing.  

The Nem Nuong that gives Anh Dao its reputation was a disappointment as I found the pork to be dry.  The mystery fruit that showed up on our plate were mandolin-ed plaintains.  I think that they should use larger sized rice papers as there is no way you can properly make a roll without it falling apart.  Either that, or provide a 2:1 ratio of rice paper to fixings so that we can half the Nem Nuong to make a neater looking roll.  The bean sprouts were showing bits of brown, which was kind of a turn off and I avoided using these in my wrap altogether.  We were also shorted on the rice paper as we had 6 sausages but only 5 sheets of rice paper.

The ""com"" (rice dish) was made with a short-grain rice and topped with scallion oil.  Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I would say that this is probably one of the poorer rice dishes I've sampled.  I wasn't a fan of the short grain rice as it gets progressively harder to get off the plate - even with a spoon.  The grilled pork was overcooked, tough and dry.  The steamed egg was nothing exciting.  

Verdict:

Horrible service, but pretty decent food.  I would advise that you stick to the Pho options on the menu as everything else isn't really that great.  I also wanted to try out the Grilled Shrimp on Sugar Cane (#14) but was informed they were out.  The damage at the end of the day was around $29 before tip. Cash only."
3,I like this pho restaurant because the quality is consistent and the price is very reasonable.
3,"The burgers here are good but you wait too long.
Thats the real problem here.
You see when you are either on your lunch break or on the run, I dont have the time to sit around and wait.  Its  a small place with a good idea and a good product but they either need to expand or become more efficient.
Sorry but as i said, i just dont have all day to wait.
That is the major problem 
It would be a 5 star place if they had their act together and a few more tables, because the product is actually very good."
3,"Ok It is my 2nd check in. Restaurant been renovated. I hate their black walls, black floors Like  it didn't reflect food factory as much as vehicles factory! 

Their burgers is massively big mouth burger. We had 3 Juicy Lucy .. we finished the patty and almost no cheese inside ! Beef quality is normal good nothing special! 

Pontine with black gravy and mozzarella cheese !!

Staff and manager were very nice and welcomed our comments and suggestions. 

Baby high chair wasn't clean."
3,"I finally did it, for Tony T.  I walked to Yoshinoya and got a beef bowl (gyudon) to go.  For whatever reason, the faded building/sign always turned me off, so I expected it to be old and dirty inside.  I already can get cheap gyudon from Japan Creek or just make it at home, so I never saw a reason to come here, though I worked within walking distance for almost 6 years.

I spotted Yoshinoya in Japan but never sought it out to eat at one.  The other day, I watched a show called ""Fast Foods Gone Global"" on Travel Channel, which usually chronicles US chains that infiltrate other countries and make special menus for each country's tastes.  However, this episode was international fast food companies' infiltration into the US, and whether or not menu items were changed for the American palate.

Yoshinoya has clearly adjusted its menu to the American palate, but the gyudon is still what gyudon is always - fatty thinly sliced beef cooked with onions in a sauce made with typical Japanese ingredients and served on top of rice, with beni shoga (red pickled ginger) as an accompaniment. I ordered a regular beef bowl (just under $6 with tax, and added beni shoga.  I also sprinkled on some shichimi togarashi and though not traditional, some chopped green onion that was out for miso soup orderers (only because green onions are my favorite vegetable!)

The menu otherwise has some odd things (I am not a fan of teriyaki type joints so I do not like the weird vegetables like zucchini in my bowls or stir fries), like vegetables, udon bowls, chicken and combo bowls, and grilled fish - I asked what type of fish and the lady pronounced something weird twice to me that started with an S, a name of a fish I certainly have never heard of in my life and have no idea how to spell...I did notice Yoshinoya now has ponzu sauce (not for the beef bowl but rather the fish).  I liked the to go bowl packaging and the meal stayed hot on my jaunt back to the office to eat.  I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the interior too.  Accepts credit cards for orders over $5."
3,"i'm going to summarize what one of the dude here said:
This is definitely a divey type comedy bar.  

-cheap tickets (better to buy via groupon in my opinion because i would not be impressed if i have to buy the regular tickets)
-easily accessible via subway
-small af venue and if it's crowded, you have NO guarantee with getting a place to sit because the performer and their friends takes over half of the venue
-the seating is all just basic chairs and you have nowhere to put your drink or food (i.e. no cup holders and table).
-food here is was a-ok but i've had better experience somewhere else with similar price 
-Performance wise,, it was a legit hit or miss (Helder Brum and friends) because half of the act sounds like amateurs that can only perform when tipsy.

i would go back to try again with another act but it's better to research the person before going."
3,"It's a tiny bit more expensive, a tiny bit of a longer wait, and slightly thinner buns than would be ideal but I'm a huge fan of the patty and their toppings are great. The Butter Chicken sauce on the chicken burger is delectable. I also love love love the fries but if you aren't a soggy fry fan they might not be for you. 

Don't try this place if you're in a rush the anxiety ruins the burger. The layout of the store could be better especially as winter is on us, it's a tiny eat in area at the back with a very narrow area between the wall and the service counter. As I mentioned you aren't getting out of there quickly so it quickly fills up with people waiting for their food and people trying to get to the cash and people trying to get out. All this combined with winter gear and backpacks. If it's busy I usually just forget about it, it gets frustrating quickly. However the fact that it gets that busy says something about the quality of the food."
3,"Took them a few times to get the order right, and then when we got to the window they still got it wrong.

I guess its because it hasnt been open that long.

Food was ok though, I will try it again."
3,"This is a great little unassuming restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. 

I came here when a Vietnamese craving couldn't wait anymore, and I needed something close to work! The yelp reviews are pretty meh (and they are warranted) but it was worth the risk. 

The menu is actually pretty large, and has many items I haven't seen at other Vietnamese places in the city, HOWEVER, the craving was for a hot bowl of noodles with BBQ meat, and so I stuck with my usual Vietnamese order. 

The food came pretty quickly and was hot and delicious. 

So why the 3 star review? Two things made me think twice about returning to Anh Dao: 

1. WHERE WAS MY SERVER??? 

I got seated and a menu right away, and even ordered pretty quickly - then the food came, and he was GONE! All I wanted was some hot sauce and hoisin, but it was like pulling teeth to get it. And when we wanted the bill? Forget it! He was no where to be found and we waited for about 15 minutes before being able to get his attention

2. SOOOO. QUIET. 

Near the end of our visit, music finally came on which was a godsend. It was like a library in there! Even though there were other groups it was so eerily quiet that I felt like we couldn't talk at all. Awkward. 

Overall, if the craving strikes again and I'm in a desperate situation, I wouldn't write off Anh Dao, but I certainly won't be looking to get back there any time too soon."
3,"3.5

went a few weeks ago for dinner. it was super quiet when we first arrived and you know how empty restaurants can be a sign of a sub-par joint. but within 15 minutes, people arrived. my friend had this huge platter of vietnamese sausage thing. a banh? i had pho. it was not bad. a bit on the salty side and left me thirsty, something i don't usually experience at xe lua. service is alright, like all asian restaurants but i wasn't expecting any more or less."
3,"Went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were kinda worried where we would sit once our food was ready. We managed to snatch a table as it became free. 

I ordered the triple cheeseburger and it was great.

The only big issue we had, and this went for all 5 of us, is our sides were cold by the time we got them. Tornado fries, poutine, and onion rings. All cold.

Cost $40 for a big burger with a poutine and a Philly cheesesteak sandwich and tornado fries and two cans of pop. Typical for a specialty burger joint.

They just need to time the cooking of your food so your burgers aren't piping hot and sides ice cold."
3,"I don't know what the craze is. The whole sandwich is just really underwhelming. It's exactly what you think it would be - a small, greasy mystery meat sandwich for $4.50. They do, however, have cherry cola and the overall place is really cool."
3,"Had the fish burger and fries.  Deep fried fish with shrimp stuffed in was Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside but, under-seasoned. Toppings were fresh but nothing special. The Jackson hit sauce was disappointing with neither heat or acidity.  Another issue was my choice of the wholewheat bun. The bread is almost as important as the meat and there was a lack of overall flavour. Take a look at the Shake Shack and see how the bun completes the burger.

Fries were of the shoe string variety and another issue as they were limp and soggy. No crispiness or soft interior. Lack of salt completes the dish. A large was huge and can be split between 2-3 people.

Overall haven't tried the other burgers but I can see they are SMALL.  At ~$9 a burger and Wonderbread bun, it is poor value unless you take advantage of the daily buy one get one free special. Ingredients are fresh and that is standard as is the antibiotic -free beef (all beef sold in Ontario is antibiotic-free in that if antibiotics are given the animal products are not sold until they are cleared)."
3,"Mixed feelings about this place. I'd come back if I was hungry and this was very nearby. I wouldn't make a trip out of my way nor would I pass up any number of other choices.

The place inside looks like a rip-off of In-n-Out crossed with a typical 50s diner. Clean top to bottom. Very attentive, very friendly staff. Table service is a nice perk.

I had the original double with cheese as a meal. Shoestring French fries? Hmmm. Not impressed. They were hot but also most of them were quite overdone and hard as rocks. The ""steak"" burger had evident quality and decent flavor. But, I doubt it's possible to make a patty any thinner than they do. Was it even an 1/8th of an inch thick? I doubt it. It didn't seem like there was much meat at all. The cost was $7.60 before tax. 

I think, maybe, since they are pushing their custard, that they look to Culver's as their main competitor. I'd rank the two on par with one another. The quality of the beef is better than a lot of other fast food burger choices. The price is a bit on the high end for the quantity. 

So, it's not that I would not come back but I can't find a reason that says I'm definitely coming back."
3,"The new owners did a great job fixing up the interior and making Fisher's much more open and pleasant. We sat at the bar and had a very attentive and personable bartender serving us. My wife and I shared a Mama's combo which included ribs, brisket and pulled pork. The ribs were excellent, the pulled pork was OK though a bit dry, and the brisket was quite dry. The sauces were above average. The mac & cheese was excellent. Portions were fine. I did not think that the food prices were out of line for the quality and quantity, though it seems a small piece of cornbread could come with the combo dinners rather than providing an indescript ""brioche"" roll. They do have to reduce the price on their draft beer. I don't think any other high-end restaurant in the Cleveland area charges nine dollars for a microbrew draft. Since barbecue and beer go together, they are going to chase away a lot of customers with those beer prices. They will be competing with Oak and Embers in Chesterland and right now, I would likely go to Oak and Embers. I will however give this place another try after the management has a chance to tweak things."
3,"We had a mixed experience on a recent trip here.  Lets start with the most important part the food.  The beef ribs and spare ribs were really good.  Both had the bark and smoke flavor you expect from a smokehouse and were tender without being mushy.  The biggest surprise was the pureed sweet potatoes, they were awesome.  The sausage and mac and cheese were good as well.  
The brisket and burnt ends were a huge disappointment.  Both lacked any bark or smoke flavor and you if i wasnt in a bbq smokehouse it wouldnt have occurred to me that they were smoked.  The burnt ends werent even 'burnt' and i question if they were even smoked a second time.  The beans were different, not bad but not what we were expecting as it was more like a soup.
Our server was friendly and helped us with our questions.  Since we just ordered bbq, i was surprised that it took 30+ min to get our food.  They were busy but since the bbq is already cooked it should come out faster"
3,"If an order of 2 burgers with a medium order of fries costs more than $30, it better be damn good. So when I got my chicken burger I was very disappointed. It was tasteless and puny. I would have much rather had spent $15 at Harvey's and got a burger with all the toppings I wanted. In a city with a so many gourmet burger places, I'm surprised that burger joints like this are able to survive."
3,"More of a 3.5. I think my best advice for those on a budget is to come to JBs with a friend after you look at their weekly specials and decide which one the both of you are most interested in. That way both of you can get a roughly $10 burger for half that price. 

I swung by on the day where the fish burger was on special, (and regretted not researching what day I wanted to visited ahead of time), but I was still impressed with how close the burger was with the advertised picture. I remember seeing the 3 pieces of shrimp in the picture and thought, ""naw there's no way there would be that much shrimp of that size in the fish patty"".But, lo and behold there were in fact that many pieces of shrimp in there.

However, it's more of a 3.5 rather than a 4 for 2 reasons. First, the burger, was good but not amazing. Second, service was a bit lacking in terms of the attitude I received when I asked questions about the toppings (which are listed in front of the cashier) but I will be lenient on that since they were really busy that day.

I do hope to return and try another specialty burger and maybe at that time they will be able to earn 4 stars in my books."
3,It was ok. I guess I expected a little more meat. Fries were go though and my kids loved it.
3,Yoshinoya was always one of my Los Angeles favorites for the beef and/or vegie bowl. Real simple concept and the thin shaved marinated beef placed on top of a bed of rice has always been tasty. This location is a few miles from the strip in a questionable neighborhood where alcohol abuse (panhandling drunks)surrounding the restaurant was noticeable. Food was just ok and below the standards set at the LAX area locations. Restrooms could use a little more cleaning attention.
3,"Really disappointed! We ordered 2 dinners Beef Rib ($36 for a single bone) and  Brisket. Brisket was ok, had a good bark but not at all seasoned. Beef Rib was totally unseasoned,  and tastes as if it was reheated. We actually threw away that $36 . Ordered a variety of sides. Fried corn was good, sweet potatoes were ok. Mac and cheese was very good and fries were oily and old. This was on their second day of business which is why I'll be nice with 3 stars. I'll give em a couple months and try again to update the review for better or worse. But for a restaurant to serve obviously old and unseasoned food on one of there opening days in I acceptable. It's smoked bbq for God's sake! Step it up people. I'm surprised Carl Quigliata would allow this to happen"

3,"Used to eat Yoshinoya when I was in college. Miss those good old days! Anyways, the food was little off. It didn't taste like the beef bowl I used to have in Southern California. I couldn't tell what was it but it just didn't taste right.  Also, the employee was taking my order decided to just disappear??? Another employee finally jump in and finish taking my order. That was the most awkward moments in my life."
3,"The food was fine, certainly didn't live up to the hype but it was good. I felt like the baby back ribs were tough and the brisket wasn't really that smokey or memorable either. Mac and cheese was very very good. I feel that I should mention that our server Sarah had the absolute worst breath that I have ever smelled on a person, made me not want to eat anything, it was really really really bad- but all in all I would go back"
3,"Food was inconsistent. We had pulled pork, brisket and jalapeno sausage. The brisket was wonderful, the pork was very well done and smokey but didn't really have any flavor and the sause is very watery. The jalapeno sausage was horrible, it looked like something they stuffed into a casing and boiled till it stopped screaming. The best part of the meal the corn bread, it served in a little caste iron skillet and is some of the best I have ever had. They have only been open for a week so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again in a couple of months."
3,"There a lot of good things and some bad.  I am going to chalk most of the bad up to being new and still working out the bugs.  

I sat at the bar and the service was good but you could tell the staff was still learning the ropes and didn't know the menu or have a good ordering system.  There were several people behind a fairly small bar which caused some chaos.  The beer selection seemed to be good but they were out of several beers.

I ordered the brisket, which was suppose to be a mixed of charred bit and strips.  The brisket was tender and tasty but no charred bits.  The meat came with some slaw, pickles and onions but the portions of everything was pretty slim.

I will definitely try again and hopefully they will get things together.  The area definitely needs a place like this."
3,"When I told one of my DC friends I was going to Montreal, he said if there was one thing we had to do was to try the ""deep-fat fried"" bologna sandwich at Wilensky's. After looking it up and seeing good reviews from more than one celebrity chef, we had to go.

We walked in and it still has a 1920s feel to it like the kind of delis you see in the old movies. A funny, old man greeted us and ave us their special within literally 30 seconds on a napkin. The sandwich was NOT deep-fat friend and it was literally a bun heated on a panini with layers of meat and kraft slice cheese. I loved it, but I definitely wouldn't give it the best sandwich I ever had award like one celebrity chef called it."
3,"Did a takeout of four burgers and a large fries. All the burgers were vegetarian and were Mexican, Italian, perogies style and Greek

The fries are cut too this although they taste fresh cut. The Greek and Italian lack flavour. The Mexican with bursting avocado was good and the perogies style was good as well. The burgers a bit dry as there is nothing on the buns and that makes them dry. The quinoa  burgers also need to ante up some flavour. Need a good soy burger option as well."
3,"My order: cheeseburger combo

They have really good fries that are soft on the inside and crispy outside. Subtle hint if sweetness in them.

Burger was underwhelming. The beef patty was fresh but lacked in mass and seasoning. Please salt your patties more. The surprisingly fresh toppings make up for it though.

Their Jackson's sauce keeps me going back.

Noteworthy mention: they give you a lot of fries. I'm always stuffed when I leave, so props to JB"
3,Good food. Ok service. Place is congested though. Burgers are not the greatest but decent for the money.
3,This place was busy when we arrived. I tried the Ol Hefer with the MAC n Cheese side. The brisket sandwich was great. The MAC N Cheese was just okay. My gf tried the Pulled Pork. I thought hers was a bit dry  but her side of corn bread was amazing. I'm sure we will return to try a second time and see if anything else is worth trying as this place always seems to be packed.
3,"Burger Factory is a decent burger joint. I do not find their burgers horrible, nor are they exceptional. If you're really in a bind, I say go for it. If you really want to satisfy your burger cravings, I say go elsewhere. Plus their burger buns are terrible, and being a burger lover, buns are a vital part of a burger experience! As for their tornado fries, that's a winner! Love the crispy texture of those babies!"
3,"We were sceptical to try this place based on the mixed reviews. And now after trying their food I too have mixed feelings about this place. The atmosphere and decor is nice, two dinning areas and a nice outdoor patio. The one thing that is missing is the great aroma of smoke. Service was great and the menu ( bbq, southern with a Mexican flare)  has options from bbq pork nachos, salads, sandwiches, burgers, tacos and your standard bbq meats. 

Items ordered

Beef short rib with Brussel Sprouts. The Brussel Sprouts were tender and had a nice little char on them. The beef rib, fatty, under seasoned, extremely chared exterior, no smoke flavor but as far as the little amount of meat that was under all that was nice, tender and juicy. 

Burnt ends with fried corn. The burnt ends were extremely dry and had zero smoke. The only flavor it had was the little amount of sauce they had put on them. The corn was amazing love the Chipotle butter it was a great addition. Very flavorful.

Momma Bear platter (brisket, Pulled Pork and spare ribs) and for the sides baked mac n cheese. The brisket was tender, juicy  and a little amount if fat. Did not taste any seasoning or smoke. The pulled pork had no flavor and was super dry. The spare ribs were cooked perfectly but again no flavor. Mac n cheese had a great melted gruyere top crust, but once you get through it, the pasta was over cooked and the cheese sauce was runny and really had no flavor. 

Over all the meats were really underwhelming. Some sides were ok but nothing to write home about. Now I am not a pit master and it could just be me, because the place was jammed around lunch time. So don't just trust the reviews try it for yourself."
3,"Ordered through UberEats but was a little disappointed in the tacos. I ordered 4 chicken and 4 steak, but I couldn't tell the difference between the two meats. I wasn't expecting ground meat, and if I knew it would have been ground mystery meat I'll go to Taco Bell next time. Cilantro could have been chopped a little finer, not just picked apart and included the bottom of the stem."
3,"Definitely a restaurant where you want to ""Keep it simple, stupid""

Recommendations:
- Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork. 
- Durian milkshake
- Chicken satay

I've been disappointed with some of the other dishes. It's best to stick to the basics. Beef was very overcooked, rice paper rolls are a lot of food, but it gets boring for sure.

Mediocre service. Not a whole ton of care put into it, but I haven't seen them make any major mistakes."
3,"The burger I had was a little dry but the fries were great.  I didn't try the ice cream but it does look really good, I will go back to try that.  The prices were very reasonable.  It was about $13 for my son and I to eat.  He got a double cheese burger meal.  I got a single burger fries and no drink because they don't have a sugar/caffeine free option.  I can't handle caffeine late and I really don't need the sugar in the evening either so I had water."
3,"Arrowhead has improved waiting. I've never waited any longer than 15 minutes as it seems as if the nurses have gotten nicer. I just don't like that when they put you in the chairs your so close to your ""neighbor"" ... Im glad why I'm here in personal I wouldn't want the world to know... It's not fun when the person next to you is here for personal reasons tho!"
3,"Everyone who comes here knows performers in some way or the other. It's a great little venue - small spaces, intimate. Very word of mouth. 

Great place to grab a drink and a laugh at a really reasonable price."
3,"Heard a lot about this place, finally got the chance to try it. Burger was really overcooked and the bun was way bigger than the burger meaning the first few bites I just got bread. Toppings were solid though. Won't be back, way better options all over the GTA."
3,"Compared to other places I've had surgery, the check-in process here is a lot slower.  When you're about to have surgery, you get pretty anxious and just sitting there waiting doesn't really help, especially when you don't get called in until less than an hour before the surgery is to start.

As far as everything else goes, things went pretty smoothly - what I remember of it of course.  The nurses were nice, and I felt like I was take care of.  If I had a choice, I don't think I'd come back here again but wouldn't mind it either."
3,"Poor service. I asked about the ""hot chick"" sandwich...the server answered simply ""no"". Gave no explanation. The drink was very weak. They were out of several beers we ordered, including bud light. The server even crossed out the beer they did not have.....I have to say the food was good tho! Nachos app, pulled pork, mac n cheese, tacos; all really really good! Would get takeout."
3,"It's a very nice place with a great wait staff and a cozy feel. But the problems are two-fold...first, the ""smoke flavor"" is completely missing and this is BAD when ""Smokin"" is the restaurant's first name. The meats have no smokey BBQ flavors whatsoever. Thank God for the extra sauces on the table.

Second is the price...I don't mind paying $22 for a full rack of ribs, but I was hoping for a big rack and/or large side portions. But instead, you'd get a small scoop of slaw, a bun, and a few slices of onions with a medium-size rack. After adding extra sides such as corn, sprouts, mac and cheese, our two-person dinner tab was close to $70. And that's drinking water only!

It's a tossup whether I'd recommend that you come here because I would need a great reason to go back again."
3,"To be completely honest with you, I wasn't on hiatus from Yelp all this time (I know my reviews were starting to become missed about these parts). 

I have been thinking for almost a month now on what place I could write a review for my big number 1-0-0! I wanted it to be someplace I frequented way more than I'd like to count and really needed to be noticed for such. After some deep soul and brain searching, I asked myself is there no better place to review other than Arrowhead Hospital?! Nope, I think this choice tops about everything (that is that I haven't already reviewed). 

I've had one near death experience in their ER. Leave it to me, to end up in the ER for the most bizarre or scariest things I could have ever imagined (try a butter knife stab to the left index finger or a locked jaw due to a sudden onset of TMJ at 2am on for size!). But I have this theory going that AZ has been trying to kill me since the moment I first stepped foot on its dry cracked soil. 

Yet, I hold no grudges for it, I just simply go get fixed up and put back out here in the world. Considering most of the times I ended up here I was slightly incapacitated, I will have to say I was treated as well as a hospital can treat a ER patient. They would let me sit in the waiting room until I passed out or faked death, check on me once I made it to the ER, fix IVs, and sometimes bring me stuff to stay preoccupied with while I waited for a horrid prognosis (yea, I know I can be a bit dramatic, but just keep reading!). So yay for average bed side manner and medical professionals and staff that do their job! I've visited others here before and saw a bit of how the non-ER hospitalites lived. I think they've got it ok, but I only base this from outward appearances and have no non-ER testimony of my own. 

So why the three stars Ameerah, you ask? You're still alive and kicking, in moderately good health and not the most noticeable scars...And you know what I say in response? I say, I got some beef. I got some serious beef! But not with the physical hospital per say, but with their billing/collections department. Abrazo Health Care has the most incompetent individuals working for them in that department! I'm still haunted with this to this very day! Numerous (no, not just one!) medical bills that were PAID for by my insurance ON TIME, but have their stamp of delinquency in my credit history. 

There is another thing I would like to add to my list of things you don't mess with about me. And that's my credit. I'm an adult now, and its really important that I don't have things like that lingering about, please and thank you. So yes you, Abrazo Health Care billing, I despise your methods of operation (or more like the lack thereof) and consequently one of your facilities that I frequent is getting the brash decision of a star reduction on its review!!! 

(insert maniacal laugh here)

Arrowhead Hospital, keep up the average work! And Abrazo billing, improve, like major!"
3,"My order was lamp burger, cheese burger and fries. 
Service: 3/5 (friendly staff and okay service) 
Clean: 4/5 (dining and kitchen area looks clean) 
Price: 3/5 ( regular price burger for a small size burger) 
Amount: 3/5 (size of the burger is small it is between a burger for a kid and female.)
Taste: 4/5 (it tasted good. You can feel the fresh taste of ingredients. But it is not my first option at all.
Overall: 3.4 /5 ( it is fresh and taste OK but next door you can get taster burger. I might try it again but not in the near future.  I don't recommend it that much but it worth to try it ) ."
3,"Their daily specials are a bargain!  They have specific burgers for each day that are BOGO.  If you can't have something specific on the burger, just ask them for without.  And for all your friends that eat halal or gluten-free - REJOICE! I like this place because it doesn't make a dent in my pocket.  I get a decent-sized burger and my friend takes the other for $5 a burger.  Their burgers are interesting and creative and that tempts me enough to try all of them.  So far I've had the Canada Eh! (Monday) which has an egg, beef patty, bacon and fried cheese.  I've also had the Burogie (Saturday) that has a beef patty, potato latke, sour cream, and coleslaw. Canada eh! was good, but greasy.  Definitely have it hot because if it's cold it'll taste ick. Burogie seemed like a package of awesomeness because I love coleslaw and potatoes, but it disappointed.  The latke was hard and I couldn't taste the coleslaw. 

The staff was nice.  Cooks are a little succinct, but the cashiers are a lot more friendly and patient. Seating area isn't big, but people clear out pretty quickly after their meal.  So finding a spot to eat shouldn't be too difficult. My overall take on this place is that the price is unbeatable for the daily specials and staying open late.  I'd head back here just to try the other burgers to see if I scrounge up a winner or if I'm out on a late night. However, I definitely prefer my other burgers."
3,"The bad first,  it was freezing in the restaurant.  Then they were out  of the first three draft beers we ordered  from the menu.
The good was the food.  My 1/2 chicken El Hefe style was excellent. The others enjoyed their tacos, except every one would preferred soft tortillas
Instead of greasy hard ones. Our waitress was road house perfect!
We will return but not a third time if is still so sub zero."
3,"Came to the airport to drop my boyfriend's mom off, so we thought we'd eat together here before she left. We've been to the other Lo-lo's in Arizona before, so we know how good their food is. The food here, however, was a little.. different.

My boyfriend and his mom ordered the Tre Tre which comes with two fried chicken drumsticks and a waffle. I ordered a waffle and a side of fries. They both said that the breading of the drumsticks were a little too salty and the drumsticks seemed really small. 

The waffles at Lo-lo's usually have a slight cinnamon flavor and are crispy, but we all agreed that the waffles here were soggy and didn't have a strong ""waffle"" flavor. The syrup wasn't thick either and was really runny. The fries, however, were extra crispy. They were thinner than I remembered and didn't have the seasoning on top, but I still enjoyed them.

I would have given this place 2 stars, but the guy who took our order was very nice and gave us a lot of ketchup!"
3,"Food is very good.   However very tight and uncomfortable as we had to share our table with others.  Very busy, service is quick."
3,"I've always been a big fan of LoLo's since they first started in central Phoenix in the small house and to see the restaurant experience nationwide growth is great. The menu items are similar but you won't find the exact same thing if you frequent visitor to the restaurant (limited menu). You can still get your order tweaked for certain things (ie type of chicken piece or with gravy). I decided to go with waffle cooked well and breast and wing which is basically a Betty Boob with an extra wing aka the Sheeda's Special I've always known. 

Seasoning on the food was not so great and the waffle was a little bit flat. I was expecting a little bit more seasoning on the chicken so that's why it receives a 3 star review this time around. 

Customer service was good but keep in mind you should always ask if there is a long delay when it comes to cooking as chicken can take anywhere from 12 to 20 minutes to cook. I tend to ask what do you have available in the crunch for the time as I am at the airport and still have to go through Security. It would be nice to if they could do orders to be served on a plate versus being in a box, but I get it when you're at the airport as you never know when you have to pick up and run. 

Hoping my next experience is better as I do plan to come back. If your traveling through and didn't get a chance to dine at the restaurant, swing by and judge for yourself if a returned trip is required."
3,"I decided to visit my (work) neighborhood Chinese restaurant today for lunch.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the interior- it was clean, well designed, and visually appealing.  They appeared to be doing a rather brisk lunchtime service between take-out, delivery, and dine-in.  

I chose the General Tso's Lunch special ($6), for take-out, and sat in their reception area, which very conveniently, had a great selection of magazines for me to read while I waited. All of the lunch specials included either white rice, brown rice, or chow mien, and a cup of egg drop soup and were priced at either $6 or $7.

The food itself was piping hot, but was pretty average.  A little on the greasy side, but a large, filling portion. Definitely had a lot of kick and spice to it, as my lips were burning by the end of the dish. I'd rate it as on par with Panda Express.  

For a lunch during the work day, I'd probably stop by China Tango again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."
3,"I wasn't all that surprised how my food turned out. Overall it was a decent sandwich spot. I really recommend other spots to have a sandwich, but this place didn't disappoint because my expectations weren't all that high to begin with.

I ordered the capastrami sandwich. Which was kind of good. Not much to talk about as I said, there's really nothing special about eating at this place."
3,"Came here today on my way to Yorkdale for Christmas shopping.  Ordered my typical item bun bo Hue.  While the broth still flavourful, the sausage didn't taste fresh at all.  This is a let down and I hope they improve on the quality control and consistency.  Everything else is ok, they don't skimp on the portion and tables are still being turned efficiently."
3,"The food her gets 4 stars, however the service was definitely a 1 star as the waiter almost contributed to the death of one of my friends. 

I came here with a group of friends this past Sunday prior to catching a movie. One of my friends and I decided to share an appetizer and a couple of mains. For appetizer we settled on the ghee dosa which is basically a crepe cooked in ghee (clarified butter) and served with 3 condiments for dipping. OMFG the dosa was sublime! It was extremely crispy and flaky. The dough had a great buttery taste from the ghee; I do not even want to know how many calories were in this thing. The accompanying condiments were all good (I was not a huge fan of the coconut sambal) but otherwise these were great to dip our crispy dosa in. The presentation of the dosa was awesome too, served in the shape of a mountain this resulted in a couple of cool photo ops.

For mains my friend and I decided to get mutton biryani and butter chicken with garlic naan. The biryani was very good, it had a nice kick and the mutton in it was very tender. If you do get the biryani eat with caution as there were small bones in the mutton and whole spices and seeds for flavouring so be sure to pick these out or risk getting a mouthful of anise seed, as I did. The biryani was also served with 2 condiments; I enjoyed the yogurt with onions as it really balanced out the spiciness of the biryani.  The butter chicken was a pleasant surprise too considering that it is not a south Indian dish. The chicken was served in boneless chunks which were quite large, the gravy was very creamy and not very spicy, this dish was very enjoyable. 

This was my first experience with south Indian food and all in all the food was very good, our entire table enjoyed their dishes. The service on the other hand was pretty dismal. Our young waiter seemed intimidated by our group of 7 people; it was clear that most of our table was not familiar with the menu items but he did not offer any explanations or provide us with any suggestions. My other friend wanted to order the biryani also but asked the waiter if it contained nuts (he has a severe allergy) the waiter came back and said the biryani contained cashews. My friend and his girlfriend proceeded to say that they would just share a masala dosa and a side of kotthu roti. The waiter brought them their food but failed to mention that the kotthu roti also contained cashews. My friend luckily caught this within a couple of bites but it was too late, he already had a reaction and had to leave to go get medication. The waiter looked stunned when we told him what happened and said it was a miscommunication, we spoke to the manager and he gave my friend and his girlfriend their dinner for free. I hope they learn from this mistake and start to take food allergies more seriously because if it was a child or something the situation could have been a lot worse. 

The restaurant itself was pretty average in terms of décor and it definitely has an authentic Indian feel (most of the patrons were Indian/Sri Lankan). The prices were fair and most dishes were in the $8-13 dollar range. Bonus for having 2 Indian beers in stock! I will likely return and give them a second chance but they need to step up their game in the service department!"
3,"I lived here a few years ago and it was okay. Close to UNLV, the airport, and the Strip so no complaints about the location. There is a shuttle to campus but it was easier for me to walk or park in the free lot. The pool and fitness center are very nice. I didn't have much interaction with the office staff but they were friendly and helpful when I did. 

Negatives - The space is very small. I had to put my dresser under the bed to be able to have any room and the bathrooms are tiny! Walls are very, very thin. I expect to hear things in an apartment, but I could literally have a conversation with my roommate through our bedroom walls and we were both speaking at a normal volume. It's very uncomfortable to be able to hear every single thing that's happening in someone's bedroom.. Otherwise, the apartments are nice and the layout is fine, just small. I had an issue with some unknown substance coming from the vents and covering everything in my bedroom and closet in a sticky film. Maintenance looked in the vent and said there was nothing wrong. Didn't have the vents cleaned or anything, just called it a day. Still have no idea what that was but it was disgusting.

Overall, I wouldn't highly recommend Rebel Place or tell anyone to stay away. It's fine for temporary student living."
3,"-Each 'order' of meat is literally 5 slices, so order a lot at once
-Already overpriced on weekdays and weekends, then add 2-5$ for soup base lol
-Only 2 servers have the tablet to put in orders, good luck flagging them down
-Weekday service slightly better, weekend is a nightmare
-Seating is awkward with long tables separating guests with flimsy glass/plastic, chairs completely the wrong height"
3,"Pricey for what you're getting, and though it's Carefree/N.Scottsdale area, it just doesn't quite justify it.  Food isn't bad, but not great either.  Inauthentic mixture of several asian cuisines here too.  Parking is good though."
3,"This was an above average restaurant experience, but not great. I recently ate at Longhorn Steakhouse and everything there was just better. Longhorn Steakhouse steak was better, the bread was better, the service was better. However, Texas Roadhouse was still a good meal."
3,"This used to have really well seasoned dishes with a variety of delicate flavors.  But the last few years has led to uneven dishes, and sauces that have no subtlety or are just plain greasy with little flavor.  They've also stopped paying attention to special requests.  In my last two orders from IG about a month apart, I asked them to omit a vegetable ingredient from a dish.  Both times they forgot.  The first time they argued with me about it, and the second time they admitted their error and refunded the price of the dishes on our credit card. But I ended up having to heat up a microwave meal out of the freezer both times!!  So now I'm done with IG and have to find another Chinese restaurant that cares about the taste of their food and the ingredients."
3,"This place is everything that's good and bad about America. It's a loud, excessive, over-the-top contributor to the nation's obesity epidemic. These are also some of the reasons that it's so damn popular. Using a sort of Texas meets commercial country/wild west theme, Texas Roadhouse is a decent place to get a good steak without having to take out a loan first.

We arrived around 5pm on a Sunday and the place was packed. People were spilling out of the waiting area and into the lobby, the hostess was doing her best to take names and pass out little electronic buzzing things, and the giant moose head hanging over the entrance looked on with cunning apathy. This place is not for those with a fear of loud noises and crowds. The decor is a combination of neon beer signs, steer horns, knotty pine planks, and cowboy. I was a tad unnerved by the giant mural of a Native American that took up most of the wall next to me. Disturbingly ironic.

We waited about 10 minutes before being ushered past the meat display case by the roll-carrying, black-shirted escort. The staff here is mostly female with an average age of about 19 and they're always moving. Unfortunately we got a two-top stuck right out in the middle of the floor. It had the same problems that all two-tops have in restaurants including lack of space (due mostly to the big metal pail of peanuts, salt and pepper shakers, menus, and steak sauce) and poor placement (I was constantly getting bumped into as servers whisked by to deliver food to the surrounding tables) but I was hungry and I was seated so I sucked it up.

The first of what would turn out to be three servers we'd have throughout our meal - apparently they've got a team approach to service - stopped by after a few minutes and took our drink order. Now for some notable highlights/lowlights:

Very limited beer selection - First, there's no Shiner Bock or Texas beer of any kind and the rest of the beer offering reads like a frat house mini fridge. Luckily they had the good ole Cleveland staple Dortumunder Gold and a surprisingly tasty Leinenkugel Snowdrift vanilla porter. Chilled mugs, ugh. Chilled mugs are for floats not beer. They also offer a ""short"" and ""Tall"" option. I went with the short and would highly doubt they were more than 10oz pours for which I was charged what most bars charge for a full pint. Anyway, I had low expectations on this front and they were met.

Good value-priced steaks - On par with the likes of Longhorn and Outback, the cow prices here are comfortably affordable and intended for the masses. I got a 12oz ribeye for $17 and it came with two sides. Not a bad deal considering I got dinner for the next day out of it, too. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, marked and seasoned well, and slathered in butter. The loaded baked potato and green beans did their best to stop my heart on the spot.

Alternatives for those into swine - If steak isn't your thing you can get ribs, chicken and even fried catfish. My wife opted for the pulled pork and it was pretty damn tasty. Not covered in sauce the meat was tender and juicy with just a hint of smoke. It definitely reminded me of the BBQ we grew to love when we lived in Texas.

The rolls, my God, the rolls - These things, which are available in a seemingly endless supply, are fantastic. They're yeasty, sweet, buttery carb grenades that come served with a sugary, cinnamon butter. Make sure you get a basket to take home with you. These things would be great as buns for pulled pork sliders.

It's loud and it's country - I personally can't stand country music of any kind so I had to go to my happy place while I was here.  It's blasting out of every crevice of the restaurant and there's no escaping it. Luckily the steak I was noshing on was there to take my mind off of the audible assault.

Manic, Ooompah Loompah staff - It felt like there were about a hundred staff members running around the place, their black t-shirts emblazoned with ""I Love My Job"" melting into smears down the narrow aisles. They talk very fast, walk around the tables in a constant hurry and recite their script-like pleasantries with pinpoint precision.

Not normally a fan of chains, Texas Roadhouse is a solid, middle-of-the-road steakhouse with good service, good steaks, and killer rolls. If you're part of the ""I Love This Bar"" crowd you'll feel like you just came home and if you're not you can grin and bear it for a well-cooked piece of meat and a damn good baked potato. You'll know you did it right when you can feel your already winter-pudged belly pressing against your belt and a slight sickening feeling washing over you. You've just been ""Roadhoused"".

P.S.
You should check out the video on the Roadhouse website with founder Kent Taylor. He sort of reminds me of a combination of Dave Thomas and Ted Nugent."
3,"good quality ingredients, horrible wait time.

oh and seats are still the wrong fucking height."
3,"Just okay. I was surprised, however, to find such a large Breakfast Waffle Sandwhich and it went beyond my expectations, although very slightly.

Like other Yelpers, I waited longer than I expected from an airport eatery. Chefs were taking there time, as was the cashier. Folks are usually rushing in airports, but not here, and definetly not catering to the ""flying public"". 

Are you serious? Step it up a bit, and perhaps the average food, generous serving size aside, will be overlooked."
3,"What was once considered one of the best pho places in North York has now deteriorated  to becoming just another generic Vietnamese restaurant. While they still sling out bowls of authentic pho noodles at a lightning quick rate, the quality and consistency of their broth has gone downhill. And sanitation is becoming a real issue here, as you'll be hard pressed to find a pair of utensils that are squeaky clean. Be prepared to wipe down stains from their chopsticks and cups before you use them. 

This place will suffice if you're looking to satisfy some pho cravings. Just don't expect to be impressed by the food anymore like in years past."
3,"This place is alright for being in the airport.  I'm sure their main location is a bit better.

The chicken was delicious, but the waffles left more to be desired.  They were a bit soggy.  Not sure if they are always like that or if they were undercooked."
3,"A surprisingly clean sit down restaurant that served food comparable to Panda Express or your local fast Chinese food joint. The beginning of the service was slow due to the waitresses arguing with some guy about expiration dates. I don't know what they were talking about, per se, because I was too far for my nosey ears to hear. 

Anyway, I ordered the garden tofu lunch special ($6) with chow mein noodles. I was given a hot and sloppy plate of noodles, tofu (3 large pieces), and veggies covered in lots of brown sauce. The vegetables were cooked nicely but I was not a fan of the sweet and salty flavors. My taste buds were like, no por favor, dude. I disliked the baby corn and water chestnuts that came with it. And that's something I don't get about fast Chinese food and probably never will. The noodles that came were a mountain of Medusa's hair extensions. They were greasy, slithery, and totally unappetizing. Had they lightened on the sauce; added more onions and cabbage; and not cooked them for too long, I would have eaten more of it. Steamed brown rice would have been a better option but they charge a dollar extra, which is a bunch of bullshit. Shouldn't fried rice and chow mein be charged extra because you're using extra man power and other ingredients?  Oh well. Other add-ons include an okay egg drop soup and an unnecessary bowl of fried wonton strips with dipping sauces. I didn't sample the latter but it was a sweet gesture. If China Tango Bistro wants to strive for a modern and chic like their décor, they must have food and service to match that, and China Tango Bistro sadly doesn't."
3,"I ordered the chicken tender basket with a waffle.  Hot, fresh, cooked to order food.  The waffle was wonderful though the maple syrup is pretty thin.  The chicken tenders were perfectly cooked and quite god.  Here's the  problem - this is an airport and can you wait 15 to 20 minutes for your food?  And that wait was when they were not busy at all.  I don't think that pre-cooking and holding chicken and waffles would be an appetizing purchase so to do it right you have to wait - assuming you can."
3,"3.5/5 

I came here with 6 other friends last night and we were quite disappointed with the service. We arrived at 8pm and didn't get seated until 9:15pm even though most of tables who arrived after us were already seated. To be fair, they did say that we had to wait longer because we were a larger group (still sucked though because we were all starving). 

We ordered right after getting seated - I got the tomato ox soup base as well as the pork bone soup base. I think it's a couple dollars extra per soup. Their drinks also cost extra - FYI most hot pot places come with one complimentary soup base and free drinks (pop, a few Asian drinks, etc.). I split a watermelon juice with a few other friends and that tasted mediocre. As I mentioned before, we weren't very happy with the service here - we had to ask for water 3 times before it came, our soups were only refilled once and that was towards the end of our meal, and no one really came to check up on us throughout the meal. 

Alright, ranting aside, the selection of food here was quite impressive. I'm not even sure what we ended up ordering because they just brought out a whole bunch of stuff. One good thing about this place is that they don't charge you extra for the good stuff (aka seafood). Their food came out within minutes and everything tasted very fresh. 

All in all, Morals is a good place to eat if you are a fan of hotpot and don't mind a wait/subpar service. The atmosphere here is also very fun and it is nicely decorated."
3,"Don't  expect anything too fancy it is a traditional HK cafe style located in an old plaza that has seen multiple restaurants that has gone through there. The newly renovated restaurant sure beats the old restaurants that used to be there.

Ordered the pork chop, chicken steak with rice and tomato sauce combo so I can compare it to the also ""cheap"" HK cafe a few blocks north on McCowan. 

Overall impression is not bad. The vegetable soup had real ingredients (lots of veggies), the tomato sauce has real tomato not a suace made of ketchup so it actually taste proper. 

I would recommend going back again, compare to a lot of sub-par restaurants in the area."
3,"It's not too bad here for the price that it is!! Our server was the same as last time. He's a bit awkward but he got all our food out right away! For $7 lunch special, that comes with soup. Not too shabby!"
3,Limited options for breakfast but the food is really good ! The service was also fast like when you need someone they're quick to come. Unfortunately they messed my order up twice and then forgot to bring the soya drink out after we mentioned it 3 times.
3,"Madison's loudest restaurant?  If it isn't, it's certainly in the running.  A Thursday night, with a few tables and a bar crowd made for impossible conversation. I couldn't hear the person sitting next to me.  Service was good, the food was ok (be prepared for small portions), and the setting was nice.  It's nothing I'll make a trip to enjoy again."
3,"This place is ok.  I tried their pad Thai and it was nothing special.  I also had their Boba and it was just ok.  The only dishes I did like was the kung-pow chicken and the fish with black bean sauce which were pretty good.  This is an ok Chinese Restaurant, not the best nor the worst."
3,"I loved the atmosphere. I thought the duck confit rice dish was amazing. I could eat that over and over.  Scallops were great. The rest of the food we ordered was blah. Our waitstaff were super friendly. 

We reserved a booth well in advance but we were short one person so they said they couldn't seat us there and ended up giving us a table near the front of the restaurant.   And damn it was cold we could feel a draft. :( just get some heaters :) or let your guests sit where they booked!"
3,"Only been here once for breakfast. The place had 4 customers besides me and my hubby. I ordered a chinese breakfast, consisting of daily congee and a choice of dim sum. I got the pan fried turnip cake. The congee was peas and sliced fish. It was ok, bit bland and watery. My husband got a bowl of soup rice vermicelli and an egg sandwich. He said his food was ok. The prices are cheap here and food is ok, not great, but you really can't expect much for the price you pay. They offer lots of dim sum choices too but why get frozen dim sum from here, when you can buy some from T & T and steam it yourself. 
Ok for a quick bite to eat, if you can read chinese, you can get a free newspaper too.
Er, no I haven't been back since."
3,"Food tastes amazing...friendly cashier.. Great location in airport to pick up food as go in or as your leaving..gave 3 stars because of the price.. I got one waffle, two small chicken wings, and a side of greens for 15$.....that's a lot of money  for such a small amount of food with no drink"
3,"I have lived here for a month and this is what I have to say so far.

Pros: I personally believe $500 is CHEAP the fact that that includes everything is nice!

The gym,pool,jacuzzi,and the lounge area are very much kept up and its great to come home and know i have these options right downstairs!

The new manager she so far seems on top of her stuff. She has been doing alot of changes that i do believe were well needed to this place.

Kitchens are nice. Granite counters and nice size stove for the inner baker i am!(except I live with 3 nasty roommates so its not really rebel place for that, now is it)

CONS:
There have been quite a few times i have woken up at 3am to someone blasting kid cudi threw there window which echos if you have a room with a window in the small quad area.

Even though we have security there still seems to be cars getting robbed at random.

Its not rebel place for this..Its the people who bring the wrong crowd here but we have had the police here about 4 times since i lived here each time someone who DIDn't live here got arrested.

They tell you they are gonna hook you up with roommates that match you. I call Bullshit on that cause I have 3 roommates who have nothing in common with me. If im not mistaken one of them even dislikes me cause I'm black and she is used to be the token black girl or something....

People often get stupid in leave trash bags in the elevator which is not only disgusting its unsanitary. 



Overall I wouldnt be outside with a sign saying OMFG YOU GOTTA live here but Honestly if you want that dorm experience,party life, social life,or anything where not just some boring homebody...THIS would be a great place for you!"
3,"Just fair, but you learn to appreciate decent chinese food for its rarity (I know, a strange concept for those of us living in the Bay Area)."
3,"Ambiance is great.  Very comfortable restaurant.  If you are used to traditional Chinese food, you will probably be disappointed.  If you have shellfish allergies, be very cautious and ask questions.  There is shrimp in almost everything.  

Egg Foo Yong was small and sparse.  Only two patties.  The gravy was like a stew, with so many vegetables that it smothered the flavors of the entree.  The won-ton soup had beef (I think) and shrimp in addition to the pork.  The flavor was good, once you get used to the assortment of other flavors.

I can't really rate it poorly, aside from the extremely non-tradition preparation."
3,"When it comes to comfort during those nasty cold winters, I seek for pho. This is my favorite spot in the North York area. I like this restaurant because there broth is delicious. This isn't a place for good customer service, beautiful decor, nor is it a place to seek for smiling faces. It is simply a place for traditional pho.

I have been going here for years and I never get tired of it. As I write this, I am starting to crave for pho. Should I eat that again today? 

It is an affordable adventure. I mostly enjoy good food at an affordable price. I usually just get a large bowl of pho, shrimp & pork rolls, and an avocado shake. The rolls are nothing great, but I enjoy it. There vermicelli bowl, chow mein, and their egg noodle soup is worth trying. 

My rating is a 4, for their good pho! You will be a happy camper. Now how many times have I said pho?"
3,"I've been to Imperial Gardens countless times. It's one of the few restaurants in Madison that's not a burger joint that's not ""too spicy"" for my Mom. So Imperial Gardens has become a go to sort of place when there is a reason for a family outing. 

On to the meal, there were six of us (ironically dear Mother didn't make it). We ordered: Grilled Pot Stickers, Green Beans with Garlic, Moo Shu Chicken, Governor's Chicken, Beef Epicurious, Sweet and Sour Pork, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, and some sort of Shrimp Dish. 

This isn't a Chinese place with bold flavors. But it's consistent. Each dish was distinctly different but mild, even the Governor's Chicken.  Surprisingly the best dishes in this mix were the simplest, the green beans and the eggplant. 

The menu seems to have recently been reorganized. It seems smaller but all the usual dishes all seem to be in place. Also, you can order brown rice in addition to the standard white rice. If you're looking for the Classic Americanized Chinese Restaurant Imperial Palace is your kind of place. 

Hopefully dear old Mom will make the next outing. We did get an extra order of dumplings to go with the leftovers for Mom."
3,"I had my transmission gasket done, and all the oil leaked out on my home. They fixed it and TJ was nice about the whole thing but ever since then my car shifts hard from first to second gear. I spoke to TJ about it the next day and later the following week. He had his guys check it out but the problem is still there and wasn't there before. I'll talk with them Today about it."
3,"Went for the lunch Buffet. It' s $ 10.99 during weekdays. Compare to my previous visit, this time I noticed  choices were limited. 
Restaurant was quite busy and only one server and a helper was working. Took forever to get the drinks. 
When we are expected to pay the full price, I didn't like the discounted service and food selection."
3,"Holy Molasses Batman! They do good work at Kinkade's and they are well priced, but it took almost 6 days to get my vehicle back and I had to keep calling asking for updates after absolutely no communication. I think they need to either get more staff or be more up front about the turn around time for repair."
3,"The build your own salads are very good here. As a sports bar it is lacking, they don't seem to have a full selection of NFL games available. We like it just fine other than that."
3,"This is a no-frills local Chinese joint reminscent of  ""A Christmas Story"" with a modern twist.  Come here for a cozy / nostalgic atmosphere with commendable comfort Chinese food and you won't be disappointed.  Come here for upscale or gourmet ethnic food and you'll leave let down.  Snowbirds from back East will feel right at home...."
3,"Came in here the other day with my partner.
As we arrived the waitress stood up from eating at the table and had a serious amount of food in her mouth, while she was asking us ""for two""? Kinda gross but whatever.
As we seated ourselves I couldn't help but notice the sanitary state of the place.  Food was under the tables, my fork had some unknown substance stuck in between the teeth. That's ok ill use my chop sticks!

We ordered
 1 iced tea
1 pork pot sticker
1 pork,shrimp,egg,chive dumpling

The food wasn't great but not bad. The potstickers came in 5 with a thin shell and beautiful crusted bottom. The dumplings came out very piping hot and fresh! I liked the dumplings the most. Everything came up to 15.00 tax included. We both left full, and satisfied. I'd come back if I had a craving for dumpling only."
3,"I really like their cashew chicken and grilled pot stickers! The ambiance is nice and the staff was attentive. Prices, portions, and quality were good. Overall it was a fine experience. Nothing exceptional, nothing bad."
3,"I went there with a group of 12 adults and 8 kids.  Seating was fine, we took up 3 different tables.  The place looks nice inside, i seen the ironman collection in the display case, looks like a nice collection.

This is the first time i've been here since the AYCE japanese place.  We got the menus, and yes, there are about 6 different menus !!! Too much to go through.  Seriously, i am still stunned on how they can have such a selection. This could be good, and bad.

So after reading some of the reviews on this restaurant, we decided on the softshell crab fried rice, the curry, and pasta with cream sauce and pork.  I asked for cold water... never came, i asked again, never came. A friend ended up going to the bar and getting one for me. There is one head waitress, that was nice, and got things done, the others wait staff, was giving the bad service. Then there was a man running around doing stuff, i assume he might be the owner.  He gave good service!

Sitting there for almost a good 20mins waiting for food, i looked around and the place was quite busy. From all the negative reviews, i was surprise to see it this busy.

On to the food, when it came, the main portions were pretty big!! and served on big dishes!!
Makes you happy, because you are getting your money's worth.

The softshell crab rice was pretty good.  Could have had a bit more softshell in it.  The other dishes were... nothing special. We ended with alot of take home food.

I think my parents would love this place because they value quantity over quality food. They love the dim sum place at market villiage , that serves cheap dimsum, which comes luke warm or cold. Basically the price is right.

For kids who don't like whats popular, they do have deep fried wings and fries, and sandwiches.

I gave this place 3 stars because, i'm sort of torn in between.... you are getting your moneys worth, yet the food was not bad.. 
Service was bad.. unless you get the head waitress or the owner to get it for you.

So... i may try this place again...

Parking lot was pretty full when we finished our 2hour experience."
3,Service is excellent. Food is ok. Particularly the briyani is horrible. Looks like turmeric mixed rice..... Appetizers are good.....Ok restaurant and spoling the name
3,"As other reviewers have said, they are in a hurry to get you to commit to a purchase, perhaps delivering a vehicle that is not quite ready to leave the lot.  It's not an uncommon practice, but I've been to other dealers who strive to deliver a perfect product, where you end up leaving feeling like a customer, rather than another sales number.

Our new 2012 Mazda 5 was missing its standard floor mats and rear cargo cover.  Not a big deal, but an 80 mile round trip to the dealer is inconvenient.  Our paperwork had also been mixed up with another customer's, so that caused some mishaps.  Multiple trips back to the dealership, as well as a trip to our home by our salesperson, eventually (2 weeks) got us those items and fixed the registration issue.  That may sound like an endorsement of their willingness to follow-up, but these are issues that should be initially avoided by a competent sales team.

The trade-in process was handled smoothly.  They gave us exactly what I felt the vehicle was valued at.

I plan to try another dealer when it comes time to service the new Mazda.  I wouldn't tell someone to avoid Cardinaleway, but I have to believe there's better Mazda dealers in the Valley."
3,"The chicken here was good, but we had to wait a little while to get it. We were short on time so we ended up taking it through security and eating it on the plane. By that point the fries had absorbed all the steam so they were cold and soggy. I also tried a bite of my boyfriend's waffle and it was also cold and soggy. Not very appetizing. But the chicken tenders were very good."
3,"I still do not care for Rebel Place. It's really the people I'm surrounded around. I am a college student, but some of these residents are very inconsiderate and unruly. I wish they would better the roommate assessment. On the flip side, I do like Sandy and the rest of the staff. Sandy always helps me out when I'm in need and she's just an all-around good person."
3,"As I was driving around looking for something to eat around the Summerlin area, I stumbled finding this place. I yelped it to check if it had a good amount of stars and read some of the reviews. So why not give it a try for myself? 

I came here on New Years Day and it was pretty busy, but there were seats available so I was glad there was no wait because the place itself is very small. The workers didn't seem to friendly because there were running around everywhere, plus it took about 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. Finally we were seated and handed a menu. I did notice the prices; the prices were a little more expensive then most small Chinese restaurants.

Everything on the menu looked good but the one thing that caught my eyes was the Seafood Hot and Sour soup. I haven't seen hot and sour soup with seafood in any other place I have gone to. The soup was good but really spicy. I love spicy food but after a while my mouth just started burning. So if you're a spicy fan I would highly recommend trying it. The Salt and Pepper Shrimp sounded good too so I decided to give that a shot. There were a lot of shrimp and the shrimp was loaded with flavor. If you want rice you have to make sure you tell the server."
3,"Went for dinner on a Friday night. It was pretty busy but we didn't wait long. Service was excellent. Hostess talked to us while walking to the table, even stayed to finish conversation. Our waitress, Tina was wonderful. She kept checking on us and made sure we had everything. The reason I gave three stars, was the food and cleanliness of the place. I know it was busy but food was just ok. Green beans were extra salty, my chicken was bland. And I'm not complaining about the peanut shells. I expect that, it's the dust on the window and blinds next to my table. Looks like the place hasn't been dusted for a year. I honestly would of left if i would of noticed prior to getting my food."
3,"Came through this place because someone in my party was a big fan of shrimp with lobster sauce and this was the closest location to procure some.  The atmosphere inside is a little odd.  It felt a little old and empty, and I kind of had the sensation I was at my late grandmother's house.

Service was amazing, but that was to be expected as there were very few others in the restaurant, so we had seemingly three servers to ourselves.  For starters we had spring rolls and won ton soup.  Both were very tasty - the sweet and sour sauce paired very well with the spring roll.  I wish you got more than two!

For my main course I got the orange chicken.  I have to say I was a little disappointed by the spice level.  It is called out on their menu with a 'warning' red pepper, but there was almost no spice in it at all.  While I would prefer to err on the side of less spice over more, they went way overboard in this instance, and it really just tasted like plain chicken.

Since the service was so great, I'm going to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  If you're in the mood for some Americanized Chinese cuisine give this place a look, you could do worse."
3,"Super dosas spicy chutneys/curries
If you have *white taste buds your in for one spicy hell of a ride thru the long dosa tunnel

Mutton was chewy chetinad gravy was nice n spicy
Highlight was obviously ghee paper dosa bit on the $$ side 

Serves halal mutton/chicken"
3,"Madison is hugely lacking in southern dining options and Julep is certainly a nice addition to the restaurant options. The black eyed pea salad was a standout during my first visit to Julep but I found the grits disappointing and lacking in flavor. The service was a bit sporadic and we never had our water refilled throughout the meal. Also, we waited 1.5 hours for a table on a Friday night and were only seated when we approached the hostess who had just sat a table of 5 after us on the wait list. The bar looked like a great place to grab a drink but I may not return for dinner in the near future to let them work through the menu and service a bit more."
3,"I'd really like to give this place another star. But the service is inconsistent, some servers need training instead of just being let loose on unsuspecting customers. You can't teach some people to enjoy their jobs and let it show. And than other servers are great like they want to be there and serve you. I blame the poor training on management. 
The foods always been good, sometimes great. Fried chicken is one of my favorites and it's done just right. I also like catfish, but that's been kind of iffy. The luck of the draw."
3,First time trying chicken n waffles definitely nothing to write home about. Fried chicken was ok and waffle average at best. They do have good hot sauce.
3,"Very good authentic Chinese food! Beautiful restaurant decor. Feels like you're in China! Hefty portions. Very good grilled dumplings, shrimp lo mein, and  ginger soy sauce. White rice is better than the brown. Also, the shrimp rangoon filling is a little tasteless. Could use some salt. Friendly staff. The only drawback is that the meals are a tad pricey. But considering the portions, they aren't bad! Fast service, too. Overall, a good restaurant! (I would give it 3.5 stars)"
3,"Food is very good. Easy to tell these folks are experienced in the kitchen, just order anything. Beer selection is also very good. Craft beer and many of those are from NC. Always good to support our in-state brethren. 
If you are looking for a resurrected version of Center St. Tavern, don't bother. This is not the same restaurant. Think a bit more upscale. Of course that brings with it higher prices. OK, much higher prices. Don't forget your wallet!
Again, food was very good. Wish I could afford to eat there regularly, but my budget just won't allow it."
3,"The space is lovely and so was the service. Interesting glass light fixtures. Beautiful courtyard. Reclaimed wood maybe. Welcome to new America. 

I like my cocktails with at least two kinds of amaro, some bitters, and a syrup. I wasn't let down. But hey there's always room for improvement! Make a show of burning some orange oil like a flame thrower over my glass next time!

The dinner menu is short, so for me it was quickly whittled down to brisket. It was dece and there was a lot of it. I prefer my meat to be extremely tender and fall apart to the touch and I had to chew this more than I like. The potatoes and root vegetables had great flavor and texture. The whole business was wading in a pool of gravy, which was savory and rich. I could have licked the plate clean of it.

For dessert... you know what, I don't really enjoy cake. What was I thinking? Oh well. It was fine. But it was still cake, ya know? You'll like it if you like lots of cake and ice cream, which you probably do."
3,"I don't know what kind of morals we need to enter this place, but if we're talking about good service I definitely didn't receive it here. If we're talking about customers' consideration of other customers, I also didn't receive it here. Also, a village? I appreciate the open concept, but it definitely has no village feel.

With that aside...

This restaurant was very busy on a Tuesday night. In fact, I think many of the people came from the condos, cause a lot were wearing PJs and slippers! I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table at 9pm (they close at midnight by the way). They also work very slow, so don't expect quick efficient cleanup of tables and turnaround; I took 90 minutes to finish my meal, and I was only a table of  two.

One issue I found with the menu is they don't have an immediate English translation. I assume you have to ask for it, but not every single Asian can read Chinese, let alone simplified Chinese. Good thing my dad does so I just took his word on what's good or not.

The hot pots are individual sized, which I like cause it prevents spillage of soup to the other side. The broth was also flavourful throughout the whole duration even after water was added. Some items I enjoyed include the octopus, pork, lamb, cheese meatballs (yes they have that), beef tripe, and pork balls. A major item that disappointed me was the beef; even if you dip it in the hot pot for 5 seconds the meat goes too hard and tough, and I agree with Cherie F. that there simply isn't enough fat in the beef.

The ice cream was standard; nothing to write home about but good enough to balance the salt-sugar content.

I won't bother much with this place unless I don't wanna venture into Richmond Hill for good hot pot. Although winter is coming, which means expect a lot more hot pot visits."
3,"My boyfriend and I went because we we're craving good fried chicken and wanted to try something new. The atmosphere was nicely decorated and the waitress was knowledgeable and friendly. I ordered Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles which  came with 3 pieces of thighs and 2 waffles. The waffles were awesome, the best I have ever had. The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside, but lacked seasoning and flavor. The combo is not something I would order again simply because the sweet syrup does not taste good with fried chicken so for me, chicken or waffles, but not together. My man ordered chicken smothered in gravy, dirty rice and mashed potatoes with gravy. Very spicy gravy and rice, but very good flavors. It was a Wed nite and we did not know it is a comedy club nite. People flooded the place so our service was slow and my food did not arrive hot. We waited an hour to get our bill and a go box, then another 20 minutes to check out."
3,"It's a very spacious saloon with lots of TVs.  Probably a good place to watch the games on Sunday.  I've been in several times for takeout.  Service is always good.  Food quality is below-average, (not terrible, but just not up to the level of the typical pub grub).  Wings and onion rings are great.  They do have a punch card program that gets you a free meal after buying 4."
3,"I usually love coming here with my family for their large paper masala dosa. Unfortunately this time it was much smaller, like half the size than what we usually get. It was also very flat when usually its round and puffed. The main thing we didn't like this time is that it had a weird texture, as if the mixture wasn't blended properly before cooking. Other than that, the garlic naan and butter chicken are always good. I would highly recommend getting shrimp 65 for appetizers, it's really spicy and flavourful! Overall this place is nice to come to once in a while, but I have to say it's way too overpriced for the portions they give."
3,"Full Disclaimer for starters my exposure to Latin American food is limited so I am going to base this review on the taste profile I like as oppose to what they are supposed to be.
This was a planned trip so we had reserved seats in advance for a Friday (recommended as I saw a few people being turned away when we were heading out). I had gone through the menu beforehand and still wasn't sure what to order when we got there. The latino street party tasting option looked enticing as one would pay the same amount. However we had to skip as my other dinning companions (DC) are picky eaters.
I had the tasting of ceviches which for some inexplicable reason had a shrimp taco as well. The tuna ceviche was decent, the hamachi was ho hum, the shrimp taco was middling. I expect a lot of tang and burst of flavors on ceviche which were there however the hamachi didn't have the fresh flavor one craves (maybe cured too long?) 
On to the mains I went with a chaufa and DC's ordered the miso cod with dashi broth. I ordered a margerita as well which is OK.
I didn't know what to expect from chaufa. I am pleased to report it was better than I expected. Served in a piping hot bowl (bibimbap style) that started to cook the rice to a nice crisp and added texture. The medley of meat and vegetables was well balanced. My DC's enjoyed this dish as well. This is a large serving so can even be shared by two. 
Miso Cod hmm I did try this dish and wasn't impressed at all. Devoid of seasoning was unexpected as well. DC's commented on being overly salty at the end. Dashi broth didn't add much to this dish IMO. 
The presentation is nice for all dishes and is in line with the food that is offered in the the entertainment district (with price to match I should add) 
Will I visit again not sure at this price point there are plenty of other options IMO."
3,"Decided to try Mayworths tonight for dinner. We were seated right away and the server was quick to take our drink order. We started with one of the advertised Happy Hour appetizers, soft pretzels with pimento cheese dip & honey mustard. It took awhile to arrive. The pretzel pieces were room temp around the edge of the plate and only a few warm pieces in the middle. We had to send the cheese dip back because it was cold. Our server picked the cup of cheese dip up off of the plate and took it to the kitchen. A film had formed on the top because it must have sat in the window awhile. The cook microwaved the heck out of the cheese, still in the plastic cup, and served it. 

We ordered shrimp tacos and a burger. I will say that the burger was cooked perfectly and the tots were the hottest part of the meal, not counting the renuked cheese dip.  The shrimp were over cooked and tough. They were served on double-layered corn tortillas, which were stale. The water, or the cups, had a funky flavor, almost like mildew. 

Not the worst place I've eaten, but not someplace I'm going to go back to anytime soon. There are lots of similar style restaurants in the area worth trying."
3,"Baro is a fabulous place for Sunday brunch. I was able to  change my reservations the same day online. It's very fancy and upscale along King Street West. 

I loved the decor of this place. Clean wooden tables and chairs. The choice of brown manus complement each other well. The tables had centre pieces of white and purple lilies which was so beautiful and elegant. There were green plants all over which was appreciated for clean fresh air. I also liked the cleanliness of the washrooms. Music was your standard top 40. 

It's important to note that their brunch menu closes at 2:45pm. Our waitress was friendly and wished me a happy birthday because she saw it on the reservation details. That's nice customer service. She was very attentive. 

Prices are very affordable for brunch here. A good sized plate costs around $17 on average. I ordered a decaf coffee with almond milk and sugar. I got no sugar and had to follow up. It would have been nice to get sugar with my coffee the first time around. I also had a pitcher of sangria. Oh boy, this was a strong pitcher. I definitely paid for what I asked for. Nice and chilled, it was perfect for brunch. 

My main order was a side of yuca chips and chipotle mayo. I've never had yuca chips this way so it was interesting to eat. Yuca is a root vegetable similar to the family of sweet potatoes. It is grown in South America. It can be quite bland so flavouring is essential. It is mostly starchy. My main was the avocado toast. It only comes with one egg so clearly I ordered two eggs. It's only one slice of toast aka frono cultura as well. It was kind of small. Eggs only come poached well done or runny. This part of the dish was underwhelming. The avocado was like guacamole. It was tasty. The side salad was huge to say the least. It was an accompaniment of baby kale, arugula, spinach and lettuce: drizzled with walnuts. There was also a few slices of radish. It tasted alright. 

Overall, I'll probably visit this place again but order something different on the menu."
3,"Let me start by saying I really like Mayworth.  It has been a favorite.  The food is always great.  However, I often dine alone.  I was very angered the last time I went that the server assigned to my section walked by no less than three times, looking me straight in the eye each time.  While she co tinted to flirt with the table next to another server asked if ---- was helping me and proceeded to take my order.  The server who was supposed to be over my section stayed at the same table go guys for a solid 10 minutes, and then proceeded to roll her eyes when the other server asked her a question.  She never once so much as acknowledged me.  Needless to say I made certain to tip in cash that night to the server who ACTUALLY helped.  Ever since I feel like I get an attitude when I go in alone, and I always tip 30% or better.  It makes me less inclined to go to what was once a favorite spot for me."
3,"We went here last night for a last minute dinner. We were craving barbeque and its 5 miles away from our hotel. The food was pretty decent and the price. Onion blossom was pretty good and bbq pulled pork was so so. I wish they have a better barbeque sauce though. Serving size it is decent; you will get your moneys worth. Okay, thats the food part. Now, the service - SUCKS! I don't know if its just because it's a Friday night but I think the server should pay attention to their customer more. My review is fully based on the food quality and its price and it is a solid 3 stars. Customer service, I would've put a negative. Suggestion: If you like barbeque and you have a chance try Lucille's Barbeque."
3,"It's Chinese alright. 

I meant its alright Chinese. 

But must admit, it wasn't greasy. Nice, clean flavors. 

We had the 

(Entree) Honey Walnut Shrimp - Nothing exciting. Better than Panda, not as good as Chinese Restaurant in Chinatown (PhoKim Long is good). Came with good portioned white rice.

(Entree) Tofu Veggies - Good. Came with good portioned white rice. 

(Side) Veggie Roll (2) - Was ok. The norm, bean sprout, carrots. 

For the price we paid for different entree. We will try the Family Value which is a dollar more, but had more of the sides."
3,"Really had higher expectations for this place. I was originally going to give them a 2 star 'cause their service was just really a disappointment. 

I made reservations for a group of 9 during on a Saturday night when they had their anniversary promo (30% off promo). Our server lacked speaking English so it was quite difficult to communicate with him and sometimes the wrong order would come out. On top of that it was just really annoying when whenever we order a certain item (eg. 6 orders of watercress), the person bringing out the food would almost never bring out the how much of what we ordered. When we told them that we ordered 6, the person who brought it out just kept nodding his head and saying ""no no no"" and bring like 2 orders out. Maybe they didn't want us to waste food, which I totally understand but that just meant that we literally had to order every time our server came cause our table wanted more watercress LOL. 

The dessert, soft serve matcha or vanilla ice cream was the highlight of our dinner. It actually tasted really good. Not sure if it was suppose to be one per person but when I asked the server if I could have another one, he said yes. 

Overall, it's just really annoying. I don't know if I'll be back though. I think I would prefer going to a place where I can get up and pick and choose my own food."
3,Chicken kinda dry and plain.  Waffle okay and a little softer than I prefer.  Was super hungry and ate the whole 3 piece meal which filled me up.
3,"Clean and beautiful interior and friendly staff. The food was very good and the woman (who I'm assuming is the manager or owner) was very attentive. Although there were a few problems with our food (my mother's order came out wrong) overall, I was pleased with the experience."
3,"One of only a couple chinese restaurants this far north.  Unfortunately, they have raised their prices recently.  They were already high priced for chinese food but now they are in the unacceptable range.  

The quality of the food is average at best.  The egg rolls are big but mostly all cabbage inside and quite dry.  The beef with vegetables is very good with very tender beef.  Stingy with the white rice on carry out.  They even have the nerve to charge an extra $1 for brown rice!

For my money (and better food) travel just a little further north and go to China Joy."
3,Thought I'd give this cha cheng tang a try for dinner.  It's pretty big place no wait time when we went. service was great they have those devices a at the table to call waiter was very effective maybe because the place wasn't busy.  We had the garlic steam prawn in steamer and mince pork with vegetable rice.  Comes with daily soup a drink and  dessert so value is there. Portions where good taste was okay typical quality servers were very polite and nice more nice than typical I would say so that aspect was nice.
3,"One of my favorite places for pork bone soups, dumplings and pan cake with chives and eggs. Don't order anything else. Utensils can be dirty. Service can be slow. Don't expect friendly staff there. You get what you pay for !!!"
3,"I am kinda torn. I order the Bun Bo Hue and thought it was just OK. Not sure if it is because my few exposure to BBH is from dinners with my Vietnamese friends and families. I thought the broth was OK but lacked depth. 

Their fried chicken wings was also a bit odd - the fried wings were not seasoned. Instead, I had to dunk it into a sauce that was close to a Ranch Dressing. I never had anything like that before and thought it was just OK. 

However, given that the restaurant was packed with satisfied customers gives me the impression that this should be a 4 star restaurant. Maybe I should have ordered Pho as my reliable indicator. 

I think it is worth it for you to try. I will try this restaurant the next time I am in TO."
3,"I enjoy the happy hours specials, especially the pizza & beer. Restaurant is dimly lit and a little outdated looking, so nothing special on that front. If you are looking for an inexpensive dining experience that gets the job done (nothing above that), then this place is not bad."
3,"We are visiting here for many years. The quality of the food, is always good. However - year after year, the service quality goes down. Tonight - very few table was taken. There is no reason to wait 15-20 minutes before anyone will approach to say ""hello"". 
I is very ( very!) rare that we are not giving tip. Is services is not good - we give less - but we always tip. 
Tonight - we didn't gave any - it was ""just ignoring with no reason"""
3,"Dinner for friends birthday. Was a Wednesday, but the clientele was mostly retired folks. Initially seated in an area that was freezing but server graciously moved us to warmer seating area. Service was excellent!  Cashew chicken probably isn't the most adventurous order but was surprisingly bland. The chicken was plentiful and they accommodated my dislike of water chestnuts without fuss. Portions are large. The leftovers were expertly packaged and made for two small dinners after. I'd be likely to go back especially if they might modernize the decor to be more hip and sleek. Maybe should have tried the bar area?"
3,"Think this restaurant must be affiliated with Ming's Noodle at Kennedy and Passmore. 

Menu is same but here they have more options such as Peking duck, bbq pork, japanese ramen and bamboo basket steamed rice.

Variety is good and decor is more spacious and modern than Mings. 

However, dishes are about $1 or $2 more than Ming's.  And service not as good.  Food came fast but waitresses not as friendly.

One plus is we got sweet taro tapioca for dessert.  Nicer of all the HK diners in the area but will likely stick to Congee Queen or Oriental Gourmet next door."
3,"I used to come here a while ago, and it was great, now it seems almost as if everything is rushed, I got the wrong order 2 times, which is very unfortunate, however, my wages had enough time to tell me that what I got is what I ordered knowing IM allergic to seafood, and I had shrimp on my plate, was a high concern, I don't know when I will be returning"
3,To be perfectly honest I've not found that much of a difference between the 4-5 pho places in Toronto in terms of the food. I guess its one of those things that most vietnamese restaurants can't get wrong. Either that or I can't tell the difference. The restaurant is located right at the end of a strip mall and isn't too fancy. I'd say its decent for how cheap the food is here. About 6-7 for a medium bowl of pho. I haven't tried any of the other food here but going by the pho I don't think it should be too long. Also like most vietnamese restaurants it has a loooonnnnggggg menu. Around 500 items IIRC and you have to write down what you want on the little note pad on the table and hand it to the waitress. Service has been consistently decent and is a nice place to eat for cheap. Especially good on a cold night.
3,"This location has probably been the most unsuccessful locations for any restaurants. It has change so many times I probably haven't been to half of what it were. But now that it's a HK style cafe, and seems to have quite the business, I thought I would give it a try. 

To be honest it is pretty average for a HK style cafe. Very typical food offered but they do have things that are really random. They offer the typical HK style breakfasts like macaroni, toast, instant noodles, etc. They also have congee and rice dishes, even poutine! (Some of the cheese curds were kinda rubbery but it's not bad) 

Price-wise it was decent, nothing out of the ordinary pricing for these kinds of food. They have a lot of space and a lot of staff so there always a seat and quick service. There is also free newspaper for customers to take home!"
3,"I was a little concerned about the washroom reviews, as I desperately had to use the bathroom when driving there. They weren't nice but I've seen worse. 

I ordered the pork dumplings. $5.99 for 14 very large dumplings! They took awhile to prepare but the waitress brought me complimentary Kimchi and something else, they both were great. The dumplings themselves were good. Very filling and my bill was $6.77 plus tip."
3,"Pretty solid tapas place.  very modern elegant casual style decor.  service was excellent.  craft cocktails were a highlight.  we tried a bunch of different dishes.  the pulpo was a highlight.  I wish the menu was a little more straightforward in describing the dishes.  for example, if the menu described the OG DUCK CHAUFA as what it was which was essentially fried rice with shreds of duck in it, I wouldn't have been so disappointed when it came out.  all in all a pretty positive experience, but a bit underwhelming given this restaurants position on various ""top restaurants in toronto"" lists"
3,Good basic Asian food. Dining room needs renovation as it's been 20 years since. No frills nothing fancy good takeout. Solid food.
3,"Dumplings are alright for the price. I would come back here for their dumplings and kimchi fried rice. 

The men's washroom entrance is at the back, down the stairs. One stall and one urinal. Washrooms are clean from what I've seen so far. 

Didn't like the cold noodle because I like my food at least warm. The fried green onion pancake is too filling. Stick to the assorted dumplings and you'll enjoy your meal.

Update: Tried out their beef brisket wrapped in pancake and found it filling and tasty

Service can be slow at times. If you want speedy service, call in for take out! :)"
3,"The small town of Cramerton has a couple of eating places. This has been opened for a year, friendly staff, so so menu. The Pimento Cheese dip was decent.  Not spectacular. I had the Jamaican Ribeye, MR, my husband had the burger, medium.  Both were very undercooked. Bake potato was cold.
 Seasoning on the Ribeye was interesting. My steak was rare, cool to touch, and poor quality. A Ribeye should not have excessive gristle throughout. 
Having said that, this is a neat gathering place for friends and couples wanting an evening out without a bunch of riff raff.  I would stick to the standard bar food and forgo the dinner menu."
3,"My husband grew up in Kerala, so we're always lookin' to score some tasty South Indian bites. We found Karaikudi online and made the voyage based upon the promise of nandu masala (crab curry), one of our favorites. When we arrived, we found the restaurant to be actually quite far on the outskirts of Toronto. It is in kind of a weird, largely unoccupied shopping complex. When you go inside, you find that it feels a lot like a traditional South Indian restaurant. The buffet had lots of South Indian morsels, so we decided against the nandu masala that we'd planned on. Instead, we had chai, veda with sambar, Chicken 65, avial, shrimp fry, really nice dosa, payasam and several other curries. The service was inconsistent. The food was okay. I'll agree with Ray that it was solid. We just keep looking for South Indian food that is better than the foods we make at home, or that my mother-in-law prepares. The quest continues. At $9.99 per buffet, this was a lot of food for lunch. With a buffet waiting for diners, it is a shame that you must make multiple requests for dosa (served fresh, not on the buffet), water, and chai. Not sure what keeps the waiters so busy with the buffet going on. The dosa were really good and actually better than those served at Udupi Palace on Gerrard."
3,"If you are expecting great service, this the wrong place for you but, if you want great tasting food, this is the place you want to be..
The rating I gave might be a little low for the quality of food they give there, but good service makes a big difference for me..."
3,"Decent enough little Asian place, food was okay, ambiance was good, like China meets Arizona."
3,"We have been to Sierra Gold several times over the past couple of years. The most recent visit was on this past Friday, during Happy Hour (which is always the happiest hour of a Friday!). I was happy to find out happy hour does not end until 7 pm at Sierra Gold (some places end too early!). To my understanding, in order to receive the half-priced drinks & appetizers, you must be a ""Beers & Bites"" card holder (which is free to enroll and provides other positive benefits too!). We ordered two rounds of drinks, one of which included their ""Prickly Pear"" beverage; the ingredients listed all sounded good enough to quench our thirst, but the end result was a little too ""thick"" for our liking and while the mixture was good, the consistency did not quench anything. We also ordered their popcorn chicken with twister fries (which are always fun!) and a thin pizza (which I believe was the only half-priced appetizer offered). So in conclusion (1) I believe they need to revisit their ""Prickly Pear"" recipe, and (2) they need to consider adding more half-priced appetizers to their happy hour menu, oh and (3) is it necessary to charge $0.50 for an extra sauce (for the popcorn chicken?). The waitress was attentive and the service was good, so we will probably return again and try their other menu options."
3,"This is quintessential American Chinese food. I realized that after not stepping foot into the restaurant for 12 years nothing had changed. I felt like I was in an old folks home for Chinese food. Don't get me wrong I love Americanized Chinese food, but this food just was okay. The hot and sour soup was great as it was both hot and sour with a large dose of spicy and the sesame chicken was good. Really I'd rather stay home drink some Miller lite and order Chang jang."
3,"I'm reviewing this from the perspective that I wanted something quick and cheap...

and this place is descent.  The prices are cheap and they have a large menu.  I tried their breakfast special (satay noodles, eggs sandwich, and hot milk tea) and it was okay.  I felt the beef texture was a bit tough.  

But service was quick ... we were in and out of there in 45 mins.  

This is the place to go if you want something quick or a late night snack."
3,"First time here for dinner with family of ten, it is a big place that i can bring my baby stroller in.

There have 36 dishes to choose from for $8.25+.

The portion of the dish surprisingly large that still can pack up."
3,Food is good but I feel the menu is too limited. Needs to be changed-up every 6-9 months.
3,Theyre fast and they have decent prices for their lunch menu.  My issue is the customer service.  They need to stop assuming that just because Im ordering from the same business doesnt mean Im the same person. Listen and slow down I'm not effin Barbara for the millionth time.
3,"Half turkey, half chili soup. Wasn't asked what bread I wanted and came w roll. They were ok and a quick meal. If have more time would recommend Grand Cafe's salmon and baked potato, which is memorable!"
3,"My family and I met some friends her a month or so ago. Doffer's was closed so we gave this a try. I've driven past it multiple times when in the area so you could say that I was pretty curious. It was good. Not great, but not bad, either. Definitely a solid good. The menu was varied but there wasn't much on it that was terribly interesting or unique. I tried the Sloppy Joseph, a more ""sophisticated"" version of a sloppy joe. It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't mind blowing, either. One think I really did like was that the kids menu had some nice options on it, including salmon. My little one loves seafood and this was a welcome find. The service was adequate but very, very slow. It took a long time to get refills, drinks, food, and the bill. I'd eat there again if I was in the area and other nearby places were busy or closed, but I wouldn't make the trip to Cramerton for it."
3,"Came by after the UNLV game and the place is not too shabby.  The location on Warm Springs makes it a convenient place to drop into if you're in the area, not too busy.  The setting is nice enough, attractive, but not overly pretentious.  The food is OK, I had the flat-iron special for $10.  The meat was chewy, not the best cut, but not too bad either for the price.  The pizza was also OK, would have liked more topping and less sauce to go with it.  They have a nice selection of brews though, I had a blue-moon like smaller name deal.  The service was alright - I don't mind the no-nonsense, tough, but sort of friendly attitude, although my friends didn't appreciate it."
3,"We have tried this place once. The food is good but could be better. Don't get me wrong, I would still recommend folks to try this place at least once and judge if they like it or not. My opinion is that I have had better South Indian food back in the States. Hence I am taking away 2 stars."
3,"Took the car in on Monday. TJ looked it over and found it was a bit low in fluid. Unfortunately, that did not fix the problem. I will have to follow up with them again."
3,"Not a bad place to be honest.
Food is decent and service is okay.
We received a free newspaper so that's pretty nice"
3,Not a bad spot to get grub. Service was good. Menu selection is the typical Capriotti's getup. New location so not very busy. It is right next to a ton of shops and other restaurants. All and all it was a chill vibe.
3,"This is an unbiased opinion.  Some of the tenants complain.  The property management company is  okay.  Some of the tenants are young and have problems.  Some of them may never have been on their own for the first time or come from impoverished households or they think the building is a hotel. They litter and leave trash everywhere.  They can't even buy trash bags. They literally throw trash around the buildings. They don't pick up after their dogs.  Few choose to play loud music at all hours.  The building isn't the best quality but its newer.   Its the problem that plagues all countries.  People can be given nice homes. But if they didn't grow up in nice homes, they don't know what to do with it and trash it.  I suppose its the same with the rich. They are so used to people picking up after them, they will trash it.  But the rich people are willing to pay for services. The property doesn't have a staff dedicated to pick up trash left outside the units.  The property isn't a hotel or a resort. 

People who grow up in impoverished homes refuse to take care of them or pay others to take care of them.  Some clown thought it is cool to leave trash on the front doors of other people. Or tenants will entertain friends and the friends will leave trash outside the unit. The few rotten apples do really ruin it for the rest of the tenants. There are dumpster divers.  Its a gated community.  I have been living in this street for 2 years and no break in has occurred."
3,"I like this tiny little space. I was quite surprised by the stylish decor and the care put into making this space look unique and special. I thought it would be a hole-in-the-wall but it is quite charming. Even the bathroom has stylish modern fixtures that put a smile on my face- felt like a fancy hotel. Nice touch!  

Anyway, the food: I LOVE the won ton soup. It's jam-packed with noodles, meat, shrimp and surprises. It's tasty and filling and wonderful.  I also love their seafood combination entree, which is made with a light garlic sauce.  I usually order these for delivery in Summerlin,   At the restaurant I had their egg-drop soup, which I enjoyed (I don't remember egg-drop having corn kernels like this one does).  The service was great.

I have to mention, in all fairness, that they aren't consistent in their delivery. Sometimes they leave out the rice or the fried won tons. I pretty much expect something to be forgotten when I order from them these days, which is not a good thing. Still, I have to give a shout-out to the delivery guy. So friendly!  I don't want to stop ordering from them because they haven't actually messed up an order, but when you can expect minor errors, you have to start considering getting your carry-out from somewhere else.


Another thing I have to say: it is pricey.  They could stand to lower the prices for their soups and entrees by at least a couple of bucks. But I'll still come here- I'd just come more often if it were cheaper."
3,"What?!  I didn't review this place yet??? 

The cold noodle dish topped with meat, veg, and egg, with sesame paste and garlic is totally home-y.  We also like to order the julienned cold potato dish.  

The best steamed dumpling is the one with pork, chives, and shrimp. 

The pan fried dumplings are very good.  So are the chive pockets.  

We don't usually order the Korean food here because the aforementioned dishes can easily feed 4-6 people.  We never leave this restaurant empty-handed.  I don't mind leftovers at all.  :)

Don't use the washrooms."
3,"I wanted to take my mom out for lunch and assumed she'd like Indian food best as it was the closest to the way she makes her own food - familiarity is her comfort. 
It's a great atmosphere overall and I love the interior so 5/5 for looks of the restaurant. 
The food I'd say was a hit or a miss. They have both Indian and Chinese food there, the Chinese food is Indian style, more spices and aroma. I really recommend the fried rice, but the chicken chilli with gravy that we ordered to accompany was crazy salty. I'd stay away from that if I were to come again. 
We got the ghee masala dosa, it was huge and we loved it. Very crispy, mostly tasted ghee rather than masala. The chicken lollipops were excellent but the onion pakoras I'll pass on next time. The garlic naan was memorable, soft and buttery and I wish I could come here just to take it out all the time. 
Overall the food was more bland than I expected (or TOO salty) but I think they want to cater to those who aren't used to a lot of spices and I get that. 
Will come back with my friends for them to try something new that they can handle lol."
3,Food is fine.....but much better when you go to the restaurant outside of the airport. The chicken is sometimes a little burnt and they just aren't very consistent with the quality here. BUT if you get them on a good day....it's great.
3,"Came here for a friend's wedding reception, marking my first time here in the 5 years in Madison. My department holds its yearly reception here, so I've always been curious how it is like. On the other hand I have heard it's an American-Asian food place, which explains my hesitance to try it out. So the wedding reception was a great opportunity.

I would say all my friends were right. Imperial Garden is a mix between authentic chinese food and american chinese food. The peking duck and the appetizer platter were my favorite. The appetizer platter (serves 4) consisted of Egg rolls, grilled pot stickers, bbq pork, crispy shrimp and calamari. Pot stickers were nicely made and flavorful, calamari is also crispy *yums* Shrimps are lightly breaded and very tasty, could taste how fresh they are. 

The Peking Duck is also super awesome. Note that you have to order the duck a day in advance. It's a whole duck specially prepared and served in three courses, of which the crispy duck skin with mandarin pancakes is my favorite. Super authentic! You can ask for more pancakes with the dish, yes it is this good! 

Other dishes we tried include the usual general tso chicken, mongolian pork, stir fry noodles. Those are delicious, but in my opinion those are pretty common in chinese restaurants. I would recommend Imperial Garden for special occasions (the restaurant is roomy and nice to accommodate large groups). Order their specialty dishes, they are worth it."
3,"I Like it here, some pros and cons of it are:
Pros:
- close to campus
- shuttle that drives you back and forth
- nice pool
- management is pretty good, and will work with you
- management team is friendly 
- live with college students
- keep the complex up-kept for the most part and organized 
Cons:
- don't ask management to address a problem you're having with your roommates (who are usually complete strangers) because they usually won't
- the rooms are dirty and need updating
- maintenance team is pretty bad at actually fixing things, had to ask 3 times for them to fix and air and dishwasher, both are still broken. 
-  this is no longer student living, there are students but a lot have left and now they let in anyone, including drug dealers
- sketchy part of town
- expensive ($600) for a room, and usually they will find a way to charge you more money rather $75 late fee, $10/mo parking pass and $10/mo ""insurance"" or $90 for broken curtains,  they will try to find a way"
3,"Just an update to say they don't even have the #1 spot anymore as that goes pretty easily to Ichiban on park.  Still, better than most in town."
3,"Gave the place a chance and I have to agree, over priced mediocre food. I should have known any Chinese place with Phat Thai is not going to be authentic. Won Ton soup, said no shrimp or veggies, BBQ pork and chicken. I got a container of all mushy won tons and no meat. Had to call and have them bring my rice. It was nice eating cold food cause you can't remember the rice? That was $89 poorly spent! Glad I live in LA cause so far the only decent Chinese is in the expensive hotels!"
3,I come here pretty often for breakfast or when I'm craving some cheap chinese breakfast foods like macaroni in soup because they have an all day breakfast menu for ~$7! The food here is pretty cheap for the most part because they have a lot of combo deals. The restaurant is really big so for the most part you won't have to wait EXCEPT during breakfast on the weekends where it can get really busy.
3,The food is delicious. Best Pho in the city. I've been coming to this restaurant for over 15 years. Prepare your self for no service what so ever.
3,"Was a regular customer at Center Street and was very sad to see it close.  When we saw that Mayworth was opening, we were very excited.  We've eaten here several times.  The food is ok but the atmosphere doesn't have the same welcoming feeling that Center Street had.  Plus we went to Center Street for brunch after church almost every Sunday because it was so affordable. 

I hope they change up the menu and run their brunch longer on Sundays.  The Sunday Brunch crowd is a very important crowd and it seems that Mayworth isn't interested in this."
3,"I was so hungry when I got off my plane at the Phoenix Airport that I immediately scoured the area for something to eat.  I stumbled upon this place for chicken, waffles, fried okra and sweet tea!  The chicken hit the spot and I loved the sweet tea!  The waffle was not so crispy and not too flavorful but forgivable.  The okra was not so flavorful either; it needed some dipping sauce.  Maybe that is what I was missing.  Either way, I was still pretty happy.  Either that or I was happy because I was so hungry.  I didn't have time to stop by before my return flight and I was a little sad...oh well, next time then!"
3,"This brand new pop up may need a few more menu items. The atmosphere is cute, comfortable, great for catching up with friends. The crab cake medium plate was absolutely on point delicious. Highly recommend, good flavored. But as for the main course, there just aren't many options.. Finally settled on the farro risotto, which I should have known what I was getting into, farro is a grittier & bigger grain. Not that great. Friend got the fried chicken and she licked the plate! I would recommend this place for the atmosphere and small plates."
3,"Average food.  Good service.  Not FD, but most Chinese food is generally delicious.  I would not go out of my way to eat there, but it would be a place to go now and again.

Room for large parties and family get togethers."
3,"Very disappointed in this establishment the last two weeks. We come here every Sunday to have drinks, watch football and hang out with our favorite person Ms. Mary (who is amazing and loveable) However they are unable to split the sound on the patio so we can listen to the game...instead it's on baseball. I understand you need to please the crowd but as loyal locals who spend money weekly it's a let down. Luckily mary said they play football on Mondays so...maybe we will have to start doing that instead (the stars are for Mary)"
3,"Great service, good atmosphere. Wings were awesome, but the cooks need to realize grilled chicken needs seasoning. Had the heater chicken sandwich and it was super bland. The ""Siracha mayo"" wasn't spicy, and the chicken tasted like nothing. I'd probably go back, but be more careful of my choices."
3,"Our go to place, serve is quick but typical of Asian places not nice but they get you what you need. Food is authentic but their table tops are sometime sticky and sometimes have the wet towel smell, makes you feel icky. we go here because there are no better places. Prices were good before but they keep rising every few months it seems."
3,"I have been here on a few occasion prior, but decided to write a review about this place. Got here for lunch with my Dad, and ordered their #1 and #2 for dumplings steam. First one was their standard pork, cabbage and other stuff in it. Second one had shrimp, chive, egg and other stuff. Between the both of them, I prefer the shrimp one for sure. Both dumplings had juices pouring out when I bit into it, so it was enjoyable moist dumplings. 

Also ordered the pot sticker chive one with pork that came with 5 pcs for $3.99. This one is tasty, but I prefer the one at Dumpling King for sure. I also prefer the chili sauce that's offered at DK!

Our last order was a noodle dish that represents Shanghai noodles, but this one was a miss. Did not taste that good, and was quite boring and bland to look and taste. Bill total to $26 before tips.

I guess I would come back here just for dumplings, but that's probably it."
3,Great place to grab some Chinese grub in far north valley. Good service and reliably tasty cuisine.
3,"Recently opened, so everything is nice and new. The menu is pretty extensive, but for the most part it is your typical bar food. Maybe a little better. Try the Flamin' Hot Cheetos onion rings...Yes, you read that right...Tasty.  Pretty much your standard PT's crowd, with a few strange ones...I think there must have been a tailgate party going on in the parking lot, because people kept coming in with red plastic cups...Could'nt figure that one out. I'll go back I'm sure, but that because its close to my house. :) Wait staff was very friendly, and the bartenders were on top of things."
3,This place is dead during football season. All their competitors are running happy hour specials so everyone else seems to go elsewhere. They raise their prices during football games. The only reason I even come it's because I'm guaranteed a seat and they change the TV to whatever game I want. Or if I come early enough I can get the breakfast special before the game starts. Its only good to come here during the NFL if you like to be a loner . Good for loners but dumb for Sierra gold.
3,"I've recently moved to the area and have been taking my Mazda here. I have felt fine about my experiences here.

My first trip to Cardinale Way Mazda was actually when my car broke down the day before my first day of work. Needless to say, I was very stressed and the employees at Cardinale Way were very nice and patient. Steve helped me figure out what to do over the phone and then let me know what was wrong with my car and what my options were once I was there. One thing to note is they don't provide rental cars. I'm not sure if equivalent dealerships do generally or if that is more of an upscale car thing but anyways, you have to pay for the rental car.

Since that trip I've brought my car in for service where they fixed a small issue I was having but didn't end up having to do much.

Overall, the staff there is very polite, but I at times felt a bit like they were ""car salesmen"" not to reinforce a stereotype. They just spoke to me a bit as if they were trying to sell me something, but when I looked at what I was paying and what I was receiving I felt okay. I will definitely continue bringing my car here!"
3,"Been to other AYCE hot pot places before and I can say this one goes to my favorites. Our friends got a table pretty quickly so we dont have to wait.

I agree on the posts here that there are hidden $$ for your soup base. I love that theres a lot of ingredients to choose from however you have to asked multiple times to get a good quantity of food.

Might not personally come back unless friends invite us."
3,Pretty good. Had the curry chicken.... Was pretty enjoyable but fried rice wasn't to die for. I got delivery and it was super quick. No complaints this time :)
3,"This is a rather less upscale restaurant but I can't complain much because you get your bang for the buck. Decent tasting food (in regards to both their Shanghai and Korean cuisines) for a considerably cheap price! I normally order one Korean pork bone soup because the meat is just so tender and the portion is very filling. The vegetable dumplings are also nice as you get 14 per order and the skin is thin. 

I wouldn't bring anyone here to impress them but I would definitely come with family for a cheap and filling meal."
3,"There are a few China Tangos around town and I recently relocated closer to this location. Unfortunately, it's not as great tasting as the Green Valley restaurant, but it's good enough to visit again and again when in the mood for Chinese. 

We really like the fried wontons, sesame chicken, and combination chow mein. We've yet to try anything else here in our last two visits."
3,"My friends came to Las Vegas and wanted to eat here for lunch. She said that there is only 1 CAPRIOTTI'S in CA (where shes from), which is located in Beverly Hills. Luckily, theres Caps all over town in LV. This gave me the perfect opportunity to try out their Bobbie.

I never had a traditional "" Thanksgiving..in your mouth.."" type of sandwich before, so I didn't know what to expect. This cold sub had layers of home-made turkey meat, sweet cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo spread. 

-I'm never a big fan of cold subs.
-My family doesn't have turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce during Thanksgiving. So I guess I didn't know how to appreciate the sub.
-The combination of cold turkey, sweet cranberry sauce, cold soft/soggy stuffing..was just okay. I wasn't wowed or felt like I tasted a bit of heaven or anything.

I think this sub is suited for someone else that knows how to appreciate traditional American Thanksgiving. Everyone I know says this sub is really good. Its just too bad it wasn't for me."
3,"I came here with my family as they had advertised in the Chinese newspaper for some set Peking duck meals that includes soup and dessert. We wanted to try it out for lunch and had called ahead to make sure we're able to get that meal for lunch. They took a reservation for us and confirmed that we are able to do as we wish.

We came here for lunch on a Saturday of Chinese New Year and the restaurant was about 2/3 full, but they had ample staff there, I'm not sure if this is a normal thing or they had anticipated that it would be super busy.

We wanted to add a few more dishes and had asked for a server's suggestion, she suggested the best bang for our buck and ones that would be more suitable for my grandfather. We got a steamed lotus leaf fried rice with shrimp and I really enjoyed that one. The Hong Kong style milk tea was also great.

The Peking duck was ok, it wasn't as crispy as I have had it from other places. We were also served a whole fish, a soup, a seafood vegetable dish and noodle soup and they were also acceptable. At the end of our meal, we were waiting for our desserts, but we were told they only have dessert at dinner, but we had called about this meal and they said they're able to serve it at lunch and no where in the advertisement did it say dinner only. We were given some sort of kids' mango yoghurt dessert as a replacement, better than nothing I guess.

I am however, a bit confused as to what kind of restaurant to classify this, because my family had a 5-course Peking duck meal, something you usually get from a Chinese restaurant, but most of the menu, and the decor suggests a Hong Kong style cafe. Confusion aside, there's an array of items on the menu that will probably take you long to decide. Variety is the spice of life and if you're with a group of people who can't decide on one kind of food to eat, this would be great place to take them."
3,"Dumplings here are good but service is not so great. We waited for about 5-10 mins to get seated. There'es about 4 tables that were present at the time we got there. 

Our server seated us at a dirty table and quickly removed all utensils and plates. She quickly wipes our table with a wet rag leaving tons of water marks on our table. I was turned off by it and was not looking forward to eat there. Server was cleaning up other tables and we saw her handling money. She would go to the kitchen and pick up food without washing her hands. 

Food came and it was good. Ordered skewers and dumplings and it was tasty. Because I didn't think this place is clean/sanitary, maybe I didn't enjoy it as much as I would like to. 

Will I go back again? Maybe if I run out of options.

They only accept cash."
3,The only place i believe in north york with late night hours. If you're hungry and looking for a place to eat at night this is the place you should go to. Its very affordable and fast. The Pho is very decent and lots of great variety of Vietnamese Cusine.
3,"Great atmosphere. Classy bar, if bars could be classy. Drink menu sucks. Nothing is made fresh. Water is tap, straight from their sink. Gross. Ordered Island Girl from the drink menu. Horrible, it made me feel like I was at sleazy night club. Husband ordered Angry Balls, which just tasted like watered down fireball. 
Really liked the look of this place in the inside. Just wish I could have gotten a good tasting drink. Oh, prices are good too."
3,"I typically hate eating at chain restaurants like this, but after striking out at so many other places closed for the holiday yesterday, we ended up here because it was the only place besides Applebee's that was open.  Obvioulsy, my expectations were low.  

The overall experience was surprisingly good though!  We didn't have to wait for a table even though the parking lot was very full.  The food was way better than I expected too.  And most surprisingly, the prices were great!  My husband got some kind of smokehouse burger, which he said was one of the best he's had in a long time, and it was only $8.50!   We would have easily paid 25% more for it without even thinking twice.  I had the smallest (and cheapest) steak on the menu, which was a 6 oz sirloin, with a baked potato and salad.  Everything was well prepared and fresh, and it was a lot of food for $10.  They also give you unlimited dinner rolls and buckets of peanuts, so there is no way you are leaving hungry.  My husband especially liked the set-up they have where the hostess grabs the basket of warm rolls from the kitchen window as she takes you to your seat so there is no waiting.  The beer wasn't overpriced either.

I know it seems like 3 stars is stingy for all the gushing I'm doing, but I pretty much expect every chain restaurant to be a 2 star experience, so 3 stars is good!  To put it in perspective:  I will never request that we eat here again, but if I'm in a situation where I'm obligated to go, I won't be mad."
3,"We came in for early lunch, seem they were packed for breakfast since there were alot of tables waiting for clean up. Anyways, they sit us down and we ordered. They have few menus put on the tables but somehow they are duplicate menu that printed n looks different but the content are the same. 
The price seems above average however after seeing the food and they comes in a good potions so thats ok. The food came pretty quick and it taste right."
3,"Three stars = A-OK.  It was fine.  It wasn't great.  This place has been here for about 30 years.  Before that it was a car wash.  I always think of it as the place that used to be a carwash.
Anyway.  Went with a group of 15.  Mom was buying and we got the ""Classic"" banquet (the cheapest one).  It was more food than we could eat.  The food was fine.  Not awesome.  The best flavor was hoisin sauce and, well, that comes out of a jar.
We got a sesame chicken that had nicely deepfried chicken chunks in a citrus-y sweet sauce.  Some trout that my sister insisted on and really enjoys (not my thing, but everyone else liked it).  Mu-shu pork - it was good.  Delightful (?) beef, kinda bland, but nothing yucky in it.  Aaaannd, oh yeah, crispy duck.  Very crispy, as in dry.  Not so great.
The kids got those finger trap toys with their fortune cookies.  The waitress was cheerful, accomodating and informative.  Extra help came out when needed."
3,"I come here very often because of  the delicious Butter Chicken and Fresh Naan, and the normally great service. 

Recently the dinner service here is a bit slow and disorganized. Seems a bit understaffed on the floor, but a couple newer servers are disorganized and perhaps better suited in non customer facing jobs. At least not the service field. 

I came for dinner with a friend...twice... Praising this place on great food and service. But was disappointed he didn't get to witness that.  Our entrées were brought to the table 20 mins apart - so he ate cold food once mine finally arrived. Both times lol (not funny tho)
An item we ordered never arrived at all, but wasn't billed so we didn't bother mentioning when we paid. 

New server squirted water on our food while spraying an empty table beside ours. And each time we inquired on our missing food items - she would ask ""oh did you order it"".   Ummm NO, we sent telepathic messages to the food and hoped it would come on its own!!! REALLY? But she never offered TO CHECK ON THE ITEM FOR US  ...hellloooooo geeez

Finally mentioned to a manager (owner?) who was going to check, until the cashier said she would...but then she never did. [Scratches head!]

I still love this place and hope they work out the training issues with floor staff. They do have a couple really terrific servers - who work their butts off, try to spot them and sit in their area if u eat here in the near future 

Hope mgt reads this and improves the weak areas. 
Because I love the food."
3,"Great for airport food, but not quite up to the regular Lo-lo's standard."
3,"Chinese food from your parents generation and service that would make a tortoise look like a rabbit this place is unbelievably typically rated the best Chinese food in Madison. Madison obviously is ok with what these guys are serving.  One sign of an authentic ethnic restaurant is the number of people of that culture eating there. Well the China Garden must be a damn good Wisconsin supper club based on the clientele.  That said, the fragrant chicken is good as is the orange beef."
3,"2.5 stars.

I got the original spicy soup base, asked for mild and was alarmed to see a thick THICK! film of chili oil. There was an abundance of peppercorn and chili bits floating in the soup base and I spent a long time picking them off my food. They should use a mesh ball to contain the spices, or strain the soup before serving. But to be fair, the selection of meats and vegetables was good and the food was fresh. Also, good presentation.   

Service was efficient enough, and perfunctory. I don't expect much more from an AYCE restaurant. I did expect to be able to write down our orders or better yet, use tablets, but there was just the server jotting everything down.  

Dessert was impressive - soft serve green tea (or vanilla) ice cream. On second thought, it was more the novelty of the idea that was impressive. One cone per customer, usually.  

At the end of the meal, my individual tab came to about $40 after taxes and tips. For this price and the amount of peppercorn I ingested, I don't think I'll be back any time soon."
3,"I was invited out for hotpot and since I don't get it that often I was delighted to go. We were going some place new near the TnT.   I am not sure what the name means,  perhaps it's an inside joke or something. 

At 41 years old I was the oldest person in the place.  Seriously,  oldest person and only white guy.  Talk about out of place!  Still if you want the best of any cuisine,  look for the one full of locals.  

Like everyone else we had to wait but with TnT next door we were able to get our grocery shopping done. 
We ended up waiting just over an hour. 

Once we were seated,  I was given the English menu. One commenter mentioned that as an issue.  It seems they have translated it. 

The decor is nice, lots of wood and clean lines.  Seats are large and ample and it is easy to walk through the restaurant,  which can sometimes be an issue. 

The soups were okay.  Could have used salt if you can believe it.  I ordered the herbal one.  The meat and veggies were excellent.  Fresh and plentiful.  The sauces could have been bigger though.  We all ordered the sesame sauce. 

All in all it wasn't bad,  but not really worth the wait. It was pricey with the bill being over $40 each. You can find comparable meal for less without the wait if you know where to go."
3,"This is an okay location that doesn't seem to get overly crowded. 

My first visit to this location was a few years ago and it seem like they've definitely made some improvements since that time. The bar is fairly large and we've never had a problem finding a seat in front of the gaming. There are plenty of tables set back a bit from the bar and a couple of games at the back. The bathrooms are clean as well.  The bartenders are pretty good and check in fairly often.

My mixed drinks have always been good. The food is standard bar food so not bad, but nothing notable either. The chicken fingers and boneless wings are standard fried food. The nachos are decent and the serving is huge, definitely enough for two to share."
3,"Had brunch with a friend here. I ordered the baked beef brisket and spaghetti in Portuguese sauce.

This is more or less my go to dish at these hk diner type places. I can't say it was the best one I've had but I can't say it was the worst. 

The meal comes with soup and a drink. I got the veggie soup and cold hk milk tea. 

The portions were pretty big. i forced myself to finish my meal and was absolutely stuffed. the pieces of beef brisket were huge, definitely not bite sized chunks. the Portuguese sauce also had potatoes and corn in it too. The spaghetti was cooked well.

Because it is close by, and the options for hk diners within the 10 or so minute radius from where i live are so limited, I'd come back."
3,"I am updating my old review to reflect the new management that has come in. At first, it seemed like an improvement, everyone is wearing white button up shirts. 

Problems: new crispy noodles are terrible, service seems to have gotten a bit worse, they messed up my order and were slow to refill water (never refilled).

The dish I normally order still tastes fine. Fix these issues and it will be back to 5 stars."
3,"My favourite part of this hot pot experience was the distinct flavour and tastes of the soup base. The soup base at Morals Village Hot Pot definitely were of a higher caliber than other hot pot restaurants. They import their ingredients for the soup base directly from Chongqing, China! No wonder the taste and flavouring was so strong and unique.  I really enjoyed the sliced lamb and beef as well since it was very fresh and sliced so thinly."
3,"This is another adventure based on positive Yelp reviews.  This restaurant has the most  unapologetic upfront English name.  Its speciality is dumpling, and it makes dumpling numerous ways, using nontraditional ingredients, such as zucchini and tomato.  Despite the name, it also makes noodle, rice and Korean cuisine.  

I ordered 1 dozen of pork and leek dumplings.  The dumplings tasted alright: the skin was thin and secured, the dumplings were fresh.  I didn't like that the pork inside seemed very loose.  The pork of the dumplings I have had before is packed together.

Service was efficient and friendly.  

The restaurant is hard to find; it is so hidden that I drove past the mall twice.  Inspite of this, customers kept coming in during my short 30-minute stay.

Overall, 3.5 stars."
3,"This review is in regards to ""maintenance requests"" ONLY.

Placed 4 different maintenance/service request one evening and the next day by the time I came home around 4pm all the work requests were done and corrected accordingly. I was actually impressed that they finished the work orders that next morning and that they were completed in a fast, timely manner. I say this because some of my other friends who live here say it takes them several days to a week to get work orders done."
3,"Everything here was average. The service, the food tasting, the price.. very typical hong kong style cafe in markham. Nothing stood out or seemed below average than other places.
They have a lot of variety in their menu though, way more than other hk style cafes."
3,"After all the food I ate at the CNE I still had room for more. I guess all that walking made me hungry. I had the beef tenderloin with white rice. The beef was slightly tough only and tasted great with the sweet sauce.

Service was fast, food was pretty good and price is very affordable. I hope this place is here to stay as its really convenient being so close to my parents home."
3,"Having gone to the Mississauga location, I wanted to try the Markham location to see if there was any difference. This interior was nicely designed, making the whole space very large and dark. Once you enter, there's someone at a booth waiting to bring you to your seat. 

We were seated at a table of 4, which has a little slit that separates the table beside which was also a table of 4. The seats were made so customers get their own pots. There was something weird about the stove as it was hard to adjust since it kept going really strong, however, after a while, it warms up. 

The food selection has quite a bit, however, you have to pay for the soups. There is no clean chicken soup like at other places. I tried the mushroom soup and also the tomato soup. The tomato soup was flavourful and had a strong tomato flavour. I would recommend this one. However, the mushroom soup wasn't very special. I couldn't taste much mushroom and it was too salty. 

The drinks like soy bean milk and sour plum juice also need to be ordered, they also have watermelon juice that is made fresh that's also very tasty.

Here, you order by telling the server and they input your selections onto an iPd. I would much rather they let you pick the items on an iPad yourself like at AYCE sushi places, or maybe have the food self-serve. I found it such a hassle trying to get the server's attention as most of them were busy. They didn't even refill my water until I asked them to twice. As well, you don't get to self-serve and mix your own sauces; you tell the server the kinds of sauces you want and they bring them to you in little bowls. I would prefer if I can make my own sauces as this was more work. They also didn't give spoons for the little bowls until we asked for them. The food was fresh, especially the meat like beef and lamb slices. If you like really spicy, I recommend the spicy beef balls, but other than that, the other balls weren't that good. Nothing really stood out to me in terms of the food options.

You order the fried mantous like you would with all the other food. Each table gets one soft serve vanilla ice cream cone which is cool. The ice cream wasn't very smooth but still a nice addition to hot pot. They also came on a cute little stand. 

Side note: the management of the staff in assigning tables to me that I received at the Mississauga location was quite negative, so the Markham location is better in that sense. 

Overall, the service was good and it was a decent experience, but I don't think there's anything too special that would Morals stand out and make me want to visit again."
3,"My husband and I are always looking for a great dumpling place and just had to come to give it a try.  

We ordered one order of assorted dumplings, the egg and chive pancake and kimchi fried rice. For us the real winner were the dumplings.

The dumplings were huge; huge doesn't even begin to describe it. 14 pieces of absolute goodness. Realllllly good!

The kimchi fried rice was a touch disappointing. I'm used to getting a fried egg on top of the rice and we didn't get that. Barely any kimchi mixed in and it came with shrimp when we had ordered it with pork. Wouldn't order this again. 

Egg and chive pancake, we were expecting better after reading those reviews. Ours was far too oily and tasteless. Big disappointment. 

At the end of the day, the place is called dumpling restaurant, the name says it all. It's signature food is dumplings, don't have any expectations for non-dumpling dishes."
3,"After reading the other reviews I was very leary to try this place.  But, a friend and I go out for lunch every other friday and it was her turn to choose.  She actually craves this place and is here once a week.  Her favorite is the Kung Pao chicken.  I looked over the menu and was disappointed to find the Moo Goo Gai Pan missing from the lunch specials.  I was also hoping to try one of the soups, but as soon as we sat down we were confronted with two bowels of Egg Flower soup and fried wontons.  The soup wasn't that bad-I did add about a tsp of light sodium soy sauce. I decided to order the Schezwan Chicken with half fried rice half steamed rice (I always order my rice this way in case its too greasy).  I was a litttle concered about how hot it was going to be.  If I think about the word 'schezwan' my nose starts to run!  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors.  It was a sweeter dish, but not overly so.  The chicken was breast meat and the veggies were green peppers, onions and mushrooms (love mushrooms!).  It was not hot at all-in fact next time I go I will ask them to kick it up a notch.  I love the combination of spicy and sweet.  The fried rice was what suprised me the most-not at all greasy and great flavor.

My lunch here was a satisfying experience for my belly.  I did not come for the ambience as we just sit and gab the whole time.  It got very busy around noon and it made it difficult to pay our check, but all in all it was a good lunch and I will be back!"
3,"I have a one-year lease with these apartments and I'd have to say, so far so good. You get what you pay for and I'm glad this place is near campus with a free shuttle for residents. Thy have an amazing pool, fitness center, study room, and they host events as well to make residents more familiar with each other. Before moving in, I talked with Geena about my questions and signing my lease and all that and she's always very entertaining and helpful.

For $541 a month (4-bed, 4-bath), I have my own bedroom, my own bathroom, my own walk-in closet, and the place is fully furnashed and appliances. The cost also includes gas, water, and parking space. The only separate bill we have to worry about is electricity. I feel that I have a more positive review because I had an idea of who my room mates were going to be (because we knew each other and so we got assigned in the same complex together) and that there has been a lot of major changes to improve this living complex. 

I would give this place a 5, but somehow Rebel Place got a mix up with one of our roomates, saying he cancelled his lease and put a random girl in our room. But at least they resolved the issue within the week and before move in date so we got our room mate back! Lol

I think Rebel Place is doing their best to make better changes for their residence, hence why I gave them 4-stars. Keep it up management!"
3,"2.5/5, +.5 for service

The long anticipated stall that used to be Toro Sushi has finally opened. After passing by this place at least 10 times a week, I finally saw the open sign lit on Tuesday. Since I was busy yesterday, I decided to wait until tonight to eat here. For 9pm, this place was ridiculously busy. However I assume it was full of people who wanted to try this place for the first time, so I'm not expecting the full seated load to last. 

The menu here is very extensive. There was your typical HK style cafe options, as well as dim sum. There are two featured items on the menu which are also advertised outside the restaurant along the wall facing Highway 7. I decided to try one of them, which was the Shanghai style beef noodle soup (forgot the exact term).

As we were waiting for our food, one of the employees gave us two 10% off cards, which are valid until January 31, 2015. The meal itself was also 10% off for their grand opening special.

The food took a good 15-20 minutes to come, however the iced lemon and iced milk teas both came rather quick. The milk tea here seems to be better than the lemon tea, as my dad found the milk tea to be good and I found the lemon tea to be mediocre. As for the noodle soup...it was also mediocre. Edible at least, but definitely not what I would say memorable.

There are a lot of other items in the menu that could be worth trying, but I'm gonna wait for other Yelpers to review this restaurant before considering coming back."
3,"This was my 3rd  visit to a Lo-Lo's in 4 days. This location is at the airport. I was totally disappointed. The food is not the same as at the other two locations.  Greens were not seasoned, I was given well undercooked sweet potatoes, catfish was just ok. The only good things were the fried chicken and the Mac n' cheese."
3,"I went two more times after my first visit and the quality of food has deteriorated a bit, the pho now tastes ok and also other dishes are ok.

I probably will not be going there for Vietnamese any more, as there other great places for the same price."
3,Decent place with decent food. I feel like it's really hit or miss. Sometimes the food's great and at times its not at all what I expected. Prices are high for what I can get elsewhere.
3,"The menu have a wide selection. Tonight I have a bit of a headache so I ordered the congee with century egg and fish. It was ok; nothing to write home about and the other parties on the table ordered lobster rice and greens with fish. The lobsters were the small ones and the fish were fillet, at least no bones. For dessert, tonight was a small bowl of tofu pudding. Overall, this is always a decent place with reasonable price for a quick Chinese meal."
3,"We came around 7pm Friday night and there was a line up. I guess its still winter in Canada and people want to have a meal to keep them warm on a cold Friday Night.

Seating: What I found interesting was how you get your table. You arrive at the front counter with a iPad. This is where you input your name, parties and your phone number. Once they have a free seat they will call you to let you know your table is ready. I find that more efficient than waiting near the main entrance as you can walk around the mall.

Price:  Bit on the higher sized consider its Unionville. Need to add extra money for the soup. almost $38-40 person 

Food: 
Beef very tender and fresh.
Lots of vegetables and fish ball to choose from 
Fried Bao were amazing. They come out crispy and hot. 

At the end of your meal you can choose which flavour of ice cream you want. Green tea or Vanilla. They limit one ice cream cone which is a bummer consider that it is an AYCE place."
3,"I like the over-all atmosphere of the Sierra Gold bars and the food at all of them is pretty good.  My favorite is the Soup.  Rice, carrots, celery, straw mushrooms, bell pepper, and meatballs in a rich chicken broth!  Comfort and goodness!  The service is nice and attentive."
3,"If you don't want to line up for Phoenix, Kitchen M is your next option! 

I must say that they have a lot of variety of food in comparison to other HK style cafe. Their food is alright and their price is reasonable. 

The only thing that I would say don't order from there is their Ramen. I appreciate that they offer something different but Ramen is just not their thing. The soup base was weird and their noodles was not the typical Ramen."
3,"Had dinner here last Saturday, followed by drinks upstairs.

Food was just okay. The best thing on the menu was a rice dish reminiscent of stuffed pepper filling. Delicious. 
Everything else we ordered (2 types of ceviche, ""big ass steak"", and a whole bunch of other things I can't remember) was unremarkable.

Lots of beautiful people in here and I loved the decor. This is what earned it 3 stars.

Club upstairs is WAY overcrowded. Stayed a grand total of 7 minutes before breaking free. Wouldn't go back."
3,"The Bobbie...very interesting indeed!  It's Thanksgiving in a sandwich in October, who would've thought!  Lol.  I would've gave it 5 stars if the turkey was hot, cranberry sauce was room temp, not cold and serving it with gravy on the side winnah, winnah, turkey dinnah!!  The 20"" sandwich is about $15.49ish and since I checked in before paying, we got a large drink for free!  Yaasss!  So bring your appetite because this 20"" is no joke, even with two people trying to finish it"
3,"While at Ming's Noodle Cafe, my parents noticed a sign on the wall that indicated that there was a ""Kitchen M"" in Markham.  We looked it up later and realized it's located across from Markville Mall, which we frequent.  So we decided to check it out.

This place is much bigger than Ming's -- I assume they're all run by the same people (hence the ad in Ming's).  It's so big that there's little devices on the tables for you to get a waitress to come over to get your order, get the bill, or ask for service.  I suppose this is where the lack of service comes in -- if you don't ask for it, the waitresses might even ignore you!

Overall, the menus seem more or less the same as Ming's.  Food quality seems the same as well so that's a good thing.  It's your typical HK cafe fare that is decently priced.  Definitely coming back here if I want some HK cafe food before heading over to Markville Mall."
3,"This place has potential - but it is certainly not there yet.  It is a clean, warm, inviting restaurant, very welcoming.  Our waitress was somewhat friendly, but had that laid back attitude that said she'd rather be elsewhere.  That said, let's get to the food:  The Black-eyed Pea Salad was phenomenal - alot of depth, wonderful flavors that I wondered at the description how they would mesh - loved it - a hint of heat from Serrano peppers, a bit of smoothness from farmer cheese, tang of chow chow, tender and flavorful black-eyed peas, and the thing that brought it together was the smoked tomato vinaigrette.  would definitely order this item again.  I have travelled the south and order Shrimp and Grits whenever and wherever I can.  This was a disappointment.  It is completely overpriced for three shrimp and tiny bits of ham.  It was very one- note in flavor:  simply no depth.  It tasted mostly like cream and the sliced red onions that predominated the dish.  There were also sliced red and green peppers, which together with the onions, had they been sautéed or caramelized, would have given the dish some flavor.  I left tasting onions for a long time - not good. The shrimp were tender and had good flavor.  We also had the Perlou, which was okay - really like refried rice, which was also totally overpriced. The smoked whitefish was the best part of the Perlou. My husband felt the oysters were just not the right texture in this dish.  We really wanted to like this place, but with their very limited menu and prices, expected a much better experience."
3,"Came here for the first time yesterday. Looks like a typical hole in the wall. Tables looked clean. They have a steady flow of customers (many different cultures) in and out. Service from the ladies was meh but whatever, I'm here for the food.

Tried the bun bo hue. The kitchen is super fast at getting orders to tables. I read some of the previous reviews about people inside the kitchen not wearing anything to catch hair...yesterday I observed the kitchen staff and they were all wearing a mix of either hairnets, caps, and bandanas. So, they fixed this practice., which is good.

My bun bo hue was a one size bowl for $8.50. It was pretty well sized with lots of toppings, pork blood, pork meat, beef meat, and vietnamese processed ham. 

The soup was tasty and well seasoned (perhaps a tad on the saltier side), and had a nice kick of spice. The noodles were for the most part cooked well leaving a nice chewy bite, though some strands were undercooked and had a hard bite. I was not impressed with the meat... The beef and pork meat were so dry/tough/stale and not tasty. Seemed like all of the juices from the meat went into the soup. Overall, it was a nice noodle soup but nothing too spectacular as they seemed to have some meh toppings."
3,"Scarborough, Friday Night with hunger pains and Yelp on my Blackberry, The SO and I end up at Dumpling Restaurant. 

The patrons were mostly Chinese, although there were some Korean offerings on the menu. Banchan was bean sprouts and Kimchi, the kimchi clearly brought in - not fresh and too salty for my liking. (missed the excellent Kimchi from Owl, or House of Soon) 

The server was unbelievably sweet. We clearly ordered way too much and she came over to let us know how large the portions are and helped us take some things off of our list. One order of dumplings is comprised of 14 and costs $4.99. We were thinking 5 bucks would give us 8 dumplings at best and ordered 4 full orders. 

Tea was hot and very good. 

We sampled steamed veggie and steamed assorted pork dumplings, Northern style Tofu skin with hot pepper (vegetarians take note, there were crumbled bits of meat on top) and snow pea shoots with garlic. The dumplings were a little oily, and my SO commented that the pork was extremely fatty. The veggie were very bland, lacking something, and they did not provide ginger with the Chinese vinegar, which I really missed. 

The dumplings were clearly made in house, and just soo cheap. 

2 Stars, for the quality of the food, 1 full star for the service and the unheard of 14 dumplings for $4.99. Cash Only."
3,"Went there today around 7pm, it was Saturday so they were definitely busy. Got seated around 8:15pm. Both food and service were alright. But one thing to keep in mind is that they DON'T take credit card, even though it said that it does on yelp. Also, you get ice-cream after the meal but only one. I was told by the waiter that they charge for extra ice-cream. Which I find a little ridiculous considering the fact that it wasn't stated on the menu, also for the price of 30$/person I think the ice-cream could have been unlimited. But on that note, probably one of the best green-tea ice-cream I've ever had!"
3,"I've come here with my coworkers several times and the service isn't great. They always seem unhappy and anytime I ask for simple things, they look at me as if I'm asking for the world. 

Food is average. Prices are fair. No stand outs. You get two Korean side dishes. Kimchi and soy bean sprouts. 

If you have dumplings, be prepared to have stinky breath. There's a couple other items which were really smelly too but I can't recall the name.  Must be super authentic cause I saw some Chinese people ordering it and they seemed to be enjoying it."
3,"Good variety of foods and soup ($2.5-$3 each). You can really taste the soup flavor in the meat - don't need to dip sauce. I like the corn best; also tried sa cha, tomato, and variety of their famous spicy broths. 

Modern interior, nice wood mix. Service could be better but don't expect much. Made a reservation but still had to wait 20+ minutes. The place is super packed.

Also for drinks, it's $6 for a pitcher (got sour plum and wintermelon) which serves about 4...  I can drink the whole thing myself."
3,"Stopped by the Capriotti's (for the first time) before catching the movies in the Red Rock Casino. This place sells cold, hot, and  cap special  sandwiches. I ordered one of their specials--Capastrami (cold slaw, hot pastrami, melted Swiss cheese, with Russian dressing.)

REVIEW FOR THE CAPASTRAMI:
i thought it was ok. The bread was soft--like slightly microwaved-soft (not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing.) The proportion was half cold slaw and half hot pastrami (with melted cheese and dressing in between). I was expecting the proportion to be more like 2/3 pastrami and 1/3 cold slaw, with the pastrami over-flowing and hanging over the sandwich--but it wasn't.  Because of the proportion, the sandwich didn't scream out ""pastrami"" in my mouth. In addition, i felt like the meat was way under-seasoned, which made it seemed like i was eating any other sandwiches with lunch meat inside. In conclusion, the sandwich did not lived up to its name.The only aspect i liked about the sandwich was the hot and cold textures. I probably wouldn't come back for their Capastrami. If i want a good pastrami sandwich, I would go over to Towers Deli (@ Venetian) and get their ""New York Sky High."" Boombb!!!

**overall, the sandwich didn't impress me, but it wasn't bad either. I would come back and try their other sandwiches. Possibly  ""the Bobbi's"" (heard its their most famous sandwich.)"
3,"The portion of main course is huge. It can definitely be shared between 2 persons. Pork chop tasted dry, appetizers are good. Ceviche and octopus are very fresh."
3,"When in Toronto the possibilities are plenty for any type of cuisine. We felt like having something spicy so we chose this place. 
We have never eaten south indian food before and it turns out that whatever we knew from punjabi cuisine doesn't really apply here beyond the traditional names. Hence butter chicken is always a safe bet, which it was. The goat vindaloo was really spicy for us as were the other dishes. We left impressed with the service and taste. 
However, this brings me to the bad part. As always with indian food, we feel that it is a hit or a miss and hard to anticipate before we walk in a place. While we left satisfied, half an hour later we were very close to regretting our decision to eat here. Massive heartburn, nausea and the like. While I don't really blame them, it is something to consider for someone who doesn't eat spicy on a regular basis."
3,I'm very picky about chow mein that I like. The one here was pretty good....3 stars. Not greasy and the noodles were a nice size! The other stuff I've tried was just okay.
3,"Lo Los really hit the spot before a long flight to Denver. Ordered 3 boneless tenderness and one waffle. Order was on the greasy side, but it is similar to what I expected. Going to feel bad for the person sitting next to me on the flight. Hoping I have an end seat."
3,"I don't really have high expectation for Hong Kong Style Cafe as I just want something fast, affordable and a menu with varieties. 

Kitchen M is definitely a good addition to the neighbourhood. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and all the all day set options. What to eat? What should I order? What is good?

The food here is not amazing but will do the job if you are in the area. Service is fast and friendly.

??????+?? ($9.95) Duck Leg Noodle with Side Veggie comes with a choice of drink was quite decent. The duck was tender and soft. Their milk tea was also quite good.

I will be back to try out other items."
3,"The food is decent but the service is terrible. We came into the restaurant and they were just like ""sit over there"". The waitresses are rude and sassy. Would recommend for the food but not the service"
3,"Decent food with good variety. Food portions were good.
HK milk tea tastes better than ice tea."
3,Food was good just the chicken wings where super little for $2.75 a wing. But i enjoyed the waffle crispy and buttery !
3,"I've lived here for almost 18 months while I'm attending UNLV and I have seen an improvement in organization. The staff is more attentive and seem to care about their tenants and provide their best with the resources they have. 

Pros: Free shuttle to UNLV, affordable rent, lease by the bedspace, they find roommates for you, gated property,$25 credit toward electric (per room), cable and Internet included (must provide your own router, staff and maintenance are friendly.

Cons: Sometimes slow to distribute mail, no turf for animals so the hallways always smell like urine, back parking lot usually has a lot of trash, sometimes they won't call to tell you that you have a package waiting in the office."
3,"If you're in the Markham area, chances are you've accompanied your parents to HK style cafes your whole life. If you haven't, let me tell about the french toast I consumed on my last visit.

For $4.95, imagine a melted layer of peanut butter-y goodness sandwiched between two slices of crustless, brick toast. This combination is then dipped in egg and DEEP FRIED to a crispy golden brown. On top sits a pool of thick condensed milk. Salivating yet? 

This decadent snack is not for the faint of heart (or for those at risk for diabetes).

Other food I've had here has been okay. The portions are quite generous and the  
breakfast/lunch/afternoon tea specials come with coffee/tea/soy milk. 

Lots of seating, and like many HK cafes, you have to wave down the staff if you need anything.

The only thing that was super gross was the tape of dead bugs hanging above our table. Also, the wifi isn't very reliable. But there's lots of choice and something for everyone. Great for groups :)"
3,"When I was younger, I lived a spell in Georgia, and a part of me still sees Southern food as comfort food. Not only because it brings back memories of childhood but also because Southern food is always filling and comforting, with its generous helpings of butter, meat, and flavor. So when I found out about Julep, I had to give it a try. After all, I wondered how one does upscale Southern food.

This establishment is fairly small, part of a troika of food establishments (along with Barolo and A-OK) wedged into a small building in the Willy Street neighborhood. The menu was not the largest, but it seemed to focus on the Southern food of the Eastern seaboard - influences of Virginia down to South Carolina with its confluence of seafood and meats. For starters I ordered a crab cake with pickled potato shreds, and for entree I was recommended the shrimp and grits. I also got a spiked sweet tea and a side of cornbread.

In hindsight, I've come to the conclusion that hip(ster) and Southern don't mix. The soul of Southern food is unpretentious comfort, with its wholesome ingredients cooked simply and not obsessing over small details or undue complexity. Not to say that Southern food isn't laborious - the labor is totally dedicated to making the food as delicious and fulfilling as possible. So when Julep tries to up the ante in terms of culinary finesse, and then tries to maintain its hip credentials with refurbished wood, old-timey lightbulbs, and lumbersexual aesthetic, the result is a clash of values. The crab cakes, although made with real crab, had more potato in it than actual crab. Furthermore, the picked potato makes no sense next to the crab cake (yes, singular cake). The vegetables in the shrimp and grits were cooked separately and not enough, and as a result there really wasn't a mingling of flavor between the shrimp, grits, and vegetables. Also, my grits had a huge lump in the middle. Finally, their spiked sweet tea was not sweet even by normal American standards, let alone the very sweet sweet teas of the South. In their defense, the shrimp was well-grilled and seasoned, and the cornbread was really good (I think it's a cast iron cornbread recipe which gave it a really crunchy crust that was really good). 

But this meal was ultimately disappointing because you can't be hip and ironic while at the same time be true to a Southern mentality. If you want to do fancier Southern dining, you can put more attention into, say, the sourcing of the food or the technique for ensuring a quality product (like Boston's Hungry Mother), but ultimately you have to be unironically warming their hearts with comfort food. Compare that to, say, New Orleans Take-out, which on the outside looks like a derelict soup kitchen but the food inside is wholesome and delicious. I don't recommend coming here for Southern food because it's not real Southern food. It masquerades as Southern food but lacks the comfort that is the heart and soul of Dixie."
3,Moths. Long wait for food. Stuffed in corner. 2011 mike on tap.  Mike was a great server. Carrots undercooked. Steak overcooked.
3,"I told my daughter, let's just grab some pedestrian uninspired generic Chinese food.  And that's exactly what you get.   But it is like just getting a fast food burger, you set the bar fairly low.  This restaurant will meet your reduced expectations  food hot, quick, boring and was fine for me as far as to portion size, but I think most people would expect more quantity for the price 
Nice service, quiet when we were there   They did screw up my bill by adding a $25 tip accidentally.  Quickly dealt with, but check your bill  I live down the road so it's not a big deal for me, but for gods sake don't drive from anywhere south of 101.  Cave Creek and Carefree have lots of great fun restaurants unique to the town atmosphere, this is not one of them.  The Sesame inn could be in Lincoln, Nebraska or Fargo, ND. You have been to this restaurant before somewhere in America  and, if you're like me some days that's all you need from Chinese food.  Some days.  Just not a lot of days. 
That was me, my daughter hated her meal, and brought it home for the dogs   
C'est la vie"
3,"Soup not salty, but lacked depth.  Chicken cooked well and lean.  Vegetables (Thai basil, bean sprouts, green onion) very clean.  Fresh spring rolls very tasty.  Fast service."
3,"I give this place a 3.5/5. I came here with a friend on a Saturday evening, at 5:30pm, as they do not take reservations for 2. The restaurant was already pretty full. The restaurant is spacious, modern and from what I can tell, clean. The service was average, and the reason I am docking a star. The waitress was incredibly unenthused when taking our orders. At the same time though, she checked in at regular intervals to see if we wanted to order more food, which is good for an AYCE. When our soup bases arrived, our hot plates were not turned on... Nor were we offered any assistance. There are different prices depending on the soup base, which I have not encountered before at other hot pot restaurants so -0.5 star for that. I opted for HK satay style, which was savoury and delicious. For a two person table, we were not allowed to order the split soup base... Sure, ok... They should list that in the menu then.  The food we offered came out promptly, and was very fresh. There is also a large selection of food to choose from, mostly classic hot pot fare. The beef, shrimp and Japanese crab meat were my favourite. +1 for thinly sliced, easy to cook daikon and offering taro! There is a two hour limit that was strictly adhered to on a Sat night. We were promptly told there are others waiting for a table when we hit the 2 hour mark and paid our bill. I would come back here when I'm really hungry and not catching up with a friend, because we certainly did not get our money's worth ($27.99 plus tax on weekend)... Spent a lot of time chatting, and not enough eating!!"
3,"Our first visit here and We order this paper masala dosa which was sooooo unexpected..haha it was huge.The taste was okay! I order mango lassi too but wasnt that good...smthg was missing..Overall, the service and food was good not excellent!!"
3,"Very busy, hard to get a table at dinner.  Menu is a little difficult if you don't know the cuisine already. My Chinese friends say its authentic. The service is not friendly but typical for type of cuisine, so neither plus nor minus.  Not my usual preference but will come back when in the mood.  The style is Northern Chinese and you may have that particular craving. It will satisfy."
3,"Good food but expensive. 
Tried devil's chicken, quantity is very poor compared to price"
3,The cheesecake is amazing but the lack of authentic gravy and crazy heavy salty biscuits made it hard to feel like it was actually in the south... more an idea without execution
3,"A traditional HK cafe-style restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is quite relaxing.  Lots of open space and comfortable seating.  My family and I went at around 7 PM and there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated fairly quickly.  The menu offers a variety of choices, from individual items to set meals for larger groups.  They also have lunch and dinner specials for a good price.  I was excited to see an all-day breakfast section (because come on, it's never the wrong time for sausage and eggs), but that quickly changed when I realized that there were only two items in that section.  What a tease.  

We opted to order a bunch of dishes to share, so we got a beef curry with spaghetti (that interestingly came with a side of croutons, cheese, raisins and sunflower seeds), soft-shell crab fried rice and two noodle dishes.  I was most excited for the fried rice, but it ended up being pretty bland and overall disappointing.  The curry was tasty, but I didn't have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent.  The other noodle dishes were good, but nothing amazing.  We ended off the meal with a dessert of green bean soup, which was quite tasty.

The service itself wasn't the greatest.  The restaurant wasn't packed by any means, but the waitresses didn't seem very attentive to our needs.  We had to wait a while for anyone to come and clear some of the finished plates off our of table.  Same goes for refilling our tea.  

Overall, nothing too special."
3,So the place is nice. I was a bit surprised that when we ordered the items did not come out together. I did enjoy my hamburger but my husbands fries came out later. I loved the Mac and cheese.
3,"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located on Brimley Rd and Sheppard Ave E. Parking spaces were limited at the plaza. 

[SERVICE] - 2/5
There was a bit of a language barrier as the servers only spoke Mandarin. We had to wait for the waiter who spoke English whenever we wanted to add something to our order or if we needed napkins. 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5 
Bigger than what it looks like on the outside, but very humid during the summer. There was no ventilation and had very little/no air conditioning.

[QUALITY] - 4/5
Good quality, food tasted homemade without extra preservatives or msg. 

[ORDER] - 3/5
- Pork Meat with Chives Dumpling - comes with 12 dumplings. They were meaty, juicy, and skin was perfectly thin 

- Spring Pancake - a little too doughy and not enough onions or other fillings/toppings

- Sparerib in Sweet & Sour Sauce - sweet, tangy, and crispy! Kind of like sweet and sour pork but with spareribs instead of pork 

- Pork Bone Soup - average. There were a LOT of bones and tasted a little too bland

- Fried Dumplings - meaty & delicious! Great with a little black vinegar and soya sauce

- Fresh Cold Noodle - refreshing, noodles were chewy, and great for the price! 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
Great dumplings and sweet & sour spareribs. Other items were average and I would not recommend them. Overall, I would recommend this place for their delicious dumplings because they are worth the value."
3,"This place is nice. It's a high end PT's Pub. So the menu is a great Bar Food Extravaganza. This location seemed pretty dead. I don't think I have ever seen it really packed. I was hesitant but figured why not. Walking in is really nice. Kinda modern with a little bit of sportiness. There was only one bar tender and one waitress. Would of assumed the waitress would of been hot like the ads and pictures display but ehhhh. The menu was pretty decent. Flaming Hot Cheeto Onion Rings sounded good as well as their wings and fingers and variety of sauces. This place can be serious competition to BWW if it was marketed right. We tried the Breakfast English Muffin Sandwich with hash browns. The egg was fluffy and bacon crisp and the Muffin was toasted perfectly on both sides. Also tried the Philly Cheese Steak with Chips. They used Whiz which was good but the meat was a bit dry. The bun claimed to be authentic but it wasn't  The Steak didn't have that flavorful taste like from Pop's or Geri's. It was a decent Cheese Steak. The Chips were the clear winner. Made fresh and almost Kettle Style Crispy. Had Cookoo Seasoning which was awesome. It was addicting like crack. The server said they even add that to the fries. Mmmmm, so my first time in a high end PT's wasn't what I expected but Im sure I'll give it another chance to see if I can get wow'd. Until next time, LET'S EAT!!!"
3,"I have been going to Pho Mi Asia (the Mississauga location near Dixie and Dundas) for ~ 3 years.  I am a fan of their rice dishes...I love the broken rice texture and their bbq meats are pretty decent.  Their pho is a hit or miss.  Sometimes the base is flavourful and other times it is water-downed.  Therefore, I stick to the rice dishes.  Their prices are modest (e.g. $6.95 for bbq pork/chicken with rice dish, $6.50 bbq pork vermicilli and spring roll dish, and $4.95 for small pho). One of the reasons I loved going here was because the staff were warm helpful.  They would even bring a small bowel with scissors for my little one (to cut her food into small pieces -- really helpful).  I am not sure if there has been ownership changes, but the last couple of times the customer service has not been great.  The owner/manager (never really saw before this month) can be quite rude and does not come to greet you readily. There are a lot of pho places now.  I may have to go somewhere else where the food is comparable, but the service better...it really is too bad."
3,"Went for dinner. Unlike the other reviewers who had to wait, we had reservations and were sat right away. 

Its a hot pot place so you pick a broth, dipping sauce then all the food you could possibly eat!!  

I was wavering between 3or 4 stars. I'm going to say 3.5.  They nickel and dime you on the cost of broth and sauces. A few items we wanted were not available . of course they were ones that were a bit pricey.  Spam and ramen were a plenty!   Service was okay. We had things refilled often. No complaints (we didn't have solver though ;) )"
3,"Braised beef noodle failed as they use instant udon noodles, hate the after taste. 2 stars. 

Also had sirloin steak spaghetti, steak is marinated Hk style so it doesn't quite taste like beef anymore, but ok it's tasty. 3.5 stars. 

Grouper spaghetti... It's ok. 3.5 stars. 

Milk tea is actually quite decent."
3,"Baro opened earlier this month adding some Latin American flavour to King West. 

The space is gorgeous, fun, and lively!  There are three floors and they plan to have a year round patio space!  They take reservations which is great though.

The restaurant is still working out some kinks.. 

So, we started by ordering drinks. 
The first two drinks were sold out. 

It took a while after ordering drink #1 to find out their signature Mezcal was not available.

It took a while after ordering #2 to find out Mezcal #2 was also not available. 

At that point I have no idea what we got for drink attempt #3.

We ordered a few items, the duck confit rice was standout and I'd order this again. 

The pork with goat cheese tortillas was also a tasty choice. 

Empanadas were cute but small and not particularly flavourful. 

Love the mix of taro and plantain chips that came with the guacamole. 

The fried fish was not bad, but nothing special. 

Did not love the pork belly it was overcooked fatty but too crispy at the same time. 

As for dessert, the tres leches cake was completely underwhelming. It wasn't sweet or moist enough. I was disappointed as usually love this dessert. 

I'd come back again to check out the patio, but order other items."
3,"Decent, but not up to par for their price point in Madison.  

The corn bread was fantastic, but the rest of our food didn't fair quite so well.  The mac & cheese gratin was good, but not great - a little heavy on the mustard.  The tamales were fair, at best, and the perlou was similarly disappointing. 

All in all, the food was not unpleasant but did not come close to meeting our hopes.  There are many better choices in Madison, plenty of which are lower-priced than Julep."
3,"The food is pretty good, service is decent but slow but definitely not worth the price they're charging. It is way too expensive (around $40 a person). Probably never going to come back just because it's not worth it money wise."
3,"This is a gourmet soul food restaurant. Don't go hungry. Presentation is awesome, food not so much"
3,"The food is always spectacular, don't get me wrong. I love the flavour of all their foods. The best ones is their make your own noodle bowl, and their steamed rice. Their breakfast options are okay - wish the toast would be crispier. The service is better this time, at least our waitress did not get our drinks or our food orders wrong. Gneerally some of their staff needs to improve on their attitudes towards their customers. I get that it's a SUnday afternoon and you are busy, but there is no need to roll your eyes at your customers, especially when we as a large group already agreed to splitting up in order for her to seat us easier (yes i'm talking about the hostess). Anyway love the food, but they really need to work on their service... one of the rare occasions where i had to consider cutting my tip or no tip."
3,"A perfectly acceptable HK style cafe. The service is quite good to be honest, and the restaurant itself is fairly spacious (unlike Phoenix and others). Their milk tea is tasty and the food is above average. Nothing that will knock your socks off but that's hard to find at establishments like these. 

I've had a few things from their menu, and today I tried to Korean style pork chop cutlet with rice. The pork chop was fried really well, a nice light batter and not oily at all. I really enjoyed it. Came with a soup and tea. 

The pricing is on par with other HK style cafes, but you also get a free newspaper if you're into that. Lots of competition in the area, so I expect them to remain competitive and provide decent service."
3,"Food is great for a casual steak house. They have one of the best ranch salad dressings ever and I never skip that as my side! Tonight me and my mom split the steak medallions and they were tasty. The food is great and the service is fine, but what kept me from making this a 4-star review were the hygienics of the bathroom. I won't go into detail but it's pretty bad."
3,"Updating my review again to reflect the change in management, they have increased the price of their lunch special with chow mein from $7 to $9 which no longer makes lunch a good deal, but merely an average priced lunch. I will probably drop my frequency of eating here as a result.

On the upside, it seems as though they've updated their recipes and the food tastes a bit better in my opinion."
3,"IMO, this place is okay. Reasonably clean. Self-serve tea (essentially, coloured hot water) in the back corner of the store.

Service is fairly absent-minded, or standard for Chinese places. They'll take your order and come back for your bill. 

The place is good for a craving of shrimp dumplings and noodles at a decent price. The broth in their soups are a bit bland and watery.  The size of their dumplings are pretty ""big"" in comparison to other places in the GTA. The dumplings are well-packed and well-made, but you usually get about 4-5 pieces (it's standardized, but I don't remember how many exactly you get with each bowl/order). 

Though the dumplings are good, the rest of the food accompanying the meals are mediocre."
3,"In Markham, a HK style diner is almost within 10 min from any place, so how does this place stand out? If the fact that it's owned by the guy who owns Ming's (another popular HK cafe south of Pacific mall) doesn't peak your interest, then maybe the thousands of dollars of expensive iron man figures will? No? Well let's talk about the food: it's typical hk style level. I tried two breakfast specials for the sake of this review - luncheon meat instant noodles and corn beef egg sandwich with oatmeal. Both are average in taste and portions. But for $6 each what do you expect? Fast, efficient, service with economical typical dishes. If you're in the mood for cheap hk diner food, check it out, your wallet will thank you."
3,"Not bad food. I'd bet that if you're used to their restaurant you'd be a bit disappointed here. 

I only have experienced this airport location and only for breakfast. I get the biscuits, gravy, eggs and toast and after a long flight from the east coast at o-dark-thirty it always hits the spot!  

Service could be faster and the toast always seems a little chewy."
3,"We had dinner with my boyfriend to Baro last week.
Let's start by saying that the food was great and the cocktail delicious. Our waitress was great too!

The only thing I wasn't very happy about is the service at the beginning when we entered in the restaurant. We made a reservation for 8.30 and the table wasn't available so they sent us to the bar upstairs for a drink which is fine. 

Since the restaurant opened recently it would have been nice to indicate us the way to go to get to the bar.

Once our table was ready someone came to inform us upstairs but our cocktails were not ready yet. We were informed that we had to pay upstairs for the cocktail which i understand because the cash registered are not on the same floor but it doesn't really make sense when you are about to have dinner in the establishment. 

Also since the drinks were not ready they could have told ask the barman to cancel the order and ask for it for us downstairs. 

So we go downstairs and have to give our information about the reservation again to the hostess and then ask for our coats to hang. That would have been nice to do when we very first arrive and before they sent us to the bar. I mean it's not mid-season where you have a light jacket, it's winter when you have the big winter coat. That would have been easier also to take our drink to our table than having my bag, my coat and my drink in my hands...

I read a lot of press release how the staff has been trained on the service and I agree they were all nice and smiling, our waitress was great but service also comes by those little things. 

The 3 stars is really for that, food was good apart from that, but the service at the beginning got me annoyed."
3,"Not a bad place to get some food but it gets confusing when there's like ten different menus they give you that you're not too sure what to order.

Prices are reasonable and enjoyed the education noodle with mushroom."
3,"Stopped in for a rare Thursday night dinner out without the kids (that never happens).  We were seated promptly and server was cordial. The place was busy, but our steaks came out pretty quick.  We both ordered the Porterhouse, but while mine was cooked perfectly, my wife's was very fatty- not what she expected because we have always had good steaks here. I ordered a ginger ale that arrived at the table flat with a bitter taste- this stuff was well past its due date; undrinkable. The vegetables I ordered were hard and tough to chew. We will probably be back and hope this was just one of those nights."
3,"I really wanted to like this place. Saw the great reviews. I have to say though I made a mistake in ordering a cold sandwich. For some reason I thought The Bobbie would be served on a hot bread. I must've been really thinking about Earls and their holiday sandwich because that's what I thought I was getting. When the sandwich came out cold I was a bit disappointed. Again, my fault for not reading it clearly on the menu but I'm not too sure that combination (cold sandwich with stuffing and turkey) works. 

Also, some of the servers didn't look too friendly. Seemed like they didn't like being there. The Yelp check-in offer for a large soda was amazing. Definitely do that if you are going in. I would say Earls wins over this. I wouldn't venture all the way out to Red Rock to try this."
3,"Decent food, slightly more expensive than their competitors, and more legit varieties on their menu.

I'll give credit to Imperial Garden's decor as it is significantly more eye-pleasing than other Asian restaurants and the fact that they have a full bar. 

I give kudos to this place because they're the only Chinese restaurant in the area that offers peking duck, a true Chinese specialty. Their seafood selection is also pretty upstanding and are cooked well. I'm also a fan of their ""banquet"" specials, which is for when you go in groups and they offer you a selection of X many dishes to share for a set price per person (this is available for lunch and dinner I believe, though I've never been here for lunch). 

Aside from the aforementioned pros of Imperial Garden, the other dishes on their menu (if you order without doing the ""banquet"") is average-tasting at best and overpriced."
3,"Food: It's overall pretty good and probably one of the more reliable options for semi-authentic Chinese food in the Madison area.  To this Asian, there is definitely some catering to Western palates.  Definitely a step down if you're used to eating at, say, Chicago's Chinatown (both old and new sections), and there's no extra menu in Chinese with the more eclectic stuff.  Fresh seafood options very limited.

Service: Average.  Food comes in a reasonable time, though refiling the water sometimes is spotty.

Value: Reasonable overall.  Prices fit the portions. Most entrees $9-15 range.

Overall: Good for when you crave Chinese, but I'd still head to Chicago for the more authentic stuff."
3,"After seeing decent yelp reviews, I stopped by for dinner today. Service was ok, we only waited 5-10 min for our meals to be prepared. My dosa was crispy and well filled with malasa potato mix. My friend had the chicken disk, a little on the small side and didnt like the bones still in. But otherwise delicious flavour.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Its an ok restaurant. I've had better dosa in Mississauga (check out my review of dosa palace)."
3,"When in the middle of Belmont,NC this little pub is a good spot to hit. The staff was prompt, the ambience good, the beer selection impressive, and the food above average. My colleague and I happen to dine on a Friday night which is also Trivia night and I must admit it was a blast. I ordered a salad with seared tuna and it was pretty good. My colleague ordered the wing entrée and it was plentiful (7 wings and a side)."
3,"The dumplings here are okay. Not fantastic, but not bad either. I've had much better elsewhere, including places in Toronto. 

First of all, my favorite dumplings (lamb dumplings) turned out really bad... the skins had already broken by the time it was served, so all the soup had escaped. On top of this, the lamb itself didn't taste great and was kind of chewy. For this reason alone, I probably won't be back. 

The chive dumplings (another standard order) also didn't taste very good. 

The other orders (cumin lamb, ""meat"" dumplings, beef soup) were pretty decent though. 

I usually don't care about service (I just want good food), but this cold service was quite obvious. The waitress didn't crack a smile once. Every time she delivered a plate, she'd literally dump it on our table and instantly walk off. Didn't say thanks at the end when we paid the bill. Only gave her a 10% tip (would've preferred to give 0). 

Quite a few parking spots

CASH ONLY!!

ps. Not sure if I'd order Korean here. The place seemed very Chinese."
3,"Like any typical chinese place, this restaurant has a lack of service. Waitresses can be slow and may make a few mistakes with your order but food here is decent for the cheap price; especially so if you love dumplings! I ordered some dumplings, the egg and chives pancakes and a pan fried pork & eggplant dish to share with another person. We ended up having so much food that there was leftovers and we were stuffed full when leaving. It was totally worth going home with chive breath."
3,"This is your typical fast food HK style cafe. Lots of seating space. Free wifi. Relatively big parking lot. I'd say it's a very ""average"" restaurant with a reasonably priced menu and average portion sizes. The service was also average, but I wouldn't expect more for a HK style cafe. I'd recommend the BBQ duck; it tastes great and didn't have too much fat on it. Their milk tea is very smooth and delicious. I would go back just for the milk tea. Each table is entitled to a free newspaper of either Singtao or Ming pao (if available). Overall, I don't think there is anything special about this place but if you're looking for a quick brunch spot, this could be it."
3,"Disclaimer: This review is only about the 3 courses of Peking duck. We misread the menu and didn't realize there's actually no duck included in the first course - disappointing. The skin was also not crispy as advertised, but rather chewy and oily. The soup tasted good, but there were only 2-3 small pieces of duck in each bowl. Finally the sautéed duck dish was a fairly decent size and contained mostly duck, thankfully. 

The service was great - attentive (with drink refills), but not overbearing. 

If I were to go back, I'd order other dishes instead."
3,"*Gross alert*  True story: 
Don't mean to trash this place, but we used to come to this place quite a bit before, and then there was this one time that one of us spotted a waitress trying to floss her teeth with her bare fingers, and she was the one taking out the noodle bowls. Ever since then, we have stopped coming here. But recently we found out that waitress is no longer working there, so we brave souls came back here to give it another try. FYI - We never got stomach aches after eating here. 

Adventurous Option: 
This time I felt extra adventurous and ordered the vermicelli with anchovy and fish soup (#426 on the menu). This soup also included shrimp paste, so definitely not recommended for anyone that can't handle fishy smell and taste.  The surprising thing about this bowl was that I got a variety of ingredients (okra, fish fillets, shrimp, eggplants, squid).  It was definitely an interesting bowl full of surprises and flavours. 

Safe Option:
You could always get the rare beef noodles. Another option that was still conservative or safe would be the My Tho rice noodle soup  - transparent noodles (#303 on the menu) which had a predictable broth base with seafood ingredients. 

Bottom line: It's alright to come here if you don't have a high standard of cleanliness*, want Vietnamese food with affordable prices, and quick service."
3,"The servers are half friendly and half slow, as well as the food.... half comes and you would be done before the rest comes! com here if you want to chill and air for awhile, not if you are in a hurry. 
the food is decent tho it's a hit or miss depending on what you get."
3,"Shrimp and pork fresh rolls (small): large portion, low cost, mostly vermicelli filler. Small order is two large rolls. Should have more meat, veggies inside 
Rare beef and chicken pho(small): fresh, lots of meat, noodles, great portion. Not a lot of flavor. Comes w lime, bean sprouts, basil (all fresh). 
Condiments great
Service fast but emotionless (usual busy pho service)
Nothing crazily amazing. Huge menu would attract indigenous or exploratory patrons. Seems solid, clean, fresh...
Won't come back unless I'm in the area and craving pho. 
Very very busy at 1pm"
3,"Pretty good, the waitress kept hinting at a tip from the beginning to the end of the meal, which was pretty annoying. But the food is spot on, probably will come back."
3,"I have been here abourt 6 times or so. The first & 2nd time we came here I ordered the cobb salad.. and  a few times for drinks only. If you get the beer bites membership that goes thru PT's and Sierra Gold you get half off drinks but i'm not sure if that's limited to a certain time frame. etc.  This is my bf's fave place to chill and have a few drinks after work. One time I even took my anatomy and physiolgy to study while he drank and played the slots. Seriously chilled out place but once in a while you get smokey joes and its like a chimminey. We love their half price pizzas during happy hour. Wow. really good super thin crust. I've only tried the hawaiian and the gilroy. I was not impressed with the gilroy as it kinda made me feel nauseated and i was super bummed b/c i love garlic more than salt to be honest with you. when i make food. its garlic, salt and pepper. But the hawaiian is perfect. we share a small and its perfect for the 2 of us. one think I didnt really care for was I ordered a screwdriver and they have me skyy vodka --- i didnt ask for top shelf vodka, You could give me mccormicks for all I care. BAck in TX I'd pay a $1 for that drink she poured me...and here its $8 - - really? On 2nd thought you might try Apache Joe's on Broadbent (which if you are on Boulder and Tropicana and you head East - you'll run right into it. Its down the road from Sam Boyd Stadium - That place Is MY fav place for a few drinks. and the food has yet YET to not be consistenly awesome! and the prices rock."
3,"Didnt have reservations, so we waited about 30 minutes for a table for 5. They gave us a giant booth and we all got our own pots. The table was very convenient to hold all the food we ordered, but difficult to have a conversation without yelling. 

The soup bases were very good and definitely better than the soup bases at other hot pot restaurants in Toronto. The overall food quality is pretty good, especially for an asian hot pot place. 

My two main knocks on this place: 
1 - They don't seem to care about the quantities you order. If you order multiple plates of beef, you still only get a couple of plates and you have to re-order.  It's annoying to not know if anything else from what you ordered is coming. 

2 - there are random charges that add up. They show a base price of $26, + an extra $2 for weekends (which is pretty common  for AYCE places), + $3-8 for a soup base. Most other hot pot places charge extra for soup upgrades, but this place seems to charge for soup itself. Which really makes the base price be $26+$3 = $29. I rather they show it included than to charge me for soup. I wouldn't mind paying it as part of the base price, but felt misled to pay on top of the base price. More of a presentation issue than a price issue - just rubs me the wrong way because how can you hot pot without the soup? Just seems like a sketchy strategy to generate revenue without ""increasing"" the base price."
3,"This place gives me reasons to hate it, but the fact is that the food is cheap, and the food is good, so I will be coming back. I'm writing this review after my second time here. My sister got a teacup that was outright dirty. It was brown and there were chunks of stuff inside. No apology, we had it exchanged. We ordered about 8 items, and one of the orders never came. We asked them twice if everything came, and both times they said yes, but there was an item we specifically ordered that never came. We waited several more minutes, and they brought it out to us. Although the food here is cheap, nobody wants to pay for food they never got. This place has a lot of room for improvement, but the food is good and affordable."
3,"I side with many other reviewers...the food is very good but the service is terrible. I waited nearly 15 minutes for my order, which was chicken fried chicken. After I saw 5 people who were behind me get their food I asked what the delay was. The counter person - who took my order - said "" Didn't they tell you that takes longer?"" I'm still trying to figure out who ""they"" are since she was standing in front of me when I ordered. Also, no ice in dispenser at 10:30am. The counter person said, ""Is it empty?"" Obvious answer, it was never filled yet today even though they had been open for hours. Same thing with silverware, it was a shock to her that the dispensers were all empty. 

The food did save the day - it was excellent which made up for the 1 star service. Way above average for airport food. 5 stars food + 1 star service/2 = 3 stars."
3,"The first time couple of times I went there they were closer to four stars, but this last trip put them at a three star. The combo Kung pao was just average. I really hate meat that is mushy, and that's what the beef was. This is just your average Chinese joint with a nice decor."
3,"The food came really fast, was good and well served, but as the place was crowded, they didn't give us any attention. Affordable, I had a middle chiken pho for $6. 3 stars but has potential to get better."
3,"Decent place. The servers are friendly enough and the food isn't bad. It's kinda roomy inside and they have a cool outdoor patio with sofas and stuff. The pizza is made in a thin crust style and is better than you'd find at most casual bars but certainly doesn't compare to a quality pizza joint. The wings aren't bad, better than BWW. The beer prices from what I remember are pretty fair. They have a fair selection of beers on tap but its not enough to satisfy the curiosity of a beer snob like me. I don't have strong feelings about this place one way or the other-- its a decent place to hang out in the day or for a monday night football game, but I don't suggest it for special occasions or dates."
3,"We found a car online that we wanted. Called, and found out it had been wrecked in a test drive...We found another one that my daughter liked and it turned out to be a great car. Everyone was pleasant and helpful at the dealership, but I still don't like how they try and sneak extra money in there. The internet price it showed, still was not the final price. They still added a $1000 plus fee in there that was not advertised. I told the guy I didn't want that and they basically said, that was not negotiable. The vehicle was at blue book when we walked out, but I still feel sick after walking out of there. I have not yet found any dealership that I walk out of excited about a car. If they would just be truthful about what a vehicle cost right up front, it would be so much more pleasant of an experience."
3,"I've gotten takeout and delivery here.  Not really interested in dining here.  The dining room is nice and clean with comfy booths, but boring.  The dishware they use looks pretty nice, though. 

It's mostly Americanized Chinese food ala Panda Express.

The lunch specials are a really good deal.  You get the same size as the dinner portion but $2 off plus it comes with egg flower soup.  The downside is that the egg flower soup is pretty awful.

The garden tofu was pretty good.  A nice selection of fresh vegetables and good chunks of fried tofu.  The paper chicken was also good but searing hot and covered in foil.  I had to wait 10 minutes before I could even handle the foil. The Mongolian beef was sweet not spicy, which was annoying.

I've gotten takeout here twice and delivery once.  Each time, ordering was huge saga because the workers have limited English skills.  Which makes me think they have some hidden gems on their menu or off-menu.  But I don't have the patience or language skills to find out.  Delivery was super fast, which I appreciate.

All in all, good in a pinch but I'd rather order from Pan Asian or go to Chinatown."
3,"A long strenuous day at work deserves a warm hot meal to finish the night away; hot pot is always the perfect choice. Normally I would rarely stray away from my usual favorite restaurants. But today I was unexpectedly compelled to roam into new territories. So, on this cold evening, right before the sun set, when the air was still and silent, I ventured to Morals Village. 

I met with my parents and brother at the restaurant front. Upon entering the restaurant, a strong aroma of hot pot soup filled our noises with joy. My mouth watered in excitement, as I expected great food and service.

The decor was warm and welcoming. The wooden walls with lamps hanging from above mixed with neon lights (not exactly the name, not sure what it's called), creates a modernized feel. The atmosphere and sound level is loud but cozy. 

A waitress led us to our table and handed out 2 menus. Curse my luck! The menu we received was written in Chinese. And all the waiters and waitresses spoke Mandarin. With my eternally awful Cantonese and non-existent Mandarin skills, I am utterly confused. Fortunately, a waitress gave us two English menus for my brother and me. And my mom translated and communicated with the waitress. Whew!

I carefully perused the menu, choosing items that satisfied my perpetual hunger. My two soup bases were: satay on the left side and clear broth on the right. We ordered a myriad of items, consisting of- beef slices, udon,  water cress, instant noodles, sausage, mussels, pig blood curd, shrimp, tofu, and many more. FYI: I'm listing the items we ordered. I did not eat all the items aforementioned.

The soup bases both tasted delicious . The satay soup was not spicy. But added flavor to any items cooked in the broth. The clear broth complimented well with the satay soup. However, the soups were not mind blowing, staying within the same chapters of its contemporaries.

The udon noodles were delicious. I carefully devoured each noodle placed in between my chopsticks and bowl. Each noodle soaked up the flavors of the spicy satay soup. Add in the beef slices and the dish is complete. Despite my praise, the texture of the noodles was too soft (subjective opinion).

Hot pot itself is already a dinner set to be amazing and delicious. But include instant noodles onto the menu, cooked in the broth, is a dinner made from heaven. I set my eyes carefully on the instant noodles, waiting for the three minutes to end. Once cooked to my personal preference, I poured the noodles into my eating bowl and some soup to top off everything. I gazed upon the beauty that sat in front of me, enthralled by such a wonderful dish. I picked on my chopsticks on my right side, readying myself for a battle. Right away, I began slurping the noodles down my mouth, like a mad Barbarian. 

The instant noodles, like the udon, infused all the flavors of the broth. The texture is what you'd expect from any instant noodle pack. Was the instant noodles delicious with the hot pot? Absolutely. Will I order it again? I ordered two more before I ate my third bite.

The service is a wee bit slow. Many items were late to arrive to our table. The waiter and waitresses were a bit unresponsive.

Maybe not the adventure I expected to be. Morals Village is not a great restaurant. Will I return? Perhaps, if my hunger beckons me to visit again. But for now, I think I will stick to my usual hot pot place (personal preference)."
3,"This place has great South Indian décor and a good variety of South Indian specialties on the menu. Tough tasty, I found the food a bit too spicy. (I guess that's the way it is supposed to be in India, but it could be a little to severe for Canadians or Canadianized Indians). The Shrimp Masala was excellent and so was their Sukha Mutton. Service was quick.
Make sure you have enough place on your table before you order the Paper Dosa."
3,"Looking for absolutely ANY particular Chinese dish? You'll find it here.. although fair warning, this place is a nightmare for indecisive people like myself. As I found myself flipping through the 10+ jam-packed pages of different menus, I felt overwhelmed with all the choices I had and it made it so much harder for me to order.

Once you make it past the ordering stage though, everything else that follows is pretty standard. Food quality, service, speed, pricing - it's what you would expect from a HK-style cafe. Nothing special but definitely do-able. Its location is pretty convenient as it's right across from Markville Mall and for the few times I've been here, parking wasn't a problem."
3,"Great place for fast and cheap dumplings. The portions for the dumplings are big and they are at a great value. The pot stickers had a lot of meat but I wasn't really a fan of them. I personally like the steamed dumplings more. I tried the fried noodles and thought they were okay, nothing special. I will return again whenever I want fast and cheap dumplings but I will probably not order any noodles again. I was surprised to see gamjatang here so I may try that next time."
3,"After reading so many bad reviews Im starting to second guess my choice to relocated to 
Las Vegas for school. 
The leasing agent by the name of Tatiana is the sweetest, she made me want to rent there, she always check on me either a phone call or email (which I appreicate her following up ) 
So if i do decide to move to LV to attend UNLV and choose Rebel Place for housing it's because of the exceptional customer service from your leasing staff"
3,"A fine stop. Imperial Garden was hopping at dinner time but it didn't take more than a few minutes to be seated. Service was okay; the server was super chatty but slow to stop by to take our order, check on things, and refill drinks. We ordered the sesame chicken for entree. Deep-fried chicken chunks in a thin sauce with pepper flecks and plenty of sesame seeds. Better than versions with thick and sugar-sweet sauce, but needing a bigger punch of flavor to be memorable. The portion is very generous for the price and can easily feed two people. I don't quite feel compelled to drive there from downtown for food, but if I still lived on the west side I'd probably be a somewhat regular customer since it's one of the better options in that area."
3,"This is the Capriotti's I frequent most often, so imagine my surprise when I went to a different location and they had wheat bread. Hands down, no questions asked, I always prefer wheat to white. I just thought Cap's didn't offer that option. Nope, THIS Cap's doesn't offer that option. Besides that, this a good location. The service here is always both fast and courteous. For a sandwich shop they actually have quite a few vegetarian options other than the usual ""veggie sub."" You just have to be willing to eat faux meat in the form of soy products. Which, I am not willing to do, but thought it was an interesting option all the same."
3,"So what does the newly opened Kitchen M offer up?
The short answer - its a Hong Kong style cafe
It was pretty busy on a Thursday afternoon but I'm guessing its because people are curious to find out what they serve here just like me. Service was blazing fast and we got our food within 5 minutes at the most from ordering. 

Grouper with spaghetti noodles and cream sauce $10.95 - includes vegetable soup and choice of HK style milk tea or coffee. Everything tasted good but nothing that will WOW you. Also, portions were huge so come on an empty stomach.

Malaysian curry and chicken with rice $11.95 - once again includes vegetable soup and choice of hot drink. Found that the chicken was a bit tough and once again portions were huge.

On the back of the menu there is a build your noodle section so you can choose the type of noodles and select two meats to be added. Surprisingly you can't choose the type of soup. It was just your standard chicken broth type of soup. Went with the vermicelli noodles with pig intestine and fish skin, plus you also get a hot drink with it for $8.45. The portions were once again very large and the meal was good but nothing really memorable.

If you are looking for a quick meal that is cheap and filling then this is the place for you."
3,"After gambling a bit, we wanted a quick bite to eat. Found this place on Yelp and wanted to try it out. I got the Cheese Steak with Mushroom. That thing was piping hot! The cheese was all nice and melted. As for the taste, sad to say it was just ok. The sandwich was rather oily. Wish I can expand on it more but honestly the sandwich wasn't that memorable.

As for the service, the girl at the cashier must have been new. She was struggling a bit and needed assistance. 

Definitely use the Yelp check in. The large soda was huge! Had to two hand that bad boy!"
3,"Finally got to try this hotpot place, though it was a holiday and we didn't have reservations so we had to eat at 4pm.  

The soup base is additional charge, we tried corn, mushroom, and pork bone.

Food variety and freshness was good, but they ran out of several key items which was disappointing (cheese meatball, squid paste, squid dumpling, etc.).  Considering it is more expensive weekend/holiday pricing, I would expect their food to be fully stocked.

Service was great!  Our server would always appear once we were about to order something and food arrived promptly.  Location at Kennedy and Hwy 7 is convenient, and restaurant is nice and new."
3,"Probably the best Chinese in Madison these days.  Unfortunately, that is not saying much."
3,"So, I like eating something cheap before going to the movies.  The Regal Cinema is right next door, so I thought I would have a Pink's hot dog, but to my surprise, Pinks is closed.  So I headed over here and ordered an Italian sub.  I was pleased that the small sub was large, filled with good lunch meats and tasted pretty good.  I didn't think a walk up counter would do a good job.  I would come back."
3,"This place has really good Singapore street noodles, however,  stay away from their ""vegetarian spring rolls"" which are oil laden egg rolls. All you taste is oil. (YUCK!!) 
The customer service was mediocre.  My husband and I walked in and were seated right away (we were the only people in the restaurant at lunch time on a Saturday) but it took 10 mins for her to take our drink order and then another 10 mins for our lunch order.  The waitress was friendly but seemed occupied with watching whatever was on tv in the back??  Anyway - I'll order the street noodles again but only for take-out."
3,"Surprisingly decent... for airport food! Super tasty chicken leg and thigh! Crispylicious skin and tender meat inside. YUM! The waffle, though, was way below average. It was cold, thin, and soggy. It lacked life. Completely boring. The Mac & Cheese was was a little more exciting with its bread crumb crust and cheesy noodles. I wish there was a little more salt and pepper, but it's all good.  
Service was off that day. The lady behind the counter was dealing with some issue with a customer's order so we had to wait for awhile to order. Then when our food was ready, she had to deal with another issue so our food was sitting out for a long time. I was tempted to grab it! OH man, if service didn't suck, I would've ordered more of that yummy chicken and Mac & Cheese to eat on the plane!"
3,"This place has been for many years, I even remember when my parents use to bring me here when i was about 12-13 years old. Nothing to fancy here but good family owned environment!

Always an enjoyable time when we go out here for a quick dinner. Most recommended dish will be obviously their pho dac biet (special famous beef noodle soup) with all the works including thinly sliced beef, beef balls, beef shank, beef tendon (mmm my favourite!) and noodle with lots of bean sprouts and mint. Be sure to remember to squeeze a hint of lime juice to heighten your tastebuds.

Very Cheap meal considering a bowl that will fill you up to your hearts content from 5-7$.

PS REMEMBER TO TRY THEIR ICED COFFEE WITH CONDENSED MILK!"
3,Stop what you're doing and let's cut to the chase. Everyone comes here for lunch you can't beat the deal. They have like 20 different dishes that are $7 come on. That's so cheap that makes you wanna slap yo momma!!!! Food isn't bad but not great. Just something you let sit your stomach. Not a bad place to eat  :)
3,"I like the food at Texas Roadhouse, I really do.  I estimate that we've eaten at this location about a dozen times over the years but our last two visits were not great.  Last week, my husband called ahead on a Sunday afternoon to secure a table when we arrived in 30 minutes.  Our frustration began in the parking lot because there was no parking so we had to park way in the back.  As soon as we walked in, we knew we were in trouble.  The front entrance was chaotic with no type of organization.  At the hostess desk, they looked in vain for our call-ahead seating reservation code and they couldn't find it. When they realized it was not there, they seated us anyway.  I swear, the 2-seat booth they gave us is meant for pre-schoolers.  It was so uncomfortable, we asked to move to another table.  Of course, they had nothing else so we left, hungry and upset.

Yesterday, we decided to give it another shot.  Since my husband took the day off, we were able to arrive at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon for an early dinner.  This time, it was not so busy that you couldn't hear yourself think.  Normally, the noise level in this restaurant when full is cacophonous and not at all pleasant for those sensitive to a loud atmosphere.  Anyhow, this time we were seated at a four-top for the two but it was wobbly which is PET PEEVE NUMBER 1.  The hard chairs were really low so I felt like I was at the kid's table on Thanksgiving.  Why are they so low?  By the way, their two-top tables are very small with not a lot of room for plates, drinks and silverware.

We were greeted by our server Ashley and ordered our food right away.  I'm a fan of chopped steak so I had the Road Kill with no cheese, baked sweet potato and salad.  Hubby ordered the Smothered Chicken with fries and salad.  The salads took a while but we kept busy with the delicious rolls and butter.  The tasty salads were fresh and crisp which is something I critique in restaurants.  PET PEEVE NUMBER 2 - I despise salads that are limp with old greens and big pieces of romaine stalks.  My well-seasoned chopped steak was cooked a perfect medium and the mushroom/onion topping was wonderful.  Hubby loved his smothered chicken and ate it with gusto.  My baked sweet potato was good but there wasn't enough butter for the size of it and there was no brown sugar like I had on our last successful visit.  I would have asked Ashley to remedy this but she had LEFT US FOR DEAD.  She didn't come back to ask how our food was or how we were doing which is PET PEEVE NUMBER 3.  The server should always check back with the customer a few minutes into their meal.  She returned after we were all done to give us the check which we paid and left her a 10% tip.  We normally give 20-25% for good service.

One note about this restaurant:  The layout of it is insane.  The problem begins at the entrance where there is only room for customers either going in OR coming out.  You have to wait for people to move away from the hostess desk in order to leave the restaurant.  It's very frustrating and I think it's a fire hazard.  The layout of the entire place is poorly configured, crowded and very uncomfortable.  Chip Gaines from Fixer Upper would call this the ""Crazy Maze Restaurant"".  It doesn't flow at all and the people who designed the floor plan and should be taken to task for lack of vision.

Will we go back?  Perhaps because the food is really good and usually consistent.  However, there are many other factors that prevent us from making this spot a regular choice for a pleasant meal."
3,"Typical HK style cafe right across Markville. 

This place has a huuuge menu. Food is ok la in my opinion. Ordered the curry with pancake which needs more pancake lol and the black pepper beef noodles which had a huge portion!! 

The short haired lady with the bob is pretty rude. When she took back our menus she just threw them onto the table beside us loooool. But the other one is pretty nice so she makes up for it. 

They didnt have wifi when I came in even though they advertised free wifi outside their door... Boo!"
3,"I stopped in here on a work trip as I tend to do. Got the veggie pizza sans cheese. It was pretty good, though I miss the variety of veggies you can get on a pizza in europe. I kind of feel like the veggies available on most pizzas in the US are what I call ""filler"" veggies, basically onions and bell peppers. It would be great to get some grilled veggies on pizzas out here like squash, eggplant, and of course your typical mediterranean veggies found in higher class joints. But a man can dream...

Anyways, the pizza was good. In fact it was half price when I went, not sure why since it was so late. They have an ok selection of beers on tap, but all in all the prices are pretty good and theres enough variety to make it worth going to. Everyone I was with enjoyed it.

I also stopped in for breakfast before catching the plane out of Vegas, but I dont remember what I got, so it must not have left an impression on me.

I think this is a good place to go for late drinks and food/snacks with some friends."
3,"Not pleased with customer service when I brought my mazda in for service. I called more than two hours after my appointment time to check on the car as I hadn't heard anything. The response was that he did not know the situation with my car and has not been looked at because I brought my car in at the beginning of the morning, at about 745am for my 11am appointment. I was told that I ""changed the dynamics of the day"" by dropping my vehicle off early. Does not make any bit of sense to me. And there was definitely no additional customer service to make up for that. Service was a simple oil change and to check my low air pressure light. Poor time efficiency and quality of care. Quite disappointing and will drive farther to another dealership for service in the future."
3,"I was happy to see this in Terminal 4 pre-security and have been eating here for years.  My go to is he Betty Boop. One fried chicken breast and one waffle. Perfect. And at $9 is very reasonable for airport food. That sweet and salty goodness is well balanced perfection. BUT let me forewarn you. Chicken takes time to cook. So be patient. However, service here is abysmal. The female cashier on 6/26 had NO sense of urgency whatsoever. It was painful watching her complete one task at a time. I can see why people get so frustrated here. Even another employee came out to get a drink who may have been a supervisor but offered no assistance and there was a line around 12:30pm. I've never had this issue at the brick and mortar locations. She was also so unfriendly like I was doing her a favor by ordering. I probably prefer the other locations but this was a treat having landed for business at Sky Harbor. There's plenty of food court seating too. Not sure how I feel about the styrofoam container either as it could potentially make everything soggy of you're taking this to go. I would have given this two stars alone for service. If this is run by airport concessions or HMS Host they need to clean up their act."
3,"This is the monthly watering hole for Queho Posse #1919, ECV.  The food's as good as any other Sierra Gold/PTs.  The wait staff are friendly and quick, and the televisions show the latest sports.  What's not to like?"
3,Convenient for students. New management has been helpful
3,I am writing an update review based on my second time back. The business extended an invitation for a dinner back and that's a nice goodwill gesture. My second time back was much better. The service was good and they came around with a tablet so it looks like they have improved their ordering system. I certainly hope that this is the service level that they will maintain going forward.
3,"I ended up trying this place as my all-time favorite dosa place is temporarily closed at the moment. So when I was going through dosa withdrawals this place came up and I was more then happy to try it out.

The staff is friendly and service is fast. I mean when our order was placed, it took less than 5 minutes for the dosa to hit the table. I ordered the mysore masala dosa and it was good. Nicely spiced. It was a little under done each time I've ordered it but the flavour was ok. My husband's dosa was a little over done so  The chutney's were just ok but it was an alright experience. They have a few other things on the menu I would be willing to come back and try."
3,"I always seem to join the party a little late.  I've passed by Capriotti's dozens of times, but thought they were just another sandwich shop.  All this time I was clueless, wishing there was a place that offered faux-meat options (other than just a Boca patty), and all along there was such a place!  

So I finally went to Capriotti's last week and ordered the Vegetarian Turkey Sub, made with meatless ""turkey"".  I got a 12"" sub -- good for two meals -- and the flavors were very good.  

I'm really happy to have discovered another place where I can go for a quick, healthy, vegetarian meal. The other place I've been going, Chipotle, doesn't have faux-meat options like Capriotti's, but you can still order a quick, delicious, nutritious meal there without meat.  Anyway, it's great to have another option.  I'll make Capriotti's an occasional stop from now on, and I look forward to trying some of the other sandwiches, like the vegetarian cheesesteak, or the vegetarian cheeseburger."
3,"It is all about market positioning.  In my opinion, when a restaurateur aims at a certain market, whether the restaurant is good depends on whether it delivers delicious food in a hygienic environment, and fulfils the expectation/norm of that market.  If it exceeds expectation, great, but IMO, ""good"" only requires meeting expectation.  Maybe my expectation of a HK cafe is not particularly demanding.  Maybe I have missed the poorly reviewed period of the grand opening.  During the first visit recently (in 2016), I find Kitchen M meeting expectation of a HK cafe..  The food is flavourful, the portion is satisfying, the pricing is on par with market, the value is sufficient, the ambiance is pleasant, the staff is efficient.  Kitchen M is great for lunch and a value dinner.  The food isn't so good that it could demand high prices, and Kitchen M doesn't charges high prices.  Here you go: it is A-OK."
3,"Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm with a group of 6. The place wasn't fully packed. The interior is lovely! Felt like I was transported away from King st. Large booths with comfy seating, the cocktails were beautiful, and the service was nice. 

We started with the empanadas. It came in a cute little brown paper bag. They were piping hot, felt freshly fried! Lots of meaty stuffing that oozed out of their shells. They were quite small though, about 2-3 bites. We also got the salsa, chips and guac, which was good nothing special except they come with a variety of root vegetable and plantain chips which were thing and crispy. So the apps were all good. 

For the main I got the eggs Benny blanco, it was quite disappointing. The eggs were overcooked, and the middle was stiff. And the mustards greens on the side were not dressed with anything, literally just tasted like blanched bitter greens. The pan de queso was good and crisp if thats a redeeming quality."
3,"Thought this was just an HK style cafe place... NOPEEEE wrrronnnggg. They also serve Chinese stir fry dishes! 

Came here before for their cha chaan teng stuff... it's pretty average. Nothing to really write home about. Got their satay rice noodle soup + egg sandwich set as per yoozh. It's aight, better than Cafe Hollywood that's fo sho. My quest for the perfect HK egg sandwich continues  tho - their scrambled eggs still weren't fluffy enough. 

Buttttt... recently, we came here for their dinner a couple times... and I'm shook. It's actually pretty OK food (albeit MSG-laden). Their fried dishes have ""wok-hay"", super fresh, and are all pretty flavourful (FROM MSG no doubt LOL). Prices here are cheap! Def a joint where locals come to avoid the dinner chaos closer East of Kennedy/7. 

Also, service is actually really good here! Super surprising for a  very moderately priced Chinese restaurant. Honestly, I'm impressed - every one of the servers were courteous, efficient, and helpful. 

FYI, the $83 set was advertised in the Chinese newspaper as for 6-8 people. NAH. More like 4 hungry people or 6 meh-appetite people."
3,"Still the fastest cheapest lunch in Summerlin 
They just still need to work on service 
Hospitality. And hot food coming out hot 
Today I was graciously asked if I would like my lunch heated up in a microwave!"
3,"Been here plenty of times. It's a combination of a Hong Kong cafe and an actual Chinese restaurant with full course meals. Food and service are decent, most things are average. This place is more of a last minute or quick eats type of place. I usually come for their tea time, and occasionally dinner specials. They also have combos with their dishes, so meals come with a soup and a drink."
3,"We went to the Roadhouse to try a different Steakhouse. We were first seated at a booth that had no waiter we finally got a waiter he gave us complimentary appetizers to make up for the 20-minute wait. We ordered the top sirloin steaks. One 11oz well done the other a 16oz medium well. The bread rolls were good the salads we're fine the baked potatoes we're hot and large. But our steaks were very overcooked and dry which disappointed us. The servers and service was great, the place is clean, the appetizers were okay but we are disappointed in our steaks."
3,On a whim I tried this place. Got the Singapore rice noodles and overall it was pretty good. Food came out fast. Can't speak about the staff as I got take out. I will go here again. Got a lot of food for the money
3,Just tried this restaurant on Friday night. I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the catfish. We shared the risotto with squash and Brussel sprouts as our side(it was an entree so it was an expensive side). My husband said the catfish was good. I was excited for the shrimp and grits but it was just okay. It was a cream sauce and not what I was expecting. The risotto was chewy but tasted okay. My husband did have some collard greens that were really good. We had the chocolate cake with mint ice cream for dessert. The ice cream was good but the cake was dry. The setting is beautiful. May try again in the summer so we can sit out by the stone patio.
3,"A great selection of sandwiches to choose from.  They are well made, fresh, tastey and filling.  I only eat here if I'm really hungry."
3,"Came to baro to celebrate with a few friends on a Sunday evening. We got the Latino Street Party sharing menu - normally $65/person but it was on special that night for $45/person

chips and guac - good, nothing special

ceviche - very tiny pieces of fish but a very generous portion 

Chori Papa - flavour, the flour tortillas were very thick

Bandeja - the pork was drastically overcooked, making it tough and chewy. The plaintains were like little hockey pucks. The guac had so much citrus in it, it was inedible
dessert were little truffles - ho hum

we told our server that the bandeja was terrible and the manager came over and comped us a tasting menu fee. Because of their quickness to resolve, I would probably come back to try a few more things. 

Overall the food is okay, but the service is spectacular."
3,"Summary: upscale looking place off McCowan and Highway 7 provides traditional HK style meals for a higher price point than surrounding areas. Decent quality, alright service, but PeachTree Plaza is just up the road with a ton more options...

It's a busy place. We had to wait to be seated even for a weekday lunch, although it wasn't a long wait.

Prices are a little higher than usual, but they've got all the goods that a typical Hong Kong style cafe offers.

Portion sizes are adequate; other reviews say otherwise, but I personally found the Portuguese chicken average sized and average quality at best.
Soup was a little on the cool side."
3,"When we arrived at 6:30pm on Fri, it's nearly packed, luckily there's a small table good enough for 3 of us.  After sitting at the table for 10 mins, we don't have tea, plate, chopsticks and even menu.  The reason is there were only 2 ladies doing all the stuff.....Finally we ordered shrimp, pork & veggy dumpling, cumin beef, ""water boiled fish"", steamed bun & sugar coated sweet potato.  First of all the dumpling was really good, very juicy and big.  The fish in ""water boiled fish"" I don't think it's fresh, should be frozen, so I don't recommend this dish.  Steamed bun probably it's from frozen, cause I bought the same buns from a store that sell frozen food b4, but taste good.  Sugar coated sweet potato is good, the sugar coating was not too thick nor too thin, just perfect and the sweet potato itself it's sweet.  Love it.  Cumin beef was the worst dish that we just tried a few pieces and don't even think about packing it up.  Didn't taste like beef at all, the texture is awful....... 
To my standard, this restaurant is not clean enough for dine in, so I have to think about it whether go again just for dumpling........"
3,"Dumplings are good, satisfying and SUPER cheap. Not as high quality as nearby restaurant xiao long bao. Not as much soup."
3,"Hong Kong style restaurant. The soup (that comes with the combo) isn't hot enough. The curry beef isn't bad. Typical HK style ""cha chan tang"""
3,"They have the best tempura and fake chicken I have ever had! It was so fresh and crispy! 

I actually go back there every month and purchase 3 pounds of frozen fake chicken. It's $9/pound. 

The sushi is good too, the sashimi on the other hand is not as good as I thought. 

I had an eggplant hot pot - nothing great

Teriyaki beef - weird taste

I will definitely go back but not to eat, just to buy frozen fake chicken."
3,"Decent place to grab lunch.
Biggest gripe is you have to go to the counter and ask for a refill on your drink.
Get the spicy chicken sandwich with the honey bbq sauce!"
3,Fun for the family and they actually make pretty good burgers that you can customize to your taste. They also make great milkshakes. Lots of other stuff on the menu.
3,"We've used Discount for a long time.  They are fair with the prices and generally get me in and out quickly.  I would give them 5 stars if they would get the tire pressure right.  After they replaced 4 tires my husband who always double checks the tire pressure got 4 different readings from 32psi to one tire having 60psi.  So, check your pressure when you return."
3,"This restaurant is in the location of the old Loco Lime.  We decided to give it a try on a Friday night.  The staff couldn't have been any nicer or more welcoming.  In fact, they were nearly tripping all over each other to serve us.  Two women attempted to take our drink and dinner order.  A nice man  came by to ask if everything was good.  We also liked that the restaurant was playing authentic Mexican music in the background.  It doesn't have the same effect when an ethnic establishment plays American pop music.  
Tortilla chips and salsa was brought to our table.  We were given two salsas, one which was described as mild and the other labeled hot.  I immediately went fir the hot one and found it to be mildly spicy.  The mild salsa tasted like canned tomato sauce,
We both ordered the number two vegetarian.  It came with a bean burrito, chalupa and quesadilla.  The quesadilla was like the best Mexican grilled cheese ever, and I appreciated the crunch and flavor of the chalupa.  The burrito left me flat.  The sauce tasted like an Italian topping, and the cheese was minimal.
The prices were great,  it was nice to get two meals and two drinks for under $30.00.  And I definitely will return for more chalupas and quesadillas!"
3,"Good, standard Mexican fare. The tortillas are very good! They hold together well and are not too thick. I liked the quesadilla el pastor and the trio of salsas they offer. I would come back to try other dishes, but I cannot say this is a stand-out place. Not yet."
3,"Quite a disappointment for us.
We went there because of all the great reviews here. The plain pretzels were pretty good, not exceptional as they had been sitting there for a while and not warm but at least they were not greasy like some other mall pretzels can be. Unfortunately the pretzel sandwiches were disappointing. The have all the sandwiches pre- assembled  in the display case and when you order them they microwave them-- which heat them up but made everything soggy. The sausage in my breakfast sandwich was very salty. We were expecting a family version of Bruegger's Bagel or Panera, well this place is not as good. The price, however, was unbeatable in the Southside area. The two of us had a filling breakfast for under $10 though you do get what you paid for. We will not go back and will not recommend it to others."
3,"This is a good choice of restaurant when dining with vegetarian friends and families. 

We had teriyaki chicken (mock) bento and beef (mock) bento. The bento boxes came with miso soup,  rice, stir fried veggies, edamame or seaweed salad, veggie tempuras, a few pieces of California rolls; and a small scoop of ice cream at the end. The bento box is $11.99 which is not a bad deal. The ""chicken"" was better than beef IMO.
We had veggie gyoza for appetizer (which came out after the bento boxes), big portion for $4.99; it was freshly made and the filling is cabbage.

Overall, good choice for vegetarian food, not greasy like other chinese vegetarian restaurants. I would come back when craving a vegetarian meal or dining with my veg friends."
3,"I've been here a few times over the years, for soccer parties and just with a couple of friends too. Actually, this is our go-to place with 2 friends of mine, not entirely sure why, as the food isn't amazing or anything, its more of a tradition thing now I guess. 

Anyways, on to the food. Came here last weekend for a late lunch with these 2 said friends. I ordered the fried chicken Roquet burger (bacon, Monterrey Jack cheese and onion rings), my friend got a beef Roquet burger with a side of pulled pork mac n cheese and my other friend got the mac n cheese hot dog. Everyone enjoyed their meals, but none of us were able to eat everything. Although my burger was good and the fried chicken excellent, the burger overall was dry and lacked in flavour (I had to add mayo to try and make it less dry). The fries were good, as was the mac and cheese. Everything was good in general, but nothing more and nothing memorable."
3,"2.5 stars

A group of 7 of us met up in Unionville Main St on Boxing Day and realized that most of the restaurants weren't open for lunch that day. Solution? Head to Hwy 7 and Kennedy down the street, where Asian restaurants are open 365 days a year. There was bound to be food! 

We got to the plaza and one guy remembered eating at a sushi place. It was still there, but it appeared to have changes name to Tenon. Oh well, in we went for sushi. Unfortunately, we ALL missed the part about it being vegetarian cuisine @_@ 
Looking through the menu, I silently grumble that they have a poor selection of fish and note that they appear to only have salmon, tuna, and eel. I chalk it up to just being a low quality sushi resto.

We ordered a huge sushi platter to share, an eel/avocado roll and some beef soup of some sort. The eel/avo roll came out first. It had cucumber and the tofu skin they use for inarizushi, no avo or eel in sight. We called the waitress over ""uhm, sorry we ordered the avo/eel roll.. I think this is the wrong one..."" No problem she takes it back to the counter. Then the platter comes out. Looks pretty enough, but there was something just weird about it .. square slices of fish, funny looking white thing lots of arms... then our eel/avo plate comes back and it now has avo but still has fried tuna skin slices. The waitress probably noticed all of our perplexed looks because she then states ""This is a vegetarian restaurant. This IS our eel roll.""  Boy were we fooled!

It's hard to judge the food because I've never wished to try vegetarian sushi given the choice of real fish versus some hard jelly that's made to look and feel like salmon. To be honest, I didn't like it very much. I suppose if I was a vegetarian, I might think otherwise. The presentation was nice and funny enough, after slathering soy sauce and wasabi on the sushi, some people at the table remarked that the texture could have fooled them. 

Final thought : It was expensive."
3,Was excited to try this place out as it was on Your Pittsburgh. The service was awful.  I can't blame the 2 servers/bartenders but they were just overwhelmed doing the whole place as it was full.  The food took forever as well.  I had the brisket and was disappointed with the portion size.  My date had smoked eggplant and it was just plain terrible.  Very disappointed as this is my kind of place.  I loved this decor of the place but maybe I just caught them on a bad night?
3,"Food took an hour to come out of the kitchen. It was sitting there for a good 10 minutes. We finally went up to the kitchen and asked for our food and showed out anger; afterwards the manager came up to us and offered to take care of our bill! Service was slow and staffing does need practice, but manager sure knows what he is doing! I do recommend this place for big parties or people with big appetites. I rate this at 3 stars because of the little dilemma with the food but overall this place was delicious!"
3,The food was decent..the waitresses weren't very talkative however..i heard a lot about La Unica but i didn't see the hype..maybe i'll order something else next time..
3,"Poor first impression: Staff doesn't seem interested in keeps by clientele happy.  It likely ruined my whole experience. 
The hostess was slow to seat us despite there being many empty tables.  I watched one potential customer turn around out the door when he saw us and one other person waiting to be seated.  Our waitress showed up quickly but I was 'advised' there were many people ahead of me for a latte (really- one machine?) and it might arrive after our food.   That said my daughter's oj showed up well after the people seated next to and after us got their drinks.  I declined a drink (what ever happened to cranberry juice?) and looked over the food menu.  I can't say the options were all that impressive-  fats and sugars smothering bread for most of it.  Diabetes waiting to happen for about $10-11 a plate.   When I finally got to order I asked for a cup of coffee with a shot of peppermint-  ok European cup sizes with mediocre coffee overwhelmed by huge shot of peppermint and no offer of creamer.  I finally had to ask for creamer. 

Then the food arrived and it was tasty.  A bit more oil was left on my plate than I'd like but overall the food was good.  Certainly better than the service but not necessarily enough to sending be rushing back. For the price, I'd rather head to First Watch.  The food and service is a lot better."
3,"Fun fact - Apparently this place is one of the top 10 vegan sushi places rated by PETA! 

I really admire Tenon's creativity in conjuring up vegan dishes disguised as meat, but I wouldn't say it's something that I would crave often. 

I can see how a restaurant like this can be appealing to either vegetarians/vegans who miss the meaty taste and texture and to meat eaters who are wanting to go a healthier route, but this is not for me. It was really strange eating foods that resembled the taste and texture of sashimi, chicken, and DUCK after not having it in years! They use some magic and manage to create plant-based raw fish, isn't that insane?!! Albeit an interesting experience, it was just too weird for me. I would very much rather eat avo and cucumber maki instead of fake tuna sushi. 

They also managed to mimic the taste of scallops which really freaked me out! Vegans should definitely give the scallop skewers a try if you want to throw off your taste buds - the texture and taste resemblance to scallops was uncanny. 

Overall, an interesting experience with creative food, but a little too real for my tastebuds to handle. You should definitely come if you're looking to experience a unique meal."
3,"Love this place... cannot afford most of the stuff but I did ended up with a pair of jeans that was on sale...
Sales people were nice if you are buying/ or interested in buying something... but if you are just brownsing.... they are not that helpful.
I wanted a purse that they didn't have and just because they didn't have it... they answered me like my purse brand was inferior... oh well I am buying my purse and  it will not be at the barneys :)"
3,This restaurant was okay. I would not visit it again. The service was fast and friendly. But the flavor was not there and very bland. The location just looks suspect and just not what I was expecting. I've had some excellent Mexican food across the Valley and unfortunately there was nothing here that would cause me to return. I had the chimichanga and guacamole. The chimichanga was not cooked well enough and the dough was still pretty doughy inside. The guacamole was simple with no flavor. My husband had a shrimp soup that he liked but it was just okay to me.
3,"The food was good, really overpriced.  The service was great. Everything was really clean for a fast food place.  It seems like every time I get to have Chic fil a that their food shrinks."
3,"The food here is just decent.  I got the ""Benny"", which is eggs benedict on a waffle.  The waffle was a bit softer than I like but the toppings were ok.  I ordered homes fries and bacon on the side, those were actually the best part of the meal for me.  On the plus side, service was very good and they accommodated our every need."
3,The food is very good but they tend to price the food and bit more than what the menu price says I've caught it twice while I was there just watch out when you are paying for the food
3,"The mock sashimi for dinner are rather impressive due to their looks and taste to the real sashimi. Being a small vegan cuisine at the corner of New Kennedy Square (facing Kennedy rd), it is pretty unique in the Markham area. 

Points are deducted due to the slow service (especially if you are in the rooms) and the lack of options for AYCE. Overall a decent experience and will recommend for people to try."
3,"While it's not the place to go for anything healthy the salads are very good and generous in size.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich that had a funky taste. The lettuce covered it like it was hiding the piece of chicken. Almost as a warning ""why are you eating the grilled chicken"" 
It just is not the place to order this item. 
It was rubbery and tasted like it was 100% rib meet. It is shaped like a breast and has lines on it like it is grilled. 4 stars for the salads, stay away from the grilled stuff and go with the signature fried stuff."
3,Love love love BBQ and this place was just meh - maybe it's because we got take out. Friends highly recommended so will give it a second go and eat in.   Our take out was expensive for 2 sandwiches and 3 sides. Sandwiches had minimal sauce and no extra side of sauce.
3,"Nice cute little joint. Really, really good burger but my curly fries were cold. The wife had the turkey patty and sweet potato fries and they were both fantastic. The service was really good. The young lady was very helpful when we ordered and her recommendation were spot on. Drinks are a bit small considering soft drink costs next to nothing on tap. Place was busy, mostly families and everyone seemed to be happy. Service was quick considering how busy it was. I will happily come back but the fries better be hot next time! I would have liked to give three and a half stars but that doesn't seem to be an option."
3,"I went to Wheelfish recently with my two teenaged kids.  Good beer selection and my kids liked their burgers, but my chicken and grilled vegetable serving was quite small.  Their bbq offerings seem very legit, but I was surprised with my very spare portion.  Otherwise, quite good."
3,"J'y suis allée avec mon copain avec beaucoup d'attente !  
On était affamé,  on a commandé les nachos avec les ailes de poulet , super bons , les ailes sont très croustillantes comme je les aime !
J'ai mangé le Burger ou les gauffres remplacent le pain, avec un gros morceaux de poulet panné,  bacon et fromage ! Super bon ! Mais TROP gros hihi je l'ai pris avec un side de Mac M Cheese au Smoked Meat. . Le macaroni était overcooked et le formage était trop salé. ..
Mon copain à prit la tour Burger,  c'était immense ! La première partie était bonne , mais le bas de la tour était sèche !  
Nous avons été un peu déçu. .. Ça nous a coûté 95$ .. tout de même cher pour deux !"
3,The margarita tasted like lime juice and sugar. It was terrible. Our server was very nice but seemed to get flustered very quickly when asked any questions. We kept trying to get someone's attention to get our check and when we finally did we had our money out to pay she just dropped the check and didn't come back for ten minutes.  It was about 8:30 on a Tuesday and it didn't seem like they were very busy so I'm not sure why it took so long. The food was pretty good. Aside from the fact one menu item was described as 'spicy' and wasn't even mildly spicy. I know that they are still in their early stages of opening so I may give them another chance in a few months but I won't be returning any time soon.
3,"No frills here, just some cheap Mexican food that hits the spot. This place is 5 minutes from my house, so it often wins during my hungover, queso craving recovery days. 

They bring you both a mild and spicy salsa with your chips. Pro tip: ask for the green salsa as well. Spicy and delicious. When asking for queso, make sure to specify dip or else you'll end up with a side of shredded cheese. 

Tuesdays can get pretty busy here for dollar authentic tacos. I like that they have a long list of options for this (chicken, steak, chorizo, veggies, beef tongue, shredded beef, chunky or roast pork). Most places skimp on $1 nights and only give you a couple choices. Aside from dollar taco night, the entire menu (especially for lunch) is pretty cheap. 

Nice covered patio. The bathrooms are located in the space between La Unica and Kickstand. The parking lot is kind of rough, so make sure to just pay attention and drive carefully."
3,"Tenon Vegetarian Cuisine is not a bad choice if you dine with your vegetarian friends... 

There are a great selections of Japanese, Chinese and Thai items on the menu to choose from, hopeful you will find something that everyone will enjoy.
 
But if you are dining alone or you just not into sharing, at least they have Bento boxes you can choose from.

My Bento Box B ($11.99) comes with:
- Miso Soup: serves lurk warm.. meh
- Seaweed Salad: quite standard supermarket quality
- Vegetables Tempura: batter is light, maybe too light and they are all super oily
- California Roll: quite good, taste wise compatible to the non vegetarian version
- Beef Teriyaki: great presentation.. they do looks like beef.. :) 

For $11.99 as a non vegetarian, I could have get the ""real"" beef teriyaki and it probably taste better? But Tenon is a great place to dine with fellow vegetarians... 

15% Specials so at least I am not paying full price. Lunch Specials till 3 pm but no extra discount...

What?!! My friend just turns Vegan!!!"
3,"I wasn't impressed with the food, but I got the eggplant, not meat. We went twice when there was a band which made the experience more fun. When you were in the bar area you weren't able to hear the singer which is insane for how small the place is."
3,Pulled pork Nachos and the smoked wings are REALLY good but these are the only dishes I have enjoyed. Brisket is my favorite BBQ dish but theirs needs some improvement in my opinion. For a neighborhood bar and restaurant Its convenient but I also feel its a little overpriced.
3,"I met a friend for a mid-monday lunch.  Breakfast was the food of choice since it was his birthday!  I have never been a big waffles person.  (No to pancakes too)  But - being that I was at a waffle place - I felt like it was inevitable that I get waffles.

IF i am going to eat waffles - I like them with some crunch.  My megaberry waffles - while beautiful was relatively soggy.  I know it had some reduction on it - that helped with the ""soggieness""  but the outside could have still had a bit of crunch - right?  Maybe that's just my preference.

While I didn't finish my waffles - I did finish the scrumptious berries!  My friend got the Chicken and waffles and devoured it. 

They were not busy - granted it was a Monday.  I can see it being packed on the weekendds.  The service was great.   I would definitely go back - but go for their non-waffle selection next time ;)"
3,"The sushi doesn't really taste like sushi but it is interesting to try, it's kind of chewy. But definitely get the soy chicken teriyaki, it's amazing and tastes so good. Can't even tell that it's not real. Also had the sweet and sour eel, it's interesting, not bad but nothing amazing like the teriyaki. I wouldn't get the eel again if I go back"
3,"I like Chick-Fil-A. They deserve props for inventing the chicken sandwich, for the cute cow commercials and for maintaining their religious principles. That said, I don't really care for this location. It's cramped, with a lot of tables and a children's play area crammed into a very small space. Also, no way to refill your soda on your own. Chick-Fil-A overall is a bit expensive for what it is, perhaps in part a consequence of its closed on Sunday policy.

I tried their grilled chicken nuggets a la carte on my recent visit. How disappointing. They came out soggy, sealed in a plastic container, where they had apparently been for quite some time. Gross! Gross! Gross! Definitely no resemblance to the promotional photographs! When I mentioned how disgusting they were to another family member, they immediately asked, ""Did you go at lunchtime?"" ""They make bigger quantities in advance at lunchtime and the food then is never as good."" Hmm. Makes some sense, I guess. Still, over five bucks for six tiny slime covered grilled nuggets and the smallest small sized soft drink I've seen in years, leaves me less than enthusiastic in any case. Plus, call me silly, but I like to eat lunch at lunchtime."
3,Went for taco Tuesday (1$ tacos) and the food was pretty good and came out fast but overall wasn't that special. Service could've been better as well.
3,I am updating this review because I have noticed that it might be a cultural difference that cleaning and sweeping may take place near you having your meal in a Mexican restaurant. I have had it occur in another restaurant but I am not quite comfortable with it.
3,"A coffee house vegan place with alcohol. Seems like a neat place to hang out and play board games - there are a few couches and long tables, and the decor is interesting. 

Their menu is pretty small, with a few sandwiches and salads, and they have a breakfast menu until 11. Their sandwiches all have the same bread, cheese, so they're a bit one note. The grilled cheese was fine but not super gooey and the bread was fairly crisp. I also got a side salad, though you can also get chips and a sweet pickle.

You order at the counter and then the food is brought out to you. They brought out the sandwiches one by one and there were long lags in between which was quite disappointing. 

This isn't really the eye-opening place that will convert nonvegans to vegans but it was okay. Faster, sweeter service and more unique foods would improve this spot."
3,"I checked in with the NoWait app, which has recently partnered with Yelp, but when we got there, the hostess reported that it hadn't registered me as checked in. Frustrating, but he sat us within 8-10 minutes of coming here, and was very friendly and accommodating about it. We ordered the caprese crab omelette and toast as well as a cinnamon waffle with whipped cream. Both were decently satisfying, and the maple syrup felt delightfully light in comparison to most store bought syrups. However, the portion size of the omelette was quite small, and we thought it would be larger since my father and I were sharing it. Overall, welcoming place, a cool little waffle joint. I'll have to come back to review it again!"
3,"Good selection of burgers but it sometimes feels like the combinations are a little random. Once you find something you like, stick with it. Fries and other sides are okay but I've had better elsewhere. As far as sit down burger diners in the west island go, however, it's a decent option."
3,Burger is good maybe better than good but not outstanding. Toppings are on point the jelepeno Iwere actually a bit hot. Bun was very good. Fries were limp and over cooked poor at best. Staff got it right just attentive enough but not too much. I can see why Poutine is popular here no one knows how to make correct fries here.
3,"It was really cheap, but just didn't do anything for me when I got the pizza sandwich on a pretzel, of course. Maybe I'll go back and get their regular pretzels."
3,"My wife and I came here for the first time this morning. She had the BC Breakfast while I ordered Crepes with cream cheese and blueberries. It took nearly 45 minutes before we were served the breakfast. (To be fair, the restaurant had a large number of patrons.) My wife found her breakfast quite satisfying. I wish I could say the same about my crepes which were small and leathery, the toughest crepes I have ever had. The blueberries were tasteless, the creme cheese sparse. The presentation on a large square plate made the crepes look even smaller. The coffee cups were also small, certainly the smallest I have ever used in a breakfast restaurant. My wife found the over-easy eggs satisfying, and considered the home-fried potatoes among the best-tasting of any she's had in a restaurant. Because the restaurant was crowded, the noise level made conversation difficult."
3,"i'm not sure what i love about this place.  but every visit to pittsburgh seems to include a stop by this cheap take-out eatery on the southside.

its menu is simple:  pretzels.  you can get a bag of five hot, soft pretzels for $2.  however, the main attraction are its pretzel sandwiches.  the choices vary depending on the day, such as chicken salad, the club, buffalo chicken, tuna fish and more!  that said, the owner is sweet and made me a custom order of buffalo chicken once because of an undying craving.  the price varies based on whats in between the pretzels, but they all seem to be little more than $2.  yes, this place is CHEAP.

there's no where to sit down.. and there can be a line during prime lunch hours.  but if you love pretzels, this unique eatery is worth stopping by."
3,"Okay, I know I shouldn't have ordered nachos for lunch. But it sounded good. I also now know to order tacos at a place called mucho taco. All the tacos and other food flowing from the kitchen did look really good, so I was excited to get my nachos. Waste of $5. A little bit of bean and a little cheese, that's it. I do think I will come back at some point for the tacos but avoid the nachos! - see picture!"
3,"Whoa there, Barneys New York Las Vegas. No. Back off. Go away. Off.

I visited Vegas about a week before my birthday, so I went to Barneys to see if there was anything I wanted to buy for myself on my husband's behalf. There was a sale going on, and I browsed the shoes for a while, and almost convinced myself to get a beautiful but very impractical pair of Dries van Noten heels before moving on with my life. I like Barneys in general. Nice aesthetic, interesting shoes and clothes and bags, great for window shopping. This one was on the small side, but well organized and fun to browse.

When I didn't find anything perfect to buy, I decided to get some makeup. (I must've really felt like spending money.) I found a great Nars lipstick and asked a beautifully made-up woman to help me find a few things and while she was at it, make my face look nice. I ended up looking kind of like a clown, but she was very sweet and I liked her a lot. (Also, clown make-up works okay in Vegas.) I ended up buying a powder in addition to the lipstick, and was relieved when the other two things I liked were out of stock.

The problem was not with this girl, but with the old woman representing a skincare line on the Barneys floor. She came over unasked and gave me what was more or less a mini facial to prep my skin for make-up. (I'd thought she was just going to put a little moisturizer on, but whoops.) I felt bad when she was done with her demo and thought about buying one of the products, since they seemed decent enough. I asked her to quote me prices, and they were insane. The moisturizer (which is the thing I thought about getting) was $190, and I think it went up from there. I declined, very awkwardly, but politely, by saying it was all out of my price range.

Her response: ""You can open up a card.""

Wait, WHAT? Look, I know that the Vegas economy pretty much depends on getting people to make bad decisions about money, but shouldn't that shit stay on the casino floor? Apparently not! You get hustled trying to buy fucking lipstick.

When I said I couldn't afford $190 moisturizer, I didn't mean I didn't have $190 in my bank account--I meant that my current lifestyle does not accommodate $190 moisturizer and all the other shit that would come before I bought $190 moisturizer. If I actually only had $185 in my bank account, I should probably do other things with it before buying $190 moisturizer--like, for example, buying groceries and saving up to move out of my parents' house. I felt pretty confident about declining to open up a credit card, but I hope that never works on anyone. And even if it doesn't, the fucking gall of that woman. How does she sleep at night?

Anyway, Barneys is fun, and if you have the money, there's plenty of ways to spend it. But don't open up a credit card to buy mysterious creams and serums. Just avoid that section altogether. It's a trap."
3,Solid place for smoked meats. We only had the pulled pork nacho and it was the tits. Defently will be coming back to try some others!
3,"Our family loves Chick-Fil-A.. BUT this location needs some work. After the 4th visit today, the drive-thru team is rushed and impersonal and doesn't care to listen to what we ask for. They have messed up 2 out of the 4 orders, and they don't take the time to make sure it's right. When I asked for additional sauce they say oh it's in there, when in fact it's not. The other location at Shea and 101 is by far better customer service and always cares on what we ask for-and checks. Wish this location would get it together!"
3,"The place is all right, looks like an old fashion dinner but you feel like your going to gain 10 pounds just looking at the menu.  The food is decent and classic"
3,"Reasonably priced, standard Mexican food. Nothing mind blowing although the past 2 times we've been have both been disappointing. My boyfriend ordered the ACP which was mushy and my torta was practically all bread which was stale. The server also brought out fries which are optional with the tortas except I didn't order them but was still charged. The margaritas have also been watery the past few times we've gotten them."
3,"Even though it was a small place and busy, we didn't have to wait very long (thanks to the No Wait ap). The coffee was great and they had a busgirl come by and fill people's cups whenever they were near empty. Which was key because the cups were really small. 

I got the eggs benny which comes on half a waffle with ham and crab meat. I asked for the waffle to be crispy, but i felt like it still could have been cooked a little more ""burnt."" It was still good, though. And even though it was small it was still filling. 

My wife got the BC breakfast, with egg whites, a double order of fruit, blueberry toast, and a salad. Her egg whites were a little runny in the middle, but she didn't have the opportunity to send them back because our waitress never came by to ask how everything was. Also, I don't think the double fruit was really two orders. Maybe 1.5 at most. 

We may go back, but wouldn't make a special trip to do so."
3,"My sister and I were really excited to try Volstead because it's another of the highly rated spots in downtown Mesa, but I can't say this has been my favorite in the area. It's a cute place, but we weren't crazy about the food. 

We went at lunch time and split the Copper State Sandwich, which is vegan cheese, green chilies, and chipotle mayo on sourdough bread. To be honest, I didn't think it was anything special. It was too cheesy for me, with very few green chilies, and I can't say I even noticed the mayo. It is affordable though, we split that with chips and a pickle, which was filling for us both and only about $9 total :)

It is cool that this is a vegan/vegetarian restaurant offering a menu with vegan cheese items and vegan chicken, ham, soyrizo, etc. They do have regular cheese if you'd like though, we found that out while ordering.

Other than that, I did like the atmosphere, though it was a bit dark inside. It's a fun cafe with a lounge area for reading, and I saw a few games as well. If you like to bring your work to cafes, I'd say this is a good spot! It's very quiet and not too crowded, and they have free WiFi."
3,My first and only visit to Wheelfish. The ribs did NOT fall off the bone. The Mac and cheese was one step above box Mac and cheese. My wife pulled pork was average and her sweet potato fries were good. Service was slow although she was friendly. It's a cute inside. Please try it and make up your own mind.
3,I found out about tenon from a friend and decided to try it out since my favourite vegetarian sushi place closed down. I thought the service was nice. Overall the food was good good choice of soups and appetizers and as for the rolls the faux spicy salmon was my favourite.
3,"I can't rate these guys past their drip coffee and maybe 1 of their confections...but it SMELLS delicious. 

We pop in for a $1.75 coffee now and again. Staff is friendly, fast and courteous. 

There is usually at least 3 other people there and more arrive as we leave. Seems to be a Southside institution!"
3,"Even though it was a small place and busy, we didn't have to wait very long (thanks to the No Wait ap). The coffee was great and they had a busgirl come by and fill people's cups whenever they were near empty. Which was key because the cups were really small.

We may go back, but wouldn't make a special trip to do so."
3,"Friendly reps, painfully high tire price quote.  Found em for $100 less, per tire while waiting for my car to be pulled up."
3,"I received a rebate back last week from the Discount Tire Black Friday deal. I have been a customer for America's Tire Company/Discount Tire for many years and have bought a number of set of tires. So when I saw they had a deal for Black Friday 2015, I was excited to get a deal. The rebate is one that I had to email in and ran into some delays, however I received a rebate check. While their add seemed to imply a $100 rebate for best quality tires or $75 for better rated tires, my rebate check was for $50. That is less than 10% of what I paid. The tires are good and the customer service was good but I am disappointed with such a low rebate for a Black Friday deal especially when competitors were offering buy 3 get one free. Moral learned from my story, if you see what looks like a deal, make sure to shop around if price is matters to you."
3,"Amazing looking store, I loved everything in it.
If possible I would ahve bought the entire co-op section.
and the shoes and the handbags and the jewlery and.....

I came here looking for a Balenciaga handbag.  The sales woman was not helpful at all.  I asked her if they hada certain style in black and without checking she said no.  A minutes later I found the purse on another rack.  She paid zero attention to me.  It's not like I walked into the store wearing sweats or something! 

Too bad for her, I didn't buy the bag.  I'll wait to buy it at South Coast Plaza.

5 stars for the store.
1 for the sales associates!

btw! the stairs are really steep."
3,"I came here for lunch and ate a pretzel sandwich.

A PRETZEL SANDWICH! 

Whoever came up with this idea is a genius. I didn't even know such a thing existed! 

Unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which really wasn't bad, however the sandwiches are premade and I'm pretty sure the chicken was just a frozen patty.

Damn you pretzel sandwich you sounded so good!"
3,"The interior design is cool and warm, and the service was decent enough, but none of that can outweigh truly mediocre coffee, which if you're a coffeehouse, is kind of important."
3,"Maybe it was just the wrong time of day, but my pretzels were stale and they lasted like they've been sitting out for a few hours. My boyfriend got the cinnamon pretzel bites and I got normal salted pretzel bites and they both tasted hard and stale. It's a cute shop and is definitely unique, maybe we just came at the wrong time."
3,"When we saw WI was coming to Wexford we were excited for it to open and try it. Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations.

I echo what many others said in the previous reviews: sign is too small (easy to miss), smells gross when you first walk in, slow service, food takes way too long. 

However, I disagree on one primary thing. My husband and I were not impressed with the food. It's fair at best. I hate bad service (especially when you have to beg for drinks like we did), but there is no reason to go back when the food is average. 

I ordered the Southern Breakfast (waffle stuffed (or should I say contains a tiny bit of) with chorizo (Mexican sausage, which I normally love, but it didn't taste like chorizo at all so just call it sausage) and an egg. It was just ok because it only had a little bit of chorizo and the waffle just was ok.

My husband had the chicken and waffles. Everyone raved about it (and he normally loves it), but did not agree. He thought the chicken was bland (and he likes plain food) and the waffle was just ok.

The only good thing about this experience was the home fries. They were very good (a little too salty), but not enough to bring us back.

We were happy to have another breakfast spot in Wexford. Too bad this place falls way short. Hope they get their act together."
3,"This is a 50's type diner.  The menu looked incredible. The food was about. 3 out of 5. The burgers were just a bit on the dry side but tasted fine.  The onions ring were very good but were battered and not breaded. This could just be a matter of personal taste.

The service was excellent. Establishment is clean and bright."

Went to this restaurant for the first time. My wife and sister-in-law has been there several times, and love this place. We were here with a group of 11, just after lunch
 
Location: Marché de l'Ouest - Lots of parking. West end of the city. 5/5 stars
 
Atmosphere: It's a classic American style diner with 60's décor. Music wasn't too loud. They did have TV's everywhere just in case you didn't want to miss the game. They have a massive dining area, and I'm not sure how long the wait is for a table during busy time. They have over sized booths which are nice, but the floor under my seat was sticky, as if they were not mopped after a spill. 4/5 stars
 
Service: Upon arriving, we waited 5 minutes before someone acknowledged us. There was no hostess at the front or they were somewhere else. After seating, the waiter took our drink orders. Usually, a waiter would come once or twice to if your party is ready to order. I am not sure where he went, but we had to call another waiter to take our order. It took longer for us to receive our food, but that's given since we are a large group (11). The place was not packed, maybe 3 or 4 large groups and a few smaller tables. We've asked several servers to refill our drinks. Only after the 4th or 5th time asking, they finally acted. I don't know if there is some kind of rule at this place where you serve the tables your are assigned, that isn't right. Overall I think the service can be improved. 3/5 stars
 
Food: The menu is large! I have never been to a diner style restaurant with such a big menu. Although it's probably because of all their specialty burgers (poutine burger, porky pig, Honolulu, etc.). There is also 9 types of mac and cheese, 10 types of poutine, and don't forget their hot dogs, sandwiches, salads and appetizers. There was a mix of different foods at our table. I had ordered a poutine burger with curly fries. Nothing really special, it's like they slapped a poutine inside a burger. My wife had the rodeo hot dog with an expresso milkshake. Since we share everything I enjoyed her dish more than mine. The smokey bbq sauce with the pulled pork was excellent and the caramelized onions was like the cherry on top of a sundae. The milkshake wasn't bad either. 3.5/5 stars
 
Price: This place is not bad priced. Considering a poutine burger was $14.45, I don't think I can get a quality burger with a poutine on the side for less than $15. We spent just over $200 for a party of 11. Not bad at all. 4/5 stars
 
Overall: I would go back for the food and try one of their specialties, but part of eating out is the experience, and the service was a bad experience. I think you need to step up your game Jukebox. Will give the service another chance next time we are in Montreal. 3.5/5 stars

3,"Service was excellent, but crepes were terrible. Friends got waffles (breakfast magic) that were pretty good but everything was pretty overpriced. Coffee tasted good and it's nice to see a small business being busy, but I'd like to have better quality food that actually comes hot for the price!!"
3,"This is another cool addition to downtown Mesa after the light rail. I've only had a cup of coffee (to go) so far, so all I can say for certain is it's a good place to get coffee on a weekday morning. I'd like to go back to try more of their coffee drinks, especially the lavender toddy."
3,"The burgers are not very good, kinda dry and lacks taste for 15$... mcdonalds burgers are tastier and jucier. Also, the mac and cheese apparently had ""home made sauce"" but wierdly enough, it tastes just like good old kraft dinner. We went cause it was featured in Mtlblog, the decor is really cool though. Burger de ville is wayyyyy better!!"
3,"I was really looking forward to eating at Tenon.  We decided on the bento boxes rather than the AYCE.  I chose box C with sushi, sashimi, california roll, futomaki and edamame.  I was quite disappointed with the sushi and sashimi.  The sushi was just pieces of gluten on sushi rice and the salmon sashimi was mediocre. The futomaki and california rolls were very good.  

Mr Leny had box A with chicken teriyaki, veg tempura, california rolls, seaweed salad and rice.  The chicken teriyaki was very good but the tempura was quite greasy.

Service was friendly and quick.  I had such high hopes since Joe Yee closed.  They had the best bento lunch boxes.  I am still curious about Tenon's AYCE and will probably return to try it."
3,"Ironically, I did not order the tacos, even though that is my staple choice at a new Mexican restaurant. Instead, I opted for a chicken, bean and rice burrito. It wasn't half bad! I added lots of the hot sauce and thought the overall consistency was great. The chicken was tender and flavors tasted fresh. My gf was not overjoyed with her Chimichanga meal, which was rather sloppy and wet. It had some crispy parts, but just wasn't up to her standards. She agreed the burrito was much better.

Our carry out order included several chips (6-7) and sauces. We ate some of the spicy carrots while we waited, which were ok. For being a hole in the wall Mexican place with a funny name, I liked it."
3,"I heard about this place when I moved to Pittsburgh and everyone said that you had to go there and get Pretzels. Well I did and I don't see why everyone likes it so much. 

Don't get me wrong the Pretzels are good, but it's not life altering in anyway. 

My major beef with this place is their breakfast pretzel. It's like a salty sweet soft pretzel that is meant for breakfast. I think they are kind of gross. They seem to use regular table salt and sugar and the salt over powers the sugar and just tastes like a really salty soft pretzel. Which in my mind is not good for breakfast at all. 

When people at work get them and if I'm really hungry I have to say to myself before taking a bite ""salt...it's going to be salty"" and then take a bit. Else it takes me by surprise every time. 

Maybe I'm wrong, so try it for yourself"
3,"I went 3 days ago and got a meal of Chick-fil-A Nuggets with waffle potato fries and a lemonade drink. The nuggets are ok, I think the fries were better. And the lemonade was too sweet too much sugar...diabetes? As for the sauces, the only one I liked was the bbq but they stingy with them."
3,"I've been wanting to try some vegan food options for a while now, so I was excited to try some of the things they have at Volstead. We got the Copper State sandwich, which is basically a grilled cheese with vegan cheese, green chiles and chipotle mayo. While it wasn't bad at all, it definitely wasn't one of the better sandwiches I've had in a while. It kind of just wasn't anything special in my opinion. I also think they went a little heavy on the cheese and could've used more green chiles. 

That said, I do think the restaurant has very reasonably priced food, because you get a big sandwich plus chips and a pickle for a pretty low price :) I would like to try their coffee, but I didn't have any this time. I'm not sure that I'd rush back here, but I'm definitely glad we finally tried it!"
3,"I was excited for all the great reviews on yelp. But when I made the journey to Tenon for Mother's Day, I was underwhelmed to say the least. Maybe I just didn't order the right items, but it was VERY pricey. And the food was just average. The positive is that I didn't miss the meat too much. The downside is that I just had higher expectations on taste and service. Service was extremely slow. Had to request the same items multiple times before they actually brought it. Interesting vegetarian dining experience, but likely would not return."
3,"Food was amazing. Server was very friendly, but was not very good. The coffee cups are very small, and she was pouring half cups of coffee. The coffee also tasted like bad gas station coffee. Surprised since breakfast places usually have great coffee. Our food took a really long time and the people next to us waited an hour for food because the server forgot to put in the check. We've all been there. The checks got messed up and I ended up being charged for double what we owed. The manager was very nice and did as much as he possible could to fix the situation. So, breakdown....foods amazing, service is bad(this time), coffees gross, but the staff is very friendly. We will be going back after they get more settled into this new location."
3,"To start off, I don't believe this place has the right kitchen talent to ""bring it"" so to speak.  Compared to Graceful, which shut down due to their lease expiring, Tenon is not anywhere close.  A good sushi place ""always"" make their own wasabi and ginger, never depending on some wholesale junk.  As for the imitation meat, there was nothing real or authentic to it.  I give 3 Star only to be fair since there is only 1 vegan sushi available right now to compare to in the Toronto area.  I hope things can improve someday so I can upgrade my ratings, this idea was successfully tried in Hong Kong back in the 90's..."
3,"You want a burrito, that's just what you'll get. La Unica is a place where you can count on no-frills, solid food and portions that will blow your mind. 

It's a little strange to get into this location. From Central Ave, there isn't really a ""front"". The door which looks like a front door is actually a door that goes to their kitchen. So, you need to enter though Kickstand or the back. There's an awesome outdoor patio and the best part is the mega margs. I was hoping for a jalapeno marg, but it didn't come in the mega size, but our server was great enough to provide me with that one! 

If you have a spicey need, you might want to keep going because they didn't have an extra hot sauce or anything beyond Cholula."
3,"This place is OK. Went with a couple of friends. Everything on the menu sounds delicious. My issue is mostly with the speed of service. We waited 35 mins to be sat, which was to be expected and didn't bother us. However, once we were seated we were given drinks and then basically abandoned. It was 30 minutes before we were able to order. Then the longest part of the waiting... 40 minutes for our food (all waffles). Which even then, wouldn't have been so bad if we didn't have to watch as other parties who were seated after us get fed within 12 mins of placing their order. 
I got the southern waffle and added avocado. The batter they are using is great. The waffle was light and spongy and tasted fresh. The portion sizes are small. I don't know how every one else feels, but when I think of eating a waffle, I think of being full with yummy syrupy fluffy goodness for a good portion of the day. My check ended up being over $12 for just a waffle (not including tip) and I unfortunately, left the place still hungry. I really expected to love this place, but it just didn't happen.


Ps. The owner might want to look into exhaust (installing or repairing) fans above the kitchen area... our entire party left the place smelling like old grease. Blechhhh."
3,"I love the spicy chicken sandwich, also the iced tea/lemonade mixture I usually get instead of soda. The waffle fries are usually awesome when they are fresh out of the fryer... unfortunately the batch I got yesterday were cold and tasted like an ashtray. The dog enjoyed them, though."
3,"I really want to like it here, the decor is cute and the staff is friendly and helpful. However, a half filled cocktail with a huge chunk of ice leaves a lot to be desired."
3,"I really want to love this place. But in all honesty, the only reason I ever go here is because it's five minutes from my house.

Maybe it's me. I had heard all kinds of great things about La Unica. Maybe I set the bar too high in my head. I've been here a handful of times now and nothing has been overly impressive. Nothing has been bad... it's just all okay. One thing I will not recommend is the ceviche. Probably should've known better than to order that in a place like this, but we really wanted to try it.

I like that they bring you two different kinds of salsa. One hot, one mild. I like the cheese dip, too. They usually have drink specials of some sort. Nice spot to get down on some chips and cheap drinks. The lunch menu is reasonably priced. Tuesdays they have dollar tacos. 

Not terrible, not fantastic. A-OK. I just think there are much better Mexican spots near/around the Plaza Midwood area."
3,"Went to Tenon for birthday dinner Friday night because we were looking for a vegetarian/vegan place and heard from friends that this was the place to be.

Service was quick and friendly. The restaurant wasn't too busy, but we did make reservations just in case.

We had the a la carte menu instead of the ayce. We ordered a couple dishes like the special dragon rolls and mango rolls which were pretty good. Also had the agadashi tofu which was disappointing to say the least as it was dry and tasteless. We also ordered thai style noodle which was essentially udon noodles in sweet red colored sauce with basil.  Also ordered stone pot mixed vegetables with 'chicken' tasted pretty good, the 'chicken' which was gluten was ok but still doesn't really taste like chicken.

All in all the place was not bad. If anyone is looking for vegetation/vegan in Markham  then you should try it out."
3,"This was my latest taco stop, and it is an all around fine place. I had their tripe tacos, the al pastor and the carne asada. The tripe, I asked for extra crispy and it was but I don't think they clean out the tripe, so it is a little grainy, a little gross if you think about it but it is perfectly sanitary since it has been deep fried to a crisp except the inside is again grainy. Carne Asade taco was good, crisp and chewy, lacked a little flavor. The Al Pastor was so so, it taste just like chorizo seasoning, that is the second place that has happened so I don't know if it might be a regional thing. Coming from out of state, the Al pastor tacos I had before had seasoning but not like this though. They did give free chips if you eat in, They were okay, their drinks are not home made, just come from a dispenser like others. I would give it a lower score, but they were definitely better than some of the others. I would mostly likely never come back since nothing was worth coming back for. It is an okay taco place though if you are around the corner and needed a place to eat. I ate 4 tacos and a medium drink and came to be around 9.50 so I would have to say it is average in cost."
3,Went here as recommendation on a friend. A nice choice for the food and atmosphere. Can't say the same for the service or host. Wrote comment on the receipt with a phone number realized they are closed on Sundays. Still would of thought that the server would of shown the manager and would of heard from someone. Well let's see if they see this review and reach out. Would go back for food prob sit at bar and eat.
3,"A crazy choice of ""American diner"" style food. Was not overly impressed with anything. The Mac and cheese had zero taste and the burger wasn't anything special. They do make a mean milkshake."
3,"It's funny that my experience was the exact opposite of others.  All the salespeople I encountered were super friendly (especially the fragrance lady). 

The store is beautiful but I found the selection sparse. I've never walked into Barneys without finding something I want to try on or at least wish I had the $$ to buy!"
3,Great place for lunch. I always end up hungry afterwards though. The pretzels are delicious. Especially if you get the optional side of cheese.
3,Stopped here to grab some food before my visit in Canada came to an end! 50's styled decor and feel with pictures of Elvis Presley lol cute little joint & their milkshakes were great! But the food was typical. The burger was dry so I couldn't finish it! Nothing special at all to be honest!  Also the curly fries are definitely better in the states! other than that an a-ok experience!
3,This Discount Tire location is a little more professional than the one on Ray Rd. In Gilbert. The staff is alot more knowledgeable about what they're doing.
3,Hello... The Taste is fabulous as close as to my gmas home cooking as it gets. It's normally 1 server 1 cook but I think they should invest a little more into their staff I'm sure the customers would appreciate it and that delicious food would just keep on yielding profits!! Great food but I gave it a 3 cuz that poor girl works her butt off and it's not fair.
3,"Eh it was ok, not as amazing as everyone tells me it is. When I lived in Vegas everyone would say if Chick-Fil-A was here Raisin Cane's would be put to shame...HAHAHA yeah right! I am glad I tried this now because nothing here stacks up to it. The Chicken was really solid could tell it was fresh cut before fried. But it just was lacking in flavor. The sauce was not inspiring but OK. ( I did take 8 packs home to Seattle with me) But it was nothing like the Canes sauce. The Sweet Tea was even disappointing vs Raising Canes. Overall compared to other fast foods it is better than most. But, I only eat fast food if it is outstanding and this was not it."
3,"I have eaten here twice. The first time was a great experience and the service was good. The second time they seemed to be out of everything and the service was not impressive. I tried to order a burger but they were out, than we tried to order Irish mules but they were out of ginger beer. I ended up with a Manhattan which I did enjoy. My pulled pork was disappointing though. It was overdone. It had big pieces that were burnt to a crisp. It wasn't the kind of burn that makes bbq taste better, it was the kind of burnt taste that overpowers the dish. I would give it another chance because my friends did enjoy their meals. Maybe I caught them on an off night."
3,"I came on a Saturday night and had no wait to be seated, or for food which was nice.  They had a margarita pitcher on special for $16.  It tasted petty good, a little sour, but not bad.  The chips and salsa were fresh and spicy.  I prefer the most spicy and chunky one.  I ordered a hard and soft beef taco.  I preferred the soft.  The beef was a little on the greasy side, but overall ok.  The service was excellent and the atmosphere was nice.  NOTE: do not try to enter at the the front of the building!! *Entrance in rear* :)"
3,"Mucho Taco was ok.  It was nothing unforgettable; in fact, I'd forgotten about it.  While reading Andrew S's review I got to the part about his gf's Chimichanga, and I did a double take because I hadn't realized I'd been with him  for the experience in question.

As mushy as the chimichanga was, it had good flavor.  I'd give the place another chance, and probably get a burrito.  My only other complaint is what seemed like an unnecessarily long wait to get our take-out order.  

Located next to a Goodwill and in the same strip as several other small businesses, this place is easy to miss.  I probably wouldn't miss it if I weren't to retuurn, but it's decent enough if I needed some Mexican food nearby."
3,"I've gone here several times and had mixed experiences.  The first two visits were positive and I was happy with the quality of the drinks.

However, I was disappointed with my list visit.  I ordered a hot chai latte to go only to discover that it was barely lukewarm, at best.  The taste also seemed a bit off- needless to say, I didn't drink much of it.

May wait a while before giving it another try..."
3,"We were looking for healthy options for dinner and thought we'd try out Tenon Vegetarian Cuisine. It is a vegan Japanese restaurant with foods that mimic meats, seafood etc. It's a good option for those who are vegan.
Service was good.

GREEN DRAGON ROLL (4/5)
(Avocado, imitation crab meat sushi roll)
We loved it! The avocado was fresh and the imitation crab meat was still warm (I think it was served tempura-style). Yummy :)

SALMON SUSHI (2.5/5)
It's fake salmon! It's actually very cool. The texture of the salmon is similar to konjac (konnyaku) or jelly but the taste is like.. salmon!! D: Why the 2.5 stars though? It's just too weird for me to try again hahaha

BENTO COMBO - CHICKEN TERIYAKI (2/5)
I didn't like this. The fake chicken meat tasted very mushy and the sauce wasn't good."
3,"Try not to go to this place during the vegetarian Chinese holidays (using around the time there's a full moon) as those are the days this restaurant is busy due to people who are vegetarian on these specific days. In other words, 30 minute wait for a table, 15 min to get the menu,  20 min to get their attention and then something happens where they forget and then attend to something else. 

The food here is not bad, especially if you're a vegetarian. If you have lots of vegetarian friends, expect to see somebody you may know there. Bento boxes were decent but the portions were pretty big imo. Couldn't even finish my portion considering how hungry I was with all the wait time. I would have to come again on a non-busy time. Until then."
3,"This store is always empty. The service is okay. The staff does greet me, which is nice, but when the store is so empty and large I'd expect a little bit more of a welcome. The men's clothing selection is just okay. There isn't a lot denim to choose from."
3,Typically on every visit to this fine establishment the service and food and has been spectacular. However this time I suffered from a subpar experience. The meal was less than adequate and was quite underwhelming.
3,"I am really disappointed. I ordered the green chile pork plant. Was extremely bland and skimpy. It didn't even taste or look like pork to be honest. I think they used chicken. I had to used a bunch of salt, lime and salsa to even make it take remotely good. I asked for two side beans but only looked like one. There was barely even me on my plate the whole thing was just covered in sauce. This used to be one of my favorite places to go but lately they have just been slacking on their quality of food. I don't think I will be coming back anymore."
3,"Service is quick but one thing I have realized in the 5 times that I ate here is that their hamburgers have become quite soggy. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, reminds you of the 50's and service is quick. However there is some improvement to do on the quality of the food, most importantly the burgers which is what they're known for. The fries are good and crunchy. They just put so much on their burgers that is falls apart when you eat it. I would rather flavour versus portion."
3,The mac and cheese tastes like kraft dinner & the burgers were nothing special. It was very overpriced for the quality of food you get.
3,"Good food.  Decent prices. Appropriate portions.  Boring atmosphere.  They did the best they could in a strip mall building.   Clean and bright.   It is a solid choice, but didn't get ""wowed"" by the experience."
3,"Have been driving by this place since it opened and after seeing it profiled on You Gotta Eat Here we finally decided to try it out. Make sure to bring your appetite because the servings are pretty generous. The ambiance is very retro and fun my daughter said she felt like she was in an episode of Riverdale. The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  I had the the Hot Rod (bacon, caramelized onions jalapeno, jalapeno havarti and lettuce) with a side of sweet potato fries and blue cheese dipping sauce), My daughter had the Frankie with a Caesar salad size and a Strawberry Milkshake (delicious) and the hub had the Meat lovers Mac and Cheese. The food was very tasty although I thought my burger was going to be a little spicier and it was a tad overdone but still good. The Mac and Cheese was loaded and also very good. Will definitely go back"
3,"I do not get to much of a chance to shop here, Since I live in Las Vegas, like most locals, I try to avoid the Strip like the plague. I like the selection. The store is clean and very shop-able. I come here to Barneys, because it carries one of my favorite colognes, Gendarme'.  If you are in Vegas, you need to stop in."
3,"I've been here a few times and plan to return. The staff has always been friendly, and the coffee drinks and grilled cheese excellent. They also have wifi.

There are a couple things they need to improve:
* They don't clean tables after a customer leaves. The tables are always full of crumbs or sticky.
* They don't do a good job of cleaning the stuff on the side table, like the water container.
* They take a long time to make a drink. I appreciate the fresh grinding, but unless no one else in line, getting a drink becomes a time commitment.

I recommend Volstead to my vegan and vegetarian friends, since they'll like the food options. For other friends, I'd suggest going somewhere where they can find a clean table."
3,"I had this strange feeling that I would find the winter coat I've spent the last two months shopping for, at Barney's.  I walk in and take the escalator 3 flights up and work my way across the room.  I go through the Prada, Canali, Cavalli, D&G, blah blah blah and still nothing looks good to me.

Then another shopper taps me on my shoulder and asks if I could try some jackets on for her.  Normally I wouldn't grant this type of favor on a stranger, but she was quite the stunner, so I relented on my rigid rule on this particular instance.  I asked if she were shopping for her boyfriend/husband and she replied that it was a birthday gift for her brother.

Nice.

So we chat while I'm trying outfits on for her.  Eventually she goes with a Varvatos ensemble that's not too shabby.  Of course, I ask her out for a drink, she declines but gives me her number.  I call her later that evening and she tells me to meet her at Prive.

I go, had a blast, made a friend.  

PS - no luck finding a jacket haha.

Thanks Barney's..."
3,"The mock salmon sashimi is impressive - it looks and tastes similar to real salmon. The texture is similar but not spot on, the mock version is made from tapioca so it has a jelly-like feel to it. The vegetable tempura is crispy and sliced thin. 

I will only return for the salmon sashimi mock (I can't have real sashimi during my pregnancy). Otherwise, I did not enjoy with the rest of the food. The sushi rolls were made with too much rice and little filling. The chicken terryaki was fairly ""chicken like"" but I still didn't enjoy the dish."
3,"A bit late (8-9 pm) in the West Island and dining options disappear pretty quickly.

 We came here, the place is pretty busy with mostly young suburban kids.
I found the burgers a tad pricey (most are $14-16 with fries and no drink)

The saving grace was the small quarter pound burgers with a glass bottled Coke for $10.
Good deal, good burger, nothing amazing. The fries were decent too.

If you're starving though, it's probably best to get the larger burgers, but by then, you're paying $20 for a burger, fries and a drink.

The decor and ambiance were OK, it would probably get on my nerves if I went here too often, too much vinyl and chrome."
3,You would never know where Wheelfish is. The wings are very good and during tonight's Stanley cup game they're $.50. Ribs are dry rubbed and were tasty without the house sauce. I would recommend the house traditional sauce. Unfortunately my boyfriend informed me a patron left a swastika on the men's bathroom wall.
3,Small burritos. Decent flavors. Nothing too special. On par or just below something like Filibertos
3,"Stopped here after a long work day to see some friends perform. Wasn't going to get anything to eat but the smell of the smoker upon entering the place changed my mind. I got the brisket with Mack and cheese. The Mac and cheese was good had a nice crust on top with nice cheesy flavor. I was disappointed in with be brisket though. It had nice flavor but was pretty dried out and a bit tough.
The decor was nice and when the cooker was bringing a piece of pork in from out side he gave me and my boyfriend a sample and it was delicious and tender.
Maybe I got a bad batch of brisket wished I got the pork instead. Place worth another try and some of the other dishes I saw looked like worth a taste."
3,It is a fantastic store but if you do your homework. Or if you dont live under a rock a lot of the same items they carry can be found on sale. This is why I love shopbop.com plus they dont charge tax or shipping
3,"I wish there was such a thing as 3.5 - 3.75 stars... because this ranks just under 4 stars. My husband and I came here with another couple on a Wednesday night. The restaurant is tucked in at the beginning of a housing development right off of the main street. The gravel parking lot is large and would accommodate quite a few guests. However, the back of a strip mall abuts the lot, which is not the most ideal situation and could be a potential eye sore. 

The building is inviting from the outside, as it perfectly fits the BBQ, rustic theme. The inside is dimly lit, with several dining options: small tables, a long table overlooking the main dining area, and the bar. We opted for the bar as the live music was quite loud and we wanted to have conversation with our friends. The bartender was very friendly and attentive - I would go back for the sole sake of having her again! There are 4-5 different meat options prepared a couple ways. I had 1/4 lb pulled pork with the pork and beans. The BBQ sauces were very good - spicy was just that, regular was a nice blend of spices, and sweet was sweet, my favorite! The pork and beans were just ok, however my friend had the sweet potato fries (I stole a few) and they were very good! The food was a little pricey, however it is one of the better places I have been for BBQ in Pittsburgh. 

If you enjoy smoked meats and traditional BBQ/picnic sides, this is a place to put on your list. A little pricey and located off the beaten path, however, it's worth a stop!"
3,"No one in our group tonight is vegan or vegetarian. I'm currently pregnant and was desperate for sashimi, so we checked this place out. Service, ambiance and food were all fine - nothing to complain about. However, contrary to many others' experiences here, I didn't think the ""salmon"" tasted, looked or felt like the real thing. The food definitely was creative and made a concerted effort to mimic real fish, but wasn't entirely successful. I'm also weary what ingredients were used to make the mock fish. 

The tofu chicken and duck were decently good. But, this is probably due to seasoning and teriyaki sauce. 

Overall, I think this place does a good job at serving a specific type of clientele, but it wasn't for us. I will wait out my pregnancy and gorge on real sashimi later :)"
3,The food was just okay. We ordered to go- the home fries were awful. They are not your traditional home fries by any means and they are terrible.  The waffle was decent.
3,"After hearing all the hype I decided to check out Jukebox Burgers. Service was a little slow and it took long to get our food which normally doesn't bother me as long as I know that my food is on it's way. 
My burger was not bad but it came a little cold which really ruined everything for me. I had to ask them to put it back on the grill and I was starving. I had asked for curly fries but the waitress got my order wrong and brought me regular fries instead. Their mac and cheese was not bad but not worth going back there only for the mac n cheese. 
Sadly I don't think I'll go again"
3,"Food is very good, desserts as well. Just the male waiters are not very good from trying to seat a group of 6 at smaller tables when clearly bigger tables available. Then when noted got grumpy and passed the table off to just as bad a waiter."
3,I got a bunch of pretzels with dip for New Years. It was crowded. The girl who waited on me although she was pleasant I felt like she was hurrying me along a bit. Like I was talking to slow for her. Remember the customer in front of you is the most important one no matter who awaits behind. The pretzels are delicious but I gave it 3 stars because who waited on me was not respecting my business. It was just in and out. And that made me feel bad.
3,"Mucho Taco falls closer to 2.5 stars-average.  The prices are very good and the staff was very friendly.

Let me start with some positives:  the salsa was fresh and tasty as in these were whole tomatoes 5 minutes ago.  veggies on the tacos were also fresh and crisp.

I had a fish taco & a carnitas taco-total about $4.50.  The fish was decent but the carnitas was pretty gristly.  I overheard the kitchen staff talking to a customer and found out that they make liberal use of the ""L"" word here.  That's right, old school cookin' for better or worse; Lard."
3,"Love their chicken but not for corporations who speak out on political or religious views.
You're a fortune 500 company. You make chicken sandwiches. Just make chicken sandwiches and keep your mouths closed and I'll keep coming for your chicken.
God knows if I was blessed with a fortune 500 food chain I would be on my own island speaking my beliefs to myself."
3,"Came because heard people talking about this place. Won't return but nice place. 

Cute concept decor brings you back to the 50's. 
Great service. 
Milkshakes were great
Burgers were ok but nothing more and I wouldn't come back for them. 
Onion rings were great. 
Mac n cheese if you like American cheese with BBQ sauce ribs is ok."
3,"The last time I went to a Chick-Fil-A was about 15 years ago in the mall and was unimpressed and it would have been a 2.  They have gotten better.  I chose the grilled chicken breast combo and it was ok.  The fries were not very crispy.  Afterward I was told by friends I should have gotten the original delux and I would have preferred the taste but I assumed there were fewer calories, salt and fat in the grilled and I was correct when I checked.  The restaurant was clean and everybody was pleasant.  So they have moved up from avoiding them to acceptable but not going out of my way."
3,"My family has gone to this location for years.  The team that works there are great, with a good selection of tires & prices, compard to other shops. However, the mgmt/owner (whoever is encouraging this) needs to understand that they need to figure out how to make their money without packing in their customers to wait for such a long time.  I would give a lower rating for always waiting too long but it's not the teams fault on the front lines doing the hard work!  It's not fair that the workers are being pushed this hard, as well!!

Recently, I went to this location today & this past week.  This week, I waited approx 45 min without an appt.  I had to go back because my air pressure light came on while driving down the highway to go home.  They had over-inflated my new tires.  I called back this week to order a tire for my other vehicle & set-up an appt for install today.  When I got to the store, I was told that there were 5 appts ahead of me & it would be close to an hour...even with the appt I had made.  It took them 45 min to get to my car, then just 15 min to complete.  Again, I had to return immediatly, d/t my tire pressure light coming on.  

I hope whoever is pushing the store to set-up so many appts, where their customers have to wait for so long, reviews their process!!  It's only benefiting the store, not their customers!!  If a customer has an appt, then they should service their car at that specific time, not almost an hour later!  Also, they need to check to see why the tires are being inflated incorrectly at this location!"
3,"They serve the simple ""street"" style tacos I like. I had one al pastor and one asada. Both tacos were tasty. The al pastor had a nice spice to it. I also had a green tamale that was really gross. All masa and barely any cheese or green chile they said was suppose to come in it. Can't seem to find a spot with good tamales around here. I also got a jamaica to drink and wished I had gotten the horchata that I initially wanted instead. It was watered down and sour without the sweet.  So basically... come here for the tacos... don't bother with anything else. 

*Note: I didn't receive this as I ordered take out, but there was a sign that said ""free chips and salsa for dine in customers""."
3,"Went here as recommendation on a friend. A nice choice for the food and atmosphere. Can't say the same for the service or host. Wrote comment on the receipt with a phone number realized they are closed on Sundays. Still would of thought that the server would of shown the manager and would of heard from someone. Well let's see if they see this review and reach out. Would go back for food prob sit at bar and eat. 

The manager reached out with in minutes of post to apologize and discuss. Will be giving a chance."
3,"I used to love going here, but they took away the all you can eat option, I won't be returning. Also poor customer service :( too bad to see a place with good food lose regular customers!"
3,"I really wanted horchata, so when my boyfriend and I were driving around for lunch, I searched on Yelp for a Mexican restaurant and decided on this place. The man behind the counter was nice and just said to let him know when I was ready to order, since I was still waiting for my bf to come inside. I decided on the chicken enchiladas and horchata, and my bf got a burrito. The chips and salsa they brought out before were tasty, and my horchata was good was well (free refills if you get a large!). My enchiladas were okay, but my boyfriend devoured his burrito and said it was really good, so I guess I'll have to try that next time."
3,"I came here on a Saturday evening to do some shopping. I wasn't really looking for anything in particular, just wanted to browse and see if anything catches my eye. I walked through the shoes and accessories and was surprised how empty it was. There wasn't much merchandise on the floor, which is out of character for Barneys! It wasn't until I wanted to buy something did I realize that the entire time I was in the store, that there was NO sales associate to be found. Anywhere. In fact, I think I was the only customer in there.

It was like the Twilight Zone. 

I finally found someone that worked there, but he was on his phone behind the cosmetic counter. He looked really busy, like he was playing Clash of Clans or something so I decided not to bother him and left."
3,"Had lunch at this place a couple days ago. I ordered the arroz con pollo. It was good, but nothing to jump up and down about. I would say it was like any other you'd order at another restaurant. I will say the portions were huge and I actually took leftovers and ate for dinner. All in all this place was ok."
3,"The only reason why I'm giving the restaurant a 3 star is because of the long wait for us to get our food & the check. The food was absolutely delicious, the menu is extensive with chocked available & the prices are decent. My only complain is with the server and the service provided."
3,"Avid coffee shop goer and vegan so when I heard that there was a place that did both I was sold. Coffee was tasty, I ordered a latte with almond milk and could taste the espresso. Me and my boyfriend ordered breakfast sandwiches the Wilbur and the Copper State, which some how ended up costing $8 each when the listed price was $5(?!) Okay I give them the benefit of the doubt that it was THAT good of a sandwich that there must be some upcharge for the bagel on a bagel sandwich.... 
Soo the sandwiches come out and I though I was just given a sliced bagel. Nope there was actually filling in there. The Wilbur was sad. The copper state was also skimpy on the toppings but it was tasty. I pull out my laptop to try to forget how hungry I still was and to start working for the day and ask for the WiFi password. The cashier doesn't know but points me to the sign with the password on it. I try to connect and it fails. Again and again. So I try to connect for the next 20 minutes to their WiFi and the public WiFi with no luck. I really want to like this spot..."
3,"Had the brisket sandwich.  The flavor was good, but a tad bit overdone. The mac and cheese was just glorified Kraft mac with some unnecessary topping that, instead of flavor or texture, only added to my irritation. Ordered an Old Fashioned that was dominated by an obnoxious sized glacier that took up 54.6% of the glass. Super loud and having a conversation is only possible if you brought your frat buddies."
3,"Hoping for an indigenous Mexican food experience ( having read so on Yelp) I trundled to this place (which is next to iMart, A thai restaurant and a newly opened ""Deshi snack food store"".

Service: Good and very friendly. I got the salsa/chips and the verde /roja spicy sauce for my taco served t me. I also got the medium Jamaica (even though I paid for the small). I also helped myself to their pickled Carrot and Serrano peppers (mmmm Spicy.. though I prefer the grilled peppers from Senor taco) 

Food: I chose to order the more adventurous Tripe, head and Shrimp tacos. 
Tripe: Rather gamey and had a smell like the cow was having a bad day when it got chosen to be eaten
Head: Interesting taste and smell (tasted a lot like a slightly off Carne asada). I was expecting portions of brain as well (but maybe after Bovine Spongi..what not,  its probably safer that I didn't)
Shrimp: Bit overdone (hence rubbery) but with a good griil aroma and flavor.

Authenticity: Definitely 

Net Impression: Will go here again and order the more traditional fare. I'm leaning towards the mole to make my final decision. As always Mom and Pop authentic stores always has a soft corner for me."
3,"I came here today on a bike ride and picked up a grilled chicken pretzel sandwich with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing for lunch.  The pretzel ""bread"" of the sandwich was wonderful--very chewy, savory, and delicious.  The fillings, on the other hand, did not impress me--while filling, they were bland and flavorless. The sandwich was also quite messy to eat, since some of the cheese and dressing had leaked out of it, despite its being wrapped up, and continued to leak as I was eating it.  Usually, two napkins is sufficient for me, but this is one of the few times I wish I'd picked up more of them.

In addition to my sandwich, I picked up a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, which, though small, was tasty and full of chocolate chips.  Together, the sandwich and cookie cost a whopping $4.40 (take that, Subway!).  Service was friendly and efficient.

Based on the quality of the pretzel and the cookie, I'd come back here.  Next time, however, I think I'll try one of the regular pretzels, or perhaps a pizza one.  3.5 stars."
3,"It was ok, place was kinda empty. We ordered tacos and the pastor was fair but the carne asada had no flavor. Oh and gotta buy the guac separate (muy triste porque sin guacamole no son tacos lol) The one thing i really liked though was the salsa with the chips, i approve of that salsa!"
3,"Met a friend for breakfast. Waited quite awhile for a server to come over, and there were only 4 people in the place. My friend ordered the crepes and I ordered the eggs benedict waffles.
They have background music which is so loud we could hardly speak to each.
Our food was brought by a different server and asked if we wanted more coffee, we both agreed, but once again waited for it. Our original server never came back to check on us, except to bring the bill.
The prices are quite high for the quality of the food. We decided we were glad we tried it, but would not be back."
3,"I wanted to like this place more, but it was solidly average.  The menu was good with decent variety of savory and sweet waffle choices among other breakfast items.  They had gluten free waffles, which was nice due to a family member having a gluten sensitivity, and I had the chicken and waffles.  Like other reviews stated, it was decent, but for $40 for 2 adults and 2 kids (who split a breakfast), I wanted to be wow'd.  

I always want to start with the good, but I think I already mentioned all the good.  Good menu with decent food.  They did have some decent syrup choices outside maple.  We tried the vanilla and bourbon syrup.  This isn't vanilla flavored maple syrup, it is vanilla syrup that pours clear.  The bourbon on the chicken and waffles was very good.

Now on to what could make it better, with some of problems not being able to be changed.  I think the biggest problem was the noise.  It is a no frills décor restaurant with two walkways with tables on both sides, but the room just echoed terribly.  I could barely hear anything my family was saying across the table.

Our server was ok, but it was just slow.  We did go on a packed Saturday, so it is understandable, but I need a bigger coffee cup than the Dixie cup sized cup of coffee they gave me which was gone is 0.2 seconds.  It would be nice if they had runners in addition to the servers.  For a breakfast place, your coffee cup should never be empty.  In addition, our food was not very hot due to the fact that I stared at it sitting in the window for several minutes.  It really wasn't our waitresses fault since she was taking orders at the time.  (of course, it was the people who had a million questions, seriously people, it is a waffle place with good descriptions on the menu).  By the time she took their order than got our food, it was not that hot.  It would have been nice to have someone running food out and filling coffee cups.

Like I said, it was good and different for the north hills.  We will probably try it again, but not go out of our way"
3,"The layout is neat and clean as you walk-in. They commited well to the retro diner decor theme and they also have flat screens and a bar for sports enthusiasts. We selected the booth seating area... to my surprise the seat cushion moved completely out of place. No problem, we just moved over one booth, right? Wrong! The entire seat cushion of the other booth was busted too, but it was a little more manageable- (you just can't move -at all- while seated). So finally the seating situation is under control, so I went to wash my hands for the meal. The bathroom was basically brand new with all the updated features, such as scented spray sensors- oddly it smelt overwhleming like piss! When I say piss, I mean farm piss smell. So I looked around briefly... it was the beginning of the night and everything appeared to be clean, and the bathroom had hardly been used- so there was clearly deeper issues causing the washroom to smell like a urinal abused by a group of farm animals with bad aim. Alright, so I got the hell out the washroom and concentrated on removing this urine incident from my nose. Reset... So I went for the full experience, which would be a burger and a shake. The shake (6$) was fantastic with pieces of fudge brownie at the bottom. I recommend sharing between 2 people- it is a meal in itself. Two burgers were chosen: the Sammy D and the Elvis, both on their classic Jukebox white bun (they are said to be ""home-baked""-nice). I should mention that they ground their own quality beef, as well, which is thoughtful. My critique about the burgers: If I order a preconfigured burger that has warm caramelised onions or warm chili, don't put the cold tomato and raw ring of oinions in the burger, too! I would have liked more of what I payed for (carmelized onions and mushrooms then the other tag-along toppings). The burger is great, though! Tastes like a solid homemade burger. Ours were cooked medium, borderline medium rare, which I'm sure they weren't going for. They were really juicy. Curly fries were tasty and could've been better if they weren't so cold and overly crunchy (made it unplesant to eat a lot of pieces). The traditional coleslaw was good- tasted and looks like fresh coleslaw made in-house. I rate this resto two stars for overall dining experience, the burger 3.5 stars(could easily be 4 with better execution) and the chocolate shake a solid 4-5 stars. Within a 1km walking distance, you can choose burgers from: A&W, Wendy's, Five Guys or Madisons; therefore, the war for your burger buck IS ON in the 'burbs! So, if I was struck again with the taste for a burger in that area, what would I chose? Easy, Jukebox. Why? It's truly the only ALL fresh burger (from the bun to beef patty and toppings) you can buy. And I don't mind paying 12$ for ""a"" burger, because it's actually real food. BTW one burger is good for two kids or a coed couple. I would only order one burger next-time. And I probably won't eat-in. I would takeout and pass on the retro timecapsule (which is done well), but too-family-resto-ee for my sanity. For the record, this place is not trying to be Johnny Rockets, the shake and the burgers are much more fresh and of higher quality. And this place is not expensive for families- you just have to know how to order. Burgers and shakes are good for two-don't be shy- ask for an extra glass and a proper knife and portion your food- because this restaurant isn't looking after your wasteline. Obesity wasn't an issue in the 60's."
3,It's a good Chick-fil-A.  Prompt drive-thru service.  Nice touch with the shade along the wait.  It gets pretty packed and the cars go out of the parking lot.  Food was fine.  It was good for a quick dinner with my parents.
3,"Good food, poor service. I waited 20 or 30 mins before I could give my name. I had to go up to someone working and tell them .. there did not seem to be a hostess yet it said please wait to be seated... everyone waiting seemed to be confused. We were seated in the ""added on"" room which didn't have any of the decor like the main room. A buffet was going on for a children's birthday party so the atmosphere was not what I hoped. Perhaps I came on an off day. The waitress was nice and I did enjoy my plate of food."
3,"This gives me mixed feelings. While I had the Cheese Steak, which was phenomenal, and the nachos were decent, the waitress I had was not as good. Not the friendliest attitude at all, and when I asked for a refill, I never got it. Other than that, the food was good and lot's of TV's. Seems like a good sports bar, but definitely not the greatest"
3,"this place is better than TOUTI GELATI down on queen st
but it is not a heart-winner either. i saw many good reviews but maybe these folks do not know what a real ice cream is like, nothing compares to Italian gelatos or other European ones.
i ve tried the blueberry icecream, i think they too, use artificial flavours, did not feel like blueberry at all, and no fruit pieces blended in it...
i also tried a chocolate ice cream, neither did this remind me of any chocolate ice cream beside being brown in color!!!
quick and friendly service and i might go again but only bcuz there is no where else to go in this area! (the ice cream shop right on the beach is even worse)
their prices are bit lower than touti gelati, here i paid 4.20 for a medium 2 scoop cup the other place is over 6 dollars...

they use way TOO MUCH SUGAR and i do not think sugar makes the ice cream good. it just makes you thirsty and increases ur blood sugar and u start feeling a bit dizzy afterwards..."
3,"The BF continued our vapor tour to this popular in house mixed juice place. 

There was a few liquids I've heard about so I decided to try them out. Probably the crunch berry was one of the better more accurate ones I've had, but nothing stood out as a must have. Oddly other than their liquids, they had a few E-Liq Cube flavors as well. One of my gripes with many places is that they use cheap disposable clearos for their juice samplers so you don't get the best of flavors and a few were tasting burnt. Sad because a few of those I really wanted to see what the flavor was about. 

We were greeted and told to try out some samples, but after that they were busy kinda cleaning up and the one other girl there was talking to the one other customer. I had a question but didn't want to bother either. It was close to closing so I do get it in a way they want to have things ready to go, but it may have made a difference in a purchase from us or not faster. And of course, I know it was close to closing so maybe partially on me for my timing, but 7pm is early to try to rush to. 

I didn't look at the gear to be honest since I was on a time crunch so I can't say what type of items they have. 

We will probably be back when there is more time to try out flavors. For now though it's A-OK in my book."
3,"I want to compliment this store for making all of their ice cream in-house.  That's impressive in this day and age of out-sourcing.  This is really more like a 3.5 star.  Unfortunately, the ICE CREAM was just not quite to my taste.  I found everything just a little bit too sweet.  They're crushing some of the beautiful flavors they're trying to make with such a heavy hand on the sugar.  

The waffle cone was nice, but had the standard problem of dripping from the bottom mid-way through.  They're also making the WAFFLE CONES just a little bit too far in advance.  Their ESPRESSO was the smallest shot I've ever seen, served in the largest glass I've ever seen espresso served in.  I really don't think instruction had been provided in how to make espresso...and this was a significant failing that prompts me to round down to 3 stars rather than up to 4.

The servers were quite friendly and the shop has a nice, comfortable feel.  Prices are reasonable for homemade ice cream.

Overall, it's decent and hit the spot on a bike ride, but definitely not in the top 20 ice cream shops I've experienced."
3,"This is a great casual place to grab food. While it's not fine dining, it's perfect for what it is.

Atmosphere: bright and open are the best two words to describe this spot. It's nice because the tables aren't clustered together, and the combination of lights and windows give plenty of light.

Service: servers are friendly. Mom and pop diner feel for sure. 

Food: I've tried several dishes here; gf quesadillas, salads, but mostly breakfast. Everything was always good. I can't say I've fantasized about the food here after I've eaten, but I've never had any complaints either.

Overall a good diner spot."
3,"The place was real busy but we were greeted right away.  This was my first time there and I thought the food was pricey for a cafe. I had the biscuits and gravy, one egg, bacon and my signature item of choice, pancakes. The eggs were fluffy and hot, bacon was good sausage gravy was fine, I needed more black pepper on it but that's a personal choice.  the pancake however left much to be desired.  Could not cut it with a fork.  I tried my husbands home fries and they were also very good.  I am going to go back one more time to try the omelette and that will help me decide if I go back."
3,"Second time here and 1st trying the Sunday brunch buffet. We arrived around noon and it was busy, but there appeared to be many open tables so we put our name in thinking it would go fast. About 1/2 later and 25 or so ""I'm hungry's"" from the kids, our name was called. We told the lady who sat us that we wanted the buffet and she mumbled someone would be with us soon to get our order. Finally after about 5 minutes I sent my wife and kids up to get food and waited to ""place our order"" for buffets. The waitress came by and was sweet as pie and took our drink order and explained what was on the buffet. Looking around, she was the ONLY waitress who had a smile on her face and looked like she wanted to be alive that day. Onto the food... they have a great spread including made-to-order omelets, fresh waffles, bacon, sausage, french toast, potatoes, biscuits and sausage gravy, fruit, muffins and dessert. The older gentleman who was making the eggs and waffles was amazing and put on a show for my daughter who wanted to go back up for seconds on her omelet. The eggs were fluffy and he didn't skimp on the ingredients. The waffles were to die for and the gravy for the biscuits was very tasty. I didn't care much for the potatoes or bacon/sausage but overall it was a very good meal for $14.95 per person  ($6.99 for kids) but the service was just ok. Like I said, we had a great waitress and the omelet guy was friendly, but the greeters, the ladies serving coffee at the front desk and the rest of the wait staff didn't seem to want any part of customers. We may try this again because I love a good, tasty breakfast buffet, but with other options it won't be our go-to place. Yet."
3,"My husband, a fan of the Taylor's Made Right in Iowa, feels that their loose meat sandwich is good but does not compare to the original. 

The Omelet was huge and good but nothing unique. The biscuit wasn't good enough to tempt me to eat the carbs. All in all, we would not seek it out but wouldn't be opposed to coming here if someone else wanted to dine here.  

Service was very friendly!"
3,Good food but small portions for the price. Ordered large salad large pizza family pizza and spent $70...there were 6 adults who were so hungry we had to order more from a chain restaurant...family size pizza not very large
3,"Great ""beach feel"" to location. Loved the chili chocolate gelato. Ice cream overall didn't live up to the hype. Still love my Baskin and Robbins."
3,"Had to check this place out since its from my family's hometown in IL!  The pizza was OK.  My husband is a big pizza guy and was not impressed.  I felt the flavors were good.  I also ordered a chicken parm sandwich - it was awesome - make sure you order it on garlic bread.  

The main reason I gave 3 stars is that this is the 2nd time I tried to order from there.  The first time, no one answered the phone and the line was out the door... this is not a sit down place.  It is a order ahead for pick up kind of place.  They do deliver - this is optimal."
3,"Friendly staff. Topping choices very unique with whole cookies, brownies and hostess cupcakes. Yogurt not so good to me. Dense and icy. Pretty pricey also."
3,"From our blog The Second Opinon:

Yogurtology is the 9th frozen yogurt store Ryan and I have been to. At first glance, this place seems great! Their root beer tastes like root beer, oatmeal tasts like oatmeal, and strawberry banana smoothie tastes deeeeeelicious. Not to mention, their topping selection is vast! Baklava, apple pie filling, full sized cookies (not just bite pieces), cream puffs, jumbo marshmallows, and gumballs! But when you take another look, you see that their red velvet and cupcake batter flavors were pretty weak and you can't get your own samples like some places, they have to get it for you (which I don't like because sometimes I want to try all of them but I feel like I can only take two or they will tell me no more!).

If you come, come in the morning, early in the afternoon, or after dark because in the mid afternoon/early evening you will be blinded by the sun because the building is facing the west.

Another thing- It's 42 cents an ounce! That is the highest price for frozen yogurt we have seen so far! Due to the taste, it wasn't worth the money!

Ryan said something like this when we were there: ""I don't think 'Yogurtology' was a very good name for this place. It means that it's the study of yogurt and you can't call it that when you don't know good yogurt.""
Hmmm... well put, babe!

Kortnee's favorite flavors: Root Beer & Oatmeal
Ryan's favorite flavors: Oatmeal & Strawberry Banana Smoothie"
3,"Back in the day... 'bout 8 years ago -- this was my favorite breakfast.
Excellent portions (not too big-not too small)
It's a classic short order diner that does/did things right. There cinnamon rolls are awesome and don't forget to try some pie some time.
That said, I've seen a slight dip in service the last couple times which is why I didn't give it four stars in case something is change there I don't know about.
Other than that, it really is a good place to get a breakfast. Very reasonably priced."
3,"My boyfriend I really enjoy yogurtology's yogurt, but their service is almost is bad as jumpstreet. 

And, if you have kids, I suggest taking them at sunset or before 6:30 before the teenagers get out and get there where they will loiter for a good two to three hours.  


They have a boy and a girl who are by far their best employees, I wish I knew their names so I could thank them properly for showing what GOOD customer service is. The rest of their employees are rude and uhm...well, I'll just say they have some trouble with monetary units and cleaning...

I've been there lots of times, but no matter what time of day I go there are always annoying customers there that the managers don't seem to care about. Tonight, there was a hoard of DVHS dancers who were half streaking and screaming so loud you could hear them from the freeway, 
no hyperbole. 

When we got inside the staff was complaining about them. Not that I blame them--I get that they're customers, but this is a food establishment, not a jungle gym or strip club.

There was a new flavor that was AMAZING (well, it was new to me) and I think it's better than their tart nouveau or whatever it is...the pink lemonade flavor is delicious. Anyway, we paid for a stuff, went to leave, and the DVHS dancers had decided to start doing some sort of ritualistic dance/tag in the street. Making me and my boyfriend unable to get our car out of the lot for 5 minutes. Not blaming the establishment, it's just a fair warning that the establishment seems to draw in a lot of rude, immature teenagers that the managers don't even bother kicking off their property for fear of losing long term customers. This seems to be a trend, as this  is not the first time something like this has happened, either.  

Getting back to their employees, there's a  girl who does not seem to be able to break change properly, ever. Example: I bought frozen yogurt for me and my boyfriend one day after work. The total came to $5.10. I only had a $10 dollar bill on me, so I gave her that and 10 cents. She started to break change. It was pretty sad. When I tried to explain to her that she only needed to give me 5 dollars back, she stared at me like I was dumb. She hasn't been working the register lately though, so maybe I'm not the only person who's noticed she's not that great with money.  

The place is clean, but not the cleanest place I've ever been to..afew of the girls only clean major things like tables and floors while the side of the bar (the side that you service yourself on) has been gooey for me more than one time. I might casually lean on it and have 3 day old warmed caramel cup stuck to my shirt when I go to move down the line. 


All and all I like the flavors and the infinite possibilities I can make. But I really don't like having to compromise a tasty frozen treat for unruly customers and rude employees who seem like they would rather shoot bamboo under their fingernails than ask me if I have a Loyalty Card."
3,"Heard about the biscuits and gravy, they were pretty good, but lacks service as I needed a refill on my water....and haven't received any water, probably under staffed....coffee wasn't pleasant..."
3,"I REALLY Loved my gel manicure when I got it. I loved it so much that it really made me so sad when less than a week after I got it they peeled off. Literally in one whole sheet. I've had 4 finger nails peel clean off. I've never had a gel manicure last less than 2 weeks much less 1 week! Usually my nails have a little wear on them after a gel mani starts coming off but it's like they were never even painted. 

That being said I have never been so pleased with service and the look of a gel mani, just sad they didn't last as long. For the amount of time they lasted I should have gotten regular paint."
3,"Decided to try out this place for breakfast. Going in we were greeted immediately and taken to a booth. It's definitely old and outdated but it's clean. Our food was good but the iced tea is not brewed it's from the fountain. The biggest complaint I had was the price. $28 for 2 diner quality breakfasts. I had corned beef hash and tea, my husband got French  toast with bacon and coffee and OJ."
3,"Well I was really in the mood to try a new breakfast place and this one had some good reviews.

The service was good and the waitress we had was very friendly. As for the menu, it was pretty basic next to the restaurants we've been going to lately. Sometimes that's exactly what you need. I had the sweet and savory platter with scrambled eggs, sausage, and plain buttermilk pancakes. Very good and satisfied my breakfast craving.
I did find the fact that they have breakfast sandwiches pretty unique and even though I didn't get one personally, I heard the Jo Jo was delightful. 

Now for the stuff I didn't care for...
There was a guy doing construction work near the bathroom the whole time we were there. So instead of a music ambiance, we had power tools. Why they scheduled that during business hours is beyond me and if I hadn't had a six person party coming from all different directions to get together, I would have left. It's really distracting trying to talk to people when that's going on.
Also the tea I had wasn't very good. I realize it's not their fault when all they have is bagged tea but I do appreciate a larger selection if that's what you're going to serve.

The food and service was ok, nothing to write home about but definitely good for the plain breakfast mood when you're sick of Bob Evans. Honestly, there could have been a very good reason for the construction work even though they didn't bother to explain. It could have been an off day and I wouldn't mind giving this place a second chance in the future."
3,"I've been to Al-Hana at the Baiz Market several times and the consistency of the quality of their food, portion sizes and some of the pricing has changed but going in the wrong direction.  It still an A-OK place to go, but it used to 4 to 5 stars.

Restaurant ~ it's in the Baiz Market, so if you're needing to buy some Middle Eastern or Mediterranean food, staples and condiments this is a great place to shop!  They often have great buys on their ground lamb and beef.  Al-Hana is located in the front of the market.  The distinctive and spiced filled aroma hits you when you enter the market ~ ""take a deep inhale, awe.."" There is a small area for dinning up front that's clean and not too cramped.  Most people order to go, so don't worry about seating when you see a lot of people at the counter.  

Service ~ is quick and friendly.  Usually there are just three to four people working the restaurant, two cooks and one girl working furiously taking orders and ringing people up.  I don't like how they have their menu.  It's laminated on sheets of paper tied together with a ring.  They only have two sets, so you may need to wait to see their menu.  They get a lot of regulars which will walk right up to the counter beside you and in front of you if you give them an inch.  This experience is starting to remind me of that Seinfeld episode ""Soup Nazi"".  You stand in line, hold your ground and order quickly, pay ~ then move aside and wait for your number to be called.  Having an idea of what you want ahead of time is recommended, so read the Yelp reviews before going.  

Food ~the spinning skewers of meat look and smell amazing, one beef and one chicken but no lamb? WHAT??  The beef and chicken sandwiches used to look more like middle eastern burritos stuffed full of meat and veggies but lately they look more like taquitos with some veggies thrown in.  

Their kabobs, both beef and chicken are better and you can get those as a sandwich if you ask.  Their Babaghannuj is much better than their Humus.  Humus is ok, small side is now $3.99 and sold seperately, but their Baba is delish!  The pitas lately have also been hit and miss.  Our pita's were too dry and almost brittle on our last visit.  Thanks to the Baba, we didn't mind so much.

All in all, Al-Hana has changed in my opinion with there being better options to choose from within a 5 mile drive.  I will go back to shop the Baiz Market and plan stop by Al-Hana again soon.  Hope to see you there."
3,"The tenderloin is fantastic as are the briskets and gravy.  However i have lived in the area for almost 30 years and the little old store on McKellips was much better than what they have now.  
Since the owner sold out a few years ago and the new owner took over and moved to the current location the service has bombed and the prices have skyrocketed.
Being from Iowa I still go there for the tenderloins once in awhile but nothing like I used to."
3,"I haven't been here in a few years only because I live kind of far from it and when I do have the time to get there it's on the weekends for breakfast and then I'll have driven a long way just to wait for about 20 minutes to get a table. 
When I have eaten here the food has always been decent. The breakfast is typical eggs and bacon. I would definitley recommend getting a slice of pie and a home made donut."
3,"Unable to review at this time because we arrived expecting to be able to sit in a dining room to eat. The restaurant website has a 'Dine In' menu and we didn't see anything on the website saying that there wasn't an indoor dining area. Would have been nice to know before driving there with a hungry family. We'll try again when they have a location with indoor seating.

UPDATE: Since posting, the website has been updated. The dine in menu was removed and seating options are now listed. Very helpful of them. Yelp will not allow a review without stars so I'm upping from one to three based on the website update."
3,"This place is one of those little neighborhood spots in a very unassuming strip mall tucked back off of Bagley Rd.  Nothing to get too excited about here, just average breakfast and lunch fare that you can get anywhere.  Had the Chicken BLT Wrap and Kettle Chips.  Mom had the Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich and Kettle Chips.  The sandwich was served on some generic hamburger bun, instead of something like Ciabatta Bread.  This is not a place I would actually say lets drive out there, but a place you stop because your hungry, just passing by, and it's convenient."
3,Coffee was good. Not crazy about the layout. Small cream and coffee center that you can hardly reach and the batista was in a bad mood. Probably will not be going back.
3,I decided to come in by reading the great reviews so I came in one morning. I was immediately greeted. There was three people in there getting serviced. I got seated immediately only to wait till the lady that was doing my nails get her stuff together. I think it took to long for a fill in and a fix. Over a hour. The place is clean but I didn't receive the hospitality and great service that people are talking about. The lady that did my  nails spoke to me and the rest of the time she spoke to her co worker the rest of the time in their language. I might go back to try a pedicure. Maybe.
3,"Glad to find a local restaurant for breakfast that is not a chain. I had read the reviews and was looking forward to standard American fare, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon.

The food was average. Hashbrowns had a little too much oil, toast was not done enough. Eggs were good, bacon was cooked properly but the flavor was not my favorite.

Normally with breakfast like that, coffee or tea is included. Not here. $1.89. Plus my first cup of hot water was not even warm enough to brew the tea. Our server didn't look like she was too thrilled to bring me some more hot water. Plus, I had to reuse the teabag I had tried the first time which is probably what made the tea so devoid of flavor."
3,"Everybody was giving a good review and I tried. The taste was good but I am not sure why people said this is the best in the city. Gelato taste like more ice cream. The taste is for more children than adults? The price is good not expensive. By considering the price and the location, they might be one of the best."
3,Let me say that the food here is really good but the service is slow and at times chaotic. Do not go if you are in a hurry. Servers run around like chickens with their heads cut off. They have no order or process for what they do which is a shame because the food is worth it. I like that you can create your own egg bake. I have gotten different combos and it's nice to be able to have it the way you want it.  I'm not a coffee drinker but i am told tje coffee is really good.
3,"Let me say, I LOVE Ed's Real Scoop, and the Leslieville location is fully deserving of 5 stars.

However, after visiting this location the other night, I have to say, it really doesn't live up to my Ed's standards.  The ice cream selection is much smaller than that of the Leslieville location.   And the place is a bit of a mess!  The windows are jumbled with old grungy signs and inaccurate business hours, and the inside is just cluttered with that feeling of a home that accumulates stuff over the years and never organizes or weeds down.

Don't get me wrong, the ice cream, gelato, milk shakes, etc., are all DELICIOUS.  But I'll go back to my regular Leslieville visits rather than visiting this location again."
3,"We had watched the Sanfrantello's place get set-up, so we were really excited to try. We have been there twice to give it a chance, but we ended up being ok with the pizza. Three things to consider when ordering because if you've never had Chicago-style pizza, you may not know the first two of these things: 1) when they say pan pizza, it's going to be a deeper pizza than Arizonans are used to seeing if you frequently do pizza delivery. It's not crazy deep like you may see in Chicago, but be warned, it's thicker. 2) In an attempt to fix the mistake from the first pizza order and ordering a deep dish, we thought thin pizza was the alternative to the deep dish since we thought maybe their thickness was different than what we say is pan or thin, but it really means thin crust. That was our mistake, but now we both know what we know. 3) The sauce is more sweet than it is savory. I know some people like that, but it's a preference like people love Spinato's pizza because of that. Unfortunately, that's not our preference.

In the two times we went, we ordered mozzarella sticks, hot wings, a pepperoni pan pizza and a thin crust pepperoni pizza. The mozzarella sticks are breaded with Italian bread crumbs and Italian seasoning. The cheese pulls out of there like you would expect at most places, so it is a decent order. The hot wings are also acceptable as well where they cook it thoroughly, it is more cooked to a juicy, tender texture rather than crispy, and it's coated well in the sauce. The pan pizza was a good mix of sauce and cheese considering how deep it was. The crust was okay. It didn't particularly strike any chords with me, so I didn't eat it. The thin crust pizza was a bit on the dry side. It's really hard for places to find that perfect balance of thin while still retaining the sauce and melt the cheese. 

The service was acceptable. The delivery people were nice and those that took our order were friendly. I wouldn't say they are particularly wow or outstanding - nothing sticks out - but they are acceptable. It also looks clean when you go in, and it looks like there's a small patio to dine at outside.

Overall, if sweet and deep dish is your thing, this would be a good spot to go. Otherwise, I would pass."
3,"Hello to all my fellow yelpers-

Where do I start... Where do I start ...

I guess I'll start at the very beginning... A very good place to start!

Read reviews of Sanfrantello's and being from the great city of Chicago decided to give it a try.  The reviews were very mixed but the one good thing in common was the sausage.

My top favorite Chicago pan pizza is Gullivers on the North side of the city.

Second fav would be Gino's East.

The reasons I find these 2 places to my liking is the crust and sausage... With that being said here is my opinion of their pan pizza.

The girl who answered the phone sounded rushed as a good pizza place should be... But it is still ok to be just a little friendly.

I asked for ""Scott"" the owner simply in hopes of getting the best pizza they make... So if I did not enjoy it, I know it's not that they made a bad pizza but because that's how they make their pizza.

Scott was super friendly and he turned over to another very friendly person to confirm the order.

An hour later the pizza arrived... Let take a moment to say the delivery time was very good considering the time it takes to properly cook a pan pizza...  That should have tipped me off.  

Delivery guy was also friendly.

The price is a couple dollars more than what I am used to paying but as i always say... I don't mind paying a higher price but the food needs to warrant it...

Pizza looked like a pizza... Although I have never seen a pan pizza cut in squares... In the Chicago I grew up in only thin crust is cut in squares... But oh well... Doesn't effect the taste!

Let's start with the part I usually enjoy the most . .... THE CRUST!

Several of the other reviewers feel the same way... The crust was undercooked... Especially the bottom which was white and fluffy... And the taste?

Was there supposed to be a taste because neither my husband nor myself tasted anything.

When I spoke with Scott to order the pizza I told home 2 fav places and he said if I liked those I will enjoy his..... WRONG!

Gino's East uses a cornmeal crust and it is always marked on the edges and bottom with the black pan marks... And has a wonderful taste.

Moving along... The sauce... Keep in mind, food is a preference and I am just one persons opinion...and.... I am a VERY picky eater!

I will be nice and say... The sauce is sauce... Nothing terrible then again nothing that pops either...

Now for the saving grace... The sausage is the best part!  Not quite as flavorful as I prefer but nonetheless closest to home as I have tasted in Az.

I give credit where credit is due... Of course I am guessing they get the sausage from a vendor and do not grind it themselves... If I am wrong my apologies...

If this is the case then he picked a great vendor.

Would I try again?  I think we would try the thin pizza...but not pan!

I am told from pan pizza connoisseurs  the crust gets its favors from the pan which you want to be aged for years to get all the black crusty goodness ... so if they are new to town and are using newer pans that would explain a lot!

I gave 3 stars only for the sausage.

So we come to the end of another review...

Give them a try... See what you think...

Until next Time

Bon Appetite'"
3,"i have to admit that i am a fan of haji-baba's falafel. a big fan. a big, huge fan. that being said, this was not haji-baba's falafel sandwich. it was slightly dry, had floursecent pink pickles (i think they were pickles) and the falafel balls were mushy - not crispy on the outside. 

based on other reviewers' recommendations, i ordered a side of garlic sauce. it was definitely garlicky and good, though the mayo-like consistency was a little bizarre. the pita bread was good and hummus delicious. despite this, my craving for falafel went unsatisfied."
3,"We are from Iowa so we thought it would be fun to go to the Iowa cafe. It was charming with the Iowa souvenirs. Wait staff very friendly. I ordered the Iowa tenderloin and upgraded to jumbo. We received it in a reasonable amount of time, started eating then was told we got the wrong order and someone else got our jumbo. Waitress told us we would get a piece of pie to compensate for the mistake. Ok, that was fine. But when we got the bill we still had to pay for jumbo. I was disappointed. I thought I would only pay for regular since that is what I received and pie was comped for the mistake. Anyway the tenderloin was good. I would go back again but would send back any mistake they made."
3,"This place is exactly what you expect.  Tables in every nook of the drawn out building means plenty of seating.  The kitchen is quick and the servers are pretty good (but lack any charming personality).  The place has all sorts of random junk you can buy if you are into buying postcards at your breakfast stop.  It is a decent experience.

Where it gets me down is the food.  I ordered my typical Texas Toast french toast and it was beyond boring.  The pieces were small and had no hint of extra flavoring.  The syrup was bland and tasted store-bought.  

What I wanted was home-cooked goodness for breakfast.  What I got was cookie-cutter blandness.  Too bad, this coulda been a great place."
3,"Average food, lousy service.

The hostess was very monotone. She sat on her shift and stood up to greet me with no personality . I requested a specific table by the front door but was told that was the ""owners"" table. Odd they need their own specific table and would take away from paying customers, but hey it's not my establishment. Hostess sat me at the next table over. 

The server was nice, but slow. I felt like I waited forever to get things. The food was average. Not bad, but not spectacular either. 

When it came time to pay my server disappeared completely. I couldn't find her and needed to get back to work. After 10 minutes went by with my credit card just sitting on the table I flagged down another server. Asked her if she could cash me out. Of course she couldn't, but would find my server. Waited another 2 minutes are so to be cashed out."
3,I used to come here all the time and it seemed like they had way more business before when they took phone orders for pick up.  They said they no longer do phone orders because people dont pick up. So why not take credit cards over the phone to ensure payment? If they dont show up then they charge the card...simple as that.  So now i have to go through the trouble of waiting 15 minutes for a to go order?
3,"First visit, lunch time April 21, 2015. The place was busy, about 70% full. 

Let me first say this about the resturant, the dining area is exceptionally clean and well maintained. Not very fancy but spotless clean. 

I ordered the loose-meat sandwich (aka Maid-Rite, authentic Marshalltown Iowa), fries and lemonade. The fries were plain but hot. The bun was soft and nice, the meat was dry dry dry and  a bit over cooked. The sandwich is served plain, which is not authentic Taylor's. Iowa Cafe's is like a sloppy joe sandwich without anything added to the beef.

Even the mustard and ketchup at the table couldn't help it. The beef was decent, tasted like actual beef, give 'em credit for that.

Service was excellent, I tipped well. Patrons and staff were friendly, 100% family atmosphere.

Total for sandwich, fries, and a drink with tip was $13

Would I go back? Perhaps, but I'd never order that sandwich again. I saw others eating huge portions seated at other tables, my lunch didn't meet that description.

Easy access, plenty of free parking."
3,Great atmosphere and good classic breakfast food! Love the Iowa vibe.  Brings me back home to sit at a counter and sip coffee from an Iowa Hawkeyes mug.
3,"Food I would give a 5 stars. Excellent burger!Waitress I would give 2 stars. She was not friendly, nor polite. Were were there later, maybe she was having a bad night?  She looked at us like we were inconveniencing her. She should get a job that doesn't require customer service."
3,"Not sure what happened to this place over the years. Customer service has gradually gone down and they no longer take phone orders for to go food. But if you order the Shish kafta, they warn you its at least a 15 minute wait.....so you're forced to wait amongst the sea of annoyed and somehow always angry customers. The food is good and fairly priced, which is the only thing that brings me back every once in a while."
3,"Perk-Cup is definitely a convenient spot to drop by if you want something different or healthy without getting out of your car. However, I didn't have the best experience. I ordered my food in advance and arrived when they told me my food would be ready. When I first arrived at the drive up, I was food was still being prepared- that's fine; I didn't mind waiting a few minutes. I ended up waiting 10+ minutes at the window. Because or the issue, I was given a free cookie. 

All of this to say, the food isn't bad but I wouldn't bet on your food being ready when you get there!"
3,"I don't exactly agree with the reviewer, who wrote, this is not only the best Arab food in Phoenix, but everywhere!  Well, having been to Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, I can happily confirm the last sentence to be a BIG exaggeration; but it's an exaggeration even for Phoenix.

We had the dolmas, hummus and babaghanoush; so to be fair, that's what my review concerns.  I can't speak for any of the meat dishes, but while the hummus and babaghanoush are very good, my partner and I are in disagreement as to HOW good.  We both find the hummus to be better than at Haji Baba, a staple and favorite of ours in Tempe.  The hummus at Haji's is smoother; this one, more grainy.  You would think smoother would be better ... while it's a matter of taste, I would argue it isn't.  The grainier one leads me to believe it's most likely ""homemade"", while the smooth indicates mass-production.  Not saying that's the case for either; but having tried canned hummus, I suspect, I'm not wrong.  The babaghanoush here is of the same consistency as at Haji Baba's, but has a ""smokier"" texture.  As far as those two dishes go, we rate them hands down better than Haji Baba (though I think not by much; my partner thinks they're significantly better).  The dolmas ... meh.  Tastes like they're out of a can, whereas Haji Baba's is very distinct and ""non-traditional"".  

Now, here is a point, which, for some people --- including me --- is important:  ambiance.  

Just as Haji Baba is not a ""real"" restaurant per se, this place is located inside the shopping center.  The difference is that while Haji Baba's grocery section is smaller and distinctly separate from its restaurant, eating here is akin to going to the hot dog and pretzel counter at Costco.  There is NO separation -- except for a steel railing --- and as you eat, customers mill around the store.  It does not leave an impression or quiet, calm and privacy.  If ambiance is important to you, then this is most likely not the place to think about having a ""real"" meal.  On the other hand, the service at the food counter is friendly and quick.

I will do a separate review of the store, Baiz Market, which is the REAL gem here, but overall, I'd say the food is good, but nothing spectacular"
3,"I've never ate the food here but, I've gotten coffee here a few times. Although, they have some good mochas...I don't think it's worth the price at all. For two mochas, it'll cost you $10 & some change. I believe the prices have gone up on the drinks because a few months ago I swear it was less than $10. The iced drinks only come in one size which is a downfall because sometimes I want a small iced drink. Really overpriced for a place like this so, I'm just going to be getting my coffee fix elsewhere."
3,"I don't do reviews for 2 or 3 stars, but am making an exception here, because it's so complicated. Great quality home-made food, which should make this place an easy 5 stars. The management made the dining experience uncomfortable and down-right strange. I've never seen an owner/ manager behave the way this lady did. Go in, and see for yourself. It's very distracting and weird. If the service is slow, it's because it's under-staffed. The staff that is working seems to be doing all they can. Great food, unorthodox management style. If you own or manage a restaurant, it would be worth sending your new managers here as part of their training to simply observe what not to do as a manager."
3,"Food was ok, service was terrific. Will come again on game day for the fun atmosphere!"
3,"A good pizza place was just what this area needed so was extremely excited when Sanfratello's opened here. Finally stopped by tonight and ordered a thin crust meat lovers pizza. 
The service was great, no complaints there and the place was nice and clean.  I wanted so bad to like the pizza but it tasted bland and rather forgettable. Based on other reviews it sounds like deep dish is the way to go. We will be back to give it another shot and will make a point to try the deep dish.  I really hope when I do that I can edit my review with a higher rating!"
3,"The atmosphere is what you want when going for a self-care day/relaxation/pampering. It is very clean and organized. I enjoyed my glass of wine and the entire experience. I received a gel manicure and a regular pedicure. However, my gel manicure did not last two weeks (more like it started looking old after one week) and my feet looked untouched after a couple of days. I was originally pleased with the entire experience until both services started deteriorating prematurely. Of course, it is over priced being in the Uptown/Plaza Midwood area but I was expecting a higher quality."
3,Good atmosphere and service for the most part. I go for the turkey burger best one around. Not alot of bars have them.
3,"Total disappointment: run-of-the-mill experience that keeps me on my hunt for my holy grail Charlotte nail salon (my go-to is Sassy).  I'm giving Tiptoe 3 stars for: Good ambience (4 stars); Sterilization (5 stars); Color selection (2 stars); Workmanship (3.5 stars); innovative services (3.5 stars) and Customer service (2.5 stars). 

2 other recent reviewers had to return for redo -- who has time for that? To require coming back seems like a time suck; better to do it right the first time. To date, that's 10% (3 out of 30 reviews) of published reviews that required a repair (including mine).

I was referred to Tiptoe from my hair stylist who raved about Michael and said that Tiptoe does chrome nails. I was stoked and couldn't wait to find the time to get my nails done (it's usually a 2-hour+ event; my schedule only permits me to designate one afternoon a month to get them done).  

THE GOOD: 
a) Good ambience: the salon is new and relatively modern.  Everything is still fresh, including the plush pedi massage chairs.  Your hands are done at a long granite bar. They serve complimentary drinks, including wine and have HGTV on one TV and the news on the other.  
b) Very clean, sterile environment.  They use fresh tools and files for every customer, which avoids the risk of transmission of nail fungi -- TOTALLY appreciated!  
c) Diminutive color selection.  Their color shelf is about 2/3 full but it's noteworthy to mention that the colors they do have are the popular hues.
d) Workmanship.  I was generally pleased enough with the outcome but there was nothing that blew my mind to elicit my return. 
     ---  pedi. I'm pleased with my pedi. The girl who did my pedi was very thorough and worked with careful, slow diligence.
    ---  hands.  Overall, I'm pleased enough with my hands: the shape is nice, they have a pretty thin, natural appearance for acrylics and even throughout BUT I did not notice until I got home:          
                     * drilled my natural nails paper thin.  I do gel under acrylic for convenience since it's more durable (I travel often and carrying luggage can easily break natural nails); however, underneath are my natural nails, which are strong and grow out -- I don't have tips.  I didn't like that Michael drilled through my natural nails underneath so they're basically uneven and paper thin.  Others have drilled underneath before but they use a less abrasive drill setting. 
                    * I have a raised clump on my right index finger that is annoying to feel because I'm right-handed but not annoying enough to go through the hassle of going back to have repaired.
                    * my thumb is uneven and has a jagged edge. 

ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: 
a) innovative services: they only offer acrylics and limited chrome selection.  They do NOT do: silk wrap (which doesn't require drilling your nail bed to promote adhesion) or dipped gel (which doesn't require UV or LED  light) or monochromatic colored chrome (the latest nail trend) and do limited designs (see below)
     -- limited chrome.  I came here to get rose gold chrome nails. I had rose gold chrome done in S Cal and love them.  Turns out they only do silver or rainbow. I initially agreed to silver but Michael kept reiterating how expensive it was (only $20 more) like he was dissuading me from getting the silver chrome.  I saw first-hand the technique that is required to do them in S Cal;  therefore, Michael's demeanor gave me reason to lose confidence in his aptitude, coupled with the fact that polished silver might be too edgy for my conservative business attire (although I have seen our head of Litigation wear dark blue polish; I'd probably be OK but I do prefer a softer color for fall like rose gold or beige undertone).  
b) rude customer service: the pedi girl was very eager to ensure my satisfaction (5 stars); but 1 star for Michael because: 
    --  he was distracted.  He kept consistently looking around the salon and having conversations with other patrons and employees the whole time he was working on my nails. 
    --  offensive stereotype. Not wanting to give up on my rose gold nails, I asked him whether he intended to offer them in the foreseeable future. His response: ""My clients are doctors and lawyers so likely not. I also don't do much design here either (given my clientele).""  (He did not know that) I am a corporate transactional attorney.  Yet I wear chrome and albeit once, have had a nail design done.  Most of my female family, friends or business colleagues are doctors or lawyers who regularly do fun, trendy things with their nails.  The implication is that people who do design or want chrome are tacky and unprofessional.  I don't tolerate passive aggressive broad strokes of inaccurate stereotyped generalizations. 

Overall, given the mediocrity of my experience here, there was nothing extraordinary to incentivize me to return. My search for my holy grail salon continues. On to the next salon.."
3,"I'm updating my review of this place.

I had a bad experience the first time I went here and I decided I would give it another try.

Every time I come, I never really get greeted, if I do it's a simple hello, with no eye contact. I don't get offered samples either. 

I only like coming here for two reasons. Tuesdays(35 cents per ounce) and their oatmeal cookie flavor is amazing.

Other than that, it's an okay yogurt shop, it's clean, but not spotless like everyone says. Most of the time the girls are usually talking to each other when I go to pay for my yogurt, it'd be nice to get a ""hey! How are you today?"" But maybe I am asking too much?

Another thing I do not like it that their toppings are pilled HIGH. So you spill(and waste) a lot of toppings and then when you're done putting on your toppings(especially the twix) they put the tongs back on the toppings. Which is kind of gross because other customers have touched the tongs."
3,"I had the burnt marshmallow.  It was very creamy. They did a good job making the ice cream. I don't know if the actual ice cream had any marshmallows in it. It had like caramel and pieces of what you call ""sponge toffee"", like what's inside of a crunchy chocolate bar.  This ice cream flavor was kind of mild. Not a very strong flavor.

They have gelato and they have ice cream. You also have the option of buying little pints to take home.

 I would recommend this place if you're in the area. It's about $4 plus for a single scoop.

I'm giving this place only a 3 because the burnt marshmallow didn't really seem to have any marshmallows in it."
3,This place has a pretty good breakfast and that is what I am writing my review on because I haven't tried their lunch.  Apparently they have really good pie too but I haven't had that either.  They moved the location from McKellips to Higley which is great because it is closer to my house.  I will give them a try again but I already have a couple breakfast places I like to go.
3,"Thin crust pizza was slightly above average, but not something I'd go out of my way for or recommend. I paid $33 for a 15"" thin crust delivered, with small antipasto salad. I think that's absurd, but if they can charge those prices then I can't fault them for doing so."
3,"I went there twice in two days. Food was ok, I had the sandwiches and grape leaves. Prices are very reasonable for what you get and sandwiches are served pressed on a grill which done rarely these days. Taste was good but not great. I also had the meat and cheese pies, which also were ok. Larger pies were a bit expensive compared to other places I've had then in LA and other places but at least you get better price by the dozen. 
Service was ok; no smile by anyone working there whatsoever (and so went two days and served by different people). If that's the only place in Phoenix, I wouldn't mind going again but I would try some of the other places in the area before I return there. 
Grocery store is very big and you can find almost anything and prices are decent. They also have a sweets counter connected to the market and quality is good on most items."
3,"sometimes the wait sucks, but the food is awesome. The amount of food for the price is well worth it"
3,Sadly after years of seeing this practice I've decided to leave them.  For years their billing has been a mess and no one can seem to provide accurate information.  It's unfortunate but I'm throwing in the towel!  Between the billing issues and the lack of professionalism at the front desk I'm moving on.  It seems some of the best providers have also left the practice.  I wish them the best.  Hopefully they can improve the patient experience in the near future.
3,Their drink menu is great. It's clean and well decorated. Their buffet on the weekend is very good. The service is generally very slow for the number of tables they have at a time. Overall a very average dining establishment. I wish they had more vegan options.
3,"Don't change your mind on what kind of drink (nonalcoholic) you want after you get it. My husband ordered an ice tea, he did not like it, when the waitress came bake he asked to change his drink to a soda. Everything was fine till we got the bill and he was charged for both! That has never happened to us before. He had one glass of ice tea and didn't even finish it. On a better note food is great, my kids even love it. We just know no matter what stick with your first drink choice."
3,"Holy price increases value man! 

We knew something was up when the faithful menu board was down, there are new glossy printed menus, with new higher prices to match. The falafel is now 4.49 up from 2.99 a 50% increase. Most other items went up by $1 to $1.50

For that price the falafel is rather small and does not include any sides.

I still like the overall quality and taste of the food but the value factor bottomed out with this one move.

One a positive note we finally found a can of hummus on the grocery side that is good, and the fresh bags of pita are still .99 so you can still have a ton of pita and humus for $2.50 or less."
3,"Holy Beers On TAP!  Yay for Rivals.

I was pleasantly surprised when the man and I stopped her for a quick bite on Saturday.  What a lovely patio!  It's huge!  The interior of the space is nice too.  Looked very clean!

Our waitress was manning the whole patio by herself and doing a pretty good job at it.  She was informative and didn't rush us.
.
The man got wings & I got a wrap.  They weren't too bad.  The beer was beer.
I'll go back.  I think it would be a great place for friends to get together!"
3,This place was just OK. Nothing to rave home about. I didn't think it was any worse or any better than other froyo places I have been to.
3,"----------------CASH Preferred.  Credit Card -- $10 minimum---------------

This is important if you're a single as most things on the menu are less than $10.     This place does not have filtered water or even water from a tap.  So, don't forget to grab your drink and pay for it with your food.  I didn't realize I could not get a cup of water when I ordered/paid for my food, so I ended up drinking a bottle of warm water in my car when I was done eating.  Meh.

This restaurant is down a street I would never drive down.  Most people would probably never pass this store in their commute to any place in the Valley.  The restaurant itself is located inside of a middle eastern (maybe Islamic/Kosher/?? as there are no pork products in this store) grocery store.  You will not see the name ""Al-Hana"" on the outside when you drive up, so don't be confused.

I had lunch here last week with the Yelper lunch UYE group with Rand H. I tried their chicken schwarma and the fatoosh.  Both tasted very good to me.  I thought the chicken was over cooked, but the flavor was still there and exceptionally good.  

The fun part about eating here is exploring the grocery store and standing out like a sore thumb.  I loved checking out all the products.  The herbs and spices you find in whole foods for astronomical prices are not so expensive in there.

I would love to go back and try this place, when I have cash on me.  I hope the 2nd time is the charm!

----------------CASH Preferred.  Credit Card -- $10 minimum---------------"
3,"I went here for breakfast.  Ordered two eggs, corned beef hash, and toast.  It was okay.  I do not know if this would be considered ""Iowan"" style.  I am originally from the Northwestern corner of Illinois, on the Iowa border.  I do not know if I would call it ""Iowa"" style.  The food was okay."
3,"This place was ok. 

We were driving around trying to find a place to try in our new neighborhood and for some reason the building here sort of stood out. It didn't really...we were just hungry.

When you walk in, as the name suggests, you're overwhelmed with Iowa stuff which is interesting. To your right would be a bar (in terms of sitting at the bar to eat your meal) and a couple TVs). To your front and left is the seating which doesn't have any kind of privacy. You could be inches away from the table next to you.

Sitting there looking over the menu kind of reminded me of Joe Pesci from My Cousin Vinny when they ordered breakfast: ""we'll take two breakfasts"". There is plenty to choose from it just felt limited at the same time, if that makes sense.

The service was good.

The food itself was nothing to write home about. We'll only come back if we want that midwest/southern feel."
3,"Went for a quick dinner. The place was almost closing. Ordered one sheekh kababb plate and one iraqi kabab plate. The price was very good for the portion. However, we did not really like the kababs. They tasted average. Both plates came with bread. Bread was also average. I would go to other places if I want to eat kabab. The place has not impressed me to come again."
3,"I took my Japanese ESL friend to the beaches and happened to walk by...a lineup was out the door.  We tried their gelato - I had pistacio and she had hazelnut.  Yummy! 

Just be prepared to shell out around $4 for a scoop."
3,"We had the deep dish pizza. It was pretty good. The crust could of been more buttery and a bit more crunchy. Sauce was good, I like that the owner responded back to my review."
3,"This place is just like a small town diner.  Every small town I have been to has a little place like this where the locals eat.   I found Iowa Cafe using my Yelp Blackberry App after finishing a hearing at the East Mesa Justice Court.  The restaurant itself is a small and old fashioned in a 1970's midwest kind of way, but it was clean.  My waitress was friendly and she took my order and delivered my food without any delay.

I had the corned beef hash, over easy eggs, and rye toast.  The breakfast was hot and delicious, but very traditional.  There was no artistic license taken with the food.   My meal was ridiculously inexpensive.

Don't come here looking for healthy options on the menu.  There are no egg-white omelets or low-carb wraps.  My breakfast really stuck to my ribs, though, and I did not get hungry again until almost dinner time."
3,"Keep in mind that this pizza was a gift from Sanfratello's, via YELP!  I feel bad not giving them a higher rating but I did bump it up half a star.  Service was indeed 5 star but down hill after that.  The free thin pizza was dry, with scant sauce but good quality toppings.  The cheese was not stringy and elastic as I would have preferred.  (Personal taste here of course)
The girl on the phone was delightful and very upbeat.  She told me it would be ready in 25 to 30 minutes and it was ready in 25!  The owner introduced himself and shook my hand, everyone was quite pleasant.  We consumed less than half of the medium thin crust pizza gifted to us because it was so dry.  I sprinkled some good EVOO on it but it only helped a little.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.  Included was their dessert bread ""Fritz"" which needed to be cooked more and have more sugar on it.  We consumed half of one piece each.  Maybe we just don't dig the Chicago experience, not for us, sorry."
3,"Ok....so I'm sad for the 3 stars because of the potential  of this place. We were greeted immediately and sat down at a nice booth. We put in our drink order right away but this is where the promptness ended. Like, slam on the brakes ended. Ridiculously ended. Tyler was the server and was very sweet. We ordered an iced t, a milkshake and a cocktail so we weren't surprised by the wait until it was literally 30 minutes later when we got them. We asked a couple times where our drinks were and he just kept saying ""one sec"". Our food came out before our drinks. We had the split pea soup, which was delicious, a fried pork tenderloin sandwich and it was plenty to share and corned beef and hash. All came out as ordered and nice and hot. Still, no drinks. Im getting super irritated at this point but Tyler was really trying and the other server on was absolutely no help. Its a small cafe style place and if there was teamwork in place, I feel like they would be more successful at making things run more smoothly. She just kept yelling at him to get his food out of the window etc....I would hate working with her as she just helped in his getting futher behind which as you can guess, is horrible for business. We also ordered a piece of the cyclone pie with cherries and peaches and vanilla ice cream. Very good and not too hot. The bill for all that was 42 bucks so not bad on that, either. All in all, I would check this place out again."
3,"Al-Hana wasn't bad, it just didn't blow me away.  I went there for lunch and ordered the chicken shawarma and a (very large) side of hummus with some pita.  The sandwich was smaller than I expected, but for $5 is pretty fair.  Everything tasted pretty good, but I've had more flavorful Middle Eastern food outside of Phoenix. 

A note about the neighborhood.  I can understand why some reviewers weren't totally comfortable here, but I really don't think it's a bad or dangerous area.  In my opinion, low income doesn't always equal 'hood.  There are families in the nearby park, well-kept homes, clean sidewalks, etc.  It's not an area that's going to entice to explore on a leisurely walk, but I felt plenty safe walking there from McDowell."
3,"It is a hidden place you would never know about, but really is it worth knowing?

 I went here for lunch with my coworker who took some convincing. We walked in the front door of the market and saw the menu. We took some time staring at it as we expect to see a few more options. I opted for the falafil sandwich $2.99 and a side of fires for 1.99. I also purchased a juice from the market side of the store. 

While our food was prepared we walked the isles of this market. We enjoyed seeing the alien to us foods. Our number was called out and our food was waiting for us on the counter.

 We picked up and then unwrapped it. My first surprise was the bread, it was not a pita, peta nor lafa it was some other form of thin flatbread. Along with my falafel there was a salad of pickles and other pickled vegetables some were shades of neon purple and ample sauce. The falafel was a bit too firm for me, and the flat bread was not my favorite but the salad part was good. 

My coworker did really enjoy his chicken shwarma calling it ""damn awesome""

They did lack the condiments I wanted as some hot sauce would have been appreciated. 

The fries were a bit undercooked, unsalted and we lacked ketchup.

Overall it was a cheap decent meal, but the location, ambiance and lack of cups of water or fountain drinks lowered my score."
3,"Each time I was here, I came alone and I just got a pedicure. Nothing fancy, no designs, no acrylics, just a pedi with color. This salon is VERY clean, is laid out very nicely, the chairs are great and they offer wine and snacks. Prices are fair and there are multiple packages. Staff was not overly friendly but not rude. What keeps me from offering any additional stars is what others have said. I didn't feel welcomed here. In the five or so times that I visited, the owner only spoke to me once, and that time only came because he happened to be the person to ring me up. The other times, I'd catch him looking at me, but never a word, or even so much as a smile. I could be wrong but it feels like they are going for a certain type of clientele here and based on appearances alone, I am not it. That said, if that's what they're going for, they may want to go to Ballantyne or South Park and not Plaza Midwood which is one of if not the most friendly, open, diverse and welcoming neighborhood in Charlotte."
3,"3.5 stars. 
I never really know what to make of Perk-Cup Cafe. Is it a restaurant (the place is packed on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch, and they offer full menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner), a bakery (the windows case is packed with cakes, cookies, and other bakery delights), or a cafe (a variety of coffee drinks are available)? 

The thing is, I guess that's where Perk-Cup falls a little short for me; it seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. In fairness, I have only been there (albeit on a number of different occasions) for breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday, and I have never opted for the brunch buffet, electing rather to order off their menu. 

The food is always really good. Fresh eggs, fresh ingredients, and some of the best pancakes you've had in a very long time unless you're making them yourself; yes they're that good. 

The service is ok. They're generally nice enough but there also seems to be a systemic problem somewhere behind the scenes, as it always feels as though you are on the cusp of utter chaos, like they're just barely hanging on. It's just a bit disorganized and it makes one feel a bit uneasy. 

On the coffee side of the house, let's just say you've had better coffee at a lesser place I'm sure. I'd either take the ""Cafe"" out of the name, or find a new coffee vendor and/or barista. It's not horrible mind you, but it's not anything to write home about either. 

The bakery case is always full of sweet treats, although I question their freshness. I've never actually eaten any of there bakery items, and they all look really good, but I wonder how long a quarter of a cake could have been sitting there when I come in on a Saturday or Sunday morning. How quickly could they have sold 3/4 of a cake by 9 am? See what I mean? But again, in fairness, I've never actually tried anything from their bakery so I may be way off. 

Like I said, I've been to Perk-Cup a number of times for breakfast, and I will go a number more times. I've always enjoyed my breakfast there. But with a couple of tweeks, I bet this place could really be something!"
3,"A mixed bag of goods and bads.  Their ""new"" location (at Higley and Brown) is a building formerly occupied by an Arby's; they moved in just after Christmas 2011, and you would think the new facility would be pretty spiffy because they would take time to fix it up so cute.  Not so!  It still looks like a tired and shabby Arby's, all scuffed up and untidy and frankly not very clean.  So, ambiance is a maybe a 2.  Now, prices are most reasonable, so for value I give them a 4+ rating, as in this economy, you want them to be easy on your wallet.  But, on the down side, the quality of what you get for a really low price is not so good, so my rating there is 1 1/2.  I took one of my pork chops home, but in the end just threw it out as it was tough, like leather.  Wait staff was great, attentive, and right on with answers, so I give them a 4.  The one saving grace amongst all these mixed ratings is certainly their PIE.  That, for sure, is a solid 5 stars and makes up for their lesser ratings.  I had their apple pie, um mm.  My wife had a different pie, and she ate it so fast I did not have a chance to sample it so I can't tell you what it was.  I hope the Iowa Cafe management continues to improve this place, and perhaps is will time to catch the rhythm of running a cafe."
3,"Perk Up 'n listen. First off the food is really pretty good!
Most everything else needs a lil Pick Up!
The ambiance is not homey, wide open & 2 much like a cafeteria. Could use a lil rearrange, w/ some partitions, and please HIDE the busser station to the other side of that wall!!  
Servers could be a bit Perkier. 
Finally, they need to advertise Dinner, bc the place is a ghost town at night and feels kinda lonely eating in there.  Busy during day, but evidently nobody knows they serve dinner.  Need to advertise more and could use a sign at street w/ Dinner specials maybe?!"
3,"3.5 stars!

Stopped in here on a Thursday looking for some casual grub. Rivals has an extensive draft beer list! We started with the fried mushrooms, they were good but not memorable. We also had wings and they were the standout! My only qualm was that the prices were really high for this type of sports bar, especially for the smaller size portions."
3,"Good food and very spotty service. We often hit them up on weekends after soccer or other stuff since they're so close to home, have good food, and nice coffee drinks. 

If they weren't so close we'd probably hardly show up because of the service. But they're close enough and the food is consistently good.

Burgers are really good but they will charge you for simple toppings like red onion (???!!) and everything on the breakfast side is yummy. Tasty coffee drinks too."
3,"My wife and I come here for breakfast frequently.  The food is good overall.  The eggs are always cooked well, pancakes and baked items are very good, and there is a decent variety of items.  The egg bakes are very good as well.  However, the service is horrible.  Waitresses are arguing in front of you, complaining about how busy they are, and it takes forever to get seated and get your food.  Also, it can sometimes be challenging to get a smile out of anyone.    It will take 45-1 hour from walking in the door to getting your food."
3,"Stopped by Ed's Real Scoop while checking out the Beaches Jazz Streetfest.  It has been on my list of places to visit since I heard they have Burnt Marshmallow flavour.
Not surprisingly, there was a line up to the door, but service was pretty quick!

My cousin and I each had a scoop of burnt marshmallow. We needed a dessert after grabbing food from various vendors at the festival. It was nice and refreshing with a bit of crunch from pieces of burnt marshmallow. But since I had my first bite of Toasted Marshmallow from Greg's Ice Cream (ONLY the Distillery location) I found ERS to be a bit too sweet and I wasn't able to finish it.

Ed's Real Scoop is a nice neighbourhood shop... I'd love to try the other flavours when I'm in the area."
3,"Food was not awful, but atmosphere and basics lacking. Always leery of a place that has fountain iced tea."
3,"Very good!  I'm only giving it 3 stars because I've only been there twice, for breakfast. I'm not sure how other items on the menu are, but if they're anything like breakfast, they're going to taste great!
Very clean, especially the bathrooms, which is important to me in a restaurant. The overall look of the place is cozy and inviting.
They stay pretty steady on weekends from what I've seen. I love that this place is pretty close to home, yummy food, reasonable priced and great wait staff."
3,"The Iowa Cafe isn't amazing, but it's a decent choice for breakfast in Northeast Mesa. 

I'm not a huge breakfast fan in general, but I do enjoy their biscuits and gravy. They're about as close to homemade as possible. The menu seems pretty typically Midwestern. Portions are large and the fare is very hearty.
 
Service is pretty hit and miss. During the winter it's packed with snowbirds-but what isn't in this neighborhood?- and wait times can be lengthy."
3,"The yogurt is good, but the topping choices were a little stale. Still, it was a good price and it was clean and neat."
3,The Iowa cafe is moving its location to Higley and Brown The food is good and like the claim it taste home cooked friendly wait staff good service quaint atmosphere I ordered the home made meatloaf and mashed potatoes there were smothered with a brown gravy $7.95 good food good price
3,"I just paid $30 for 1 Pizza... No Salads, No Delivery... Look at my Receipt on the PHOTO section.... look like they charged me for 2 pizzas.... The Pizza was good... I enjoyed it... but DANG $30 for 1 PIZZA...."
3,"A good change of pace from the other pizza spots in Gilbert, but our 12"" pepperoni pizza was $20!  It also took 40 minutes to make.  We do pizza nights when we need something cheap and quick... this place is neither. However, it was tasty and I could see us splurging every once in a while."
3,"Have been a patron at this restaurant since it opened, and recently have become unimpressed with the current establishment. Don't get me wrong- the food is great and one of the best breakfast/brunch/lunch spots in Berea. Have never had a bad meal here and probably never will. However, the service has deteriorated over the years. When it first opened, my mother and I used to go there for breakfast on the weekend and could get in and out in 45 minutes. Now, we're lucky if we get in and out in a hour and half to two hours. Our drink orders always come right away but we end up waiting at least a half hour for our food. In fact, attempted to eat lunch there today and today's experience took the cake for bad service. There was a party going on in the back room, but our waitress did not notify us of this fact until she came back 35 minutes after we ordered to apologize for slow service because of the party. We then asked her how much longer it would be and when she told us we would STILL have to wait another 10 to 15 minutes, we left. A party should not slow service down to that extreme, and if it does the owners should reevaluate how the kitchen runs because obviously something is amiss. Even the half hour wait on a slow day is an indicator that something needs to be done to improve efficiency.

Disregarding service, the food my mother and I have eaten here over the years has always been great. For breakfast, I usually get ""The Berea"" with scrambled eggs, bacon, and a biscuit and she either orders that or pancakes. Their ""Turkey, Bacon, Cheddar"" wrap is also an excellent option for lunch. I really do love the food here and that's why I was very upset when my mother and I had but no choice to leave without food today because the service was so poor. Overall, if you order take-out you do not wait nearly as long for the food, so if in the area and you want to experience the fantastic breakfast offered by Perk-cUp, I suggest ordering it to-go to save yourself the service headache. Food is deserving of all 5 stars, but their service is only deserving of 1. Great eats, but make sure to get it to-go."
3,"I had been keeping me eye on Rivals for a while. I do uber eats and i had ended up here a couple of times so i went to yelp and bookmarked the heck out of it. 

Me and hubby finally got a free day to ourselves so why not watch the indians/yankees (go NYY) game at a local sports bar right?

We got there around 1:30 and it was empty, that's fine because it was a sunday and the church crowd wasn't out yet lol. We sat at one of the little pedestal seats right by the bar, the table was wobbly but i wont get into that just yet. The menu had a HUGE variety of beers and wines, almost 30+ from what I counted. That's what I love to see in a sports bar.The menu selections were great too, however i feel like they focus a lot on tuna and exotic dishes rather than the root of all bar food. Im being picky!

Now, I am a self proclaimed wing connoisseur and so i judge a places ability on food  ( especially bar food) on their wings. And i have to say this place fell a bit short of my expectations. Their sauce choices were awesome, some definitely unique sauces and rubs. You have to pay extra for all flats or all drums though? LAME. The wings were very fatty and had a lot of extra bone on them, not as much meat as i had hopes for.Also they only give you one small little cup of ranch for 10 wings? 3 pieces of celery? what is this?!The ale battered onion rings came out in a literal vat of grease and no dipping sauce, i was kind of turned off by how truly greasy they were. The french fries were the show stopped for me, fresh cut and they came with ranch dressing and some other dipping sauce. You know its bad when you go to a sports bar and the best thing you ate was the fries. 

Its a cheap meal and the staff is nice and helpful so i guess that's where the charm was, but for now i think ill stay closer to home and get my amazing wings elsewhere."
3,"Not a bad place, but I dont consider it a ""great sports bar"". I had a reuben, it was pretty good. However, the mac n' cheese needs a new recipe. Not much taste with it."
3,"Great place to go if you're a Steelers fan to watch the games. There's an entire bar/room area where they seat you all filled with Steelers fans and a ton of TV's showing the game (if Directv cooperates.) Like the owner told us, they're Browns Backers, but welcome Steelers fans! That part is all cool! And yes, the owner and most staff are really nice! Outdoor patio is really cool, although you cannot actually see the TV screens due to the glare. 

Now the food. I have not at all been satisfied with their food. The boneless wings were ok, but that's not really hard, is it? Well, you wouldn't think a burger or nachos would be hard to get right either. The burger was overcooked and tasted like the lighter fluid used to start a charcoal grill. The nachos....uh, these need to be taken off the menu until they make real nachos. Sorry, but tortilla chips half way covered with cheese, a mound of olives and peppers, topped with a hamburger patty broken into large chunks (and yes, also tasted like lighter fluid) does not count as ""loaded nachos"" to me. 

Service is hit or miss...and by miss I mean we missed our server as she disappeared for 20+ minutes, leaving our glasses empty, etc etc. And this was at a point were the dining area was half empty, in between games. 

So, we may go back...I don't know. The crowd gets pretty intoxicated and belligerent not ok to scream F#((, Ass....., etc etc so the whole restaurant/bar can hear. There are actually a few families there watching the games too! Or just dining. 

I"
3,"A little breakfast spot that has the old dinner feel to it so if your looking for something of the more local downhome feel for breakfast versus a chain this is a good spot. 

While it is nothing that is outstanding it will hit the spot if your looking for just a simple breakfast. I have had the corned beef hash and 2 eggs twice now and while it hasn't been anything that jumps out and screams ""come back for more"" it still hasn't stopped me from clearing my plate each time. However it has needed a kick of tabasco and some pepper. The pepper is because it is a little blander than i would like but the tabasco is just because i love spicy breakfast. The first time my eggs were a little overdone but not horrible and they were just fine the second.

If your somebody who prefers a mom and pop place over a chain like iHop this is a pretty good alternative and probably a better taste too."
3,"I've been to this place a few times to satisfy my yogurt cravings since Yogurtland isn't around where I live. Upon entering, I was greeted and offered sample cups but declined as I was only interested in my usual original tart. I added toppings of strawberries, fruity pebbles, rainbow mochi, and cheesecake bits. The available fruits and candy along with different syrups were fresh and abundant. Personally, I felt like I was overpaying for what I got compared to yogurtland. When I tried the yogurt, I didn't taste the tangy sweetness of the tart that I was expecting. Also, I felt the texture seemed more icy or slush like. Besides these two things, I thought this place was overall average and will be stopping by again if I get cravings again."
3,"It was alright. After reading reviews, I expected better. 

Restaurant is located inside a really cool market, so spend some extra time looking around. The produce and meat is worth a trip back.

You order at the counter and the girl who took our order repeated some special instructions, but they were either not written down for the kitchen or the cook just ignored them. After waiting for the food, we just decided to pick out what we didn't like rather than return the item.

You have to get your drinks from a cooler. There's more than the one near the counter, so look around if you don't see what you like.

The menu is pretty standard middle eastern fair. I got a chicken shawarma sandwich. It was okay. The hummus was good. The pita a bit flat and dried out for my taste.

Prices were good.

A word on the neighborhood. Yes, it's not your typical trendy location and there's a lot of poverty around, but that can be said for a lot of neighborhoods in the Phoenix metro area. I've been afraid in some South Scottsdale places and there are some areas in North Phoenix that are down right nasty.

Part of the charm of places like Al-Hana is where you find them. It's those immigrant, ethnic places that you know are authentic and have yet to be stamped with watered down big box culture. I guess if you're not up for an eating adventure, there's got to be an Olive Garden holding a booth in your name!"
3,"Been here a lot recently and the past couple times we went MULTIPLE machines weren't working. Another time we waited to check out for probably 5 mins while the girl was in the back room on the phone. Our ice cream was melting so we started eating it (oops, but not our fault). I do like that they provide high chairs but I went to put my son in one and they were extremely filthy with caked on ice cream and crumbs all over the place. It looked as though they had never been washed. I much prefer yogurtini to this place. They have much better options. Every time we come to this one all of the flavors are fruity with an exception of the boring original chocolate and vanilla. Also, I've never seen a yogurt place that doesn't offer swirl options of the two flavors in the machines!"
3,"Nice diner for breakfast or lunch. Good prices and really good food. They have a drive through for take out that makes it super fast for work lunches. Service is OK, bit it depends on your server (like everywhere). Nice atmosphere and seating options.

EDIT:  They changed their menu and raised there prices, removing some of their signature dishes (or at least the ones that everyone that I know regularly ordered).  They got rid of all of my favorites, and raised the price of their breakfasts by more than $1, taking them from a good price to overpriced.  I still go there because the food is good and it's close to work, but it's not as automatic a choice as it once was."
3,"Stopped for our first time visit to cafe. We went for breakfast and liked that it was a really bright and clean cafe.  The prices were reasonable for breakfast.  $5.99 sausage gravy and biscuits. $1.29 for two eggs added on.  $7.98 for 2 pancakes, 3 strips of bacon and 2 eggs. Husband's sausage gravy tasted homemade with lots of sausage chunks.  Bacon was crispy as requested.  Only food complaint was the pancakes.  They were so tough that it was hard to cut them.  When I brought it to the servers attention, she told me that was how they make them, that their pancakes are dense, not fluffy.  When I said that I could barely cut them, she offered to have them make another batch and they could try cooking them less time.  The replacements were a little better but still pretty tough. (Note to cafe:  maybe the pancake batter needs refreshed with baking powder or stirred less?  This should result in a better pancake.)  I opted for the blackberry topping over the Mrs. Butterworth's syrup.  Great choice, topping had lots of blackberries.  Now for my Tea Rant:  Hot tea drinkers will get this.  Two things ruin a hot tea experience.  First is contaminated water.  Water is contaminated when they use containers that previously held coffee, resulting in coffee tasting tea. Perk-cUp Cafe does NOT have contaminated tea water, but they hit on my other hot tea nerve.  The second is tea refills.  We were charged the same price for both coffee and tea, $1.89 each.  Husband got his hot coffee and even a refill pot was placed on the table for his convenience.  I got a tea bag and carafe of hot water.  When server offered a refill, she wanted to charge me another $1.89 for a second tea bag. What? Husband gets a whole pot of coffee on the table? Coffee is way more expensive than tea.  Anyway, she did give me a 2nd tea bag, this time, only because I had a problem with the pancakes.  (another note to cafe:  Rethink the policy of charging for a 2nd tea bag.  Do you charge for refills on pop or iced tea?)  End Rant.
I like supporting locally owned restaurants and will most likely return for lunch sometime.  The menu offered many different sandwiches, salads, and soups.  If I went for breakfast though, I would skip the pancakes."
3,"I postponed writing my review of Tortas Paquime I July since it was my first visit and our experience was 2.5 stars.  Today's visit brought them up to a 3 star rating. 

The Good ~ They use very fresh ingredients, their tortas and variety of postres are very good.  They offer a soup of the day.  The service is friendly and they are fairly quick to make your order.  Their prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most other places that offer the same menu options.  

The not so Good ~ Their Aguas Frescas are not made fresh to order and tasted very watered down.  The tortas are very good however their Tacos Volteados was more of a melted cheesy tacos than a shredded pork tacos.  They were also a too greasy.  

The Bad ~ We had to sit on the side of the restaurant that has the TV and it was too loud.  It was playing some kind of Mexican comedy that was not appropriate for the children to watch that were dinning at the time.  It was also very hot in in the restaurant.  I will blame that on the Arizona heat."
3,"Nothing really special, but good. Not a lot of small Italian places to go eat in Charlotte so this one fills the spot nicely. Pizza is pretty good, sauce is a pretty basic marinara. Chicken parm was tasty, again the meat sauce good use a little more seasoning. Great garlic bread and dressings with their salads."
3,"The reviews from Yelp encouraged us to visit this great little spot with an extensive menu. I ordered the classic breakfast and my honey the breakfast that included poached eggs and pancakes. Both were OK. The pancakes seemed dry. The service was terrific. The highlight was the chocolate and banana crepe I ordered, delicious! The potatoes that are served with the breakfast dishes are divine, such a treat."
3,"If you're weary of the high end expense account restaurants on the strip and just crave something that's fun and flavorful, this is a recommended restaurant. Shop first in the mall - inside are fun stores like Zara and Diesel - and then enjoy the tapas to your stomach's content.

This was our second trip in two years, and the experience both times was good enough to keep us coming back. 

Recommended if you're looking for something under $50 per person on the strip, including drinks."
3,"Great concept in a great location, that being said there is a ton of room for improvement, the fence isn't very tall and there are a lot of areas that there is a bench pushed up to the fence making it very easy for any dog to escape. 
They allow any dog in no questions asked. 
The entire place is in desperate need of a pressure wash and cleaning. 
They charge for a pint of beer but it's in a 12oz plastic cup, that's 1/3rd short of a pint. 
The bartenders, for the most part, are huge dog lovers (and good looking). 
No place will ever be perfect for everyone but with some attention to detail most of the negative reviews could be corrected with very little effort."
3,Ricas tortas y aguas. Aunque les pongan menos aguacate y menos cane que antes. Los nachos de carne asada muy grandes y ricos. Y el pan dulce igual de delicioso. Ojala pronto abran una locación en Mesa.
3,"After really enjoying Firefly, my friends and I decided to try Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  We were pretty disappointed... smaller portions, not as good, and higher priced than Firefly.  And it was pretty dead in there, too.  Thanks, we'll stick to Firefly."
3,"The service was okay but the cleanliness could use improvement. Some of the syrup bottles had been leaking for awhile and built a nasty sticky crust on the outside of the bottles.
The exterior of the restaurant looked great, customer service could use some improvements with a smile! Although none of the staff were rude, they also did not appear to be having a good day and partially projected that towards the customers.
I would definitely go back to this location with the hopes of providing a higher star rating."
3,"I was super excited to visit my family and check out downtown Medina with my son last Sunday. We decided to have lunch at House of Hunan at 1pm and had a group of 5 including a 3 year old. The restaurant had a very tranquil and relaxing vibe with the windows opened in the front so everyone walking could see inside from the street. The seating was interesting as there were 4 large tables surrounded with big leather chairs, regular chairs and tables and long wooden benches that are accompanied by pillows down the middle. The middle also has a metallic waterfall down half of the restaurant that my son seemed to enjoy. Nice and relaxing.
 
We were greeted by our server and we decided to have a shared meal that included appetizers, sushi and the lunch specialties. I started with the wonton soup that was just ok. To be honest, the broth was pretty salty and the wonton didn't have much flavor. The egg roll I had next was filled with lots and lots of cabbage but it was pleasant appetizer that I would order again, especially with the duck sauce that accompanied it. We all shared the crab and tuna sushi's which were very fresh. We also shared the volcano roll which was a California roll topped with spicy crawfish, which had a little heat and definitely a roll that will fill you up. The best ways to describe the Teriyaki Chicken dish was that it was bland and didn't have much seasoning. Our General Tso's dish was the complete opposite with fresh flavor and the heat I was looking for. I was not impressed with the fried rice, it tasted like just plain old cooked brown rice.
 
Overall, we had a pleasant experience at House of Hunan. Our server was friendly, accommodating and the atmosphere of the restaurant was fantastic. I would come back but I would probably just stick with a meal of sushi and skip the specialty dishes."
3,"Un petit dej du dimanche!

Service rapide, grand choix de repas dans le menu, dont plusieurs options moins classiques comme des ufs dans le trou (du bagel) gratiné. Pour ma part j'ai pris le bagel Montréal (saumon fumé, fromage à la crème, câpres et oignons rouges) assez bon, mais trop peu de saumon ! Le gros déjeuner du constructeur que mon homme a pris l'a repu, mais rien d'excitant de ce côté-là. Avis, ne prenez pas d'extras, ils sont a 2,50 la pièce et ça revient cher. Les smoothies n'étaient pas très bons surtout celui au café et bananes.

Ca fait la job on va dire !"
3,"Food be bomb, but gaaaaahhh damn it put me on the toilet my G . I almost died in that b*tch."
3,"3 stars because my husbands dish was very tasty - peach chicken.
2 stars for service- wait was entirely to long to get our appetizers and  meals for a week night. The place wasn't packed from
Ordering to finally getting out food was exactly a hour. Our waitress wasn't the most happy person either. You can get a better dinner for  $60 somewhere else."
3,"I have been to evolve three times in the last year, and this is the first time I have been compelled to write a review. First I want to say that the facial and massage I had here were excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed those experience and the staff was fantastic. Yesterday I had my first pedicure at this spa, and I was incredibly disappointed. The woman that did my nails was distracted, the pedicure was messy (my nails looked dirty when they were done) and the whole experience was not at all what I expected given my positive experience with the other treatments. I'm rating this three stars, the massage and facial get a five star but the pedicure gets a single star."
3,"Excellent atmosphere and ambiance.  The tapas were good, but of course, you need to order multiple plates to become full, except for the paella.  The paella was very good as well.  The service was also wonderful.  I have gone to this location several times, w/ both friends and dates.  I remember coming here during happy hour, and BOY did those SANGRIA's sneak up on ME =)"
3,"There comes a point in every man's (or women's) life when they need to branch out and really test the bounds of eating crappy. Enter these crazy lavish buffets. 

I'll be honest, I do have a weak spot for these places when I'm really hungry. As I found myself in this predicament the other night, and I had to follow up with the fancy Yelp app to see what was avail. Tokyo was an interesting find. 

Ultimately, I'd give a 4-star rating based on their selection, and a 2-star on their quality, meeting in the middle at a 3. Walking in I was pretty impressed by how the buffet is set-up and the amount of different items through-out the place. It got me fairly stoked about the meal.

Well, that's where the excitement ended. I just couldn't not find much of anything to my liking. I will admit, there were some items that were just mediocre, the rest were just felt loaded with MSG and generally not appetizing. The mac n cheese was like the sorriest excuse for mac n cheese on the face of the planet. It was literally so watered down I could probably call it noodle soup. Even my kid wouldn't eat it.

A few other pro's are that there is more than adequate seating, it does have a good layout, and generally pretty clean considering how some people eat here:-/

If you happen to frequent Tokyo, do yourself a favor and go either fresh hibachi or straight to their sushi section."
3,"Over time this restaurant has changed to de-emphasize tapas. The menu is now more focused on Paella. Most of the tapas I've had here were quite good. With the smaller number of tapas selections, there is little that is exotic or challenging. It was pretty much impossible to have a tapas dinner my last visit. The Paella is not as good as the tapas. The new menu is disappointing."
3,"This seemed like a really fun idea..

I went to see my sister and her family and I took my dog..so we went to Dog Bar.

Well..i think if youre a regular, and know all the other people and dogs there that night, you will have fun.

No one makes sure your dog has shots, theres pee puddles and poop is just sprayed away with a hose, possibly onto my feet..im not sure any employees were present, because other than the friendly bartender, no one is identified as staff.

There were alot of large dogs that werent being watched by thier owners, who then thought it was funny that i was concerned about the well being of my small dog..maybe separate sections would be a good idea 

The place is really cute, and they have some fun merchandise as well..inside there are lots of cool pieces of dog artwork..beer prices were awesome"
3,"The last time I had Dunkin Donuts was about 17 years ago when I lived in Chicago.  I remembered it much better.  This particular location is very clean, I will say that.  Donuts are eh... pink box donuts are much better... but those places don't usually have drive-thrus.  Coffee is pretty good."
3,"My friends and I stopped by here looking for some quick healthy food.  It's located in a shopping building.  There is plenty of parking behind the building.  It's across from a school.  They seem to cater to students.  There are plenty of student deals on the menu.  

At this location, you order up front and then they deliver the food to you.  We came here late afternoon on a Friday and there were two other tables here.  The prices were decent for what you get.  I particularly love their drink selection.  I got a rose ice tea that I love!  

Anyways, in the mood for kabobs in Vegas?  This place is good!"
3,"Ok, yes..... I am a WH fan!  Bacon egg and cheese on texas toast with a side of hash browns.  Great breakfast!"
3,"Grabbed some takeout at the request of my Chinese-speaking, Chinese-food-craving daughter. The bar area is nice, and I enjoyed a cold Kirin beer while I waited. The food quality was good. Chicken fried rice was excellent. I ordered the moo shu pork for myself. The flavor was good, but the wrappers were a little stiff and, most disappointingly, they didn't include any hoisin sauce! How can you miss that! Still, pretty good overall."
3,"My co-workers and I stopped in here for lunch on a busy Friday afternoon. The lunch special is a good value, and the restaurant smells amazing, but the pizza wasn't my favorite. The dough was very thick and chewy. We were a rather large party, so I understood why our wait time was a little long, but our waitress gave us drinks once and then was never seen again. Just an ""eh, ok"" experience for me."
3,"A solid spot of standard breakfast food. It has a large menu with everything from eggs to bacon to Greek yogurt. The Go Bananas smoothie was very good and the toast was dripping with butter. Overall, if you're craving some standard breakfast fare, it's a good spot to go."
3,"Went for lunch and got the chef's choice sushi with California Roll. My table also had the spicy tuna and Alaska Roll. The spicy tuna is not the tuna steak with sauce as I prefer but more the purée. While the Sweat and Sour soup was very flavorful, the sushi we each had was very bland. Glad we went as the decor and atmosphere is contemporary and a nice dinning experience. The sushi however I would simply pass and go to Project Sushi."
3,"They have a variety of items, sushi and a hibachi grill. I wanted to love this place but the buffet items were always cold....meaning they can do better to make sure the food is at least warm. The fish was so rubbery! The egg drop soup was thick and looked like the egg yolk hadn't cooked in it....I swear I hope no one gets sick eating raw eggs.  It's big and clean and the staff is friendly."
3,"It's ok.  I could be snob-bish & state that it's not even close to food in Spain.  But with the economy & airfare being cheap it's definitely better to go to Barcelona, Madrid, Malaga, or Cadiz etc & enjoy the food & beauty of a dfferent world.  But I digress.  If you want a cheap version of Spanish ham, the serrano ham & caramelized pineapple will do; other best items were the short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper and the mushroom empanada."
3,"I ordered a large cheese steak, with mushrooms, onions, and peppers. 

House of Pizza's large cheese steak is a LLLLLARGEEEEEE sandwich.
The combo comes with ruffled potato chips. 
The large cheese steak is almost $10, which is acceptable given the size and quality.

Service is pretty good, but not exceptional. I ordered a Diet Pepsi and my waitress brought me an iced tea. {shrug} I got this corrected without any drama.

They were good about keeping beverages refilled, which is my major pet peeve. They were also good at bussing and cleaning the tables when diner's left. 

The kitchen was generous with the steak and the mozzarella cheese atop the sandwich. They were also ample amounts of peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The bread was nice and crusty on the outside and tender in the middle.....really delicious. It was a VERY satisfying sandwich for a cheese steak lover.
 
They include mayonnaise on their cheese steak, which is definitely not traditional. I didn't have any problem with that. 

Advice:
- Hot cherry peppers hoagie spread,"" would add flavor and spice to their cheese steaks. It is available in every grocery store.
- They need to add a little salt and pepper to the steak as it is being cooked.
- I would have appreciated some garlic powder on the tables or sautéed crushed garlic in the cooked meat. It makes the sandwich mo better. ;o)

The men's bathroom? Gross. 

There was also no room in the men's restroom for anyone with a wheelchair, which bothers me. 

Current sanitation rating as of 4/11/2015 = 94.5%"
3,First time having a cappacino here.  Delicious with a glazed donut. Donut tasted older but definitely better than Krispy Kreme. Service was mediocre. Only one lady being cashier and making beverages/retrieving donuts. Would return for a craving but it's average for a donut shop.
3,"Always awesome food and atmosphere.  I've been here many times and never had a bad meal.  The menus offers a wide variety, and suitable for a pallets.  

Service on the other hand is another story.  The hostesses are not friendly, and seem like you are bothering them for coming in.  Waitresses are not attentive and leave your cups empty, and plates at your table.  We have had a few occasions when they've been just rude; again, almost like you're interrupting them for coming in. 

All that into account, the food is worth some tolerance as long as you bring good company...or order take out."
3,"This is an interesting place. It's marketed as a ""dueling piano bar"", I think at some points you can see that, eventually it'll just turn into a karaoke session. 

You submit your song request, they'll play it (of course with their own twist). I like that they made a twist of basically top 40 hits into their own versions, I thought that was neat. The female piano dancer will occasionally get on top of the piano and do her singing, this just turned into a mini dive bar concert now. 

But it's located in the Epicenter, go up to the 3rd floor (or was it 4th?) and it'll be on the right, you can't miss it. On a busy night, there will be plenty of people on the ""outside patio"" just hanging out with their drinks. 

I wanted to check up the epicenter so I came here, it was ok overall to me. small place, lots of people, decent music depending on what they play. Expect to stand since seats will go pretty fast and I wouldn't come here if you expect to dance, apparently some people will dance in their tiny little floor up front."
3,"Part of the Lettuce Entertain You group of restaurants, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba started out in Chicago, then opened a branch in Las Vegas.  It specializes in tapas.  Originally intended as bar snacks, the term now refers to small portions of food (at least in the United States).  Choose a few and you have a meal; choose a bunch and you have a meal for a group of friends.

In addition to tapas, the menu offers paella and a few other items, but tapas are the stars. There are more than 50 choices, plus another dozen desserts.  Cold tapas include serrano ham, olives and chicken salad; hot tapas include octopus, empanadas and roast dates with bacon.

The inside dining areas are dark: dark stained wood flooring, dark wood tables, moderate lighting.  Loud guitar music plays; a Flamenco version of ""California Dreamin'"" was one of the more unusual selections.  The outside area, facing the strip, seemed much more inviting, but it was too hot outside for me.  Service was prompt; I ordered tapas one at a time, and they arrived pretty quickly.

At Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, tapas have been supersized.  A typical dish could serve as a small appetizer for four people, or as an hors d'oeuvre for even more people.  I was hard pressed to finish just three plates.  Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego cheese also included triangles of toasted bread with chopped tomato on top.  Both the cheese and meats were thinly sliced, and very strongly flavored.  A winner.  It wasn't finger food, definitely requiring a knife and fork, but was big enough that it would best be split several ways.

Roast dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette was an interesting dish.  Small dates (or perhaps halves of large dates) were wrapped in bacon, then grilled until the bacon was crispy and the dates were very chewy.  A small amount of vinaigrette was poured on top.  It was an unusual combination of sweet, salty, sour and fatty tastes.

Grilled squid in olive oil and garlic consisted of large pieces of squid (both body and tentacles) sauted in olive oil.  Barely cooked through, the squid was still tender.  It was a little oily, but I liked it.



The food was OK, but as a solo diner I didn't really enjoy myself.  The supposedly tapa sized portions are actually quite large, and not conducive to ordering many dishes if one is dining alone.  I think it would be more fun with a group, at one of the outdoor tables."
3,"The food was ok, service decent, staff was friendly. However for a place that calls themselves ""waffle house"", the waffle was as thin as a pancake and very small. I was bummed out looking at the waffle.    

On the flipside, hashbrowns are good. They allow you to load it with different tons."
3,"Solid torta ahogada.  Showed up on a week day around noon, very few customers but they still took a very long time to get the food.  Might have made a 4 star....maybe."
3,"Another tapas experience in Las Vegas.  Located right on the strip, take a seat outside so you can enjoy the constant changing screens of the Wynn Hotel and, of course, people watch.

Late lunch and we order the Traditional Gazpacho Soup (gazpacho tradicional); the Beef Tenderloin Toro Brocheta (parsley garlic oil brocheta de solomillo); and the White Anchovies, Avocado & Peppers (boquerones con aguacate).  We attempted to order the Fried Green Peppers & Coarse Salt (pimientos fritos), but they were out already.  

The Gazpacho was light and cooling.  When brought to your table, you can choose if you want a few toppings added to it or not.  The anchovies were very tasty.  My only complaint was that there wasn't enough anchovies and too much of the avocado stuff instead.  The toro brocheta was especially enhanced by the tasty green sauce that accompanied it.  (My dining companion was surprised that they didn't ask us how we wanted our beef.)  Without the sauce, it would be a bit dry.  The sauce really gave it a punch.  (I requested more so I could dunk my bread in it.)
 
Dessert - we ordered the Banana (caramelized banana, vanilla ice cream aka platano al caramelo); the Strawberries (sour cream foam aka fresa con espuma de crema); and the Chocolate (white chocolate soup aka sopa de chocolate blanco).  With these desserts only be $1.99, you don't feel bad ordering a bunch of them.  Then again, they are super small.  Big enough to share with one other person only if you order more than one.  The Banana was nicely caramelized with caramel sauce and cooling ice cream.  The Strawberries were a bit too tart for me, and tasted much better when mixed with the Chocolate dish.  I think the idea of a white chocolate soup is divine.  With little rice crispies on the top and tiny pieces of pineapple on the bottom, it's a refreshing dessert.  (Was there a hint of coconut in it?)

Overall, with my limited dining experience at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, I would give it only three stars.  It was a decent place for tapas, but not extraordinary.  Portion sizes are on the smaller end and I would hate to think of trying to share my sardines or gazpacho dish with more than one dining companion.

I did particularly enjoy just sitting out front and enjoying my leisurely lunch on the strip.  Having such late lunches, there are no crowds to deal with and you can enjoy yourself so much more.  As always, having fabulous company always makes it that much better.

Update! 
They offer a weekday (M-F) happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm.  $3 tapas at the bar and half off sangria!"
3,"First time at the location and I went to the drive thru around 9:30 am today and upon greeting I asked her how she was and the lady at the drive thru said she was tired so I just ordered right away. It was pretty obvious she didn't want to make small talk so said I wanted a chicken snack wrap. She told me the tortillas were frozen so that was a no. I mean okay?So anyways I just ordered a doughnut instead. While the overall experience was great, their food is up to par and I am a fan of their coffee. Not only is it cheaper than Starbucks but they have a good variety of coffee flavors. I probably won't be back at this location though!"
3,I came here to try it out because I was craving tortas I was a little disappointed the meat had no flavor I felt like it was a little dry for almost $10 I expected more.
3,"So this is the original? I would've never guess as the location is tucked away in an underground mini mall across campus. I have always frequented the one on Sunset which is now no longer part of the chain/franchise.

I got the mix and match combo chicken and lamb (+3.00 extra) and a mini mast-akhir sauce. 
First off I was bummed that there was an upgrade charge for the lamb. It wasn't that way at the other location. There were a few other subtitle difference between this location and the breakaway fresh kabob.
1. The upgrade charge mentioned above for the lamb.
2. The combo comes with a bit of mast-akhir sauce on your plate (no need for separate orders)
3. The side mast-akhir sauce comes with bread. 
4. The mint chutney sauce is is Spicy! 

The kebabs were packed full of flavor as I have come to expect. Nice flame grilled texture while at the same time moist. I enjoyed the dish here. 
The only thing that was a bit of a miss was the bread, I was used to the lighter fluffy taftoon bread that's served at the other place, this one was a little more on the dense and firm side. 

All and all a decent meal in a sketchy location"
3,"Located on the 3rd floor of Epicenter, Howl at the Moon is a dueling piano bar. So if you've never been to this type of bar before, check it out before making assumptions. Basically, 2 pianos on stage provide the entertainment the whole night, playing popular songs & battling for tips. It's really tough to explain, other than you'll be amused by the ""skits"" & songs they know & come up with.

There are 2 bars & the bartenders are pretty quick, but don't catch them when they go into their song & dance routine. You'll be stranded at the bar with no bartender in sight. The beer is a bit pricey, along with a $7 membership fee, but that's what you're going to get in an Epicentre bar. 

You'll have a great time at you're 1st visit to Howl at the Moon, but just don't go there too often. To avoid seeing the same skits & banter again, I'd suggest making this a once a month trip."
3,"Hmmm...

My sister and I were in Medina visiting our cousins and we all had cravings for sushi and pad thai so they suggested House of Hunan.  I was surprised by how quaint yet modern with a more upscale feel the restaurant is.  The ambiance, however, doesn't really make up for the service.  Evidently you need to call way ahead of time to make a reservation otherwise they look at you like you are out of your mind that you might want to eat there.  After waiting over thirty minutes for a table, we were finally seated at one of the large booths near the water fountainy thing in the middle of the restaurant.  We ended up needing to bring one of my cousin's kiddos with us due to dad having a late running golf outing... I do not recommend this as House of Hunan is not kid friendly in the least.  The manager actually came over once to let us know that ""the water has an awful lot of chemicals in it"" when he noticed the kids sitting next to the fountain and one of them had stuck a finger in the stream of water (aka ""Tell your kid to get his fingers out of the stupid water fountain."").  There is no children's menu and they do not serve child size portions.  Service started out decent but after the food was served it was hard to find the waitress for refills and such.  As far as food, everything was pretty tasty.  We had a variety of plates overflowing the table.  Several different sushi rolls (everyone really liked the Key West), edamamme (can't really jack that up), salads, tofu pad thai, lo mein, some kind of green beans, and chicken and broccoli.  Beware that they charge you for rice with the entree meals.  She asked if we wanted fried or white with the chicken and broccoli so you would think it was included but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I guess that they have some kind of signature dessert that consists of a cheesecake layer with chocolate cake and chocolate mousse which sounded delicious.  However, they had already sold out of it.  Overall, a decent meal but make a reservation and leave the kids at home."
3,"My review is for the late evening . If you come in with an hour before closing, the donuts are old and stale. They must stop making fresh donuts early in the day and just sell what is left over. The donuts are heavier and denser that K Creme with less flavor."
3,"I enjoy this place for their food. The tortas, twin burritos, their homemade potato chips delicious! No comparison... but lately their service is atrocious. I come and dont even get attended to so I leave after 10 min standing their. While they see me there. That was yesterday. Today I called in my order and they didnt have it ready. I called in 20 min prior and still..."
3,"Have now been to Novanta twice. Like the menu, the pizza's are good but still not above Alino's . The appys are good and the pasta dishes are substantial except for the lasagna, which seemed to be more about presentation than anything. The main reason for the 3 star rating was the service. Both times we have been there i get the impression they are one server short. Having to wait 10-15 minutes for someone to approach us for drinks etc is to long, period!"
3,"I have been here three times in all- the first time was the massage -facial combo others have described and the other two were for massages. I had the same experience on the facial as Anonymous. There was about 15-20 minutes of actual work on my face and the other 25 minutes were drying time for the facepack when the lady left the room. I felt completely ripped off. I went back because the massage therapists are good. However 2 out of the three massages were barely 50-55 minutes. Next time, take note of the time when you undress and after. They seem to have a timer in the room that they do not use. 
Their specials are good."
3,"The customer service here was excellent. Our server was so friendly. 

We got our food/drinks in a timely manner. The food was good. I didn't have a waffle, but my husband did and said it was great tasting. 

We will be back. :)"
3,"I stopped in here before work to get a large iced caramel macchiato and it's usually very sweet but, this time it was not sweet AT ALL!! Lucky I had some stevia in my purse otherwise it would have been gross because I like really sweet coffee and was disappointed...I also ordered their egg and cheese tortilla (2) and the cheese was a bit burnt but for $2 what do you expect I guess?? Oh, and the workers there are pretty rude and act like they just don't want to be there...hopefully next time will be better"
3,"Love this place!  Pizza is awesome!    Wish they could provide the Ass Clown ""Orange Citrus"" beer on a regular basis that is on their menu.  Great local beer!   The last times we visited it was not available."
3,"Good food, it's a laid  back atmosphere and the wait staff was great. A little pricey. The menu was a little confusing on the sliders appetizer. We ordered them and the menu said $8 but we were charged $15. Menu should be more clear it states 4 meat sliders for $8 but supposedly that means 4 different types of meat?? So if you are going to offer 2 sliders for $8 or 4 sliders for $15...you need to have both prices on the menu based on how many sliders you get or have the waitress explain it. It wasn't explained before we ordered and no exception was made after the fact. A little misleading."
3,"This place is interesting.  From the outside it's very unassuming.  Run down isn't the right way to describe it, but it's close.  You could drive by every day for a year and never notice it.  when you step  inside, though, it is like stepping into a time machine.  The walls are wood paneled, everything looks like it might've been fancy twenty years ago,and the placemats are paper.  I think they forgot to give us our crayons.  I had a witty comment about the wall art, but I forgot what it looked like.  It's that kind of place.

Anyway, on to the positives.  Our waitress was really, really nice.  The prices are nice and low, too. The entrees are in the nine-twelve dollar range (don't quote me), and come with a salad and garlic bread.  I decided I couldn't go wrong with lasagna and was pleasantly surprised.  It was flavorful and did not have a cookie cutter taste.  the portion size was more than ample and there is a wide selection of cheap wine to choose from.  I guess it was kind of like eating at the genesis of Macaroni Grill.

When you take into account quality, price, atmosphere, and quantity The House of Pizza is a  solid value.  I'd go again.... if someone asked me to.  Maybe."
3,"I was slightly disappointed after going, the reviews hyped it up and are the reason i decided to try it. The place was clean and customer service was awesome but the food was just okay. Nothing special or even worth a second trip. My favorite part was the cold mussels with cocktail sauce. Second was the hibachi. Probably won't be back."
3,"Dunkin' Donuts coffee and beverages are the best.. compared to Starbucks and McDonalds.  

Donuts are still tasty but lighter and smaller.  They look like a meal when on the shelf, but after 2 bites, they're gone.  No substance whatsoever. Not worth $1.09.  But that's the fault of the corporation, not this store.

I had an issue once and they made up for it.  

After reading some of the reviews,  my comments are pretty accurate. Dunkin' Donuts needs to make their donuts bigger.. with more filling or frosting. No dozen donuts should cost over $5.99.  That's what they charged a few years ago, before corporate greed came into play.  

Also.. TIP CUPS!! Employees' jobs are to take your order and bring you the food.  It's NOT a tippable job.  Please, America, do NOT support tip cups anywhere, any time.  Stop the greed."
3,"My husband and I love tapas and since we were staying at the Trump and walked by Fashion Show Mall quite a few times, we decided to give Cafe Ba Ba Reeba a try for dinner on Saturday night. We ate outside on the patio to enjoy the fresh air and to do some people watching on the Strip. Our server was really friendly and attentive without being pushy or annoying. We tried:

White Sangria - it was so good! I really like white sangria and it was one of the best I have tried.

Crab and Shrimp Dip - by far our favorite dish of the evening. We should have ordered two because we fought over it! Definitely a must order!

Spicy potatoes - I must have missed the spicy part of this dish because all I did was taste potatoes. You have to eat this dish fast because our potatoes went cold pretty quickly.

Oven baked goat cheese - I don't think you can go wrong with goat cheese, tomato sauce, and bread with pesto. 

Seared sea scallops - a bit gritty and didn't have the melt in your mouth quality I look for in amazing scallops. However, they were still cooked pretty well even if they did have a bit of grit in them. Not the best I have ever had, but definitely not the worst.

Beef tenderloin - the blue cheese was way too overpowering

Our bill was $65 before tip and we left feeling full. If you like tapas and want a meal that won't break the bank on the Strip, this is not a bad place to give a shot."
3,"I have never been to a Waffle House so I wanted to give it a try... I enter the restaurant and took a seat at the counter it all booths were full... I was greeted by a friendly staff and I looked over the menu and saw the managers special posted on the wall and had to try it. Eric's Southwest Sausage burger with Hash browns (Contains ground beef, pork onions and jalapenos)... I rate the food as followed.

Eric's Southwest Sausage burger - C
Hash Browns - C

I could have made this meal myself at home... I was pretty disappointed but I did see other things I want to try so I may be back... Friendly staff keeps people coming back."
3,"Go figure.  The night my husband and I brought our 5 pound yorkie and 12 pound weenie dog to the Dog Bar...there's a GREAT DANE meetup group. 

Besides the fact our doggies were intimidated to death, and didn't move around too much (would YOU move around and wag your tail if you were 5 pounds and the place was taken over by 160 pound GREAT DANES??) we wanted to like the Dog Bar.  It just didn't gel for us. 

In the end, we found it a bit unclean and the service was kind of, uh, not there. None of the dogs were asked if they had their rabies vaccines like they should be. 

It's a great concept...simple b/c you can bring your own food, and it's a relaxed setting...but again, something about drinking around wet pee spots of gravel and poo didn't sit right with me."
3,"Good food. Filling. The owners/or ladies that run it can be a little rude and disrespectful at times. Otherwise, the pizza is good as are the subs."
3,"I think this is such a great idea. A place where you can go to drink and bring your dogs and they can play with other dogs and you do not have to worry about them. 
But this place could be a lot better executed! I feel
Like the owners don't really take care of the bar. It is pretty unsanitary rap with the dogs ON the bar! Also dogs pee in the water buckets and no one is paying attention to them to clean them out and other dogs are drinking from the water bucket that for peed in. 
The drinks are kind of expensive too and it's kind of gross that they give you cups on that bar with all the dogs on there.
I do like that my dog can play there and I just wish they would pay attention more and clean it up."
3,"Last night a group of about 12 of my friends and I hit up the Epicenter and spent most of our evening at Howl at the Moon.  If you come on a Friday night, be prepared for a 7 dollar cover - and pretty expensive drink prices overall.  The place was packed when we arrived around 10 but a few groups had left and we were able to grab a few tables in the middle of the room.  We tried to get a third table for our group, since there were 12 of us, but a worker came over and was actually really rude to several of us and said we didn't have enough people for 3 tables, that we needed four to a table...we had 12 people, 12 divided by 3 is 4 the last time I checked - it was honestly really silly, but if the guy was just friendly about it, it wouldn't have been an issue at all.  

The music was pretty great overall - playing songs from GaGa to Elton John.  They do take requests here, but only for money - and more than 5 or 10 bucks I'd guess.  The drinks were really great, for 20 or 25 bucks you can get their 'bucket', which comes in a variety of flavors and they won't let you order one unless you have 4 or more people going to drink it - it's just that strong!  I left the bar after two buckets and a few rum and cokes feeling really goooood!  I did have a lot of fun, but mostly because of the people that I was with, not because of the high prices and rude workers.  My only other comment is that the crowd on a Friday night was a bit older - I'd guess the average age to be 35-45, and most of my friends are 25-32, not that there is anything wrong with that :)  Just want people to be aware of the typical crowd to expect :)"
3,"This place is your typical asian buffet. I've passed by here many times but I've never been inside. It's sort of tucked away in the shopping center with Big Lots, I think it's in the same place where the old Party City use to be. This restaurant is pretty huge inside. 
They have everything on their buffet. From traditional chinese dishes like seasme chicken and general tso's chicken, dumplings, seafood to make your own hibachi to sushi. They have something for everyone. Their hibachi station was pretty good. A variety of meat and seafood options with rice and noodles and as assortment of veggies. If I come back, my first stop will definitely be the hibachi station."
3,My friend and I met for lunch a few weeks ago. I was not sure what to get but I ended up ordering a burrito combo. It was good and I also liked how they gave samples of their soup out. Tortas Paquime seemed to have a little bit of everything in their shop and it was very clean as well.
3,"This place isnt that sanitary. There are only two dog bars i can find in charlotte, this one and the lucky dog bark bar and brewery. I think there used to be others but they closed down. Charlotte is a cool city to have dog bars, for that I definitely give it props. 

While this place has two bone shaped swimming pools, dog beds and games for adults to play, it isn't that clean. Dogs would pee on dog beds, pee anywhere on the floor mixed in with already wet grounds, then poop right at the entrance. The humans also are not that fast at cleaning up after their dogs. They have buckets of water for the dogs, for those are clean, but they aren't dog bowls, and a chihuahua knocked a bucket down just like that. They have one play structure here, and throughout the bar except for one section is green carpet. The bar inside is also very dark and not airy. There is only one bathroom stall, very small and unisex. 

I'd recommend lucky dog over this place, parking can also be complicated here as well, though they have their own lot, there aren't that many spots."
3,"The interior was nice.  Lots of people but no wait. Plenty of sitting.  I felt the buffet was average. I was disappointed with the steam fish with soy sauce it was dry and rubbery.  But the person who prepared my vegetables did a good job.  

The server and price was good.  ."
3,"This is a pretty decent buffet, as far as buffets go. They just opened, so the place is new and sparkling clean. It gets busy FAST, so make sure you come just before lunch/dinner, or be prepared to wait a few, even with as many tables as they have.

The staff is pretty nice, and service is really good. They whisk away your old plates very quickly and courteously check in on you a lot.

There seem to be a lot of food options, but really only a few items for vegetarians. What they do have is pretty good. The food that I tried was decent and didn't seem to be overly laden with sugar, salt, or MSG. The corn on the cob, however, seemed like it'd either been steamed for about 5 days, or it was really old corn. Ick.

People seemed to go nuts over the frog legs and the sushi. I recommend the broccoli dishes and the hot and sour soup. I'm so picky about my soup. This soup, with a ton of pepper added, probably is a 3/5 in terms of restaurant soup. That's more than 2 points over what I give the usual suspects. The egg rolls were pretty good. My companions said the crab was hit or miss.

I'm not big on buffets, but I hang out with people who are. I would definitely come here again."
3,"This is a really cool idea..  a dueling piano bar..  basically, they have live and very talented musicians, who can play pretty much anything..  people write down requests and toss them in with tips..  some tips are small but one time I was there and some guy tipped 100.00 to hear Sweet Home Alabama...dude must have been LIT!

Anyway, it is small and nothing fancy, but it is high energy fun..The musicians are awesome and the drinks are good.. the big buckets are not tasty but they will do the trick.. i never drink them, but i do buy them for college kids who work in my office for fun.. LOL

Usually less of a line than Whiskey River, The Forum or Cans.. and a sometimes a less ""trendy"" crowd.. The good thing about the epicenter in general is that you can go check out a different night spot in the same location without driving if you get bored one place.. you just go to the next...

Every now and then the whole staff gets up on the bars and does a dance.. that can be entertaining.. 

Some things to note: 
The parking is in the garage of The Epicenter and there are a bazillion steps to climb up to the third floor, there IS an elevator, but i don't know if there is one that goes up to this level.. so don't get hammered and then try to walk down.. i have seen some nasty spills...

 ALSO beware if they tell you you won a VIP party for you and your friends.. basically it is a ""your list gets in without cover"" offer... there is nothing VIP about it.. so don't fall for that..  It is still cool, but don't tell people you are going to be VIP becz you will just be embarrassed when basically all they get is free cover..."
3,"I can't remember the last time I was served food so hot I had to wait for it to cool. That's not the worst way to start.  I dropped by one Sunday for an early dinner.  Decor: dated and unimpressive.  Service marginally friendly but effiecient.  I don't need to bond, just eat.  Had the canelloni, was piping hot and saucy.  Thank goodness for the generous portion of garlic bread.  Is it freshly made pasta in an heirloom recipe sauce? No.  But it is hot and tasty and fairly priced. I will certainly be going back, at least for take out."
3,"I have been here several times and have come to the conclusion that the sushi is wonderful and the cooked food is ok. 
My friend and I visit at least 1/month, so you would think I would have better things to say, but alas, I think we do this more out of habit than love.
This time I ordered sushi (Key West Maki and JJ Maki) and a salad with ginger dressing. The sushi was WONDERFUL!! the ginger dressing was like chewing on raw ginger root. If you like sweet/citrus ginger dressing, DO NOT order this. You will be disappointed. 
We were there no longer than usual, but our waiter was a little too helpful. He began by trying to talk my friend out of her meal choice, which we both thought was 
incredibly odd. He then went on the critic other items on the menu and inform us of items food critics did not enjoy. Once again, we thought this whole conversation was odd; not helpful. BTW, she loved her meal (something with shrimp and pineapple)!
We really love the decore and the items we always order (I, sushi; she, General Tso). Those items are definately what keep us coming back.
Side note- If you have small children, make sure you are not seated by the waterfall and they do NOT have a children's menu."
3,"We ended up here by accident after another restaurant we had planned to eat at  had a wait estimated at over an hour.  The food was not bad, but there were so many people in the place, with a dj pumping somewhat obnoxious pop songs, that the ambiance became more of a factor than one would have hoped.  We had a party of 8 and ordered 2 tapas apiece.  The waitress was really pushy when we ordered the 2 person paella, saying that we'd only each get a biteful.  That was our intention, and frankly I can't imagine why anyone would want more than a spoonful of it.  To put it kindly it was underwhelming.  She was pushing the bigger sized paella that was $40.  I'm sorry but you ought to be ashamed of yourself charging that much for RICE.  Try the dates wrapped in bacon, as another reviewer suggested.  Better than other tapas places I've been to, but I'm not sure that we'll be back any time soon."
3,"I received the ""Glow package"" (massage, facial, mani/pedi) as a gift. Helen did an outstanding job with my massage and I purchased another massage session with her before I left. This was the first facial I've ever had. Still not sure if I enjoyed it... The woman who did mine seemed distracted and at one point was on her phone for a couple minutes during the middle of my facial. Also, I usually get a gel manicure and they do not provide this service, so I will most likely go get a manicure elsewhere next time. Pedicure was just okay. I agree with the other reviews that it is not relaxing with the nail area in the front of the waiting area of the spa. Overall, I look forward to my next massage with Helen but will not go for the other services again."
3,"I'm updating my review because I have been here once, for carryout, since my last review. Same thing stands with the service, it's good.  Nothing to complain about there.  The people are friendly.  No wait on my food for pick up.

The red sauce is awful. It's orange-y in color and really just not tasty at all.  I'm warning you now, don't get it...& if you do, don't say I didn't tell you.

Fettuccine Alfredo! Good! I got this the last time and was pleased.  Delicious, creamy sauce & a yummy garlic bread to accompany it."
3,"Hmmm not sure what is 4-5 star worthy but not the meal I ordered. I got the prosciutto, arugula flatbread sandwich thing. It's a cold sandwich. There's no dressing or anything to bring it together and one cherry tomato cut in half stuck randomly in the sandwich is a no go...especially due to it not being fresh. I recommend a vinaigrette and turn it into a panini. The side salad literally had pieces of lettuce with brown edges. Cmon where's the quality and return on investment for the sandwiches. It was $12?!

Maybe the pizza is better???"
3,My frozen hot chocolate was delicious but they only cream cheesed one half of my bagel. I guess it's my fault for coming to a donut place and ordering a bagel lol
3,Was nice and clean but the food was average and not memorable. A bit overpriced but the restaurant was comfortable.
3,Pretty much exactly what you would eggspect from a chain breakfast restaurant.
3,"2.5 hours.  Thats how we were there from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out.  The upside is that the sushi was super and we didn't have anywhere to be, the downside...we were there for 2.5 hours for lunch, seriously?!  

I think it was the manager who was at the front when we walked in and we were frankly not paid attention to for about 5 minutes, I was stunned, but my in-laws have the patience of a saint, so I kept my mouth shut and waited.  In case you're wondering, they weren't slammed busy.

Once we sat down, our server was very friendly but almost never came around to check on us, we had to get up and find him to get the check.  

3 stars because the food was yum.  But service is key and it was lacking."
3,"It was ok. Service was nice. Some food was phenomenal, some was less than stellar (enter sushi.) Sushi guy was mean. Best hot and sour soup I've ever had. I'd pay just to sit there and eat nothing but that all day. Coconut shrimp was awesome. Octopus was overcooked and tough. Mac and cheese tasted sweet... couldn't eat it. Overall, was average. I'd go back."
3,"I was given a gift certificate to this spa, and I went online to look at the services offered. I scheduled a one hour relaxation massage and an organic refresh facial. All the services were great, and performed extremely professionally, but at the end when I went to pay I was charged more than I had anticipated. 

When I booked, I asked for an Organic Refresh Facial, which looked like it was the only one of it's kind offered on their website. When I left I was so relaxed and thought maybe I read the prices wrong on the website, so I went home to check online. I called the next day to see what my exact charges were, and the receptionist explained that There is a 50 minute organic refresh facial (known as a Custom facial on their website) and a 25 minute organic refresh facial (known as an Organic Refresh Express facial on their website). When I booked, I asked for an organic refresh facial and left out the express since no other facial was listed as ""organic refresh"". However, they put it as a custom facial since I did not specify.

I feel very misled and upset because my experience was so positive there, except for this event. If they have two facials with the same name, but different prices, they either need to specify this on their website, or clarify with the person who is booking the service - especially if the person have never been to the spa before. I wish that this hadn't happened because I did enjoy my services, but I don't feel comfortable returning."
3,I mean.. It's a Waffle House but it used to be a Waffle House that was cleaned once a day. Now it's a little closer to every other day which is a bummer for those of us who remember it being built.
3,"Everything I tried here was pretty good.  But, considering that I love the whole idea of tapas and we probably sampled 9-10 items, pretty good isn't enough to make me go back. 
None of the dishes were bad, but only one of them (serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego cheese) was good enough for me to want again.  
Service was pleasant and the patio location was very nice for people-watching on the strip, but there is so much competition in this town for my food dollar, that I will keep looking."
3,"This place was okay.  First of all, we had a reservation for 12 at 8:30pm.  Okay, we were there at 8:25pm and we waited an additional 20 minutes for them to put our table together.  The hostess kept saying 5 minutes, 5 minutes....and we sat down 20 minutes later.  

The food was okay.  I did only have their mushroom soup, which I enjoyed but it was quite salty.  We specifically told our server that we needed to be out of there by 10pm, and I felt like she didn't really care whether or not we were out by 10pm.  

Not so sure if I'd come back here again.  Maybe for a snack before/after shopping, but never again for dinner - especially when I plan on going someplace else after."
3,The food was decent. Prices are about average. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place agin. The only upside was the waiter spent about 5 minutes giving us some tips on things to see and do in the area which was fantastic!
3,"Great place , great atmosphere and great food! You can call ahead of time and place your order. Lunch time is very busy! But they cook everything fresh and you can see them preparing your meal."
3,"I wasn't very impressed with the pianist and their lyrical abilities. The bar on the right was way crowded and not staffed accordingly. The bar up top on the left wasn't even staffed. I heard they don't like to staff the bar on the top left due to Customers using the stage as a site seeing balcony and preventing Customers from accessing bar.

You need to definitely keep both bars open and well staffed. Keep bouncers available to coordinate the crowd listening and hanging out."
3,"If you're looking for a solid choice that will have something on the menu for everywhere then this is your stop. Food wasn't mind blowing or even anything spectacular but it hit the spot.

I ordered the eggspectation omelette which was your standard skillet style omelette with hashbrowns.

My server was great, I asked questions about old Montreal and he happily obliged. 

The restaurant and location itself is very nice, exposed brick, nice art, and decoration. 

I give it a 3 but that, to me, isn't a 'bad' 3, while it was good, it wasn't anything eggceptionally out of the ordinary (see what I did there!?)"
3,"Food was really great!   General Tso chicken had just the right amount of spice. 

Service was abysmal. Sitting for 20 min and still had not placed an order.  Had to flag down hostess to get a food order placed."
3,"My wife and I came here for her birthday. The entertainment was OK and everybody was participating. I spent about 100 on drinks for the two of us but we never really caught a buzz. To investigate this anomaly I order two shots of Patron. They were so watered down we just sipped on them until the place closed. Oh, and the 12 dollar long Island was the most expensive lemonade I'd ever purchased.  All in all, this is a fun place with lots of craziness, just stick to beer and you'll be alright."
3,I was pleasantly surprised to have good sushi and Asian food in this part of the country. My favorite was one of the sea bass dishes I had. Sushi selections are limited; however they were very fresh. Looking forward to going back when I make it back to Seville.
3,Very surprising. Staff was very Pleasant they even knew the names of their own local patrons The cook willing and outgoing fun to deal with. The food was nice and for you liking as to order.  Clean place spacious and plenty of Windows space. A little surprising since the last time I have been to one. That was early 90's and in the Midwest. So check it out yourself. Let us know. At least The food was editable compare to the competitors on the far side. Trust me it was descent and nice and family kind of staff. Good food good people.
3,"I like the donuts, the place is clean, but...... I can't go more than three. 
Presentation sucks, and each time we have had to go back for forgotten items. Luckily we dine in.
 The coffee is good, everything is fresh, my croissant was burnt on the edges once.
 I am hoping it's New Business Pains, and they'll settle in. Otherwise we will keep coming here, cause duh, donuts. Also, I LOVE Chicken Salad as a breakfast option. :)"
3,CLOSED Las Vegas location only open in Chicago.
3,"Last time I went to House of Pizza was 10+ years ago, but my wife wanted to give it another try.  

Very popular place with people waiting at the door and the wait staff was fast & courteous.  My wife got pizza and I got chicken fettuccine alfredo where neither of us were impressed.  It was OK, but nothing exceptional.  You can get way better pizza & pasta going to Portofino's in the shopping center right behind House of Pizza in the same price range, but you always have to keep personal taste in mind.

A friend's wife only like Portofino's and loves House of Pizza going there regularly since she was a teen where House of Pizza has a huge  nostalgia factor for many patrons."
3,"Came here for breakfast on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. Despite the fact that it was empty, our service was a bit slow. (However, our server was very nice) The menu is huge! We both got big egg platters, which were pretty good as far as breakfast food goes. The prices were also very reasonable. We mostly chose this place because we wanted a breakfast close to our hotel in the late morning, which is what we found."
3,Just ok. Maybe I wasn't drunk enough. But hanging with work friends and mumbeling song I had no idea about was fun.
3,Great place and really nice staff! The only problem is that the place is more for big dogs. Small breeds beware you will have to constantly watch your dog not to get stepped on by the bigger dogs. Maybe one day they will have an area for small dogs and I can relax and not worry about my dog .
3,"I'm not a big fan of buffets, however, if you are with a  family or group and on a budget, this is great value for your money! 
There was a short wait to be seated, but once taken to your seat, let the games begin!!!! 
There is something for everyone, starting with the hibachi grill, fixed your way! They also have a nice sushi selection if you're into that. Chicken prepared in a variety of ways, steak, ham fish and even octopus... Options are endless and the food stayed fresh as they were constantly switching it out, it was a busy Sunday. Plus the staff was friendly..."
3,"The food is cheap for a buffet. My kids like this place. I'm not a fan! Walking in is nice and gave you that Asian feel and look. Decor is nice and they have a fountain with water and fish. To me the place could be a little more cleaner

The food: 
The have a wide selection of from seafood to meat to Sushi and more. Here one reason why I'm not a fan.... some of the food is old (for the food items that a lot of people don't get) and cold. Instead of them throwing the food away when it's old they just add the fresh and hot food and Mixed it with the old food."
3,"3 stars at best. Average chinese + honky food with some sushi thrown in. The food is your very typical buffet fare. Unfortunately to get my moneys worth i tried eating a bunch of their sashimi (tuna and salmon) and cherries to get my moneys worth. No oysters or crab legs. The cold shrimp looked pale and dead. The mussels were disgusting- dethawed watery mess. This place doesnt pop. I do admire the workers- at closing time they go full blown worker bee mode cleaning the restaurant- floors, windows, etc then they all (literally every single worker 15 or so) cram into this van that comes by to take em to a group home im guessing. Im assuming its some work for your visa deal. They work hard for the money so tip em well. This place is in the ghetttooo and food is not memorable in the least so i dont think im coming back."
3,"Fun spot. I'm glad I got to come check out this place in Langtree. I wasn't overly impressed with the food, but it is good. I've just been to many brick oven pizza places to compare it too. It's nice that Mooresville has one up in this area. The pizzas are more personal size, so I feel they are a bit pricey for the size (in comparison to Alino's, where you pay $22 for a pizza that is 2-3x the size). The indoor space is very cute and open - love the wooden interior decorations. We also had a calzone, which at the price of $16 is a bit steep (It said $12.00 on the menu, but apparently, they just ""updated prices that day)."" Overall, I think it may be a little overpriced for the quality of the food. I would come back and try some of the pasta dishes, but wouldn't make this my go to spot."
3,"My first visit to the remodeled House of Pizza that was known to us when we were in high school as ""The House"".
Now 41 years later, I am back home in Charlotte at this iconic landmark. First I will say that the facility is definitely improved. More tables and much cleaner! But I guess I am nostalgic for the old place.
Ordered Pizza-Pepperoni and half Sausage- tasted very similar as I remember but seemed much greasier than I remember. I thought it was decent but my wife was not a fan at all.
Regardless, I have such wonderful memories of the House, that I will always be a fan. Maybe I'll get a Meatball Parm on my next visit."
3,"This place has some of what it needs to be successful,  and falls short in other places. 

They have a bar and a decent bottled beer lineup, but no beer on tap... At all... Ever.

They have bands come in and play, but they aren't the most personable ever. I went there with a few friends who are very musically inclined (which is a fancy way of saying they're amazing at making sounds) and one of them asked if he could play bass for a song with them. The guy playing said that he could play... If he tipped them $100.

Overall it's alright, but nothing special."
3,Still the best late night eatery. Close to home and easy to pick up on the way. This still have the best hash browns no matter the time of day.
3,"I'm not sure what it was but the morning I stopped in here I wasn't too hungry, I was just craving a crepe with Nutella.  This place is a little bit on the outskirts of Old Montreal which was nice because it wasn't crowded like all of the other places were on a nice weekend morning.  The wait staff was attentive and friendly and had no problem dealing with my obnoxious group of half English speaking, half French speaking friends.

I ordered my banana, Nutella crepe while most of the rest of the group got breakfast.  Everyone seemed happy with their meals.  One of my friends ordered Mac n Cheese which I tried and it was absolutely amazing.  I would definitely get that again if I went back.  Overall I would say my crepe was average.

I like the fact that it's walking distance from the hotel I normally stay at, it's not too crowded, and it has a very diverse menu, so I would probably return here again."
3,so so food is ok . This is my second time to feel the first time is better than this. The inside of the health environment so-so.
3,"The services is great! Warning: stick to breakfast food. I've been before for their breakfast or crepes it was good, but steak and fries was mediocre at best. They overcooked the steaks significantly. The fries seem frozen."
3,"The food was fine, but not worth the 40 minutes it took to come out once we placed our order. They're eggs, FFS. Overall it was pretty meh, but the price was fine and the food was fine, so.. three stars."
3,"Typical Chinese buffet, although this is currently my parent's favorite place to go. They do have a lot of selections, but I feel its just mediocre. The place is huge and the parking lot is always pack. I feel this place is a little dirty and the sushi is just okay. The only thing I like from here is the fried crab and coconut shrimp."
3,"So I figured Vegas would be a good place to watch the fireworks on Independence Day.... in 104 heat...

The misters outside suckered me into this place.... however, where ever I sat...they stopped working...

So I moved inside. The waitress was great, the sangria was one of the best I ever had, but other than that...the food was so-so and as for the dessert....you could easiliy confuse it with a candybar that melted on a small plate. Um, no thanks. 

I'm starting to wonder if the whole point of tapas is that everything is so average that nothing is outstanding?"
3,"This place is basically a bar that allows your dog to come in. 

Bartenders are attentive. People are friendly
Outside the bar there is astroterf to walk on.
This is a very casual place."
3,"I usually don't waste my time with chain restaurants, but I've heard a lot of raves about Dunkin' Donuts coffee- when this location sprung up near me, I hurried over to try it. And was distinctly underwhelmed. 

I was surprised by the variety of the menu, though- in addition to iced and hot coffee drinks, the menu includes the namesake donuts, and various breakfast sandwiches. They have an order of oatmeal available as their lone healthy option.

This location does have a drive-thru, which is convenient. Service was a bit spotty, which is to be expected as they are new. Prices are on par with other coffee chains. Avoid the latte lites, which are straight-up aspartame."

3,"Better then you might think.

Tortas Paquime is clean, busy and has great food. The entrée's at Torta Paquime are reasonably priced, made fresh to order, and absolutely delicious. 

The carnitas  and ribeye tacos are tasty  and the tortas are not only good but are enormous as well. So be prepared to go hungry and have leftovers. Make sure you ask for a side of the pickled onions, jalapenos and carrots (they're free).  

You never walk away from Tortas Paquime hungry but leave some room for a dessert because the ice cream and pastries will satisfy your sweet tooth.

Great service and excellent food, it doesn't get any better."
3,"You might be surprised...no not really...I hate piano bars. They are right up there with nails on a chalkboard and...oh, yeah...karaoke nights or the ultimate...karaoke only bars. There is nothing worse than forced fun. If you are in a bar and spontaneously sing a song that is playing...great. If it is staged to embarrass people...not so great. So needles to say I arrived with a one star in mind. 

Atmosphere - crowded yet spacious, slightly older crowd, mostly high tables and chairs, two bar locations, center stage w/ large mirror used for writing silly messages. 

Service - prompt and friendly. Never really had to wait for a drink. Went to the bar on the first round and used a server after both w/ equal success. 

Pricing - Similar to other Epicentre establishments ($7 mixed drinks) 

Piano Playing/ Songs - Songs played consisted of your standard sing-alongs of ""Piano Man"", ""American Pie"", ""Tiny Dancer"", and ""Sweet Caroline"". These songs were played with the dueling pianos but as others have mentioned there is support from a drummer and a keyboard player, which is unique to this setting. The musicians will also play requests. Since a majority in attendance w/ me were Steelers fans we got the musicians to play an excellent version of ""Renegade"" by Styx (a Heinz Field staple).  They also played a surprisingly interesting take on Wiz khalifa Steelers theme song ""Black and Yellow"". 

Overall - Despite the fact that I dislike piano bars and the place did not have the same cozy feel that I prefer of say a Mr Smith's in DC, I had a good time. This was mostly due to the company and the musicians willingness to play anything requested...and play it well."
3,"Would love to love this place...great location (sushi in the burbs?) and atmosphere but overall its meh.  The disappointment starts at the front door when the overweight, grumpy, disinterested manager greets you with a less than enthusiastic hello.    You MAY get a great waiter...or NOT.  I've had both here.  Generally, the sushi is good, if overpriced. The cooked food, not so good,  and still overpriced.  Too bad they no longer have half price sushi Tuesdays OR a Happy Hour - a 50/50 shot at good food and service was worth the gamble then, but we no longer patronize this place. If we are hoping for good sushi we hit up Sushi on the Roll just down the street."
3,"I went here with a group of friends, and found the place to be a good choice for a small group dinner.  It was at night, and the the atmosphere and view was nice.

My boyfriend and I have never been to this type of restuarant before, so we weren't sure what to order.  Our friend suggested the paella and some meat dish.  We loved loved loved the paella.  I've never had it before so I don't have much comparison but it was very good.  My only wish was that the lobster in it could've been bigger and they charge more for the dish.  As for the meat dish, it wasn't very good....that's why I don't remember what it was called.  My boyfriend said it was something his mom can make (hehe...apparently his mom can't cook).

Overall it's a nice place and the food is decent."
3,"The Waffle House is kind of like an old friend.  You may not visit them very often, but you're always glad to know that they're there.  And dagnabbit, sometimes you just NEED to have a triple order of fresh hash browns in the middle of the night

May be a little bit too brightly lit for my tastes, especially in the wee smalls, but the food is consistent and the service alway polite and attentive without being pushy

Oh btw, always make sure you tip a little extra to the good peeps working the overnight shift   ; )"
3,"The tortas taste good, but they are overpriced for what they are. Their size is not on the big side. They serve the torta with 5-10 pieces of chips, which hardly counts as a side. 

The bathrooms did not have paper towels."
3,"Now I'm not too keen on Chinese buffets, but when you're a broke college student this will suffice. Great lunch deal with student discount (I think it's $8?) and dinner's deal isn't bad either ($11 if I'm not mistaken). they have a full range of foods from sushi to hibachi and all the other Chinese goodness in between. Fast service, cleanliness and a full belly is what you'll find at this establishment."
3,"I've been a few times this year. Nice staff, I love the pasta and wings mostly. Haven't tried the sandwiches but they are on my list."
3,"It's hot inside. Slightly cooler than the 105 outside, but hot enough to make me miss my car.

They haven't bothered to update their signs, so my soup and salad ended up costing me an unexpected $20. Yikes! 

Being across from the college, you'd think this place would be packed. The food is actually quite good, just very expensive."
3,"Came here during happy hour (4-7 PM).  I dont quite remember everything we had as it wasnt that memorable.  What I do remember is their yummy meat lover's paella.  It was delicious.  We also tried their black raspberry, peach, and passionfruit sangrias.  The black raspberry was the best.  Wait service was ok.  The waitress left out one of the items we ordered so we never got it but we didnt get charged for it.  
Note: Happy hour is only served in the bar area so you should let the hostess know upon arrival so you can be pointed in the right direction."
3,"Normally, exciting, crowded, lively, club-like bars are not for me.  I prefer the calmer, slower environment, preferably one where you can actually hear well enough to carry on a conversation.

I make an exception for piano bars, but only occasionally.

I have been to Howl at the Moon once.  I went with several friends and we all had a good time.  The music was fun, the drinks were good and it was actually not too crowded.  One of their signature drinks was a ""bucket of liquor"" which is basically a Long Island Iced Tea that we all shared.

We had a good time, but I have definitely been to better piano bars.  Also, the drinks seemed rather expensive and the cover seemed high ($10) based on the number of patrons there."
3,"not as good as expected..... I guess I like Cora more.....
The Montreal putine was too salty to have a bite. :("
3,"I'm usually not a big fan of buffets, but this is by far the best buffet I've been too. Still not my to go restaurant but my family loves this place! It's pretty clean for a buffet & cheap too! But the quality is the food is good, just needs to be heated more and it's not that greasy either. But the options are big!"
3,"The white peach sangria was good, the goat cheese appetizer was tasty, and service was good, but stay away from their ""paellas"".  I actually could not eat the combination one I got, it was too nasty.  Paellas don't have sauce and they should also have a crust from searing in the pan.  What we got was a gloppy mess.  Inedible.
Definitely okay for drinks and tapas though!"
3,Decor was nice and updated. Sales people seemed normal. Didn't see anything wrong with them or giving any attitude or poor service. What did perplex me was the difference between a normal iced coffee. Why would a medium size be cheaper than a small?
3,"Three stars for the cheap happy hour menu... $3 tapas and half on sangrias! Other than the fact that the restaurant has awesome, affordable specials, there's nothing spectacular about this place. This food was alright and the atmosphere was a little stuffy for a tapas place. The lighting in the restaurant was ridiculously dark. I could barely read the menu without selectively moving the menu in the right angle to catch a hint of light. The service was ""eh."" Our waiter was impatient and not friendly. The restaurant was only a quarter full, so I'm not sure why he was so rushed. 

Peach sangria...light alcohol content and fruity. Good for a hot Vegas afternoon.

Tomato and cheese flatbread...pretty good. I liked hot the tomatoes were halved cherry tomatoes, rather than diced. 
Calamari...okay. I've had better. Not as crispy as I'd like it to be. The tangy, spicy dipping sauce made up for it though. 
Skewered chicken...
Dessert: coconut cake. If I had to choose a favorite, this would be it. It was coconut cake soaked in a rum and topped off with ice cream. 

Will I come back? Sure. It's a good deal for happy hour, and a nice place to relax after shopping in the Fashion Show Mall."
3,Tasty. Granted we went there mid day but I'm still waiting on the waitress as I have been the entire time here. And we are the only table here currently. Slow AF
3,"I went on a Tuesday which is clearly the ""off night.""  I was in town for an interview and I arrived a day early.  I LOVE the Howl in Houston, so I decided to check it out.  I was there with the AARP set, and a few middle aged couples.  There were probably about 15 people in the whole bar.  The musicians were awesome (as are all Howl at the Moon musicians)  I would love to come here on the weekend.  I hope I get the job!"
3,"Well first off, it was hard to find the restaurant because you have take downward steps to get to it. It is completely Persian themed and so I had big expectations. The place was clean and big. It has Arabian music playing in the background and a Persian underground theme. The staff were very friendly and informative. The wait time was alright. Not to late. The food was not warm though. Some plates were really hot, some were really cold. It lacked consistency. Some plates were filled with rice, but some had very little in them. Do not drink the glass soda, it tastes off and they will not exchange it. The meat is very flavorful while the rice lacked flavor. Three stars in total. 

PROS: -good meat -good service -wait time was reasonable. 

CONS- -Weird soda -inconsistency -lack of flavor in certain areas."
3,Great place to eat for dinner. Only 3 stars because I ordered sushi pick up twice and the order was wrong both times. So stick with dine in and skip the pick up.
3,"I had gone in with a friend of mine for lunch a few days ago. The food was okay like any other reviewer would inform you of, but I felt very very uncomfortable as we were the only two in there and they would stare at us relentlessly, it was at a point in which we decided to eat in the tables outside of the building rather than inside."
3,"The HoP is one of those places that should be great - it's been there forever (and when I say forever, I mean as long as I've been in Charlotte, which means quite a long time), and it looks it. Anything that manages to last that long in this town has some serious staying power. On the downside, they have done absolutely zero to update the place - that can either add some major props or knock you a few points, Here, we'll call it a push, because in Charlotte, having at least a couple of things that haven't yet been torn down is nice.

When it comes to the staff, they are typically friendly, but not in on overly creepy way, so they make you feel comfortable and welcome, which is all you can ask. The menu pretty well matches up with the decor, in that it doesn't look like it has been updated in years, and if it's good, there is no reason that it should be.

Food comes out quickly, which is a big reason to visit, and though they are called house of pizza in the big glowing neon, they offer far more than just pizza - plenty of pasta can be found on the menu, and sandwiches as well. Just be careful if you order the pasta, because it comes out hot. So hot, in fact, that you will burn the roof off your mouth and the cheese will sear your brain so that you can't taste anything for a week.

So step into Charlotte's past (there aren't many places that you can do so), give the plate a moment to cool off and relax while you enjoy your dinner. Or suck it down as soon as it's delivered. Either way, there aren't many like this around any longer."
3,"Drove by at 8 PM and was going to go in but saw that they already cleaned up the entire front of the store and took out all the donuts so I just did drive through. Drive through was super fast and the guy helping was very nice. They close at 9 PM so there weren't many options left which was understandable. I'm not sure if the store front closes early (like some McD or Starbucks). 

I was debating between a macchiato or a latte and decided to go with the latte. I ordered a large iced vanilla latte ($4) and it was very disappointing! Seems like I'm drinking all milk with a hint of vanilla. I guess next time I'll go with the macchiato or cappuccino. I also ordered half a dozen donuts (about $6)

Everything came out super quickly... probably because no one else was in line and the old fashioned glazed donuts were tasty even though they weren't fresh."
3,"I love this place. I love the concept, the bartenders, the beer list, the way they pour their drinks. That said, I have two boxer mixes, who, while not at all aggressive, play rough. They sometimes knock your little dog over. And the clientele kill this place. Most weeknights are fine, but Sundays are awful. The second your pit-looking dog is within 10 feet of a scuffle, the people their label it the instigator. I wish I could go here all the time, but most days it's just not worth the drama with a rambunctious dog."
3,The sanitation rating has been creeping closer and closer to the 90 mark and it's pretty easy to see why.  The food has gone from consistently good to very much hit or miss. It is a buffet and I understand the struggles but I always looked forward to trips here and that just isn't the case anymore.
3,"So any place that allows my awesome, amazing, handsome dog gets 5 stars. However, my dog got very sick after going here so I have to subtract 2 stars. I do not fault the Dog Bar owners for the sickness, but if your dog is susceptible to getting sick easily I don't think it's a great place to take your dog. My vet yelled at me because you just can't predict how other people take care of their pets, so just be aware if your dog doesn't have a strong immune system. 

However, this place overall is just awesome. I love that you can take your pets and all the dogs seem to be super friendly. The beer is in plastic cups, but not too pricey. And they allow you to bring in pizza or any other food into the place since they don't serve any. 

If you are a dog lover, you can go here and see lots of cute pups!"
3,"The first time I tried tapas was at Chicago's Cafe Baba Reeba and I was too nauseas (pregnancy related) to enjoy the food. It was very bustling with family and kids at that chain.  I tried to redeem the experience at the Las Vegas chain and this was not what i expected. 

Perhaps I went after 9 pm and the place turned into what seemed like an adults night out only atmosphere. No kids, just couples in the dark and it felt more romantic and sexy. Decor is dark red and black with quiet groovy like music in background.  If you are looking for a place to take a date this would be the place--after 9 pm is best, I think, if you want to just sit and learn more about each other over cocktails.  I certainly don't recommend this place if you are starving!! The prices are ok but I find expensive if you are looking for a place to get a great value for food. You are basically paying for ambience, presentation, and the unique experience of tapas food.  Ladies you will like this place for ""girlfriend catch up time"", or just dress up and enjoy each others company...and maybe get chummy with some local guys. I believe there is a lounge area too.  We sat in the booths cuz we were there to eat!

The food is different, smaller portions. I like the tomato bread with cheese ($8.95), beef skewers ($8.95), and the baked crab & shrimp dip with piquillo peppers - $10.95. Calamari ($9.95) was blah...have had the same thing elsewhere and not that expensive.  The roasted padron peppers a big mistake.  Overpriced chilies! It is not that spicy (to me it is like eating bell peppers but then I love spicy food so I am not the best judge) , but it is still pointless for me to eat chilies and pay $6.95 for that plate. The meatballs ($7.95) was ok but too wet for me. I prefer more crispy meatballs.  Pictures posted.

The bread and dip was really good though. We filled up on that an a pitcher of sangria between both of us and we were full....not on the food but on fluids and bread.

Pros: Service is good, friendly staff, easy seating, & private. 
Cons: Overpriced, not all food that spectacular

Bottom line: 
Great for after dinner-dates, cocktail only night, girls night to catch up. Ok to dress casual or dressy.  Even with available kids menu, I don't think this place will quench their appetities. The Chicago one is much better for family."
3,"A friend of mine gave me the tip of Cafe Ba Ba Reeba's Happy Hour so my husband and I looking for a place to grab some dinner on Friday night went with my friends suggestion. Half Price Tapas and Pitchers of Sangria in the bar area. 

We ordered a butt load of apps and I had two Sangria's for less than 25 bucks. It was a steal. There was probably only one tapas dish that I didn't particularly care for but for the price...I would definitely recommend the Happy Hour and I would definitely go back. 

Cozy atmosphere and great service."
3,"I really want to like this place. I just wished they would tighten it up a bit.   Their breakfast items are really good, donuts taste good, coffees good and customer service is even good.  My complaint is with their accuracy.  My goodness.  In the twenty times that Ive come, my order has been incorrect 95% of the time.  Im so used to this by now that I dont even drive away from the window until I check everything out and get it adjusted.  Which is always done with a smiling face so I almost feel bad giving them only three stars but I feel like it just needs to be done!  

The first few times I came, I chalked it up to being brand spankin new.  Sometimes it takes time to iron everything out and get it working like a well oiled machine.  Unfortunetly that just hasnt happened here!  

I'll honestly probably continue to come here, like I said, I like their breakfast options and when I want a guilty pleasure their cronuts are pretty awesome."
3,My husband and I have been here a couple times. It's a cute little diner and the food is good. You get that classic greasy filling diner food. Nothing memorable about the service but that also means nothing bad.
3,"The tapas here were whateves, nothing really stood out to me, the menu was very limited and simple, I think I'll stick to Firefly on Paradise Rd., my first love. But I must admit it was a cute restaurant with nice romantic lighting, cute decor, and decent service; doubt I'll be back for tapas though."
3,"Ordered the chicken kabob.    The only thing that I enjoyed was the kabob itself.     The white sauce had too much anise.    Not exactly ""fast"" food as you have to wait longer and nor was the $14   price with small drink.    Sour cherry was good though too sweet for my taste"
3,"We ordered take out.  The edamame appetizer was delicious.  The Tom Yum soup broth was delicious.  The menu stated it was to be loaded with seafood and tofu.  It one piece of 5 different items for a total of 5 bites and broth.  I was disappointed.  This is not a description of loaded.  Sushi was delicious as always.  For the price, we expect it to be a step above other restaurants.  For take out, it was not.  For eating in, maybe, as you get the atmosphere."
3,"This restaurant specializes in both paella and tapas.  We started off with a salad of apples, almonds, manchego cheese over organic greens (4), baked goat cheese in a rich tomato sauce (3.5) and dates wrapped in bacon (1.5).  We were disappointed by the dates which were overcooked and chewy.  I questioned the waiter and he confirmed that this is the way the dish is prepared.  We also ordered paella; mine was mixed seafood with shrimp, scallops, mussels and green beans.  Ann ordered the evening's special seafood paella with monkfish, beans and squash.  Each was visually unappealing suffering from a heavy hand with the tomato sauce and an absence of saffron.  I used a $50 certificate purchased form a radio station."
3,"I have eaten here twice now and held back reviewing it until after my second visit. The pizza is ok. It's not great-not horrible. Just average. You can tell the ingredients used are mediocre. The crust is good but with the pizza being so small the amount of crust leaves very little room for the other ""stuff"". I have had 4 different pies and all the same - somewhat bland in flavor, and a small amount of food for the money. If they would just make the pies a more reasonable size and improve the sauce, cheese and toppings used they might be onto something cause the place had a nice atmosphere. I also tried one of the pasta dishes and it was also ok. Nothing here was bad, but also nothing I would really want to go back for again. Overall very average quality, nice atmosphere and very expensive for what you get."
3,"The food was good, but they don't give you much at all.  If you want to charge a lot you should provide enough food.  I left the restaurant after lunch and was still hungry and had about 22$ less cash in my wallet.  I did enjoy the food, so I'll give them 3 stars.  But if they want to be long term they must provide more food.  Give customers their money's worth!  Also don't go skimpy on the toppings.  I got like two basil leaves on my margarita pizza."
3,"Natalie is the worst bartender. We have experienced discrimination before but not at this level. She passed us more than four times when we were asking for drinks and she clearly noticed us. Then she decided to tell us that she saw us with drinks before. Well, Natalie, that is not the point. You passed us multiple times when we asked for our champagne and you should have been the first to respond. We will remember this, and we hope you do too.   Howl at the moon was great EXCEPT for Natalie!!"
3,"Normally I Love Dunkin' Donuts today I bought a regular coffee,  croissant sausage and cheese, by 2 PM mostly all the donuts were gone,  so I had to settle for one I didn't really want then I got some pretzel nuggets which were dark hard dry and cold they were horrible. I would've return them but I had already left. And there customer is just ok"
3,Oh my gosh.  We came to watch a football game & actually watched the dogs.  At least 20 great dogs in here.  Limited beer choices and no food (because dogs) but fun atmosphere especially for dog owners with laid back canine kids.  Wish there was no smoking.  And clean bathroom.
3,"So it's definitely not the fastest place to get a coffee since on average the drive thru takes about 10-15 mins, but it's one of the few Dunkin locations in the desert. 

I love their iced coffees! I usually tend to go with the Almond Joy or monthly special flavors since they're delicious. I also like that you have the choice of Splenda or skim milk to make it a little less heavy on the calorie side. I still haven't ventured off to the breakfast sandwich side, but I know their doughnuts are great. 

Now if only this location could work on their speed and service I think it'd be great."
3,"Pizza is good... Pasta is ok... But the bill will be pricey!
I've tried this place twice.. And it's just an ok option! I think there is better Italian in the LKN area, and j believe the pizza is beat by another similar establishment. I think the owners are killing it with Brooklyn south, but I'm not sure they are killing it with Novanta"
3,"Hey! What is happening at Novanta?  This has always been at the top of my list - until last Tuesday.  The food has always been awesome - not anymore.  I ordered the zuccini pasta which came to me with 95 percent carrots.  My husband ordered a pasta dish that was overcooked and gummy.  Such a disappointment!  We did notice that none of the owners were present and it looked as though the kitchen was being run by a group of kids.
Don't let this restaurant go down - it is worth keeping alive - before it's too late."
3,"Appetizers were good, Served with a nice presentation.  However to charge $2.50 soda fountain water is absolutely uncalled for.  It's table water."
3,"Really wanted to love this place as I live near LangTree.  Pizza was okay but not nearly big enough for the price.  Without apps, one pizza wouldn't be enough for me.  The toppings stop about 3/4 way through the pie so it ends up being a lot of crust on top of the small size.  Hopefully they make some changes as the price is prohibitive for what you get."
3,Been here twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner.  Service has always been good. For lunch I had a sandwich and salad. Both were very good.  Went for dinner to have pizza. Ordered the A&P and a kids cheese. I understand the wood fire gives it a char but both pizzas were just plane burnt!!! Crust and bottom. Could not taste anything but burnt crust. Son only ate a few bites of his. Seems like it may be a little to hot in the oven. Dough was still raw on the inside.
3,Just yay!  Haven't been to one in ages.. As there aren't many in CA. Was glad to find and indulge in a small Koolata. I actually went inside to order and there was only one person working there at the time. The place was nearly empty. I had to walk around to the side of the aisle to get his attention. Other than that everything was great.
3,"This House of Hunan has one of the loveliest interiors of any restaurant I have ever been to, and for that I would like to keep coming back. It's cozy but spacious, classy but still casual enough to be comfortable. They have a nice assortment of options on their menu for both the adventurous and the traditionalist, and I opted for mildly adventurous with the seafood nest. (Ok, I also just couldn't pass up such a cute name for a dish...a nest?) 

Sure enough, my seafood came in an actual nest made out of fried potato shreds, and the presentation itself made me grin. All the seafood was cooked just right, and the shrimp was especially good. The vegetables were rather al dente, which is not my favorite, but I've come to expect it at Chinese restaurants. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken in peanut sauce dish as well. 

Our server wasn't exactly Mr. Warm and Fuzzy, but he did his job well, and didn't interrupt, so no complaints there. Unfortunately, my beef with this place, and the reason for two missing stars, is how it leaves me feeling. I know it's a Chinese restaurant, and if I want healthy I should go elsewhere. But for the price point of House of Hunan, I would think I would be able to walk away from a meal feeling better than I have both times I have visited. 

However, I have yet to try their sushi, and I believe I will give them a shot to redeem themselves with that in the near future, hopefully leaving with a happier belly."
3,"Meh...This is Neapolitan style pizza, which is probably healthier than the usual American style, but is much less satisfying. It is so thin that it is too messy to eat by hand. Yet, some toppings can't easily be cut with a knife and fork. For example, the main ingredients of the prosciutto and arugula pizza are layered on after the pizza is removed from the oven, not actually cooked with the pizza. This is not only hard to eat, but also means the flavors don't really mesh. Lastly, the place is pricey and service was a bit slow. If you love Neapolitan pizza, you might like this place. If not, you might want to skip it."
3,Being one of the few DD's on the west side this place gets busy in the mornings. Regardless if there's a line of cars or not in the drive through the wait is always about the same which is about 10 mins to get your order. The staff here is decent but not overly friendly or welcoming. Make sure you are not in a hurry if you decide to stop by this location.
3,So I was so excited to come here while this used to be my favorite place to get lasagne. All summer and last year they were closed for renovations so when my mother informed me they are back open I was stoked and ready to head on over only to be a little disappointed. I always ordered the lasagne dinner which came with a house salad and garlic bread I swear none of it tasted as good as I remember before the closing and renovations. I'm not sure how I feel about house of pizza now because before I held them to such a high standard .
3,"I have tomato allergy but I still love a good pizza! I normally order a regular pizza and sub tomato sauce for something else I was sad to find out they only had Alfredo and it was put on very thick and the toppings were sparse! I would not order another pizza from here! I gave 3 because my lunch mates loved their food they had Lasagna, Baked Ziti and the House pizza! The dough was not memorable"
3,"Clean, efficient, good food in Medina. Great booths! - nice back support.  MUCH better than the Fairlawn location."
3,"Lunch:  Beef & lamb shawarma. Comes with pita, hummus, tzatziki, salad and...onion salad? with lemon wedge.

Meat was a bit on the tough side & heavily seasoned. A bit spicy--guess I'm a wimp today. Needed the tzatziki.  Other than that I enjoyed it."
3,"We stopped in to Novanta at the beginning of their second week.  I'm rooting for all of the businesses in Langtree at the Lake at exit 31 to be raving successes so I use my discretionary money to do my part to support them.  

We stopped in at about 6:30 pm and the restaurant was already bustling.  The three of us were seated within 5 minutes in the middle of the restaurant.  Decor is eclectic, the restaurant is very attractive and definitely a place you'd like to linger and hang out in.  The bar area had a number of couples and groups eating and there were many children in the dining area, so people of all stages were here.  I think people are definitely looking for their ""Cheers"" in some manner of speaking.

Our server was extremely pleasant.  She had drinks brought round quickly and we ordered the grilled Caesar salad to start.  To my vast surprise, it was on the table in about three minutes.  The salad was listed as a lightly grilled romaine heart with roasted cherry tomatoes and drizzled with Caesar.  I've long been curious about grilled romaine and just never got around to doing it myself.  This romaine simply kissed the grill for a nano-second so I was a little disappointed in the ""grilled"" portion of the dish.  The Caesar dressing was delicious and the grilled bread was out-of-this-world delicious, I'd suggest the restaurant make that a stand-alone appetizer suggestion or pair it with a dip of some sort.  The blanched and peeled tomatoes had a slightly odd mouth-feel to me, I'm not a super fan of peeled tomatoes outside of sauce. 

We finished our salad and our entrees came out promptly right behind it.  I ordered the Capricossa pizza which comes with a red sauce, mushrooms, artichokes and Italian ham.  The style of pizza served at this restaurant comes from a wood fired grill which cooks the pizzas very fast, in about 90 seconds.  The crust is chewy and crunchy in some places and blackened in others.  This is the nature of this style of pizza.  (think about it, there's NY style, Chicago deep dish style, Buffalo NY style, thin crust style...).  Personally, I like this style of pizza.  But. I don't think Americans are fond of their pizza being 40-45% crust.  I am getting the impression that that is one of the reasons for the discontent with the pizza here.  The relatively expensive $16 cost for this pizza-for-one that was 45% crust and just slightly too charred for me did affect my star rating.  This is a really expensive pizza.  And there simply won't be leftovers.  It's too small to share, plan on ordering one per person.  The man at the table next to me was upset about his pizza and I heard him ask for more ham (which they brought out) and he spread it across his naked crust.  My best advice to the restaurant is to respect the expectations of the consumer and if the pizzas are going to stay this price, make 'em less crusty and more topping-y.  And cut them into 6 slices instead of 4, it' just makes for easier eating.

My husband ordered the Pappardelle Bolognese which is a wide cut noodle with a four meat tomato sauce.  $14 for a serving that is exactly right for one person with no leftovers.  He enjoyed it.  Our third person ordered the Orechiette which came with fennel sausage and broccoli rabe.  This was $16 and again, right size for a meal, no leftovers.  The reason I keep making this distinction is because this makes this place an expensive night out. $16 and $14 a plate for pizza and pasta.  I'm paying for the overhead I know, the lovely restaurant, the expensive wood fired ovens, the likely extravagant rent, but here's the rub... 1 salad, 1 pizza, 2 pastas, 3 beverages cost me $80 and I was out of the restaurant in 30 minutes.  Were I in a hurry to go to a movie or watch a game I'd be thrilled, but I was out enjoying my night and dropped $80 in less than half an hour.  I just didn't feel like I'd gotten $80 worth of enjoyment for my 30 minutes and I didn't get leftovers for the next day.   Stores and restaurants don't always understand that if you charge a lot I'll come once, or maybe twice.  If you charge less I'll come often.  And in the long run, often is going to pay your bills.  Because I want Langtree to succeed.  I want a close-by delicious, comfortable, ambiance place that I can pop in to frequently to get dinner or have a GNO or meet another couple for drinks.  This place could be that, but at the current pricing it can't be, is my opinion.  If you charge less, people will come more often and you'll make more money in the long run. Lovely restaurant though and there was a long wait for tables when we left.

I've included pictures of the current menu, two of the restaurant and the salad, pizza and both pastas."
3,"We walked by this place and saw the nice patio outdoor seating area so we stopped by for lunch.  The menu consisted of mostly tapas around $7-10.  Paella was about $15 per person.  They had various flavors of sangria, but I just ordered the regular red sangria.  It wasn't as fruity flavored as other ones I've tried.  It just tasted like red wine with chopped fruits inside.  

For tapas, we ordered grilled beef skewers, which was cooked really tender.  It came with caramelized onions and horseradish cream sauce.  Didn't care too much for the onions.  I've never seen such dark caramelized onions before.  We also ordered a salad with green apples and manchego cheese.  This was very tasty as the dressing was nice and light.  We tried their seafood paella which the server advised would take about 30 minutes to make.  It did take about 30 minutes.  We just ordered for 1 person, which ended up being perfect for 2.  It came with shrimp and scallops.  The flavor was good.  Service was kind of slow at times, but overall food was good.  Perfect for a light lunch."
3,"This place has the potential to be a fun night, but could make some improvements.

The biggest draw for this establishment is the ""win happy hour"" program they have. These are very easy to ""win"" and I have also called ahead the day of and gotten on the list. In theory you get your first drink for a dollar and a buffet dinner provided. The buffet dinner is the in theory part. I have been to many of these free parties as a host and a guest and the food runs out quickly (they are supposed to serve from 5-7). Last time we arrived around 6 just as someone was getting more pizza because the food ran out. The guy in front of me grabbed four slices of pizza and I was told I could only have one slice when I tried to grab a second. Sorry not sorry I don't consider a single slice of pizza a meal, especially before a heavy night of drinking.  

They also have a rule where there is a 4 person minimum to order a bucket, and they have refused to sell to my group of 3 people, but will sell a second bucket to a group of 4 sitting next to us. If they were actually worried about the amount of alcohol per person that math would not add up. Other nights, however, I have been with a group of 3 that they sold buckets to. Not sure if the inconsistency makes it worse. 

All that being said, the worst experience I have had at this bar was mediocre. It is a fun bar if you are looking for something different, especially if you get a table and have cash to pay to play songs you like. Drinks are a little pricey, but not compared to the rest of the epicentre and cheaper if you average out the night if you include the first drink for a dollar deal."
3,"Dog + beer = cool idea.  But beer in plastic cups?!  Yuck.  Not a place I'd want to spend more than an hour, but a good place to come with your friends who have doggies with a need to socialize."
3,"Moved to Charlotte in '93 and this place has been open for over 40 years and I never ate here before. Weird. I used to live on the east side for many years. Usually go to portifino's but never ever again(see review to find out why). 

Anyway me and my brother decided to try it out. Very packed. Limited parking. Parked on the side of the building. Went around 7pm on a Saturday I believe. Very old looking place. Bathroom was very small. Looks like a locker room bathroom. 2 small stalls barely enough room to wash your hands. 

Everywhere looked dingy but not dirty I guess. Sn: Always Wash your hands after ordering. Menus are gross. Table and menu were kind of sticky. Seats weren't that much cleaner. Maybe it was a busy night for them. No paper towels in the bathroom had to use a napkin I had in my bag to open the door after drying my hands with the oldest hand dryer ever. Another side note: never touch public door handles with your bare hands esp in the restroom(e.coli is hella real). Call me weird but I never get sick and I'm a nurse(we are all a little weird I think lol). Anyway...

Salad was horrible. Didn't touch it. See pics. The bottle that the dressing came in...Omg.  Didn't look clean at all. Maybe keeps getting Refilled but not cleaned. Chicken Alfredo was bland and way too much Alfredo sauce for my liking. Garlic bread was ok(I make better way better). My brother ordered a Philly. Both entrees were not so good. 

Ordered a large pizza to go for my little cousins. I ate a slice on the way there(Barely ate my food so I was hungry) and Omg it was so delish. I guess we both ordered wrong. The pizza was where it was at! Hence the name. I guess I'll get pizza next time. 

Had I known about their pizza I would have stopped going to the other pizzeria down the road a long time ago. The location is very homely and sketchy looking But that's usually where you get the best food. The Pizza was very good! And I really love pizza. Maybe too much. 

The server was ok. She checked on us and the food came out quick. Reminds me of Waffle House staff(I love Waffle House but we all know the people there can be pretty interesting). Just random looking people if you know what I mean. From what I can see the front was clean and they have a good score. So I would def go back. But only for the pizza and nothing else."
3,"Good place to get tapas on the strip.

If you like cured meats and cheese they have a good variety here. Good selection of Spanish cuisine."
3,"Great spirits, a chill atmosphere and a friendly bartender. Not much more you could ask for :)"
3,"After visiting Hi Tide, I'm still on the search for great raw fish in Charlotte. It satisfied my craving for seafood, but did not leave me wanting more.

I tried their rainbow poke bowl, and the fish was a little too warm for my liking. It was filling, but it just didn't impress me much. The Goose, of course, ordered the steak bowl and felt similarly about it."
3,"If you looking for gourmet, this ain't the place. I had breakfast here after drinking all evening and well it was 8 dollars, the portion was decent and the food was good. The service seemed a little slow but I'd come back!"
3,"Pros- spicy tuna bowl was really good. We loved the rice and overall combination of flavors. 

Peach tea was good and crushed ice always rocks.

Menu is interesting - lots of combo bowls. 

Lobster roll was tasty. But:

Cons- it was the tiniest lobster roll I've ever seen!
It was on a little Hawaiian bun rather than the larger, longer tradional toasted roll. We spit both things and half the roll took 3 bites to finish. It was not priced like a single slider... $22! I recommend Dean and Deluca(3 sliders for same price)  or the place near Talbots/ Southpark(based in Florida). They used to have delicious lobster rolls on Fridays. 

It came with  a large portion of fries but they were not hot and they lacked flavor. 

There were a lot of employees and everyone was pleasant but there seemed to be a lack of focus on helping customers at the counter. You have to order and pay at counter first and food is brought to table.  (Pet peeve- paying same or more for food at places that don't offer full service.) This was lunch but they do have full service at dinner.

No regular brewed tea.

We plan to back one weeknight for half-price oysters. The variety looked really good. I'd like to try the poke nachos too. 

I'll keep my eyes out for lobster roll improvement!!"
3,"Voodoo started out as one of my top breweries to visit while visiting home (Pgh). I still enjoy stopping by to check out the beers; however, the past few times we've gone, there hasn't been very many new beers on the tap list. 

This time, they were really busy when we stopped in and the bartender seemed a bit overwhelmed. 

I ordered the Guava berliner and it was pretty good. We also ordered the Refined, Fred Got Slacks, and Space Cadet. Refined was okay but the other two weren't that good. 

I'm hoping that they continue to brew new styles and bring variety back to the tap list. While I appreciate the availability of popular, classic beers, it's also nice to get to try something new from the brewers.

It's a cool spot to hang out and they're in a great location being in Homestead/the Waterfront. There's a kitchen now (I haven't tried their food, yet), they have games to play, and they also host events and trivia nights."
3,"Beware don't leave anything behind!!
Great hotel location etc BUT for the first time ever I left a valuable one of a kind item behind in my room on the RSVR floor. I realized it within an hour of checking out, called the front desk who said they would contact housekeeping and FedEx to me. Well that did not happen. I called loss prevention 3 times with no response. Finally got a manager on phone who said they didn't find the item. Well someone did. Very disappointing as I've stayed here in past and intended to again but...."
3,"no matter in what part of the city you're in, if all else fails, Jack AStorS is your last resort.  Situated along other restaurants at Shops on Don Mills, this place is definitely HAPPENING! especially on a Friday night. 
Both my friend and I originally tried getting a seat at the bar, but failed, so the next best thing was a small booth which worked out to be perfect!
After she ordered the....cocktail (forgot which one) I opted for their Argentine Malbe (Yes i love red) and we placed our order for their shareable nachos.
Our server T*** (due to identity) was awesome! he provided us some recommendation when it came to either adding beef or chicken, thankfully we chose chicken.
Portions were huge, so huge we both couldn't finish it, as we both had dinner earlier.
Prices are decent, vibe is kickin and service was kick assssss."
3,"A good old fashion car wash with a clean waiting area. If busy, may take a few minutes to get your car out of the drying area, but the guys are generally pretty helpful."
3,3 cheers for food in downtown! So many restaurants closed at late hours except this place.  Simple meals yet filling especially during late night munchies.  Also Dunkin Doughnuts is right next to it.
3,"I am not a fan of this Jack Astor because I find the service to be lacking here. It took forever for food to come and the place wasn't even busy! I ordered a pizza here and the only flavour it had was salt. Thank goodness for the salad on top of the pizza to balance out the flavour a bit. It was quite an odd pizza to eat so I wouldn't order it again.
I would come back to Jack, not for a full meal but perhaps just appetizers or desserts because I think they do those the best. For a meal, I would choose one of the other restaurants close by before coming here!"
3,"Decided to come here with a group of 6 after we were informed of a 30-45 minute wait for Joey's.  We were seated immediately, with numerous televisions around playing sports for the night.  Our waitress was enthusiastic and relatively quick with our orders.  We mainly came for appetizers and drinks, as we had all already had dinner.  I wasn't a fan of their guacamole, but the nachos were otherwise decent.

They had 18 beers on tap, and we had pitchers of Rolling Rock, Sam Adams, Flying Squirrel.  The Rolling Rock with somewhat flat, but the other two were much better.  The glasses they provided us weren't chilled, which is always bothersome for me.  Overall a good experience, with decent service, but would still probably only come back here as a second option."
3,"We seem to end up at the Centrifuge every time we come to Vegas. Decent drinks, a nice vibe and occasionally dancers on your table. It's a fun place to chill."
3,"Jack Astor's has been a staple of this community

Their new menu is delish

The guac is a good starter though they should be mashing down the avocado a bit more

But the real deal is the wings 

Hand tossed in the sauce is so much better

Had the sesame ginger wings...

Wow is all I gotta say

Service was great there

Keep doing what you do!!!"
3,"I agree with the below review.  Good for pre-game drinks before going out and truley partying.  The bartenders dance on the bar every so often, so if you see a hot server, get in there, order a drink, and pay attention!"
3,"Nothing special but safe choice for dinner. After they've started posting their calories on their menu I'm less likely to come here...

Hopefully they can add some healthier choices in the future :)"
3,"You can't go wrong with an edible $.99 shrimp cocktail in Vegas, right? You may not get too many shrimp and there's lots of sauce on the bottom to fill the cup but at least try this once if you're in the area. It's not amazing but come on it's a $.99 shrimp cocktail in Vegas, gotta try that at least once."
3,"I haven't seen the work done yet so I'll update this review.  However, I specifically asked about purchasing the basic wash and what the charge would be to add shampooing the floor mats.  The gentleman said I could purchase the deluxe wash $49.99 which included the floor mats or a full floor mat/interior shampoo for $59.99 and he'd comp the wash.  Sitting in the lobby right now and there is a sign that says additional services offered shampoo carpeted mats $2.50 each.  I appreciate this person trying to help me but spending the extra money for services I didn't desire when they do offer the very thing I inquired about is frustrating."
3,"Cheapest meal in Vegas. 2 hot dogs, 2 Pepsi, 2 shrimp cocktails for $10. I said cheap, not the greatest. Just to hold you over."
3,"Today, had the Hamburger Deluxe, which has 2 thin patties, cooked where the edges are charred. The T/ L /onions were fresh. Fries that came with it were cooked right--golden. Place is a dive, but writing mostly to advise that the servers were courteous. Didn't get the attitude the other reviews mentioned."
3,"Inside the Fremont Casino downtown this casino snack bar serves up chinese fast food & fresh made hot sandwiches. 

Hot dog,fries & drink $2.95, 2 item chinese combo $5.99, French Dip & waffle fries plus a drink $6.99. 

French Dip was suprisingly good, waffle fries were fresh & crisp. Chinese was not so good. 

Definitely a good spot to know of if your downtown drinking & on a budget or craving some chinese."
3,"Fast food restaurant smack dab in the middle of the Fremont Casino.  Inexpensive reliable food ranging from breakfast to Chinese food to hawaiian saimin - often very crowded as patrons are often slow to make decisions on what to eat, so the line backs up.  Hours from 11am to 7am.  They close for a couple hours after the early breakfast crowd.

Highlights:
Chinese plates for $5.99 - great deal, generous portions
Hot dogs - huge dogs!  Suitable for sharing.
Shrimp cocktail - 99cent special with baby shrimp (note, spicy kick to the sauce!)
Saimin - (for Hawaiians - akin to S&S brand saimin), -nice portion."
3,"Think Panda Express, cause that's pretty much what it is. Same kinds of food, same serving style. The Chinese food was surprisingly good and very inexpensive ($5.99 for 2 entree). After midnight, they start serving breakfast and for $5.99, you get a heaping portion of whatever breakfast items you want.

They also have a hot dog and soda deal, which is insanely cheap. My brother lived on them the last time we stayed there.

So, if you're looking for fast, inexpensive, but good food, this is the place for you!"
3,"Located right in front of Hakkasan in the MGM Grand, this is the perfect place to meet up with people for a pre-party drink.  That's exactly what we did before going into Hakkasan.  There was a large group of us and we needed a centralized place to get organized so that we could get into the nightclub easily instead of everyone getting in at one time.  

We arrived early and had a few cocktails before the rest of the group showed up.  Once everyone arrived, we went in to Hakkasan.  Drink prices are a little higher here than the other bars at the MGM....probably because of the location.

Return Factor - 70%"
3,"Came here for something to do on a Saturday afternoon. It's very big and open, but also dark on a sunny day. It definitely wasn't crowded so we were able to sit wherever. I tried the Beach Gear which is a blonde ale with apricots and it was excellent! There is artwork/graffiti all over so that was cool to look at. Prices were reasonable (about $5/beer), I just wish some daylight came in the building, it made me feel cooped up."
3,"1. Decent value!
2. It's what Fieri would call a ""dive""
3. The food ain't bad, but it ain't great. 

This is not the Ritz!"
3,"This place is hit or miss.  A good place to get on the go meals/snacks for some what decent prices.  I come here to get lunch every now and then and I usually get the Chinese plate combo.  Not upset but a little disappointed, I ordered beef with broccoli and when I got back to my office, I had only ONE piece of beef in my meal.  Their sweet and sour pork is always crunchy and tough.  

So if you ever try this place and get beef with broccoli be sure you tell them to put beef with it. 

With that being said, happy eatings!"
3,"Nothing special, decent seating, standard overpriced strip casino bar..."
3,I really enjoy the beers and I like that they can let you have a sample before committing to a 16 ounce pour. The food on our trip here just needed a little extra of something. The tofu veggie tacos just needed a lime and the black bean burger just needed a good sear on the grill (it was a little too mushy to eat as a burger). The venue is cold on cold days. The bathroom is completely horrendous. The stall doors in the women's room can't close and/or lock properly. That and the cold are the two reasons why I rated 3 stars.
3,"If you come during lunch time. Expect to pay $6 to valet park.

We had chicken francesai recommended by prior reviewers, the Adega sandwich and chocolate Nutella hazelnut as dessert. 

Food is very generic. Nothing is worth mentioning here. 

Ambience is cool- big wall to wall glass windows, fancy decor, etc. but I can't eat ambience, can I?"
3,"It was good. I had the rainbow bowl. Each bowl comes in 2 sizes. If you are hungry at all, order the large. Portion sizes overall are pretty small. I ordered takeout for my boyfriend and I. He had the Ahi Tuna Bowl and said it was good. The drawbacks to this place are the atmosphere and the price. It's trendy so we expected it to be more expensive than it should be, so that wasn't a surprise. The atmosphere wasn't my style. Pretty cold, but I didn't eat there so I don't want to judge something I didn't experience. It's definitely worth a try but I'm not sure we will be back."
3,"Overall I'm going with just ok. Had high expectations due to constantly seeing many luxury cars come here. I took mine, they were very careful with the black paint and did an exterior wax. They left spots of wax on the car still but overall exterior was really nice. Interior, I don't like being able to see spots that were treated and spots they completely missed. Id be happy with a wipedown and no treatment than a half ass one. Otherwise really liked the waiting area, car is clean and the 72 hour rain guarantee is awesome, especially during monsoon season. I have a groupon so I have a couple more washes, will update if next round is better!"
3,"Stars were based on entrance  and service. However food wise, a disaster of food. My partner and I ordered Pasta, Garlic Herb shrimp Pasta, and other asiago chicken bow ties, after two attempts of having it sent back, it was cold. And basically just brought as food person who was jokingly making the meal. I did not finish my pasta, nor Would you, if you were in my position. I'm completely unsatisfied when food is brought in such manner. 
It's almost saying why did you even come? And to make matters worse it's st patty's day so service and food should have some attention brought to them! After I didn't eat had it pushed to the front of table, I had manager show up, -Aleeza, she took care of the bill and brought another meal for me, but she was open to my suggestion to  fix your Friday evening chefs. I'm a foodie, hope to visit again but we shall see."
3,"This is a pretty chill bar. Lots of seating and flat screen TVs to watch sports and lounge about. The music is Top 40s and is not loud, so you can easily carry conversations with good friends and have a great time. It is not, however, a place to mingle, hook up, or dance. It's simply not that type of vibe. But it is a good place to meet up friends before you out for the night to debauchery and randomness that is Vegas."
3,"This was the first below average experience I had at any Jack Astor's . 
Memphis Steak was awesome. So was the pan bread and kids chicken bites. The 2 salads we ordered both had too much dressing. We should have ordered dressing on the side. Esp the tuna avocado salad. Kids had a steak that came well done when we had ordered as med. it was like leather. 
Server missed our poutine. Beer was flat.  
Brownie for desert was good. Banana split came with all the ice cream melted. 
Server was nice but on the slower end of attentiveness."
3,"4-star work, but a star knocked off for glacially slow service. ALL the local car washes seem to move at a snail's pace, which I don't understand - part of the reason I'm willing to pay somebody else to do it is for the speed & convenience. If you take 30 minutes (when not even busy) to get me out of there, you've defeated a lot of the purpose. But at least I've always been satisfied with the end result here. Shake a leg and I'll update my review accordingly."
3,"While friendly, the service wasn't quick... even with the bar settling down at 3am on a Friday. What saves the place are two things:

1) the absolute apathy on the face of the bartender that looks like Wolverine. He had my group cracking up every time the employees have to dance on the bar.

2) the drinks. While service can be slow enough to sober up between rounds, the drinks are well-done and potent for the premium price. It isn't cheap, but the alcohol is good quality and they pour generously if you return the friendly attitude and don't make it a point to be a lecherous creep that goes for an up-skirt peep-show every time the waitresses get up to dance.

If I could rate the drinks individually, the chai martini gets five stars. It can be inconsistent, but that's the nature of the game when working with a complicated flavor profile. Enjoy it."
3,"The room was very nice and fit 6 girls comfortably. Valet service and bellhops were very nice and concerned with baggage and if you needed help.
My complaints with this hotel are lack of urgency.
I made this reservation months ago for 6 people for a room with 2 queen size beds and a pull out couch.  I arrived at 4pm which is when check in begins. I was told my room was being cleaned and it would just be a few minutes.  An hour later I checked back and was told the cleaning lady had just entered the room and it would be done in 15 minutes tops and they would come get me (I was sitting in the lobby right infront of them). 45 minutes later I went back to the desk and was told they couldn't find me to tell me my room was available.  I was literally right in front of them and no one left the desk to ""look for me"". 

Once we got back to our room from a baseball game and a stop afterwards at a bar we realized we were not provided with bedding for the sofa bed.  We also only had 3 bath towels for 6 girls.  At 1:30am I called down to the desk to ask for the supplies we needed to go to bed.  By 3am we still didn't have the linens so I walked downstairs and was told they would bring them up in 20 minutes.  At this point I just asked them to give me the linens and I would take them myself.  They paged the cleaning crew and told them to bring the supplies.
The cleaning crew wasn't told we needed 3 towels, sheets, blankets, and pillows, they were only told part of the materials.  
The young man was nice enough to ""help"" me to my room with the few things he was told to get me and we stopped by the storage closet on the way to get the blankets and additional towels, I gave up on the pillows, there were enough throws to use laying around the room.

For $500 a night I would expect the room to be stocked with adequate linens, towels, trash cans (there was one 8"" x 8"" box for trash in the room) and other necessities.

The hotel was nice and clean but grossly unprepared for its guests."
3,"Man... I really want to love this place but they make it difficult. I've had two orders messed up. The first time I ordered take out my order included the sliders. To my own fault, I should've checked the box prior to leaving the restaurant. I don't eat beef but for some reason I had Multiple beef sliders when it was suppose to be oysters. 

Today when I ordered again through Grubhub I created a ""build your bowl"" I was craving one after my rather daunting Friday meeting. I paid for a large but received a small. Additionally, over half of the items I requested to be in my bowl were missing. Sigh. So, needless to say my lunch was just Blah. 

The quality of fresh ingredients is good, don't get me wrong but quality control on to go orders is an area that needs some attention. :( 

Maybe, 3rd times a charm...."
3,"Love this place. food is cheap but yummy. pack but the people in line are entertaining. They serve Hawaiian, Chinese, and American food here. 
Whole reason we come here my lil man loves their spam masubi's. If your a sucker for spam masubi's come early they run out pretty fast."
3,"One of the good Jackastors, lately I've been finding a hit and miss with this nice franchise.

This specific location still have the Buffalo chicken Cobb salad where most of the other locations stopped serving it, which is a big disappointment.
Watched the premier league game today, with the above, calamari and their famous bruschetta and their current holiday spec.
Friendly staff, this is a favourite spot at this plaza."
3,Three stars for service and that alone. Food was seriously mediocre. I got the Rainbow bowl and it was kind of flavorless and disappointing.
3,Jack's never fails I had the chicken Parm with pasta The chicken was kind of small the pasta was tasty Another entrée a beer and an aap almost 100 bucks
3,Just a place to drink. It's sort of stuck in the back so it's quiet. Nothing special just a bar.
3,Went to this place for lunch. Had a 2 combo meal with half fried rice & noodles & beef brocolli & sweet & sour chicken. Food was ok. It came with a drink. Drink refills aren't free. Rip off. California doesn't charge for refills. Noodles were bland. It was just ok.
3,"Love the concept, love the place, wanted to love the food.  But...  I didn't.  Fish was fishy. They need to bump the quality up. The prices could be bumped to account for the quality improvement and still remain affordable. Small poke bowls are $8.95 and large ones are $11.95. When you consider the prices it remains a great value. 

The Ahi Poke Nacho appetizer was good but the ratio of chips was too great for the tasty toppings.  Perhaps serve it in a shallower dish and get the ratio better so I don't have nicely topped chips on top and a bunch of dry ones below?

Nice  that they provide various sauces at the table. Love the beautiful wooden communal table. 

As a long-time Charlottean I instantly recognized and felt immense nostalgia for the Fresh Fish sign from Butler Seafood, which occupied this space for many years. In a city that rarely celebrates its historic elements I was extremely pleased to see this sign prominently displayed inside!"
3,The service is okay but the food was over salted (MSG) some. Late night they get really busy and it feels like a fast food place. Not many options late at night so this will do.
3,The wife and I came here with some friends to grab a drink.  Service was good and drinks were about average.  It is a cool place to hangout if you are in the MGM.
3,Came here because it was the only restaurant open in the middle of the night on Fremont Street. Food was edible. Staff was super friendly.
3,"Craved for oxtail soup around 2am. Market Cafe is usually where I go whenever I want a large portion of oxtail soup that's super meaty. However as always, there was a long night on a Tuesday at 2am... Did not have the patience to wait. Decided to yelp & found this place! Perfecto! Short line and express service. Got our food and finished it within 30 minutes. Ordered oxtail soup, it was just as meaty as market cafe, however the broth was a little more salty, but no problem! Eat it with rice and it will balance out. Also tried the loco moco... Not a fan. It was salty. I wanted spam musubi but they didn't have so we opt for the loco moco. I enjoyed the oxtail soup though and prob would be coming back if I ever crave oxtail soup again."
3,"Jack Astor's patio is forever calling my name on any bright summer's day, so decided to drop by this location at the Shops on Don Mills. Parking is a little limited close to the main shops area, but there is a three level parking garage. I have to admit, I'm usually suspicious of any franchised restaurant, but I'm a fan of Jack Astor's. They have a fun and changing menu with some great hits. They also have a great, comfortable atmosphere. 

The servers were quick and efficient, however the kitchen was not that day. Several tables around us were getting anxious for their meal, while we were just happy to be having beers outside on a beautiful day. Next thing we knew the manager was coming out with little mini margaritas for everyone to apologize for the wait. Beer and margaritas? Well done Jack. The margaritas were so good, that we asked for the recipe! Our meal came shorty afterwards and was quite delicious. I had the tortilla crunch burger. It had a nice balance of toppings with the guac, feta, tomatoes and tortilla chips all working together. I love guac on a burger and the tortilla chips added a really nice crunch to what would have otherwise been a mush on mush on mush. My dinnermate had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich, and it must have been good, because I only manage to wrestle some fries off of his plate. 

J. Ast, you have done it again with your wonderfully cold drinks and reasonably priced foods. It was a great topper to an otherwise already sunny day."
3,"First impression: The place is cute. It looks like a chic fish market with community seating. 

Staff: The women we ordered from had no clue what was going on. There are three drink machines against the back wall and she didn't know what was in them. 

Food: The $21 lobster roll was cold and tiny. The best part was by far the fries. The poke bowl was good but tiny, even though I ordered a small, it was really, really small. We also ordered poke nachos which were basically a big bowl of wonton chips with a few pieces of fish and some seaweed. 

Service: They use a card system which is very inefficient so there was constantly someone asking you if what they were holding was yours. We got our first two things fairly quickly and then had to ask 20 minutes later where our third dish was. 

Overall: We would go back but would definitely get large, overpriced, poke bowls only."
3,Ox tail soup and 99 cent shrimp cocktail. How can you go wrong? The egg drop soup was great as well. :)
3,The fries from the poutine was kind of cold and the gravy wasn't hot enough.  The waiter said he will cook us a fresh one himself next time.  And it barely had any chicken in the chicken salad.
3,"Pretty cool little cheap place. For some reason every time we come here it's always way to packed to dine in. It might be because there are 3 other restaurants that share a dine in spot. It's darn hard to find a seat to eat at after ordering your food. Well almost every time we come to fremont street, we come to check this little joint out. They serve Hawaiian food here along with what my son always gets, the spam masubi. Every time I come here too I always order the same thing, 99cents shrimp cocktail.....yummmy. I also heard that their oxtail soup here is good to, but I've yet to try it.

Besides the fact that it's hard to find a seat to eat your food, and how long the line is every time we come here (and sometimes, just sometimes they run out of spam masubis) but other than that food is good here and I will continue to come here when we go to Fremont St. 

99 cent cocktail shrimp for the win!"
3,"I came, walked to the table where six other friends of mine were, sat down, ordered a light poutine, a beer, and did put my most casual attitude on.  Holy crap was that ever I good idea, because if I wore my pompous ass face on that night, there would have been a fight, and this review would have been a rant.

The waitress we had talked to us like she was the Alpha Male of our group, and slammed the plates on the table when we told her something she didn't want to hear, and she made fun of us when someone needed to be made fun of..and we LOVED her!
I forgot her name (probably a good thing), but she was like that cool girl at school everyone wanted to hang out with because she was so badass.  It's almost impossible to not order something when she came and asked whether if we wanted more beer.  So when I said no after a single bottle, I felt like a little bitch when she looked at me with those disapproving eyes. 
Our friend Jennifer didn't end up liking her meal (her fault because she ordered pad thai at Jack Astor's), so the manager offered his apologies, and two gift vouchers to her.  All of the sudden, all of us wanted to not like our meals.  Truth was they did like it, with the exception of me and my poutine, but I was too much of a little bitch to say anything.  DAMMIT!

There are a lot of testosterone here, and on Saturday nights the entrance/parking lot looks like a Xzibit rap video.  I haven't witnessed any fights, and generally its a friendly atmosphere.  There's not much I can say about this Jack Astor's that I haven't said about any other Jack Astor's.  At least nobody asked me for deposit my ID so that I don't dine & dash like the Bloor & Yonge location.
Most character of all the other Jack Astor's, best staff and most chillin' scene, yo.


When we left, Sarah asked whether if there was any lollipops, and the manager brought out the box and just stuffed the purses of every girl with teeth rotting magic.  WOOT"
3,"Went to Centrifuge on a Sunday night. The ambiance is great Drinks were good the bartenders get up and dance every so often. The place was kinda empty, but i am sure it is more fun on weekends."
3,"I have been to numerous hotels that are considered 5 star. I can assure you this is not one of them and will detail the reasons why. 1) unimpressive lobby and check in. 2) panhandlers at valet 3) dried soap bubbles on the shower glass in the room not from me. 4) entire table top below TV was covered in dust. Placed a folded white shirt on the table and came off dusty. Could see the dust after you set something on the table. 5) questionable clientele allowed to enter and use clubs and areas by getting a wrist band. 6) bouncer staff was rude and not professional. 7) rooftop bar is small, over crowded, lacks sample seating with bad music. 8) dirty plates from room service sat outside a room down from ours for over 36 hours.
Now the good...... Nice service from staff and they were welcoming. Carpets and public areas clean. I believe there are other hotels that are just as nice or nicer for the money or less. Should you be 24 and want to feel like you may be important then this is the place for you. Should you want and desire a first class experience I really think there are better in the city!"
3,What can I say. Its down and dirty casino grub. Shrimp cocktails for a buck are good. Hot dogs looked a bit dated so I passed on them. All in all if you need something to hold you over this is a decent option.
3,"I love my car, its a red pony.. I took it here for a wash. They left everything pretty shiny for what i can see. But i guess they forgot the inside, i wanted a deeper cleaning on the inside.. Well it will be for next time. They paid attention to my tires and did the wash pretty quick, so it was a ok wash."
3,"This place is located inside Fremont Hotel in Downtown Vegas next to Dunkin Donuts.

I had the 2 choice meal with half Chow Mein/half Fried RIce, Orange Chicken, and Beef with Broccoli. The chow mein and fried rice was good, the orange chicken had too much batter, and the beef with broccoli was alright.

It definitely doesn't beat Panda Express, but it'll do for late night food! If you want something that's inexpensive and a pretty big meal, this is the place to go!"
3,Great location in the hotel! Its a nice place to just sit and wait and people watch. Bartender was quick!
3,"Came to this Lounge, was  attended by Testafaye... the rudest, most unprofessional, might be racist ""bartender""!!! Everyone in the place was complaining about him.. worst customer service... Serg was awesome, attentive, great personality and customer service.. place was pretty clean, music was good, drinks were good.. need to teach better customer services for sure.."
3,"Over-hyped. For the price and image you'd expect a luxury hotel.  The staff and service are awesome high points, but the property itself falls short in many domains: hot water is a scarcity, internet is spotty, shower is *in* the bedroom. 

Rooms are covered with a weird fake wood vinyl wallpaper and weirdly sexualized prints that feel like a cheap Vegas casino.  

I wouldn't object to staying here again, but don't think it's worth $200+. Major bonus points for the awesome staff and outstandingly dog-friendly policies."
3,"Came here today for a Friday lunch-out, and boy was it so hard to find a spot in such a busy plaza! 

Anyways, food here is priced higher than average but I find there is nothing too special about the quality of food they serve. 

Wait time is brutal during busy lunch hours.

Their drinks are somewhat good. I find their servers are very friendly though.

I see how people choose this restaurant due to its location and the ambiance. Over-all just okay.


Review 58 of 100"
3,"I tried this place again after hearing positive reviews. My opinion is precisely the same now as it was on my prior visit. Here is my prior review:

Love the concept, love the place, wanted to love the food.  But...  I didn't.  Fish was fishy. They need to bump the quality up. The prices could be bumped to account for the quality improvement and still remain affordable. Small poke bowls are $8.95 and large ones are $11.95. When you consider the prices it remains a great value. 

The Ahi Poke Nacho appetizer was good but the ratio of chips was too great for the tasty toppings.  Perhaps serve it in a shallower dish and get the ratio better so I don't have nicely topped chips on top and a bunch of dry ones below?

Nice  that they provide various sauces at the table. Love the beautiful wooden communal table. 

As a long-time Charlottean I instantly recognized and felt immense nastalgia for the Fresh Fish sign from Butler Seafood, which occupie this space for many years. In a city that rarely celebrates its historic elements I was extremely pleased to see this sign prominently displayed inside!"
3,"HI Tide is a fun new spot near Dilworth with good food. The atmosphere is reasonable but could be more intimate considering it is a sushi/poke restaurant which is usually associated with luxury meals. Their make your own poke bowl is very well priced and I enjoyed being able to choose what I wanted in my ""nacho poke bowl."" The sauces were disappointing and I do wish they would have had a better creamy sauce option for the dish. Their sliders were delicious. I really enjoyed the wagu beef slider but was disappointed by the fried oyster slider. For $4 it should have had a minimum of 2 oysters for the size of the bun. I will definitely be trying HI Tide again."
3,"I don't remember coming here, but obviously I did because I checked in AND there were containers in my room the following morning full of loco moco and teriyaki beef. :) None of it had been eaten yet...lol so take this review with a grain of salt.

In our alcohol hang over stupor, we ate all of the food even though it was cold. We were starving! It's probably better when it is hot. It reminded me of something I would get at a small mom and pop shop around the corner. Not great, but not bad. The loco moco was kind of bland. The teriyaki beef was better. 

This place gets an extra star for being convenient since I was staying at the fremont. It's a panda express type of situation. I vaguely remember them heating up food  in the microwave for people in front of me, which would usually turn me off, but at the time, I didn't really care."
3,The staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel was clean. I gave it a 3 because bathroom and shower made of glass doors that don't seal completely. So if your in the bedroom area there is 1/2 inch gap to see into bathroom. No privacy. No coffee in the rooms.
3,"...great place for drinks and apps and above average bar-type food.  staff is friendly, food comes promptly, opens late every night. 

we ordered calamari as an app and as always, it was great. as a main, i ordered the top sirloin steak, medium rare, with mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries. steak was good, cooked just the way I liked it. mashed potatoes were good, but I'm not a fan of green onions and there were a bunch of it mixed in. sweet potato fries were awesome, definitely worth the extra add on cost. 

3star rating is because of the price. for these prices I can get a higher quality of food than just above average bar-type food."
3,This place is alright...drinks are about $10 a piece and you can sit there playing video poker. Service is decent.
3,"3.5 stars.

After the max exodus from MGM's Garden Arena seeing Sade in concert, we somehow gravitated here.  It wasn't very crowded so we cozied up to the bar and kick started our night.  The bar's ambiance is circular as if you're on some flight deck of the Starship Enterprise (well, I guess what a Trekkie would say it was like).  There were actually half circle lounge seating along the perimeter of the place that seemed cool and comfy chill areas, but they were all taken by the time we realized they weren't VIP.  

The music vibe was energetic and the bartenders punctuated this when they got onto the bar top and strutted their choreographed dance routines.  My girl cousin, just after a single drink, made attempts to join them.  However, we skirted this disaster and settled her into her seat.  Only to find out that she was downing glasses of wine all throughout the concert.  Figures as we nearly had a PDE (Public Display of Embarrassment).  Well hell, isn't that what everyone eventually aspires to do in Vegas?

A nice bar if you happen to be in the area, after a concert or need a place to launch you into a night of craziness.

3,"This bar is pretty interesting! The bartenders dance on the bar every so often, which is pretty funny to watch. The bartenders are very cool to talk to and they make some very good strong drinks. This is a pretty good place to go for a drink or two but not much more than that."
3,"The most basic carwash is $14.99 which is VERY pricey for me. And it's also in a semi-random location. I was just really desperate at the time. They did a really good job cleaning the inside and outside of my car, but I would expect nothing less for that price. I'm surprised the carwash didn't come with a spritz or two of air freshener. I love my car but not $14.99 basic car wash love."
3,"An okay bar located right next to the Hakkasan.  Came here while waiting for the rest of my group.  The drinks seem pricey, didn't try any of the signature cocktails.  The vibe is pretty mellow and the music isn't too loud.  My main complaint though is I felt rushed by the waitress.  This included ordering, paying the bill, and getting out.  Aside from that it was a nice place to relax momentarily, but could have been a more pleasant experience."
3,"There r still cheap eats to be had in Las Vegas. But they r getting fewer by the minute. Lanai Express inside the iconic Fremont Casino is a Chinese fast food. I heard they have amazing oxtail soup, Hawaiian style. But my main purpose of coming here is for their 0.99 shrimps cocktail. Don't expect tiger prawn sizes for that price. It is just one of those Vegas experience U have to try."
3,"Fun Atmosphere / not well thought out ergonomically.
No coffee maker in the rooms, no robes - for the price these should come standard.
Not kid-friendly."
3,"The food was fantastic and the service was very good but the communication between the party planner and the staff was less than optimal. There was a miscommunication about the way the bills were to be paid and it held up the night by a good 35 min.

Ps. For the prices requested... Please ask the staff to wear black pants and not denim while serving. The look of the servers should match the quality of the kitchen staff and their cooking."
3,"If you like the club scene then this hotel is more for you than it was for me. The rooms are nice, clean, and the bed comfortable but on a weekend night there were lots of loud groups staying in the rooms. 

The front desk staff was extremely nice and accommodating. The location is also very good."
3,"I didn't hate it.. but, If I'm being honest I was not super impressed either. We decided to try it after they advertised for ""Lobster fest."" I will say that the portion of lobster in their lobster roll was decent! (However I don't think they provide this on there typical menu.) 

Seating is extremely crowded and odd. Most of their seating is at a community table. Basically, there is one long table where they seat multiple different parties. Then there are various 4 chair tables around it. However the space is pretty small so it quickly started to feel really cramped.   

The food is pretty pricing, and really just was not up to par (taste wise-presentation was good lol). 

Our service was excellent though, we had multiple people check on us and our waitress was great! And our food came out very fast."
3,"Our family friend recommended eating the oxtail soup here. They claimed it was just as good as the California's Market Street Cafe. Me, being very defensive about my oxtail soup from the California as the best I've ate, was taken for lunch by my grama and uncle.

Anything free tastes great in my book! So, when my bowl of oxtail soup came I was excited. The first thing i noticed when I opened my bowl (it came in a container), was that there was a lot of shiitake mushrooms and a good amount of fresh cilantro. It smelt amazing too! Ok, at this point I was pretty impressed. I open my chopsticks and now I'm ready to dig in.....well, this is where my ""in awe"" kinds of stops. Now, I've already waited at a table for about 15 minutes for a line of about 7 people and I waited even longer for the food to reach my mouth! The oxtail was a bit hard to get off the bone (sad face). So I did as my uncle did, grabbed it by the tail, and man handled the meat off with my lipstick smeared mouth. It came off surprisingly easy which just made me mad that maybe the restaurant gods didn't want me to eat it. Oh well~ Now before I forget the soup was good, but if I had to nitpick  (which, yes I do) it tasted too much like shiitake mushroom water mixed with shoyu. It sorta tasted like salty mushroom water, but I still downed half my bowl. Like I said, free tastes good.

The only reason I am giving 3 is because of:
1) The wait. It seemed like the cashier (although she was great, patient, friendly, and kind) didn't really know what she was doing. Maybe she was new? 

2) Salty soup. Nuff said.

3) Seating. Not good for groups of 4 or more. Luckily, we only had 3 which was still a little hard to find seats as it is. It's like cafeteria style seating. 

*just as a side note, my California oxtail soup wins*"
3,"For a quick light snack, who couldn't want a spam musubi?  This place has just that, they also serve Chinese food individual portions or by the combination plate, they have breakfast food and some fruits.  They are easily accessed just inside the Fremont Casino.  The food is decent, prices are fairly cheap, and the spam musubi, well, go try it yourself!"
3,"We were starving at about 4AM and it didn't look like we had too many choices. Most of the snack bars were closed, even the shrimp cocktail bar at Golden Gate. My friend saw the sign for Dunkin' Donuts and got a craving so we headed into the Fremont. He got his donuts, but my other friend and I decided we wanted some hot food so we headed to Lanai Express. There was a bit of a line, probably because they were the only fast food at that time of night, and there was a guy begging for food. When the staff saw him, they immediately started yelling at him and called security who took him away. 

During late night, they do not serve Chinese food. You can still get the hot dog, shrimp cocktails, musabi, and a few other items. There is also a breakfast menu. The steak and eggs was pretty cheap, but it seemed like everyone was ordering that and since the steaks are cooked to order, there was a bit of a wait. We decided to get the breakfast plates instead. It consisted of 2 eggs, biscuit or bread, hashbrowns, and sausage or bacon. We went with the scrambled eggs since they had a big tray of those so we wouldn't have to wait for eggs. It didn't look like anything special, but it tasted a lot better than it looked. A pretty good deal for a cheap, fast meal."
3,"I loved Voodoo when it first opened - cool place, close to home and pet-friendly.  

Then they got a food truck and no longer allow pets. I get it, they serve food out of a truck, but so does Brew Gentlemen and my four-legged pal is still allowed to tag along there.  

Not a fan of IPA's and seems like a lot of their beers are overly hoppy.  Breakfast of Champions is still my fave."
3,"I remember the old Jack Astors in Toronto.  The Scarborough town center one in particular.  I remember the food being horrible and trying everything on the menu and being disappointed.  Well it seems like all that is in the past now and theu revamped their restaurants and menu.  To be honest I've been here quite a bit in the last year.  The new menu and hockey season had me coming back.

Watching a leafs game here is not the greatest.  The TV's are small and the game is not usually aired with sound unless you sit closer to the bar.  The restaurant is also usually rammed with parties, families, you name it, going on.  It's better to watch the game as a side thing rather than come out of your way just for hockey.

The new food menu is good and they change it up every few months.  I still enjoy the fish and chips along with their burgers.  I feel the quality of the food is much improved from the old days.  I've tried the monthly specials including their poutine and pulled pork sandwiches.  They are decent, but nothing I haven't had a better version of somewhere else in the GTA.  Overall a good restaurant to eat at while the Leafs play."
3,I tried it today for the first time. I had pretty high hopes for this restaurant. The flavors at this restaurant were different from the other places around. The positive of the restaurant was that it had unlimited toppings. Once we chose a protein however it was very little maybe five pieces  in a regular. We ordered oysters and the seaweed salad. The seaweed salad originally looks different. It has more of a Hawaiian theme. We took a few bites and it was delicious and then we found a piece of hair in the seaweed salad.
3,"Despite my mid range rating, I highly recommend this spot to anyone trying to stick to a budget... Which is near impossibly in Las Vegas I quickly realized.

I shared the 2 entree combo, which came with rice, shrimp cocktail and a musubi.

All were decent for the price. Our whole meal for two people cost us $12. 

Everything was lacking flavor, including the musubi which wasn't marinated at all... But still I was pretty into it.

I wasn't even drinking..."
3,"Service was okay. Love the tuna salad. Misters on the patio were a bit much, all the tables were wet and the mist seemed way too strong."
3,"Thought I would venture outside of the typical burgers and fries and it was a bad idea. Got the pasta and it tasted like a canned sauce pasta from a bad frozen dinner with a few shrimp on top. 

Note to self: Stick to their sweet potatoes and burger."
3,"2.5 stars- Decent drinks, not too expensive for the location. Nice atmosphere but no bar snacks (what is it with Las Vegas and the lack of bar snacks?!). If you're feeling peckish you can always go over to the gift shop down the hall for some nuts and snack away. That's what we did."
3,"Good customer service. They didn't try to upsell. I waited about an hour, which was fine seeing as I was a walk-in on a Saturday. But my oil change was $40 out the door, which I think is too expensive."
3,"Remember back in the day when Jack's was a place of pure funny?  Funny staff singing and dancing on chairs when it was your birthday?  Loud and obnoxious?  Well Jack's is still loud and obnoxious but now it's because of the customers!

Over the past few years Jack's has slightly upped it's game.  The food is definitely better than what it used to be - there's a more international flair to the dishes.  I had the Bombay Chicken Curry.  Honestly for a chain restaurant it wasn't too bad.  Flavours were there, the rice was nice and fluffly and it even came with naan bread.

Even their drinks have stepped up - you can get an assortment of water - Perrier, Evian or Badoit.  C'est tres chic

I can only imagine how busy and loud it gets on a weekend or Friday night.  As it is, being in the Shops of Don Mills complex it usually is pretty full.  Probably all the people who had to wait too long to get into Joey's. 

Before if you told me that dinner was a Jack's I would groan, now I don't mind as much.  Service was good and plenty of parking in the front as well as the 4 tier parking garage at the back of the complex."
3,"Meh. I've been here twice for an oil change and honestly, I'm going to start looking around for another place to go. 

My last experience there, I made an appointment through the website for 8:30 am. I showed up 10 minutes early, dropped the car off, and was told by the manager to come back in about 45 minutes to an hour. That's one of the pluses about this place - the location. If you have any errands to run, there is a nearby Target, Petco, Office Max, etc. 

I came back an hour later and saw my car parked in front of the office, and assumed my car was done. I went in the office and was greeted by no one for a good fifteen minutes. When someone finally came by, I asked, ""Is that car ready?"", he told me it had not even gone in yet. This is about an hour and 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment. On top of that, the guy was pretty rude about it and then left me hanging without a resolution or even an apology.

The manager finally came out and I explained to him what happened. He tried to make it good by giving me $20 off an already overpriced oil change, so I wasn't all that impressed. I asked him why it took them an hour and fifteen minutes past my scheduled appointment to even get my car in the garage and he blamed it on ""internal problems with our mechanics."" He then had the mechanics rush through my car's oil change and check-up, I would say the whole process took about 4 minutes, which didn't make me feel all that confident they were putting any care into my car.

I was about to give them two stars, but I'll give them another star for attempting to fix things with the $20 discount. But I do expect better service than this, so I think I'm going to have to try a new place. There's got to be better places than this to get a simple oil change done."
3,Food was delicious and the portions were nice and hearty. Lots of options for making your own poke bowl which I love. Poke worth trying!!
3,"A little confusing to find, but you can find the Centrifuge at the Central location at the MGM Grand. Basically, it's where Hakkasan is, where Rain Forest Cafe used to be around, and right above the sports book. If you still can't find it, it's in the same area as Level Up and the bridge from NYNY / Tropicana. Had a hard time trying to find it, but hopefully you guys don't!"
3,"I have updated my review to reflect the graciousness and apology from one of the owners, Jake. He contacted me personally to apologize for the service, and invited me to come back. He also said that he has educated his staff on how to handle the food situation. If my husband and I make it to Pittsburgh again, we will stop by Voodoo and I will post another updated review."
3,"People who will not like this hotel: business travelers. People who will like this hotel: weekend party people. 

I get that this is an ""urban"" hotel but I wasn't super impressed with the fact that all of the hotel employees were wearing plain clothes, except the valet. I usually dislike super pushy bellmen, however, this trip I did have quite a few items so I did need assistance up to my room.

I had called the night before to request a refrigerator for my room and was told its a $25 upcharge (which is CRAZY but I was willing to pay for it due to dietary restrictions). I again requested a fridge upon arrival and was told it would be provided. After a 45 minute wait, I called to check the status, only to be told they were out of fridges and I could use the mini bar fridge if necessary. So currently there are 6 beers sitting out getting warm while my food is in the fridge. Not super convenient. They do offer the honor bar in the room with drunk snacks (nuts, chocolate) similar to Vegas hotels I have stayed in. The minibar is pretty well stocked with drink selections if that's your gig. 

The room itself is ok, except it does not have a desk. As a business traveler, I'm currently typing with my laptop on my lap. The bathroom is very open, with the glass shower right next to the bed. The toilet is in a closet so there is some privacy. The closet had 2 hangers, so its a good thing I'm only staying one night so I had 1 outfit to hang."
3,"Went here with a groupon, and upgraded to get my seats shampooed. The hand wash was great, as was the wait area. It's also a gas station so you can get anything to eat or drink that you want. After my car was complete the outside was decent, you couldn't even tell the seats had been shampooed, and it didn't look like they did a great job wiping down the interior."
3,"This place is... passable. I came here bc I had poke at Pei Wei and loved it. I got the Rainbow Bowl, and my husband got the Shrimp Roll. The shrimp roll was tiny, but fairly tasty. The fries were good. The Rainbow Bowl was just ok. I personally like Pei Wei better."
3,"NOT OPEN UNTIL 7am!!!  Idk when they close, I just know that they weren't open at 630 on a Tuesday when I stopped by and they looked like they had been closed for a while.      Been here before though and the food is cheap and buffet quality, so I'd definitely recommend if you just need something to fill you up on the cheap."
3,"Decent bar. It is hopping the later the night goes- as with everything in Vegas. the Bartenders would stop every hour, to dance on top of the circle/ round bar, to the latest dance song, so the atmosphere is lively. 

Drinks are good, more stiff than most bars or those free cocktails you get. Prices are reasonable. A nice grey goose soda is $9.75, which they comped since i played a little computer poker (just put in $1, and play slowly...)"
3,"They have the famous ,99 shrimp cocktail it's nice and refreshing.  What do you want for under a buck.  A colorful cast of clientel and basic  subsistence.  The ""Chinese"" food is average at best but lots of fresh vegetables to make up for lack of protein.  I'll be back to try the oxtail soup."
3,"Cool design and super trendy; however I am only rating it three stars because of the weird room layout. The shower is in the middle of the room instead of in the bathroom. And there is no desk to work at in the room, Which is a bit of a hassle if you're traveling for business. I would stay here again for a couples weekend but not alone or with friends. Service was friendly and the main restaurant was decent for breakfast. The fitness center is located on the floor above the lobby but there are not any guestrooms on that floor and the door was not locked (there was a pad to swipe your guest room key but it wasn't functioning and the door was open so hopefully they can get that fixed), which made me a little bit nervous being in there alone."
3,"Typical Jack's, no matter which location you go to.

I got the Dirty Bird Chicken Sandwich with fries. The chicken tender fingers were spicy! There was also hot banana peppers and fried jalapenos. If you can't handle spicy, this isn't for you. It's a bit more expensive than most places considering the food (and 3 chicken strips) and the food and service isn't special.

Parking is hard to come by, especially at the Shops at Don Mills. Atmosphere was good, lots of TVs with different sports on. Not much wait for a table. Waiter spilled the drinks on the floor and got some on me. The staff didn't seem to care."
3,"Not too bad.
This is fairly legit brewery.

Anyway, beer was good, I only had 1 IPA but I liked the fact that it was actually hoppy and not bogged down with that heavy sickening sweet Malty flavor most breweries around here offer in their ""IPA's"" 

 No complaints really other than the dismal inconvenient location. I will go back and get some growlers filled soon with their IPA(s) I just wouldn't linger around the brewery after the sun goes down."
3,"We took our car in for a break job that was quoted 2hrs and $500. Well they ended making some mistake that took them 2more days to fix.When we finally picked up the car we didn't get much of a discount for the inconvenience. I spent more money on cabs between work and back. Within a day of having the car we almost got in an accident because the breaks completely locked. We couldn't drive the car. We called the shop they had it towed and had it looked at. I Rate it three stars and not a 1 for all the troubles because they actually did try to help fix the situation. this was right before christmas and we were heading out of town on a road trip. so once again we went about 2more days without a car. Between car rentals and cabs we spent another $600 easily. They try to tell us it was a problem that didn't have to do with the work they did. But what a coincidence that was, break completely stops working after new break job. This was conveniently close to our house and thats why we took it there. Maybe they have students working on cars."
3,"Ah, a bar in the MGM that I care about called something other than Zuri. What a rare treat! Centrifuge was actually very nice. Our waitress/bartender was very friendly and we never felt like we couldn't flag someone down if we were thirsty. They even offered cigars on the menu! 

We shared a great bottle of wine and got to enjoy a handful of the twice-hourly dance parties that the bartenders groove to on top of the bar. It's a quirky little twist; it falls somewhere between attention-getting and just plain weird. They had a cool spinning sculpture above the center circular bar that was nice to look at. Great lighting in here, and they do a fantastic job of isolating you from a buzzing casino floor that is literally just a few feet away."
3,"This is just standard corporate Jack Astor patio for Jack Astors patrons.  This area was recently gentrification . It has really changed for the better.  
There are high stores here and movie theatres  close if you feel like shopping and catching a movie. The movie theatre is not for kids under 19 because the theatre caters to adults . Ie  - regular bar for night life entertainment."
3,"Pretty nice bar area -- its quiet enough to just chill. 

Seemed like the older crowd likes this bar better though so if you're in your 20's, you will feel out of place :P"
3,"My friend drove all the way here from LA to get oxtail at California Hotel's cafe. Having had it 4 nights earlier I really wasn't looking forward to it. But we went and ate. It was not that good. It wasn't salty enough as Saturday, and the carrots, etc., were not cooked long enough. Some of the oxtail were chewy as the meat did not fall off the bone. Not to mention, the fat was not trimmed at all. I stared into a bowl of heart attack. So, instead of ordering a second bowl we decided to go for stop #2...Fremont Casino.

My Hawaiian friend has been telling me about Fremonts competing oxtail for months but I've never dared diverge from the old reliable. It's been close to 10 years since I've eaten at the Fremont's Lanai Express cafe. If you want old Vegas, come here. You will reek of cigarettes like you were the poster child for chain smokers.

The oxtail was not too bad. It's served in a classy Korean ramen plasticky bowl and a separate bowl of rice. The rice is really sticky and clumped together. I didn't bother to try it. The oxtail is cooked with cilantro on top, and shitake mushrooms. Problem is that the mushrooms probably would have enhanced the flavor but it was cold and thrown on it as garnish more so than taste, or else they would have cooked it in the broth. I did get 2 Heinekens for $2 tip as there were slot machines right next to the long line. So, as my friend waited, I played $0.05 poker. I was confused by the screens of 3-6 row poker and how to hold cards. I pressed all over the screen but nothing happened (I assumed it was touch screen, yeah?) So, the beer came before I even lost a nickel. Yup, this college grad got out-smarted by the numerous seniors chained to the machines who figured out how to lose their social security checks while I sipped a beer and stared dumbfounded at the screen. (Just as well, I won't get a SS check when I retire anyway. No need for the early practice.)

Aside from a smallish bowl, plastic, and lacking the magic ingredient of ginger, the broth was tasty and the oxtails were generous. If you don't want to wait until 11pm, this is a viable alternative. It's not a restaurant environment like California so it's weird eating it amongst the hot dog eaters. Almost all of the the tables were sticky and had the previous occupants eating utensils. I was amazed at how many thoughtful people must have came before me who believed in recycling utensils for the next guy to sit down. Thoughtful. Not deserving of their thoughtfulness, we trudged to the Dunkin Donut side and planted our tookishes on there. I looked at other peoples food and it looks like they were pretty good and were large heaping portions. The foot long hot dogs used to be $1.50 for weiner and soda but it's now at $2.99 I think. The old $0.99 shrimp cocktail is still there, minus the celery that used to be underneath it looks like. It used to be served in a plastic wine glass and now it's served in a plain plastic urn looking contraption. Oh how the mighty have fallen, just kidding.

So all in all, it was not a horrible alternative. It was pretty good but it's just too smoky. Personally, I hate smoke and try to avoid them whenever possible. California has been remodeled to look like the Golden Nugget, and doubled their air intakes, but Fremont is still panning for gold in plaid shirts and long johns."
3,"Ugh! Didn't want to write this one but decided I should. I so want this place to be successful that I think it is important to remind them to focus. I went to the restaurant this week to purchase takeout for a lunch meeting. To say I have been DYING to try it is an understatement. First, I can walk to it. Second, I love sushi and poke bowls. Third, tons of my friends had posted the most beautiful Insta posts and positive comments. 

The place the gorgeous. The staff is so enthusiastic. But not through or detailed oriented enough. I wasn't given a ""place card"" when I ordered but didn't realize I needed it. Multiple times staff came over to ask me if I had a question and was ready to order and I told them I had already ordered. They brought me my to go bag and I grabbed some chopsticks and left. After I got back to my home office and was preparing for a meeting I found that they did not include one of the items we ordered. When I call back, The first thing they said is oh you forgot your nachos. I didn't forget it they didn't give them to me. Sorry, I'm just a pet peeve about the customer is always right and you should never say anything to make them feel like they are wrong. Especially when they are not wrong. Theyvasked if I could come back which wasn't possible so then they said they would talk to their manager and I would have a credit next time I came. I will update this review based on the next time I come and if that works out.

After getting off the phone with them, I opened my bowl and started to eat. That's when I realize that they completely ignored the instructions that I gave them and I saw on the computer screen. No Mandarin oranges no red cabbage. See this bowl, they didn't listen. Even though it was clearly printed on the screen that I saw when I ordered.

The reason it is 3 Stars and Not 2 is because the food was great. But they got two strikes on a to go order. You cannot fix that customer experience after they walk out of the door so you have to guarantee the orders are accurate. FYI - I went early so it wasn't super slammed.

I will definitely try again but hope this review makes everyone double triple check their to go bags before leaving"
3,The last 2 times I have been to this location I have requested that the back of my Grand Cherokee be cleaned out.  As in vacuum for dog hair and wipe down the interior of the windows.  For sitting arund for 30 plus minutes I would have expected that.  The car wash broke and the Jeep was driven around just wet.  On the other hand the staff is friendly and I have not had any other issues.  I will probably still go back next time and hope for the back to be cleaned out properly.
3,"It's decent food downtown, but the service is lackluster half the time and the chow mein is either dry or super soggy."
3,"Got to go here for oxtail soup, one of my favorites when I visit. Fast & easy to order  & receive your food. Friendly staff, clean eating areas in an open space and watching people gamble. So enjoyable."
3,"It pains me to have to do this, but after so many disappointing orders where ingredients/customizations are left out, I am removing two stars from the review. My husband and I talk about HiTide often because the potential is all there, but execution is flawed and the portions don't seem to matter when you order a small/regular vs large. It seems like you get more noodles/rice, maybe a few more cubes of fish, but nothing else changes. 

I stopped in yesterday for a takeout order, and the server/cashier at the counter was helpful but I was surprised to see I was being charged more for additions because I haven't had hat previously. One of the additions was excluded from my bowl and that was really aggravating after we had gone through it all twice. The portion was similar to when I've ordered a small/regular, meanwhile I ordered a large. It took about/just under 10 minutes to make the bowl which is fine, but I am generally displeased with the service/execution. I was trying to give HiTide another chance while my husband was away, but it may have sealed the deal for a while. 

I'm sad to have to do this, but I think I'm going to give HiTide a break and try some other places in the area. I'd like to know that what I'm ordering is going to actually be in my bowl, and I'd like to know up front how many additions or substitutions I can have before being charged for them. The consistency is not there, and in a market where more and more poke places are popping up, consistency will be more necessary than ever."
3,"I usually come here for their barrel aged beers.  The place is mediocre at best.  It is in a questionable area.  The bar is a total dive, not a place you go for comfort.  Their regular everyday beers aren't really very good.  I go because once a year that one beer they release is amazing.  Barrel age some stouts again..... Throw in some cinnamon"
3,Not the place to host your wedding but as a place to get late night food to soak up cocktails this fits the bill. Truthfully if you are picky not the place for you but not many casino cafes open w a full menu late night anymore.
3,Cheap and good food. Had the chili dog this time. What a deal $3.99 for a huge chili dog. Tasted pretty good too. They also have Chinese food here.
3,"I was really excited to stay at the Metropolitan At The 9 since I travel to Cleveland on a regular basis and have grown tired of the other Marriott options downtown.  This is a beautiful property and definitely reminds me of boutique hotels in New York or Chicago.  That said, I don't think this is the hotel for me.  Here is why:

1.  There are two bars in the hotel.  One off the lobby and a smaller on the 2nd floor overlooking the lobby.  I am a large person, measuring in at 6'5 and 260 lbs.  I went downstairs to have a drink and order dinner at the bar.   I am serious, I was unable to sit in the chair at the bar since my waste was wider than the space between the arms on the chair.   If you want to keep overweight people away, make the seats so you can't get you butt between the narrow arms - mission accomplished Metro!!  They are the same chairs at both bars so I went back to my room, angry and embarrassed.  This has NEVER happened to me in any other place, ever.

2.  Once in my room I decided to order room service since I was unable to eat downstairs.  It was at this point I realized there was not a desk in the room, only a coffee table.  I had to pay a premium for room service and had to eat a $50+ sea bass with the plate on my lap. 

3.  No desk makes it almost impossible for me to work while in the room.

There are many positives about the hotel as well:

1.  The staff is friendly, attentive and competent.  Exceptional service.
2.  The rooms are state of the art.  Plenty of outlets, great HD TV's, and free wifi.
3.  As a Platinum Marriott member, I was provided an upgrade to a ""King Suite"" at no additional charge - much appreciated!!

Overall, this may be the perfect hotel for some but for me, I don't think I can come back."
3,"Nice location, comfortable seating, if you like Hooka they have you covered.  My biggest issue is the Inconstancy of quality of drinks with the different bartenders.  Ordered a lemon drop when we first got in.  Sipped on it for 35 min.  Shortly after finishing I ordered another.  Second was less alcohol and not well made.  Older Male bartender acted like he gave it to me for a better price than my other one.  Not impressed when the drink is weak.  Not impressed with him.  I get it's Vegas but consistency is important"
3,"3.5 stars.

Every 30 minutes or so, a bass-thumpin', beat-heavy, pop-aliscious tune starts to play in dark and drapey Centrifuge, and you know it's time.  Time for the bar tenders to bust a move.

The bar maids and lads have a choreographed routine they dance.  On the bar top.  Like Coyote Ugly, only with gay guys -- and they're way more into it than the ladies.  Always the same song, always the same routine, but the sheer amusement never wears off.  It's funny -- ha ha funny -- every. time.  For entertainment value, you can't beat Centrifuge.

Yeah, it's hella expensive.  It's a casino bar.  But bottle service starts at $180, which comes with any and all mixers you want.  It also means you get a private booth.  With 14 of us, this was actually the most economical way we got our drink on in Sin City."
3,"Was on vacation for a high school reunion and booked through Vacations Hawaii, which provides you with a meal voucher for breakfast, lunch, dinner and speciality items. 

For lunch the one time we ate there (even though we stayed at the Fremont), I had their Teri Beef plate listed for $5.99 (which included what looked like a 20 oz drink cup), while my brother had the $8 Oxtail Soup. Anyway, with my Vacations Hawaii meal voucher, my meal and drink was free and his was only $8 for the Oxtail Soup (no drink included for him).  

Something about the mainland that has their own interpretation of teri-beef, and for a local Hawaii resident, this AIN'T teri-beef (local Hawaii style)!  It's not grilled, and has like a  sweet teriyaki sauce just placed on top of the cooked beef (like it's Yoshida's teriyaki dressing) . Hawaii's teri beef is normally marinated in shoyu with ginger and garlic and then doused with the marinade while being grilled. 

Funny, I thought because Fremont Hotel is owned by the Boyd's whose son attended Lincoln Elementary, Class of 1940 (so there is the Hawaii connection), they'd try to make all their dishes taste like what you'd find in Hawaii...at least the Oxtail Soup is (that's a winner)...heard that from other classmates too."
3,"the wait staff is usually friendly, the food isn't bad, but i don't like: the stupid sexist outfits the female staff wear, and the horrifically loud music, which everybody is shouting over to hear the person next to them=even louder."
3,"Want a huge hoagie? Triangle bar is the place to go.  I decided to take a drive and try a place that I know has a legacy of being a Pittsburgh hoagie place to try.  

Beer:  I know that they have a bar, but taking my meal as takeout, I did not drink.

Food:  I got the Super Battleship which was 2+ feet of happiness.  The take out bag had to weigh five pounds of meat cheese and toppings.  The bread of the hoagie was fresh and had many different meats (even though I do not know exactly what they were) was perfect on the sandwich.  Overall, the hoagie hit the spot but being the first time going here, I ordered it with everything, not knowing what everything was.  The one item I would pass on would be getting it with Mayo.  It was overwhelming.  

Pros:  They have plenty of different types of hoagies to get and would be perfect for big parties.

Cons:  Not the cleanest place in the world and the building shows its age and personality, so it stays true to its roots.  The line to order was long, but that highlights the demand for the hoagie.      

Conclusion:  Will revisit in the future but going no mayo the second time around."
3,"I thought it was fair. Went to visit them while they were at Whole Foods.  I had the Vegi Jambalaya bowl which actually comes in a cardboard carton. Has rice, beans, cheese, cabbages and some peppers.  It was OK, but I'd never wait 30 minutes in line for it again.  

So its put in this cardboard box, then the red and white checkorboard paper is put in, then the rice, beans, cabbage, etc.  The problem with this is the paper is not designed to be under juicy foods like beans, so by the time I got down to the bottom the paper was disintegrating into my food. Not very  appetizing.  They might want to rethink putting the paper in their bowls.  Anyway, wouldn't pay $8 for this again, and likely won't visit them again either."
3,"Late night heavy snack! hahah.
Had the peppercorn steak poutine, good flavor with a bit of kick from the peppercorn.
Person in front of my had the Notorious P.I.G. and it  looked soooo good! I will get that next time! :)

My fries were crispy, and cheese melty and the ratios were all good."
3,"So we come here about once a year with our running group for Wednesdays AYCE wings (obviously I do not partake lol) and the venue is great for a large group because it's huge. It does get extremely busy on Wednesdays due to the special however. I think this causes a little issue with the staff, simply because they're probably a bit overwhelmed. I felt that this year they managed us a bit better than before, so kudos for that. It just takes a long time to get the first set of wings and food for everyone. They do a good job of separating the bills which entails good organization skill. 
The reason I have to give a 3 star is because the food for veggies is so sub-par. The cactus cut chips were awesome and I was happy to see the menu changed and added a lot more options for vegetarians. But the veggie burger was a frozen patty, pretty gross, just the Dr Pepper toppings (minus the bacon) saved it. Everyone always seems to really like their wings though and likely that is the reason you're going! So this is more of a forewarning for the vegetarians."
3,"Nice atmosphere, but nothing to write home about here... it's a small bar that's separated from the rest of the casino.  Sometimes you need that.  Good staff and good selection, though."
3,"I love bao , haven't had it in a long time and I haven't been to this location before so I was pretty excited to go. 

Price Range (Not including tax): $4-$7 per item. 

Food Quality (Taste, Serving Size, Menu) - 3.5/5
I'll admit I think I overhyped myself for this which is probably why it didn't meet my expectations. I got the Pork Belly Bao and the Fried Chicken Bao. I thought the food was good, It just didn't blow my mind. I usually love pork belly, so I was a bit disappointed by this one. I didn't think it had a lot of flavour, a spicer sauce would have helped. The fried chicken was pretty good, pretty crispy, I should have ordered a spicier sauce for this one as well. The quality of the bao was amazing, really soft.  The vegetables were fresh. Just as you expect with bao, they aren't overly big. The meat to bao ratio was pretty good. I had 3 since I was pretty hungry and it filled me up quite well. 

Atmosphere - 3/5
It had a burger place look which I thought was good. They have some seating, since it is more of a quick meal. If you're going with a large group like 5+, It might be hard if it's busy time. Parking is a bit tough since they don't have their own lot. I'd recommend parking on a side street near by as some of them are free. 

Serivce - N/A
You pay at the counter and picked up the food yourself so there really isn't much service involved. That being said, the cashier was nice and courteous. Wait times for food can vary, we had to wait about 5-10 mins but there were a lot of orders in front of us. I could see it taking less when it's not busy. We went around prime dinner time. 

Would I go there again?
I do want to go there again to try the spicier options to see if it gives more flavour and to try the Kimchi Fries; I regret not getting them last time."
3,"Pizza was good - a bit skimpy on the sausage.  Garlic Bread was less than good (dry and burnt).  Pasta meal (Spagehtti) was ok, nothing great but good.  Overall, I will try again but next time with no garlic bread and thin crust pizza."
3,"I have mixed feelings about North Park Lounge (NPL).

So far my guy and I have come here twice, once for a Friday evening dinner in February and once for a Tuesday evening dinner back in March.  On both occasions my burger and sweet potato fries were solid, but other aspects of this place have left me feeling as though NPL isn't quite the place for me.

NPL was packed during our Friday night experience, and I don't doubt that's the case most Friday nights.  The wait wasn't so bad, though standing around near the bathrooms and claw machine wasn't an ideal waiting scenario.  During our wait we got a good look at the clientele situation, which is basically everyone--college kids looking to let loose, middle-agers equally letting loose, families, couples.  I noticed at least 2 toddlers in attendance, which was odd to me being that NPL seems to be just as focused on the bar/lounge aspect of the establishment as it is on the food and that most customers appeared to be enjoying more than a couple adult beverages.  Anyway, NPL seems to be a place where everyone is welcome.

During that first dinner Husband's fish sandwich was terrible--very bready with just a thin, dry fish fillet.  A shame for a region that boasts some pretty amazing big fried fish sandwiches.  (In case you're interested, I think the best fish sandwich is at no-frills Harry's Place off Route 51, about 30 minutes away.)  My burger, on the other hand, was solid.  It was cooked close to the medium-rare I had specified, and the seasoning was in-your-face but not totally overwhelming.  The sweet potato fries, which I order often at various establishments, were very good.  The White Russian I had with my dinner was the worst I've ever had.  More on NPL's White Russian in the next paragraph.

During our second dinner at NPL we kept if safe and ordered burgers.  Our waitress that day wasn't particularly pleasant, but because she was chatty I did take the opportunity to ask her about the White Russian before ordering one.  She explained that at the bar the beverage gun has a button specifically for White Russians.  In other words, the bartender pushes a button and White Russian spurts into the glass, no mixing necessary.  Needless to say my Tuesday night White Russian was just as bad as the Friday night White Russian.  Funny how some bars employ ""mixologists"" who are so into preparing pricey handcrafted cocktails with a hundred ingredients, and other bars have guns that not only measure the alcohol but that actually go a step further and mix the drink.  The dichotomy of bartending!  I prefer a happy middle ground.

I like that I can come here for a decent burger; however, I can't currently justify giving North Park Lounge more than 3 stars."
3,"The service is ok but I didn't like the food, I think the mix of meat with the raw veggies is not for me. I had the pulled pork steambao"
3,Never seen so many TVs in my whole my life. I felt like Neo in the Matrix. The wings are overrated but this place is still pretty cool to go to for sporting events and to play pool.
3,"At times we have had great pizza but when they are busy the pizza has less toppings and not so great. Service could be better and I do tip. Now a charge for dressing, they use to provide. I have learned not to tip since service has changed."
3,"After my review, I feel I need to redo/update it. It's always easier to be negative than positive, and I think I was initially too negative.

I didn't really like the sales pitch for a new windshield, though he may have been a nice guy I didn't appreciate it.

For what I paid, the detail($49.99) could have been better.

The wash($12) itself was just average.

I'll probably give this place another shot some time in the distant future."
3,I have never been a big fan of Chinese food..but i have to say this wasn't bad...the fried rice was great and my sweet and sour shrimp was good....the crab Rangoon ehhh not so great.... IF i have a craving for Chinese again i will try again
3,"I want to love lazy daisy. There coffee is good, their food is good. But I find the food portions to be too small. The ""big bean burrito"" is not big. In fact it feel more like an appetizer than a big burrito. It's tasty. But I'm still hungry. Also I wish they would scramble eggs for their breakfast sandwiches. 
But the atmosphere is great. And everyone is always very nice!"
3,"We ordered delivery and got the Family Dinner B with shrimp in lobster sauce, pepper beef, bbq pork fried rice, steamed rice and it came with 2 egg rolls, 2 crab rangoons, 2 fried shrimp and wonton soup for $26.95 which I thought was a good deal. The food was good, not excellent. Not a lot of shrimp in the shrimp & lobster sauce, mostly on top rather than mixed in. The crab rangoons were very good and we received 4 free. My only major complaint would be that the wonton soup has entirely too much cabbage in it. I would say half of the container was just chunks of cabbage. Other than that delivery was relatively quick and it was good enough to order from again."
3,"Just ok. Nothing amazing. Although, their sandwich looked great. (But never tried one)
It has wifi but it didn't work last time.
It seems like it's local mom's hot spot, though.
Toddlers to teenage kids come with their moms and friends.
Nothing is wrong with it. Just don't expect it to be quite. lol
If you looking for some place to bring your kids, you will like it.
They have little toy train at the back. Super cute!"
3,"I probably can eat a whole lb of Devil's Inferno and still smile with my burning lips. 

Aside from Hot and Deathly Spicy wings, there are more to Wacky Wings than wings. A good place to watch a hockey game with your friends as there are so many big screen TVs all around and you won't miss those special moment!

There are also an adult ""play area"" if you want to shoot some pool or play some games.

And if you are really into Wings, of course don't miss the AYCE Wednesday $15.99. But the wait for a table can be painfully long and the wait for additional wings can take forever....100+ flavours to choose from, that's quite impressive! 

Wacky Wings is A-OK place to hang out with your friends. I don't mind going back when I am in the area!"
3,"Good pizza & hot wings, haven't really had nothing else but that so far. Lunch special deals are the best."
3,"My Wife & I stepped into the Big Cheese for a quick meal while between errands. Both being Vegans, we were pleased to see the door menu advertised Vegan options. We both opted for the traditional poutine, vegan style. The poutines were ready quick, and were tasty. We were in & out in no time, and would likely come back. Now I'm no poutine connoisseur - I understand there's a specific true Quebec way to make this speciality, but I have no real idea how close these are to what some consider a true poutine, but to a layman, it was a fine meal. The Pros were the kind staff, the quick meal, the fact that they can do a vegan option, and that is was ready quick & was tasty. The decor was also decent. The cons were that the place was quite small & cramped, and while the vegan options were there, I believe it cost me an extra $1.50 for the vegan cheese - and by no means am I against charging extra for a speciality product with a short shelf life, but it meant that one small vegan poutine came to over $7.00. Overall though, we had a good experience."
3,"The chef and owner greets you warmly when you walk in the door.  We went in without reservations on a Saturday night- not because we didn't call ahead, but because they told us that they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more.  (we were 2 people)

We stood in line, without really any greeting - no one telling us how long it would be, or acknowledging our presence (besides the warm greeting from the chef).  A group of 4 walked in behind us -- ""How many?"" one of the servers asked them.  ""4,"" they say, and then,lo and behold, 2 minutes later, they get sat -- as they passed out one of the customers said, ""Don't be mad, we had a reservation --""  but I thought they only take resos for 6 or more people?  And then why did they ask you ""how many"" and not for your name?  Probably regulars, and there's nothing I hate more than money favouritism.  I didn't realize regulars' money was worth more than mine.

One we were seated, the ignoring continued throughout the night -- glasses cleared but never asked if we wanted anything else to drink (maybe that's why new customers don't seem worth it money wise - we don't get a chance to spend any money!), never asking if everything was ok -- we had to flag people down whenever we wanted to order something.  The space is cramped, almost seems romantic until the baby at the next table starts screaming.

So how did this place manage 3 stars?  Well priced, and the food really was good.  The service and the snobby atmosphere may go hand in hand with the neighbourhood, but they should watch Pretty Woman again for a lesson in how to treat a customer that, for all you know, eats out a lot and spends a lot of money doing it."
3,"Walked past this place a lot and never really had a hankering for poutine. So I waited until the right day for the salty fatty treat.

The environment was pretty cool I'll admit and there were a handful of people dining inside. Didn't have a single problem with the customer service, which is a huge thing for me. And the music was great. I went with the Montreal Smoked Meat. I took note of the guy making poutine in the back but found it too awkward to watch after a while so I just kind of stared at the wall which had interesting details until my food was ready.

The poutine came with a very lovely grainy mustard and a pickle. The Meat was all right, and there was a lot. What I didn't expect based on the name, was that there would be more meat then cheese curds. I'm not sure if they all melted or what but they were hardly in there. I guess it's expensive to have ""authentic cheese curds"" in your poutine in Calgary. Another thing I noticed was that the gravy was liquid, which I did not like at all and that without the mustard I would not have enjoyed my food.  I didn't mind that some of my fries were really soft, and some were crunchy. 

Oh and the ""big"" cheese didn't have that squeak that curd connoisseur's crave. 

Overall I was satisfied, but I went into the place with no expectations, other then a sign that constantly reminded me about where I can get some poutine."
3,"Heading out for the night and want to get a drink before the craziness begins?  Caramel is a decent choice.  It's definitely nothing to write home about, but it made me happy for one reason;  It was my 3rd night of madness and my priorities were simple....I wanted a seat.  

We walked in after dinner and meeting up with a few other girls and immediately were approached by a cocktail waitress and told we could sit at one of their reserved tables.  That was music to my ears (and my tired feet!).  It's a small lounge and the crowd was random, if anything.  Not anywhere worth spending more than 30 minutes but  the music was decent and you can get some really good infused vodka and if you're lucky, a seat."
3,"While visiting Las Vegas we decided to try the Edge Steakhouse, the atmosphere was very nice, the service was great however the food was not. We have no issue paying top dollar for a good steak dinner. But it was not what we were expecting. First off they charge separately for everything which is ok. But I ordered a 7 oz filet and my husband ordered a 10 oz filet. My filet was over cooked on the outside so by the time I cut it all off to get to the tender center I had approx 4 oz of good meat left. We paid $190 (with tip) for 2 steaks 2 potato and 1 dinner salad. The best part of the meal was the dinner salad it was wonderful."
3,"This place is alright....I personally enjoy the North Park Clubhouse better, but as a whole the menu is standard bar food fare with a few dinner options available.   I have always received good service though which makes up for the middle of the road dining food options."
3,"Went in specifically for the 5.99 taco deal advertised online.  Went in and they would not honor it...said it was wrong and deal was now 6.99.  I pulled up ""their"" website and showed it to them...still, no remedy.  The food was good and price was decent, but I think they should have honored the price advertised and change it later.  That would have been good customer service.  Other than that, no other major complaints.  I was though, reminded that they were closing in half an hour when I told them I would be dining in."
3,"A waffle, eggs and hashbrowns to go was not such a good idea.  Never eat waffles to go as they soggy.  I have to admit it wasn't bad but I'd rather eat my waffles at the restaurant next time to enjoy them crispier. :)"
3,"So once again this would be part of the top five lunch spots that I drive to weekly as the ""lunch b***h"" for work. I do like that every time I go in, I am greeted by the same shy girl at the front who basically knows my whole order w/o second glance. I have only tried a few things here, but everything I have tried has been pretty darn good. My bosses, and I particularly, enjoy the chicken salad. Sadly they used to have a $3.99 special, but now it is back to the regular 6-7 bucks. They have a really great achiote dressing and the salads are pretty big. But I have to say I have a new favorite with the shredded beef burro. Classically simple, chunks of beef with beans and cheese. Whatever they marinate their meat is awesome, and I am generally not a meat fan. Long story short, skip the Fili B's on every corner, and venture into the strip mall. Can't beat the $1.99 margaritas either!"
3,"Very nice and clean! The fact that they stay open till 11 PM is great as we all know that most places close at 6-7ish PM. The top picture with a very defined coffin shape is the reference picture I wanted. The bottom picture is what I got. I asked for matte for an upcharge of $5, and my nails are still shiny. If you want a true matte, the gentleman who did my nails apologized as they do not have a ""true matte"". I was still charged for the matte service. I wanted a true coffin shape and I got this round ballerina shape, I still got charged the fee for coffin shape. I wanted a similar rhinestone pattern displayed on the middle finger from the top picture and I got shifted rhinestones - if you are looking for rhinestone service, maybe bring your own... they only have two styles to chose from - small as seen on my middle finger, and a large gold one. Hope this helped someone! Thank you!"
3,"Just went to the Big Cheese for a post-drinking snack (yes, on a Monday).
The man wanted the Philly Cheese Steak poutine so we shared a large.   Then my eyes got a glimpse of their large jar of pickles!   $1 for a pickle..  Oh I'm doin' it!

The pickle was great, not as crunchy as I'd like, but its hard to find a large yummy pickle anywhere in the city.

The poutine itself was interesting - the beef was overcooked/dry, but the cheese and red peppers were delicious.   It was a large portion for 2, and didn't finish it.

The staff was great, and it had nice decor.   Overall I enjoyed it, likely won't go back unless I have a pickle craving."
3,"Great tasting good made with high quality ingredients served up in small, but overpriced, portions in a dimly lit casual atmosphere by rushed, but friendly, waiters."
3,"The waffles and food were very delicious and I was impressed with the pricing. The only reason why I am giving three stars is because of the service from our waitress. Bre looked like she didn't want to be there and not once did she smile. I guess she is not a people person per say, and to me, customer service and a smile goes a very long way!"
3,Good selection of beer. Not much in the way of food. Didn't like that bartender kept our change without asking and our free brownie for checking in on Yelp (which we took home to eat) was very dry but frosting was good.
3,"The food here is pretty good, but on certain days the food is bland - it all depends.
I come here when there are certain foods that we want to have. 
Altogether, this place is always pack when I drive by and when I do come here, the wait is usually 5 minutes. This a great place to take people that do not live in Pittsburgh so they can have that ""Pittsburgh hospitality"" style meal. :-)"
3,"Cool place but there was one snobby blonde bartender who was totally just flat out ignoring the people next to us.  We decided to order for them because she would just not even acknowledge them.  I actually called her out on it and she gave me attitude, too bad she has such a terrible life that she has to let it show at work.  Other than that, the music is great, ambience is fun but laid back.  Small place but it's not too packed."
3,This is a vast improvement from when I used to come here before I moved to Tampa. The menu has better items and a variety. One thing is in Pittsburgh you always get fries on a dinner salad! That was something unique to here. The restaurant was very cold inside. There was 10 of us and they automatically added gratuity but the severs were still very attentive. I got a burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was good but the fries were not great they tasted like regular fries that were colored Orange...Very bland. They have huge fish sandwiches and my uncle ordered pizza. It looked lack luster as well. Like a kids pizza not cheesy at all. It's a good place to come for familiar food. Nothing special but still good. It was very busy and it's one of those restaurants everyone congregates at in the suburbs on a Friday night because there is nothing else to do. By the way the dessert options suck. We would have ordered one but they were weird. Like who doesn't have a brownie with ice cream...cheesecake...etc they had apple tart and some French thing trying to be like an upscale restaurant lol um no.
3,"I've stayed in a lot of embassy suites hotels but this one was by far the worst. I came here for the Panthers game, and got a suite for 4 people. Two people had to sleep on the pull out couch and it was so uncomfortable. For the price you pay, it should be better quality. And the first night we stayed, there was a holiday party going on in the lobby until 2 am! They have an 11 pm cutoff but no one stopped them and you could here EVERYTHiNG! There are much better places to stay in charlotte don't waste your time or money!"
3,"Always friendly staff and service. Great price and consistent food. Remember, this is a diner with diner food. With that said the food is consistent and decent price. Although the   portions are small there's nothing like getting breakfast 24hrs and 8 different types of hashbrowns!"
3,"If you think your mother or Aunts are on a mid-life crisis, you'll probably find them here at Caramel Bar & Lounge.  Unless it was just a convention for wrinkled ladies dressed in young b-girl clothing.  Yes, I'm mean but if I ever get to that age and out trying to re-live my 20's, please shoot me.  

I'm sure it isn't like this all the time and maybe it was just last night but I wasn't feeling this at all.  I think it's coz I imagined my mom and her sisters there dressed as such and it didn't sit well with me.  The music was good and there are some seats for people who decide not to get VIP bottle service.  It wasn't hard to get alcohol since there weren't many people there.  I'm just glad it wasn't crowded.  

Best part was there was no cover charge.  Well, it's a great spot if you want to take your mom and your Aunts to a lounge.  :)"
3,"It's your basic buffet, nothing special, but nothing particularly bad either. Exceedingly so-so."
3,"Pizza was a little blah from how it used to be back in the day.  

This place was crowded but the servers were friendly.  Got two slices to go and it could have been better.  I was on a time crunch.   Next time I'm in Arizona, I'll make it a point to dine in and hopefully the pizza will be more fresh and tasty."
3,"Nice respite from the slots.

Caramel is located on the casino floor of the Bellagio, but walled off from the suckers losing all their money.  The size is pretty good.  There's a bar in the middle and a larger bar in the back.  Dimly lit place and a DJ mixes the sounds of the day.  I can't speak to prices as I got my couple of beers for free.  I'd imagine it's similar to the insane Vegas pricing for alcohol, especially inside a major strip casino.  As a local, I don't know if I would seek this place out just to get a drink, because it's easier to go somewhere off the strip.  But if you have friends in town, or want to do something fun but chill on a weekend, go for it."
3,"Stopped into Caramel at 7pm and had a nice enough couple of drinks. Its small, very small so when I went past later that night I can only imagine how different it was. A pretty cool place for a cocktail or two before you head out for the evening."
3,"My friends and family rave about this place, but I am not a big fan at all. Every time I've gotten a sub, the bread is dry and crumbly (I like my bread to be fresh), and their toppings are limited. I do support small business tho, so if I'm hungry and in the swissvale/Rankin/Braddock area, I'll pick up one to share. But otherwise, I'd rather opt for a sandwich in regent square or on the waterfront."
3,Came here for a free drink as promised by the club promoter for The Bank.  The place is pretty small with no dance floor but good for hanging out.  The shots took awhile and were just ok but hey they were free.  Can't really complain about free drinks!
3,"As I mentioned in a previous review, I'm generally not a big fan of sandwiches but sometimes I get hungry and just want a quick fix without going through the whole kit and caboodle of getting a knife and fork involved.

I've heard/read good things about Banh Mi Boys so I popped in. Never been. So I asked the cashier which sandwiches are popular. She said the 5 Spice Pork Belly and the Kalbi Beef . So I ordered a pork belly sandwich and a Braised Beef steamed bao.

I don't really know what the big deal is about these sandwiches. Maybe it's just that I'm a sandwich hater at heart.

The beef bao was decent but neither really wowed me.

If I get hungry while walking by a Banh Mi Boys location again, maybe I'll give the Kalbi Beef sandwich a go. Or maybe I'd be better off just looking for a good pho spot."
3,"Stopped in and had a battle ship,fresh bread and good eats.it's definitely worth a return visit."
3,"Went there on a double date. Nice neighborhood bar and grill. Food was mediocre - not special about it. Garlic rolls were fantastic. My wife got a ruben which was standard, kinda dried out though. They have free popcorn which comes is different. I got the meatloaf which was good but obviously not healthy at all. Overall, we will probably go back in the future."
3,"Bottles are marked up to the extreme, but what do you expect (it's Vegas)? Got the 2-for-1 deal from one of the promoters and the drinks were phenomenal. No dancefloor, but no biggy. There were only a couple of groups when we went on a Sunday night. Bartender was nice and music was good. Would come back again."
3,"This place is not like the advertised pictures. The rooms have older furniture, slow wifi, and issues with the AC. Also the space is very odd within the rooms as it looks unplanned and space is wasted. I've never stayed in a hotel with no plugs in your room. Lastly the breakfast was terrible. Even if it's free."
3,"I get that the vibe is to feel like your buddy opened up a beer and wine garden in their garage but it was lacking a bit for me :(  Despite numerous choices on beer and wine there was a VERY limited food menu. Grilled cheese sandwiches and a meat and cheese board.  THAT'S IT.  Next downfall, no ice in the whole restaurant therefore, water was not very cold.  Not good on a 108 degree day.  Wine and beer were good and many choices, but again the temperature of the wine was not very cold.  Phoenix summers deserve ice."
3,"Atmosphere
It's a short walk from the mall, which makes it so convenient! Great spot to grab food and eat in or to go. 

Food
I wasn't too amazed by Banh Mi Boys, as all the rave about this spot made me expect a lot more. We ordered a pulled pork banhmi, and a braised beef bao. They put a large portion of meat inside, which I do appreciate, but I found them both to be extremely dry. My friend ordered a five spice pork belly bao, and she was obsessed with the flavor and was saying we should've gotten a five spice pork belly banh mi instead, but lesson learned for next time!"
3,Decent. Had a breakfast burrito. Not the most flavorful but it was a good price and was filling. Will have to check it out again. Good atmosphere!
3,"Definitely not the right place if you don't want to be surrounded by kids. The place gets loud and a little chaotic on Saturday mornings when the local families come for brunch.

Food is on the pricy-ish side because everything is organic/free range/locally sourced. If you're looking for big portions, you've come to the wrong place.

That being said, the food is good. It's nothing special or creative, but it's done well. I had the veggie rise and the biscuit was very tasty and buttery. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with any sides. My brunch companion had the burrito and said it was good, yet too small. It came with a side of salad which looked a bit sad (a bit of baby spinach with dressing).

Not sure if I will go back to be honest. I think I might be the wrong customer for this place. I see brunch as a feast that fills me up for most of the day and this place fails to do that. Well, that is unless you're willing to dish out more money and order more than one item to make sure you don't walk out hungry."
3,"Definitely a place for take-out rather than dine-in, Chico's is not a chain as at least once recent reviewer has stated.  It is family-owned and non-franchise.  I highly recommend ordering the following:  ranchero-style carne asada burrito fixed enchilada-style.  It's deliciously saucy, not on the menu, and the only thing I'm interested in at Chico's.  It should make your day (or at least your lunch).  One last piece of advice:  Unless your in a pinch, don't bother with the breakfast burritos."
3,"While your first thought may not be food when you hear Embassy Suites, it ought to be at least your second, especially if you have kids, and even more so if you have kids who can't agree on what they want to eat.

We have one who likes the big breakfast.  Eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, biscuits, everything he can get his hands on.  Then we have one who likes the not-so-big breakfast, which consists of cereals, breads, fruits and the like.  Note that this doesn't mean he doesn't eat a lot of it.  Just that it's not called the big breakfast in our family.

So the Embassy Suites holds a special place in our hearts when it comes to food, because both kids are happy when it comes to breakfast.  And they can go back again and again.  Will it win any awards?  Probably not.  But it just fills a need, and it does so really well.  Sometimes, that's all you need."
3,"I came here with a group of friends for summerlicious. The inside of the restaurant is a lot nicer than the outside so fret not if you think the exterior is chintzy. The start of the dinner was good with my veal meatball appetizer, which was easily the best dish of the night. It was juicy, perfectly flavoured and just delicious. Unfortunately the rest of the meal made me wonder if I just don't get Italian. The next dish was the veal lasagna, which was also good but very salty. I was downing that water to settle my taste buds. Next up the fried cauliflower, which sounded great on paper, was very bland. I had to pour the parmesan cheese on it to add some flavour. Lastly for dessert I picked the lemon tart, which had a veeeery lemony filling and a stragenly hard crust. Honestly, if it werne't for the veal meatball I'd rate this place a 2/5 but it's kind of unfair I guess because summerlicious isn't always representative of a restaurant's true quality."
3,"This is a decent Chinese buffet. I tried the steamed rice (nice & fluffy, not dry), orange chicken (not bad, very sweet), teriyaki chicken skewer (pretty good), won ton soup (fine), french fries (yummy when fresh), green beans (good seasoning), spring roll (meh), lo mein (okay), Chinese donuts (love them), apple pie (delicious!), and fruit (good). Enjoyed our lunch overall. I normally like to get the Mongolian BBQ as well, but I didn't this time. I am always amazed to see how much food people pile onto one plate. It's a buffet... you can go back! Service was good with regard to refills and tables being wiped promptly. China City is much cleaner than Lin's... that place is dirty. After we left, I realized we forgot to use our 15% off coupon. D'oh!"
3,"3.5 Stars.

A not so hidden place in Little India is what and where Lazy Daisy's is. It is a nice spot in a great location as there aren't many other coffee shops around this area.

Upon entrance I was struck with brightness. This place is outfitted with a good decor; exposed brick always adds such a nice touch without doing anything! The artwork and music is pretty standard for a coffee shop these days.

There is A LOT of choice in this place. They have good menu options and are striving to be local and ethical (now, really a dime a dozen). The coffee is actually a little disappointing. I ordered a macchiato and was not impressed by the presentation of it. The taste, average. The roaster they use is Pilot Roaster coffee and I expected the best. It didn't deliver to expectations.

One dynamic plus is the staff. They are having fun while working. It's always nice to have things prepared for me when people are in good moods. This may be something people will miss, but it's a dynamic plus.

All in all they seem to be doing well and don't have much competition this far east.

That's it."
3,"The fish sandwiches at the North Park Lounge are legendary.  The fish is huge, and it's cooked perfectly.  I never order anything else here, but then why would I need to?  It's the place to go for fish sandwiches. The service is excellent, and the fish sandwiches come to your table in just a few minutes.  I like sitting out on the patio.  They have a nice fireplace there, and it's quite cosy."
3,After reading the reviews for this place me and my roommate decided to stop by for lunch. The lunch specials are priced very nicely (6 bucks) and the portions are filling. The service was choppy but the woman had her hands full with her baby girl. I would come back.
3,"This place defiantly gave me the poutine fill I was looking for. When would couldn't finish it even better :) I had the pigasus which is bacon, shredded chicken, peas, onions, cheese curds and gravy! Deliciousness except the onions far too sweet! Kev had the donair poutine again great size but the onions put him off they were way to sweet. Will defiantly go again to try something else though."
3,Cute little spot. Always a bit crazy and service can be slow.
3,"I definitely liked the feel of the big Cheese with their limited seating take out style setup, defaced old photos and folk tunes.  However after being initially blown away by the menu of 20 different poutines, I was left alittle underwhelmed by a serving of their Notorious P.I.G.....I mean it had everything about food that I love (aka greasiness and meat) but their seemed to be something missing as well as the flavours kind of clashed.

But that being said,  that was just one item and with 19 other poutines on the menu I must make a return visit...for now the 3 stars are pending."
3,"I have to start out by saying this hotel is very nice, the rooms were nice, location was awesome but....Yes there is a but, the Breakfast Buffy is Terribly handled and you have this huge line only to find out I waited in line for pancakes and did not have too, could have slithered up and asked for them instead of waiting in the omlet lines for 20 mins and the wife ordered an omlet and it was wrong.

LAME LAME LAME setup.

Other than that the Front Desk to the Room were very good.."
3,"Its a hit or miss here. There's days you can go and have an amazing poutine, hot, toppings are awesome, great meal. Other times, it's just slop that a pig could eat that's barely hot. The staff are not friendly, it's just a place to grab a poutine and leave because the staff make you feel so uncomfortable. The menu does have a great selection of different poutines."
3,"I don't normally go for wings but my boyfriend loves this stuff ! WINGS, GAMES ON THE TV, BEERS, LOUD NESS!! YAY ! lol, I was a tad hesitant to go but once I got there I was pleased with the food, it was good, you get what you pay for, the staff was alright, we had a big party but no one came to check up on us which was odd to me, because we needed a lot of refills and napkins, someone only came when we had to send someone to get a server for our bill. I do not like the décor, very farm-y. but I guess that's what you get when you go to a wings place / sports bar / man cave theme place. I liked the atmosphere, made me feel pumped up even though I don't watch any sports haha, I would come back here again but I would not recommend it to anyone.

service = 0/5
food = 3/5
cleanliness = 4/5
atmosphere=5/5"
3,"Been here a few times. I usually get the tacos, (hey it's in the name), but this last time I got taquitos. They pretty good, albeit small. I also asked for no onions or tomatoes in the gauc, and they came with it anyway, but whatever."
3,"Being from out-of-town we spent a lot of time searching for the best poutine in Calgary and were largely disappointed. The Big Cheese continually showed on lists so we drove downtown to taste the fare. We quickly learned that this place is a strong average. It's nowhere near the best poutine you've had (unless you've never left Calgary) and way better than the worst. Service is average, too. The girl at the counter was emotionless. Almost mute. 

Who cares? We came for the food, right? Before coming, ask yourself a question. Have you been drinking or not? If you've been enjoying the scene on the Red Mile, you'll probably say this place is awesome. It's a great late night option for those hitting up the bar scene. Meanwhile, if you're sober and simply looking for a bite there far better choices on the strip. 

Fortunately, the portions are fair and is the amount of toppings you'll find on the fries. The fresh cut fries can be paired with an endless amount of toppings, and enough curd chunks to make you full in a few bites. In short, if you are in search of poutine this spot will suit you well."
3,"My go-to Gringo-Mex place on the way into work.

This stems from lazy, and nothing more. The places I'd prefer are either out of the way, take too long for spur-of-the-moment food, or are located in a manner making it inconvenient to get directly to work.

That said, it's easy to get in and out of when I am headed west on McDowell.
The prices are fair, the portions are large and the food is fresh. From time to time, it's even flavorful!

Would I rank this among the best Mexican food in town? Not a chance!
Would I rank this place among the best Gringo-Mex places in town?  Nope.
Is it clean and fast and completely serviceable to eat at my desk? You bet!"
3,"My husband and I went to dinner at NPL on a Thursday evening, and it was unbelievably packed! Little did we know that their special was ""Taco Thursday"" with additional Mexican dishes on the menu. Also, there was as Steelers preseason game on that will help draw a crowd. 

To my surprise, we did not have to wait to be seated. The walkways between tables are very narrow and make it  difficult to pass guests/employees if you must pass them by. I like the variety of food that NPL has to offer. Anything from sandwiches, salads, and burgers, to pasta dishes, pizza, and wings. With so many options, it was hard to decide! We settled on the cheese stuffed pretzel for an appetizer - now, I expected this item to be a soft pretzel filled with cheese. Nope! It was one of the pretzel rolls that they use for the sandwiches with slices of cheese melted in between. I was not impressed, however, it tasted ok especially when dipped in honey mustard. For my dinner, I ordered the 6"" hot Italian sandwich  with a side of sweet potato fries. I was pleasantly surprised! The sandwich was really good and I thoroughly enjoyed the fries although they didn't come with any sort of dipping sauce (and I wasn't going to dip them in ketchup) which was a slight disappointment. My meal was very filling and I was able to take half of the sandwich home to have at a later date. 

I'll give props to this place for the atmosphere they have developed: a popcorn machine filled to the top with freshly made buttered popcorn, a spinning wheel for entertainment, and TV's everywhere to watch any game. Of course, they have an extensive list of beverages for you to enjoy as well. A screened in porch provides an opportunity to sit outside when the weather is nice.  Every staff member we encountered was very attentive and nice. 

Overall, my experience was satisfying. Decent food, reasonably priced, friendly staff, and a lot events/specials going on at all times. We will probably be back for some football this fall."
3,"This place is small, but it doesn't appear to ever be crowded, and the small crowd that was there seemed to turn over frequently.  The music was decent and the service was good.  If you have a large group and are looking for a place without a large crowd, this might be the place."
3,"I decided to get breakfast here today since it's next to my work.  The All-Star special is reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  Add coffee and you're good.  The food overall needed some seasoning, but a little salt and pepper fixed it for the most part.  The eggs had a little bit of a weird flavor and the waffle was far from being crisp, but overall, I'd get it again for the price.  The bacon was the best part if you're into crisp bacon and the food comes out quick.  Service was a little weird with the seat yourself setting.  I might be back next time I'm looking for a bigger breakfast."
3,"We came here to see the Jones vs Rampage UFC Fight on a Saturday night.  I had called earlier to see what the cover was, and they said $40; when we got there however, we learned that wasn't the entire picture.  

What it really was:

$40/person = standing only
$75/person minimum = a barstool
$250/minimum = a table (I guess however many you can cram in at your table)

Since it was only the 3 of us, we figured we'd spend $75/person on drinks and food anyway, so we chose that.  But it would've been nice to have been given the entire picture on the phone when I called.

The place was practically dead when we got there at 7-ish (doors opened at 5, fights started at 6).  There were a couple people at a table, a couple at the bar, and a few at the long table in the middle of the place that had seating on either side.  TVs of varying sizes were all over the place, and visible from every angle of the room.

We were immediately waited on, so we placed our drink orders.  When those came, we added some food:

Yellowtail Sashimi ($19) - 5 impossibly thin slices of fish, topped with a slice of jalapeno, a leaf of cilantro, and ponzu.  The jalapeno was way too spicy for this tiny fish portion, so it completely overpowered the dish.  And the fish portion was way too tiny for the price!  Meh.

Fried Calamari ($19) - a basket of lightly battered and fried hot rings, with wedges of lime, and a sweet chili sauce for dipping.  This was better than the sashimi experience - the calamari was perfectly cooked, and yum in the dipping sauce.

Bobby Baldwin Burgers ($28) - this trio of mini sliders was the best thing!  Mini brioche buns with thick mini medium rare patties, topped with cheddar, grilled onions, and a pickle slice, served with a cone of parsley-tossed fries, and a darling little jar of ketchup plus mini spoon.  Had this been the first thing that we ordered, we'd have gotten more.  The price was a little high, but it was yum!

Even as the main event started, the place was barely half full.  Several people came in just to see Jones vs Rampage and stood, so I'm assuming they paid $40/person for about 15 minutes' viewing time/standing space.  A little crazy, if you ask me!

The fights went fast tonight, so we ended up staying here for only a couple of hours, and yes we easily spent the required $75/person.  The ambience was low key, so I'd come back here again - but only if the cover and minimum were lower."
3,"The North Park lounge will not blow your mind, but it's consistent and decent food.  The general vibe is a neighborhood bar feeling, similar cliental to an Applebee's.  But I'd rather service a local establishment.  There are tvs everywhere, which is slightly distracting.  I've never had great service here, but it's typically at least acceptable.

I usually order the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  It's not overwhelmingly spicy, but it still packs a punch.  Otherwise, I wouldn't get anything exotic here, but the standard menu fare is just fine.

My only complaint is you cannot really eat ""healthy"" here if you so chose.  The portions are outrageous, and everything comes with French Fries.  Would a fruit side without an up charge kill anyone?"
3,"I have stayed at this hotel several times as I am loyal to Hilton/Embassy Suites. I have never had an issue with the hotel staff, they have always been friendly and helpful. 

The hotel is currently under renovations (June 2016) which it desperately needs, however I just stayed In a ""renovated room"" and it seems that the room was put together by construction workers that had no attention to detail. For instance, they painted the vanity in the bathroom but then put the toilet paper on it before it dried so there is bits of toilet paper cover stuck on the vanity. There are splashes of paint on the tile. Also they have not replaced all the furniture yet so the main room is mismatched. Maybe once the renovations are complete everything will be more put together. 

I do agree that housekeeping could do a better job. The bathroom tile was very dirty looking with bits of hair/fuzzy in the corners and just looked like overall it needed a good scrubbing despite being recently ""renovated"" 

Overall a decent place to stay and I can't wait to see the renovations completed."
3,"Nothing fancy, but generally filling and not bad. Tonight's Arroz con pollo provided a decent, filling, tasty and inexpensive meal.  The dining area was (and is usually) clean, and the men's room is adequate, seems sanitary and has always been stocked with the necessities.  Several specials a week make the place even more extraordinarily affordable than it already is.  I've certainly experienced better - but considering every meal is a value at Chico's, it's A-OK."
3,"Great food, great atmosphere!   However, very disappointed there is no smoking section.   I had to go outside to smoke a cigarette!  Not fair."
3,Love the space and decor of this place...food is good but not great
3,Visited this place over the holidays.  The apps are awesome.  Service was great.  Burger was horrible left a bad taste in my mouth for 3 days.  Probably should have stuck with my guns and ordered wings.  I was with 3 other people and no one else had a complaint.  I have also been there many times just must have been an off day.  I would not cut this place off my list yet
3,"Stayed here for two nights with my family. The rooms are spacious and the staff is very friendly. The hotel can use a good scrub on the floors (bathrooms and main foyer area in lobby) other than that was clean. Nice pool with plenty of towels and the fitness area is really nice. The location is ok but doesn't have anything in walking distance, except for a run down shopping center across the street. I would stay again because overall it was a pleasant experience."
3,"It's a typical Chinese buffet. They have a large variety of options from sea food dishes, sushi and a Mongolian BBQ. The food is OK. The desert options are minimal, it's pretty similar to most other Chinese Buffet's. Expect to spend about $13 per person on a weeknight, w/ drink and more on weekends."
3,"It's been about 3 years since I last ate here and it was pretty bad.
I orders some of the spicy hot and sour soup today for the wife since she isn't feeling well with the sore throat and all.
The hot and sour soup did offer some comfort and the spiciness added some kick to clear things up when you aren't feeling well.
I order the shrimp fried rice and the vegetable lo mein, both were good. The shrimp in the fried rice was about a 1 in every three bite ratio, so its a bit skimpy.
The veggie lo mein was just acceptable. No real, ""I like this"" punch in any of the food and on the greasy side just a little bit.
Good value for the money and there is leftovers for later.
Not great, not awesome, just good enough and it's new owners from the people I last dealt with 3 years ago.
So from a 1 star to a 3 star. I'll be back again someday."
3,"Great place to go on Wednesday!  All you can eat wings. 
They have a huge option of flavours. Wings are always hot and fresh on Wednesdays. It's always packed. Be ready to wait. 

Avoid going on Sundays for wings. The order I had was cold and soggy. 


P.s sign up for emails. They send you deals and coupons!"
3,"My sisters and I came here after we gave up waiting for The Bank over winter break.

From what I remember it was a nice place to chill. If you're looking for a big night out, go elsewhere I guess, as this is a small, small lounge (you can see clear across the room from any corner). But it was nicely packed and all the people in there looked like they were having a good time. The crowd was certainly much more approachable that the one in line for the Bank if that means anything to you :P

Drinks are expensive ($90 for six drinks) and just okay (not very strong). Music is okay and even if you wanted to sway your body there's very little room to do it. Check it out if you're waiting for someone to finish gambling or if you're getting ready to go somwhere else."
3,"Probably one of my favourite wing places to go to. The place is huge! It's definitely a sports bar. They got alcohol, hot waitresses, and a humongous theatre screen TV at the bar. There's also music playing in the background ranging from old school to Top 40. You can also play pool here and they also do reservations for big groups!

For me, the quality and quantity of the wings are just like any other wing place. Basically $10+ for a pound of wings or combo. Wacky Wings definitely has more variety of flavours to try from compared to other wing places. It's a great place to go eat wings and drink beer with your buddies because of the lively atmosphere. Also a great place to go watch big sporting events!"
3,"This place was okay, but nothing to write home about. The wings were a little dry and small. For the price of the wings, and that fact that this is a place that specializes in wings , frankly I expected better. We won't be back any time soon.

The time it took to get seated and get our food was reasonable, and our waiter was friendly."
3,"I spend more time in Hilton Hotels than my own home which usually leads me to selecting an Embassy, Homewood or Home2 property.  I like the multiple room layout, living and sleeping areas accompanied by a kitchen or bar.

Location: Not very familiar with Charlotte I had no idea what the location of this property was like.  Had I know I probably wouldn't have given it a chance.  Morning and Evening the streets surrounding the property are beyond capacity.  The traffic is enough to raise your blood pressure and need a drink from the Managers Reception.  The neighborhood is not much better, it's pretty much ""The Hood"".  Other than the onsite Steak house, which is great, your options for dinning and shopping reflect the economical make-up of the locale.

Interior:  Like all Embassy's the interior Public area is light and airy.  The rooms are outdated and dark but at least they're clean.  The staff is extremely attentive and courteous."
3,"I am giving this place 3 stars only because I can't do 2.5. I had my car detailed there today and I came away disappointed with the outcome. For $175 I expected to not get into a car that was mostly done and it took 2 hours. They were to do the exterior and the interior leather seats, dash, center console and the doors. The exterior looks great. The interior is another story. The steering wheel was never wiped off with the armor all or whatever they are using and it was obvious it needs to be cleaned. I was given my car back with plastic on the leather seats and when I said something about it to the woman who barely speaks English she looked at me like I was nuts. I did not realize they were still wet. The console and doors were wiped off but it was a cursory wipe. The back hatch of my SUV was never wiped off - lots of dirty spots. They did get 95% of the dog hair out of the back which I appreciate. I won't be going back there any time soon. They did an OK job but it probably was only worth about $100 not $175. The guy writing up the ticket also argued with me on where I got the over spray on my car. I know exactly where it came from and I do appreciate that they could get it all off. The door arm rest was so wet when I put my arm on it I immediately had a burning on my arm from the chemicals. There was also not a scent in the car except chemicals from whatever they use to clean off the inside and the leather cleaner. My large sunshade for my SUV is also now missing out of my car so I will have to go buy another one. That was uncalled for to have that taken from me."
3,"I came here because of all the amazing reviews and was excited to try authentic italian food.

Walking by the restaurant, from the outside you can see the chef (the mama) and the sous chefs cooking. So the kitchen is at the front for the public to see and the seating is in the back.

We go in, the ""mom"" aka the owner, greets you, very sweet! And we're seated. IT.IS.SMALL in that place! Tables aren't even an arms length away. If i were to hold out my arms and spin i would have hit like 6 other people sitting near me, that's how tight it is.

Anyways the server hands you an ipad as a wine menu and the regular menu is on a chalkboard on 2 walls of the restaurant.

Everything you order is whatever is on the menu, so for instances, if you ordered steak you'll get strickly steak and you'll have to order what you want on the side as another dish. It's pretty cheap for the pasti, but everything else is a bit $$ for the portion size.

Tried the shrimp, which was $8.50 for 5. They were delicious!! Was going to order more but couldn't justify paying $17 for 10 shrimps.

We got the calamari, that was just alright. Was kinda dissapointed because there was so much hype over it, maybe its just me though, i thought it was going to be CRISPY but it was soft crispy (if that makes sense)

Both my boyfriend and i got lasagne and that was good. Kinda dissapointing the server didnt offer us pepper or fresh cheese... :/

This place gets crowded fast, loud music playing, VERY dim, candle light dinner. If i were in the neighbourhood i'd come back.

upon leaving the place, the mom thanked us. very sweet

service 3.5
food 4.5
price 3
atmosphere 4"
3,Loud. That's the best way to describe this hotel if you are coming here and need to focus and get a lot of work done you'll need noise canceling headphones. The Decor was very cute but like I said very loud and there are curtains with the window to the middle of the hotel which when you're traveling alone seems like a safety concern. Remote did not have batteries in it so I called the front desk and they were very short with me and said maintenance would be up shortly to give me batteries. That call was placed at 6 o'clock. I had phone asleep on my bed when the maintenance guy knocked on my door at 10 PM that night. Needless to say I was not very impressed with him.
3,"Food was very good, decent prices but I felt like I was bothering the waitress with wanting food containers, refills and she wasn't very friendly. I usually tip 25 percent.
I didn't this time."
3,"Ok we just had the food.. i ordered the dumplings and maybe because it was the end of the night they were very dry inside. The orange chicken was good . And fried wantons good rice good. Soup is ok... i love the idea that they have the Chinese cartons it reminds me of new york style , and they had crispy wide noodles which was yummy.. I will try it again at lunch time.. price was good..."
3,"Usually barros is very consistent with their taste and quality, this last time we went it wasn't as good. They need to change their honey bbq sauce back to the original, this time is tasted very orangey. The pizza wasn't cut very well and the lack of the toppings were all put towards the middle"
3,"Food is fine but a bit on the pricey side.
Service is HORRIBLE! If you're on the pool table side and you do not play in any of their pool leagues, you're lucky if you can even find a server. The area by the front bar is only marginally better. You can see a server but good luck trying to actually getting served.
The only upside is that the wings are good and that whenever you actually DO see a server, most of the time they are pleasant."
3,"3.5 Stars inching toward 4.

I came back because of great customer service. The owner, Dawn, sent me an email saying she would like to treat me to another coffee and treat because of the experience I had the last time I came. Wow. A completely unexpected thing that now I can let everyone know how awesome the customer service is.

Overall my review hasn't changed in terms of the coffee and overall feel. I do believe though that this place has found an unbelievably untapped location and is going to do great. Keep it up Lazy Daisy's!

That's it."
3,"Here it is 4 days after my services (gel manicure & regular pedicure) and my polish is chipped. I don't have a job that is rough on my hands and nails, so I really feel like the fact that my polish chipped says a lot about the service.

2 days ago I noticed a small chip in the polish on my right thumb, but it was so small it didn't bother me that much. This morning the gel polish on my left thumb cracked and not 10 minutes later the piece fell off. To have 2 nails chipped this soon after I paid $35 for my gel manicure is severely irritating!

I'll be calling to see if they'll fix it."
3,"Decent hotel, but restaurant and room service are not customer friendly. Floors are filthy."
3,"Came here a while ago, first time trying poutine, we got the vegetarian one. I like that they have a huge selection of poutines to try. Service was very poor, the workers had an ""I don't care"" attitude, giving off a bad vibe. 

The food was decent; gravy was good however the fries were a little too greasy. Pricing is fine considering the portion size. It's worth a shot if you like poutine, but I will not be returning."
3,"We came here because the club ""The Bank"" wasn't opened yet. I got a glass of champagne that was decent price and chilled there for a bit. 

It was dark and crowded. Loud music was playing, but forgot what kind. Nice lounge bar to just chill."
3,"Nettes Hotel ca. 10 Min vom Flughafen entfernt. Es gibt einen großen Lobby Bereich mit schönen Sitzmöglichkeiten und Restaurants. Die Zimmer sind schön. 
Leider kostet das Internet, wie in den meisten Hotels dieser Kette, pro 24h Nutzung 10 USD, was ich völlig überflüssig finde. Bei Zimmerpreisen von über 150 USD halte ich das für unangemessen.
Die Lage ist etwas abseits mit wenig Möglichkeiten um das Hotel herum. 
Insgesamt ist der Eindruck aber ok, das Personal ist nett und hilfsbereit."
3,"Food- good
Service- not so good
Overall- ok

Could be better, could be worse its good for groups but nothing more"
3,"Being from NY I've been trying to find a GOOD Chinese takeout spot that can compare to the ones back home. This is the closest I've come. The food was the best Chinese takeout I've had since I've moved to NV, however not even close to what I've had in NY. I ordered my food to be delivered and the woman on the phone was extremely nice. The one that delivered my food was as well. The only thing that really bothers me about this place is that it doesn't serve dumplings!!!!!!! It has pot stickers but no dumplings... and no, they're not the same thing. My kingdom for a dumpling!"
3,Close to my house so I like to go there.  I usually have to ask them to redo something in the interior.  Overall pretty good wash.
3,"I actually have been wanting to visit Caramel for awhile due to reading the good reviews. After coming here, it was just okay. It's a nice little lounge, with a DJ in the corner. Drinks were overpriced, but hey, it's vegas. But nothing really striked me to think this place was great. The music was cool, but it was just an overly packed little lounge. I probably wouldn't come back since this could be more of a place to grab a few drinks. But even with that, it's a bit too pricey. I don't really want to pay club drink prices at a lounge."
3,"Good food, but they keep running out of everything. Not very busy so not sure what the problem is, expecaly on weekend prices. Front area is nice, but bathrooms could use a bottle of bleach. Hopefully the kitchen is clean."
3,"Obviously this isn't the most authentic Mexican place you could go to eat at, but it definitely is good. I had the Achiote Grilled Chicken Salad which was super yummy. The salsas are okay--the red one is my favorite. My friend had the tostadas and she said they were good. I would come here again for a quick lunch."
3,"North Park Lounge is close to home for us, so its always a good option for a dinner out when we dont want to drive outside the neighborhood. 

At this North Hills location there is often a fairly long wait on weekends, but of course you can grab a drink from the bar while you wait -which makes the wait not so bad. I have never had unfriendly or bad service here and the food is always solid, although it is also fairly average. However, I have never had anything come out cold or not the way I wanted it. Their french onion soup is AMAZING and the lounge fried and burgers are really good - juicy, hot and never dry. They are always a winner. 

Other menu items like their salads and other non-burger sandwiches are just OK and slightly underwhelming...Ive had the grilled chicken salad with the fries and the buffalo chicken salad- they are just average for me - Its usually just a lot of lettuce with few toppings (chicken included) - I like a lot of ""stuff"" in my salads and if I am eating a large dinner salad out, I want it to have a good lettuce to ""stuff"" ratio, which these often don't. But this is just a personal preference. 

I'm not from the North Hills, nor am I from Pittsburgh originally. I find that those who grew up in the area are pretty loyal to this place and it almost has a cult-like following for them. As an outsider, its just a pretty average neighborhood place to get a burger and a beer. Still wont stop us from heading back for dinner in the area, or if the mood strikes for a crock of french onion soup close to home."
3,"I ordered delivery thru GrubHub today. I ordered around 4:40pm and I didn't get my order until 6pm. I live less than 10 minutes away down the street. When I got my order, the whole bag was soaked with liquid because the containers were were faced vertical, not flat down like you'd normal place containers. Not sure if the driver was speeding and turned corners fast but everything was soaked."
3,"Visited for breakfast, food was decent, the waitress was nice, courteous and patient. The only thing I didn't like was the establishment wasn't as clean as it should be, the floor didn't look like it hadn't been swept in a Lil while, and the bathroom was disgusting! It looked like someone threw up and they just lifted the toilet seat up and left the throw up on the seat, so nay for cleanliness, especially in a restaurant."
3,"Went here on New Years day and the food was pretty good but I've also been here on a weekday when its not so crowded and wasn't pleased with the food. I'd recommend to only come here during busy hours because that is when the food tastes best! If you're a fan of crab legs, craw fish and sushi, they've got em!"
3,"Ever since their debut on ""You Gotta Eat Here"", I loved going to their joint for Steamed Bao and Banh Mi. That was years ago, when they set up shop at their first location on Queen and Spadina. Since then, they've opened multiple locations, and I just happened to stop by the one near Yonge and Eglinton for a late lunch.

I ordered their Five Spice Pork Belly steamed Bao with a side of fries, all in for just under $7.50.

Their flavours are just like I remembered: salty and savoury from the big slice of pork belly with their signature ""luck sauce"", and sweetness from the bao and pickled veg.

What sucks about today though was that I felt there was a bit too much pickled veg. It ended up shoving the pork belly from underneath so when I took a bite of the bottom, all I got was bao and veg. A bit of an imbalance, but I'm willing to look past it.

I dug into the fries after my first bite of the bao, and it was all soft... no crispiness. Now, my mentality is: you can't mess up a good fry. There's probably someone who likes soft fries, but I was just hoping for something with a little more crunch.

Despite that, I still love Banh Mi Boys and their food. It'll take a bit more than that to change my mind."
3,"This is the place to go if you are looking to watch a sports event just because of the price and the amount of TVs there are available in the bar and the personal dining area. They have pool tables and a mini game section.

The service is pretty good too. The food takes quite a bit of time to come out on busy days but that is expected.

They have an all you can eat Wednesday special which is a pretty decent deal for those who can eat a lot of wings. I personally cannot but even then its not a bad deal. You get 20 pieces of wings and fries and you can order more after you are done with your current serving.

The wings vary from good to bad. They have plenty of flavours so its understandable that there will be plenty of flavours you  might not enjoy and plenty that you might. That being said, they are definitely not the best wings around but the variety alone makes up for it in my opinion. Their fries are really good also.

I would recommend this restaurant for those looking to watch a sporting event however if you are looking for quality wings, try again."
3,"I stayed here for a conference last month and was pleasantly surprised  by how nice it was.  The lobby was very attractive, the staff was extremely helpful, and the food (especially Omaha Steak House--some of the best salmon ever, no lie) was awesome.

The negatives.  Like all atrium hotels, noise from the lobby can funnel up to the 4th floor very easily.  Not a big deal during the day, but it's a different story at night.

While the rooms are tastefully decorated, the mattresses have to go.  My room had two queen sized beds and both mattresses had hollowed out pits in the center.  

I would stay here again, but I really hope they upgrade the mattresses before then."
3,"Long story short, customer service is not very good... But they did a good job on my car..."
3,"We have been here many times over the last 20 years.  The place has gotten to be dirty, less friendly and most of all it doesn't have very good food.  Me and my family visited the restaurant on September 5.  We were greeted by two younger girls that were accommodating when we asked to be switched from one seating area to another.  Things stated off ok.  

We ordered all of our meals (5) and asked for the ""lounge fries"" as our appetizer.  The came fairly quickly and looked good, but once we ate a few we all noticed a stinky dish rag smell to the fries.  They also had a nasty taste to them.

Then we get our meals and two of us ordered the grilled chicken wrap with mild wing sauce on the side.   The wing sauce was just so bad; it was literally a droplet of Franks Hot Sauce and the rest was grease!!!  We asked the manager about it and he said that was exactly what it is and that is the way they make their mild wing sauce!

We have made a decision not to visit this place any more based on our last 5 visits it so."
3,"I'm not really impressed with Banh Mi Boys. Tried them once downtown a few years ago and just felt it was overpriced Banh Mi. I'm Viet so I'm use to the original stuff in Vietnam or at least the small stores in Chinatown which sells for like $2-3 a sandwich. 

Decided to give them another go and tried the kimchi fries recently and thought it wasn't too bad but nothing to rave over. It wasn't hot enough for me but the kimchi added a unexpected spiciness to it that I did like. 

Primary issue I was a bit concerned about is the cleanliness. There were so many fruit flies where I was sitting... It was off putting. Like I had to repeatedly squat them away while eating. Staff need to take garbage out more frequently. 

Overall, my opinion hasn't really changed. I think its overpriced for what is offered and am confused by why everyone loves it so. If I'm ever in the mood, maybe I'll give them a 3rd chance and try the baos or a Banh Mi again. Lol"
3,"I liked this place well enough and could seriously become a regular here, if they addressed a few issues.

There are very few bike parking options and only street parking, so they should look at installing a bike rack (maybe not possible, but as a bike I'd REALLY appreciate it!)

The food is good and made with real ingredients! The coffee was fine (they use pilot beans). 

Here is their process:

You go to the counter to order and pay. Next you seat yourself and they will call you when your food and drink are ready.The people that served me my food were all nice. They weren't busy, so the lady actually brought me my sandwich, but the lady who prepared my coffee left it at the bar, which I found odd especially because she never told me and I didn't notice it for some time, which resulted in a lukewarm brew.

The atmosphere is pretty relaxed and it was good for working on my computer. Overall I like it,  but I do have some major issues with some of their prices for baked goods and coffee. Their baked goods are expensive and hover around $3.00 when they should be more around the $2-$2.50 mark. My biggest complaint is that they charge you 2$ for a refill of coffee, which is quite ridiculous, especially if you have just purchased a sandwich, coffee, and baked good. I understand their reasoning for putting a price on refills, but I think the refill should be free if you've purchased a full meal or after a certain price point. Everything else was appropriately priced, in my opinion. Another thing is that their WIFI cuts out occasionally, which is also a bit of a bummer, but not a deal breaker.

If they reevaluated the pricing of their baked goods and their refill policy then I'd come here often and would change my rating to a 4/5 instead of the 3/5. Good food. Good people. Good atmosphere. Some bad pricing decisions/policies."
3,"They were sitting front and center at the Street Eats festival in Scottsdale, so I decided to give them a try.  Well, if you want the mall food court equivalent of food truck food, this is the truck for you.  The tastes were decent and they had a good selection, but the preparations were not the freshest and the prices were steep.  The grilled catfish was falling apart from sitting around in juice too long, the fried catfish was dry from sitting in a warming pot and the hush puppies were like jawbreakers.  I'm guessing this one would be better to try outside of an event like this...if this truck pulled up in front of my office, I might give them another shot."
3,"Average.  Basic breakfast food.  I thought I would be blown away by the food here, but my assumption is that all the other ratings are really based on the atmosphere more than anything.  Not sure if I'll be back."
3,"Alright this is long over due.

I came here when this place was pretty new, after hawking it for 2 weeks they finally took down the papers in the window and I excitedly lined up for my share of POUTINE! The space reminds me of old Montreal, lots of wood and vintage tinker peices used as decor. Huge chalk board of menu items, it makes it hard to choose what to get. Really laid back, jeans and tshirt joint. Food? Sad to say, I was really dissappointed. I have to agree with some of the reviews already up. 

However, since then i have gone back a few times and each time it has gotten better. More cheese curds!!! More pulled pork goodness! Drench it all in gravy!!! Hell yeh!!! They still have to work on their fries though, seems too dry or over fried. but this definately means they are improving and possibly taking our suggestions into consideration? Let's hope so!"
3,"Lazy Daisy's Cafe is standard. You order at the counter and they bring you your food when it's ready. You can't start a tab, so we had to up three times to pay for our coffees, then our breakfast and finally some jam and a dessert. When the server dropped off our food, she didn't say a word. Just plopped the food down in front of us. 

The options are pretty limited. They don't offer any alternatives to bacon (e.g., sausage, sliced tomatoes, etc.) and don't poach eggs. The veggie breakfast sandwich was okay. It didn't come with any sides. Our group also ordered chocolate chip banana pancakes, the veggie sandwich on gluten-free bread (soggy) and the full breakfast. The consensus was that everything tasted okay/good but we won't be going back."
3,"Very friendly and attentive bartenders here!

Prices on the food and drink menu are relatively high, but then again it's an upscale lounge at the Bellagio!

Their chili cheese fries were really tasty."
3,"1st thing I usually check in any restaurant is the bathroom sadly this one was horrid urinal was about to fall off the wall and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years maybe. The food however was good the ""coconut shrimp"" was more like,fried shrimp with buttery coconut sauce on it pretty good.  About half of the items are American which annoys me at a Chinese buffet. Service was good drink was kept refilled (a huge plus)."
3,"Pool for 6 dollars an hour a table before 5pm.

Pretty empty during those hours so getting a good table will be easy.

There are also a lot of TVs around the pool area so watching FIFA while playing pool of was a big plus."
3,Love the food..... Never an issue. I have however had issues with timing and getting my order right. Continue to return because the pizza is great and the kids love it.
3,"Not bad for a lounge. This place is all dark and seemingly sophisticated and lounge-like. The booming music is a bit deceptive and made me want to dance a bit in my seat, but it's not a club, so that might not have been well received.  Like any other lounge on the strip, the drinks are pricey, but there were people passing out 2 for 1 drink cards all day (we went on a Saturday). It was a good first stop and I'd probably go back if I'm in Vegas again and can't figure out where I feel like going."
3,"Breakfast here yesterday.  The waiter, Danny, was new but very nice even though he messed up my order.  I didn't bother to tell him and ate it anyway.  Had a lite waffle for $2.75.  It was the softest, mussiest waffle I have ever had but tasted amazing.  I also got the regular size hashbrowns ($1.60) with sauteed onions (.25) and cheese (.30).  What I had wanted was hashbrowns with onion and mushrooms.   Everything tasted good though and was a decent size.

I will go back because both breakfast and lunch/dinner are served 24 hours a day and the food is downright CHEAP.  A grilled cheese sandwhich is less than $2, ect.  An easy place to take the kids."
3,"Comfy comes to mind..
Lot of white women with their babies.
So noise, sound can be annoying.
Coffee was very good."
3,"I came here over 10 times and it's a convenient place to hang out with friends or watch a sports game.

Pros:
- A wide variety of wing flavours (Different sauces, seasonings and spices)
- large location with large TV's for great game day watching
- Wednesdays is All You can Eat and you can try different flavours throughout your stay

Cons:
- All You can Eat Wednesdays are always packed with people and you could be waiting for a table for hours
- Waitresses aren't the most welcoming. I would say I got a good waitress 25% of the time"
3,"This place is soooooooo small & cramped. I swear it's like the size of my room, not exagerrating at all. Calling it a lounge was just sad, especially when it looked like they were trying to cram as many people in there.

Old men hit on me, me no likey. At ALL =[
The bartenders were super rude. NO TIP for them.
They had 2 bartenders for a Saturday night working the bar & making the orders for the waitresses. Grrrr, took 30 mins to get drinks so we double-fisted since we didn't want to wait another 30 mins to get more drinks.

When I come back to Vegas, you will not find me here."
3,"The restaurant at this hotel was awful.  I tried nachos first and I don't know how you screw up nachos but they did.  I asked the bartender for a pizza, she could see that I barely ate the nachos, but she didn't ask if anything was wrong.  The pizza came out and, you guessed it, that was awful too.  Really really poor food!"
3,"While visiting Las Vegas, I was excited to try out the Edge Steakhouse located inside the Westgate in which we were staying. I must say with disappointment, the food and experience was just ""ok"". We ordered wine - a Rose and a Moscato which were delicious and the French onion soup to start...the soup was devine! They also brought over some bread, which was like a crossaint/roll and was quite tasty. The servers were friendly and the ambiance was perfectly suited for a date night. However, for a $70 steak, I've had better at some of the chain restaurants. I had the ribeye cap, which was just ok and was a bit chewy. The braised short ribs were delicious but the root vegetables that it was served with were not good at all. I even overheard the same comment from another patron at the table nearby. Service was extremely slow, it was almost an hour between our soup and meal and we were going to see a show afterwards. I had to let the server know to speed it up. We didn't even have time for dessert and had already been there for 2 hours. Overall, for the price and the fact that this restaurant is in the upscale steakhouse realm, I would just say save your money and head to Outback or Ruth Chris."
3,"My co-workers and I like to come here on Taco Tuesdays for their $1 tacos.  You can order either chicken, steak or beef tacos, (3 taco minimum) for a dollar, and you get a side of fresh tortilla chips and you get to choose from their salsa bar. 

The chicken tacos are definitely the best, the chicken is flame-broiled and you definitely get that flame-broil flavor.  They are on double corn tortillas which is a bit much for me, I can never eat more than two (which is why the three taco minimum kind of sucks, but who can beat $3 for lunch with leftovers?).  The steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken, the steak just isn't very flavorful, I definitely would not recommend them.  I have never tried the beef, which come on a crisp taco shell.  I tend to prefer soft tacos over hard tacos, so I haven't really been interested in trying the beef.  

I think the rest of the menu tends to be a bit expensive for what you get.  I Wouldn't really recommend coming to Chico's unless its for the dollar tacos.

The chips and salsa bar is pretty great.  Lots of different types of salsa with varying levels of kick.  This is a great place to come for  a cheap, fast, working lunch!"
3,"I have a question. When I was a kid, we always went to Barro's and at that time everyone pronounced it 'Bear O's,' but now everyone is pronouncing it 'Bar O's.' What's up with that?

But I digress, Barro's is decent cheap pizza. They have smokin lunch specials with a slice going for 1.75$ The pizza is greasy and heavy... nothing artisan or fancy about it, but it's consistently decent. Is this the best pizza place in town? Not even close. Is it decent and cheap? Absolutely."
3,Had take out but I will say the fries were soggy and definitely not the best poutine I've had
3,"Chico's Tacos is hidden away in a strip mall right off the corner of 7th Street and McDowell. You can get a burrito, get your taxes done, cash a check, grab a bagel and an espresso before grocery shopping. Neat! 

Chico's food has always been hit or miss with me. The fresh salsa bar is the stand-out feature, with salsas in varying degrees of intensity (I tend to go for the pico de gallo as, I am sure my friends will attest to, I am a wuss). Menu items include the standard tacos, burritos, chimichangas, quesadillas and nachos. There is also your choice of soda, beer, iced tea and margaritas.

I think I had just missed the lunch rush as it was still fairly busy when I went in. The food was prepared quickly, which was good as I was on my way to work and in a time crunch. The chicken chimichanga I ordered was fairly tasty, but a bit on the bland side. The only thing wrapped up in the tortilla (which was swimming in grease inside my to-go container) was cheese and grilled chicken. The side of sour cream helped and the addition of pico de gallo made it much better.

Chico's works well as a lunch spot during the work week because of its central location. However, the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired as it's right next to one of the busier intersections in Phoenix."
3,"New location but I always go to the gerrard location.   But since the is around my office I come here more often. 

I alqays get the  five spice pork belly.  Nice Flavourful meat.


I tired the duck confit on my most recent visit .  It is a not Thier strength when you compare it the the pork belly or REAL confit which is biased in duck fat for three hours. 


Good kim chi fries

And the lineup and wait is very long.  I go after 1:30  when it gets more quiet."
3,"Having been born and raised on the Quebec border, I expect a lot from my poutine for it to be outstanding.
Big cheese was acceptable.
It was post hockey game time at 11:00pm and the Red Mile was busy. Into Big Cheese we went for the first time. Big line-up, one guy behind the til taking orders and a true to life ""Find Waldo"" raised up in the back getting all the orders ready. Limited seating.
I do not like to mess with my poutine. I got the traditional, nothing fancy no gimmicks. I like my poutine the way it was made to taste like! Hubby on the other hand got the Pigasus with chicken, caramelized onions and baby peas. Small sized portions were more than enough for each of us. I am still so full, hours later.
My reg poutine was OK. The fries could have been crispier, the cheese could have been a tad more plentiful and squeaky (6 little pieces) but I Iiked the gravy.
The chicken one (was that really chicken on top?) mixed with the veg, cheese and gravy was actually pretty decent. Next time I may go CRAZY and try the perogie poutine.
The little restaurant itself was cute and as crowded as it was the patrons were well behaved!"
3,"Since moving to the area about six months ago, we have ordered delivery from Little Dumpling approximately seven or eight times. What's sad is that sometimes it's delicious, but other times it's not. They definitely have a consistency problem. Sometimes it's flavorful, spicy, fresh and wonderful. Other times it's bland, stale and cold. 
I hope they find their weak link and take care of it because we love having them so close for nights when I don't feel like cooking or don't have time."
3,I'm not too keen on Chinese food buffets even though I LOVE Chinese food. I gave three stars only because I ate two things... the lo mein and pot sickers. Those two items were decent enough... I had very low expectations so I was happy that these items were good. The bathroom was disgusting though.
3,"I should preclude this review by saying I am not really a fan of Poutine. Nothing against the creation it's just for a snack I'd rather have a good Shawarma or Burger. However, with out-of-country friends in Calgary I though it best to share with them some ""traditional"" Canadian cuisine. 

We ordered the traditional Poutine along with the Montreal Smoked Meat concoction. At $5.99 and $7.99 for smalls I did find it pricey for jazzed-up fries with a little bit of gravy, cheese and meat. 

It was ok. There was nothing wonderful about it and I hardly doubt with so many options on 17th that The Big Cheese would be my first, second or third choice for an afternoon or late night snack. However, my friends and I did clean out the box and we were generally satisfied with the experience. The service was good. The place was clean. The box amazingly did not get soaked through with all that was in there."
3,"I've been here a couple of times. The coffee is ok, nothing special about it. My go too is The Combine brunch, which consist of pancakes, toast, bacon or sausage, and eggs.  I love meat so The Combine is a good balance of pancake and meat. They ran out of bananas so I got my pancake with blueberries and chocolate chips which I find it made the pancake a bite soggy. I love that they use local ingredients, and it is kid friendly. there isn't anything special about it."
3,"I really love embassy as a chain. Currently the hotel is under renovation, expected to be comfortable Peter sometime in October. The noise stops at 6pm. I hope the atrium gets redone to looks similar to what it was before and doesn't try to go modern like the Ayrsley location. My biggest issue was that the wifi didn't work and they couldn't really figure out why, and I was connected to some national tech support. I didn't have the time so I just went to bed. While renovations are going on I hope the redo the pool area, that too is in less than pristine condition. The staff is great and definitely made the stay more enjoyable. I did have the pleasure of getting a renovated room, so beautiful, way better decor than the location in Richmond, VA. The only issue with the room itself is that the fridge appeared to have mold in it? Since Omaha Steakhouse vacated the hotel has a restaurant in its place with a very limited menu. No, they don't even offer wings. I look forward to trying them out again once the renovation is done. The breakfast was enjoyable, especially the omelette, seasoned potatoes, and grits. Of course the evening managers reception is alway nice, even though here they give you drink tickets (2 limit). I guess that's good to curve drunks wandering the hotel."
3,This place has definitely changed over the years!  Just found out this location is under new ownership. All the old employees have left and the prices have been raised. The reason for the 3 stars is that there is absolutely no consistency here anymore. Depending on who is in the back making the tacos results in if you get a taco with barely any meat or a wonderful taco filled up properly.  Please bring back your old cook!!!!  The younger woman that is predominately back there now makes them so weak!  You're basically eating tortilla and lettuce!
3,"This place is ok. Taste like typical Chinese buffet food. Nothing special, nothing stuck out as being really good. Wasn't offensive. I won't be back."
3,"yea it's ok...not bad, not good...ok.  $12.95 for dinner on Friday prob cuz they had crab legs, which looked  small we didn't try them, and they had shrimp and fish.  selection and service are fine.  weird crowd but we got in and out fast."
3,"It's my first time in here, came on lunch time. It was busy and lots of customers. The interior looks similar as you enter Chinese buffet but more bright and fresh.
The service was great. The waiters always seek the table that just finish and eager to clean it right away. 
The sushi display was nice and the size of the sushi wasn't as a big roll like a Californian rolls elsewhere, it was a perfect size for sushi in my taste.
The rice noodle, well, little bit blend. The wontons was OK.
The vegetables was great, it wasn't too soft or overcooked.  
The location very strategist because it's near Costco, Ross, and Marshall's...LOL..What else that you need, right? 
I would like to go back to this place to try other menu on the weekend (I wondered if they have crab legs and pork belly).

PS: no cash back (incase you wonder;) )"
3,"food was good. very laid back environment, cozy but noisy, with many many many kids running around. find your own table and line up to order with the cashier. when the coffee is ready, you will be called to pick it up but the food plates are brought to your table. open kitchen, so you might notice some cooking fume."
3,"2-3 Stars-- We visit this location often. Their GF pizza is not good and very expensive. I would not recommend the Gluten Free pizza. However, their regular pizzas are pretty good. Not our ideal pizza, not our favorite pizza but it's good enough for when on the run. The kids really like it. 

Ps- I do wish the location was a bit cleaner. It seems to be run by teenagers."
3,"LOUD !!!
This is a great place if you too are an entitled parent.
I like Flying Pony better"
3,I came here to meet up for a party bus club tour. You can find guys handing out 2 for 1 drink cards. But you are limited to what drinks u can order. The lounge is very dark which is actually kind of nice. Other then that it seems more like a bar than a lounge. Nothing special.
3,"I'd say this is an average Embassy Suites.  Hot Breakfast, big rooms and fairly clean.

Only issue I have here is the customer service.  When we were at the airport, they did not care very much that we were outside freezing.  They were unable to give us a time for the shuttle and when we pushed them, they said the driver's phone is down so he will be there when he gets there.  When he finally arrived an hour later, which is absurd as the hotel is 10 minutes away, we asked about his phone without telling him the situation and he said the phone was fine.

Second issue was that we requested a 7am wake up call so we do not miss our early morning flight, and one was never given to us.  

And while this isn't the hotel's fault, we had kids either next to us or above us that were jumping up and down off the bed and laughing at full strength around midnight for about 2 hours.  My girlfriend got very poor sleep.

Again, is this place a resort? no...it is a warm bed and a roof for the night and that is it."
3,"the battleship. 26"" of good bun fresh meats tons of lettuce and tomato all for 11 bucks?  ill admit, driving through and parking on the streets of swissvale brought me closer to God since i said a prayer that my car was going to start.  i saw the place was held up a month after we were there but that could happen anywhere. good sub, i omitted salt and pepper and oragano bc it just doesnt seem right on a cold sub. 
they have hot subs too, maybe take my chances and go there for a cheesesteak"
3,"First time dinner visit. Ordered the hamburger with hash browms, they don't have fries. Got back to hotel with food. My mistake, I should've checked before I left. There was No fork to eat the hash browns, no napkins, and no ketchup. the Burger was okay, guess I should stick to their waffles."
3,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday night to catch the football game.  It was my first time here and I was quite impressed with the layout of the restaurant. 

The service itself was somewhat dissatisfying. No server came to greet us for a good 15min and it wasn't until we flagged someone down that they realized we were there.  Then apparently the server inputted our order at the wrong table. 

The wings itself was delicious. Compare to other places like wind wings and all stars,  they were probably the most meaty ones I've had. The sweet potato fries were mediocre so I wouldn't get them again

Overall the food was good so I wouldn't mind going again on a game night. But if you want steller service,  well this isn't the place to go to."
3,"I am an avid Mexican Food Eater so this restaurant honestly caught me off guard a little bit and I have dined here twice, once by myself for lunch and then once for dinner with my boyfriend. 

I originally discovered it with the intention to go to Subway (next door) but then decided to try this place instead. The restaurant is a decent size but definitely gives off that hole in the wall mexican vibe that always makes me excited to taste their food. 

The staff there is decent, they were not overly helpful but not downright rude either. I was a little put off the first time I went there because their credit card machine was down and so they asked to write down my card information and charge me the following day (but in the end that's exactly what they did and I didn't have any issues with it). So I agreed and ordered the cheese enchilada meal with rice and beans. I feel like for what I received it was a little overpriced. The enchiladas were pretty good as were the beans and rice (with salsa from their salsa bar of course). I really enjoyed the salsa bar. 

The second time I went for dinner with boyfriend and ordered the taquitos. Again a little overpriced for what I got but they weren't terrible. My boyfriend got the taco dinner and he enjoyed it. 

Overall the food is average and a little overpriced but decent if you have limited time and need a Mexican Food fix."
3,"Average bar food and average service.

We met up with family one night for dinner one weeknight because someone suggested The Lounge. The name didn't spark confidence and we feared the worst from looking up Yelp reviews but overall was not too terrible.

Our waitress was forgetful...we watched her take our beer to the opposite side of the room before bringing it back to our table for instance.

The fried zucchini appetizer was good...thick slices breaded & topped with parmesean cheese. For me it was the highlight of the evening.

Hubby had a burger that he was satisfied with. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. The chicken had a nice char but needed seasoning.

They had a good selection of draft beer so we ordered. Both glasses arrived with no head. Very disappointing. 

Family ordered crab cakes and they looked full of crab meat. He also ordered risotto which I did taste...it was rubbish don't waste your money. Another ordered fried chicken strips which she enjoyed.

Overall, I was fed but I don't see us returning."
3,"Cute little atmosphere, nothing too fancy here. Just order, pick  up and go, or order sit and eat. Simple. We stumbled in about 30 minutes to close and were pleased with the service. Most restaurant employees seem to get upset when you walk in anytime after an hour before close. These employees were kind, and did not seem bothered at all that we were there. 

We ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the pork fried rice. The sweet and sour chicken was the bomb! The chicken was fresh with a light crispy crust, the sauce was perfectly balanced between sour and sweet and the plate was big and full. Not to mention the healthy serving of veggies chopped up in big chunks and spread around the chicken. The pork friend rice however wasn't my favorite. It was very generic fried rice with strips of chewy pork. Bleck. I will not be ordering that again. 

I would have most likely given this joint 4 out of 5 stars however nearing the end of our meal one of the chefs came out and let out a huge burp in front of us. Not exactly professional or appetizing. I would definitely order take out from here. I might not dine in again though as the experience turned out to be a little confusing."
3,Prices are not cheap but the atmosphere is always friendly and lively and the wing options are great.  A nice place to watch a game and enjoy some great bar food
3,"I have a yelpy resolution to dine at several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. As 2014 transitions into the New Year, my Chinese restaurants list will grow. I aim to review fifty Chinese restaurants by 2016. This review of Little Dumpling Chinese Restaurant is my most recent fulfillment of this yelpy resolution. It is based on my recent visit during lunch before Acacia Demonstration Gardens. 

  Little Dumpling is actually the Hidden Dumpling. It is buried in the small Starbuck's strip mall on the Northeast corner of Horizon Ridge Parkway at Stephanie Street  by Walgreen's. 

  The parking lot is too cramped that there is a greater risk of a car dent. Just as I do when I visit the Starbuck's here, I walk a short distance further to park by Walgreen's. 

  This is essentially a take-out setting with a handful of tables and unadorned walls. The silverware and plates is throwaway paper and plastic. This is the quintessential setting for a Chinese restaurant lunch special. 

  The lunch specials that end at 4 PM cost between $5.95 and $6.25. The shrimp based entrees cost $6.25. The lunch specials include chow mein noodles or fried rice with the soup of the day. Of course the soup of the day is egg drop soup. With the addition of a beverage, the lunch special comes out to $8 and change. I ordered the shrimp chop suey. It was okay. I have tasted better, that is for sure. They did give a fair amount of shrimp. 

  There is a flaw in the design of the restaurant. That is that the restroom is too close for comfort to the tables. Little Dumpling ought to invest in a louder vent or something to block out noises that are not conducive to the customer enjoying their meal. 

  In my opinion Little Dumpling is an okay Dumpling. I have no urgency to return."
3,"My girlfriend and I wanted a glass of champagne.  We stumbled upon Carmel walking through the Bellagio.  Nice atmosphere, small, intimate, good music, great champagne."
3,"It should be noted that I loath poutine. I decided that I'd try it anyways just for kicks. Afterall I was quite hungry and had just come back from Hawaii, so I was looking for the Canadian experience again. They have a huge menu with loads of variations. I decided to order the traditional. Let's face it, if you can't at least make a classic poutine well then there's no point trying to make it fancier. The fries were actually really good. Slightly crisp, golden brown and flavorful. The gravy was decent though bland. I would suggest they add some XO or something to give it some omphf. The cheese curds were nice big pieces, but again kind of bland. I wouldn't even bother mentioning the cheese if the gravy was better. I ordered a large portion. It was a lot of food! I might be persuaded to try it again if they improve the gravy."
3,"This place is close and convenient, though it is not always quick. They have a pretty good lunch menu, and prices are pretty decent. A lot of main entrees in the ""small"" size are around 5.95, but are very filling. I like the beef chow fun and the sesame chicken. The sesame chicken is super garlic-y, but I love the sauce. They also have milk teas in different flavors.. I'd suggest sticking to the milk tea and skip the boba haha.

I would skip the fried rice, cashew chicken, and lemon chicken. The fried rice and cashew chicken are really greasy. The lemon chicken is basically chicken katsu with a side of bright-yellow ""lemon"" sauce for dipping...not too appealing."
3,"Food was fine. Not a ton of flavor. Little to oily for my taste but super convenient location. Staff was friendly. All in all OK for a ""I don't wanna cook"" kind of night."
3,Their chicken bao was really great! Nice vibes! This place is much better in the summer!
3,"Caramel is a good place for friends to just lounge around and hang out. Once you get in, there's a long bar like table and seats on each side of them. They have one bar and the bartender was crazy fast, he looked like he had been doing it for a few years.
 
Ok.. so here's the breakdown.

CONS:

1. Too damn dark in there.. You could hardly make out the decor.. I usually bring my mini video cam whenever I go out and couldn't even use it in here.

2. Too small.. For a bar in Vegas where a doorman stands in front to enforce a dress code, it's gotta be a bit of a larger venue.. I bet they easily reach maximum capacity on a busy night.

3. Girl to Guy ratio.. awful.. Too many fellas in one place.

4. Not enough bartenders.. Although the one guy was fast, it wasn't good enough to get to everyone on time. And he gave me the price and never collected my money to give me my change back, so instead of waiting forever, I just left him the money with a tip larger than i wanted to give him. I bet it's a dirty little trick he uses every now and then. Listen up guy, NOT EVERYONE WILL BE AS HONEST AS ME AND LEAVE YOU YOUR MULA!

PROS:

1. Easy to get into. Aside from the dress code (which almost every swanky bar/club has). They don't hold up the line to make it look more busy.

2. NO COVER!! Yes!! A ""nice"" bar/lounge (I'm not including dive bars) in Las Vegas that's free to get into??

3. The music was awesome!! The DJ had some killer hip hop mixes!! He added a little bit of dance, but he was getting creative all night and you could tell he was really working that turntable. It was not typical of any club music you heard. He definitely put his own twist on it.

Overall, had a good night. I got lucky because I was with an extremely fun and outgoing group, girls and guys mixed. In fact there were other groups of people just staring in awe or envy because of all the fun we were having. But I can really see this place being good or bad depending on what night you go. So it's 50/50 here. Enter at your own risk!"
3,"Take a stroll down 17th Avenue, if you are looking for a quick bite and happen to pass by the The Big Cheese Poutinerie it would be worth your while to check in .  Just located a few doors down from the Melrose Cafe, it's hard to pass by without noticing the mouth watering aroma and the big plaid awning flaring off the building.

It was slightly crowded with a small line up which is a good indication that I had arrived at the right place.  I had been hearing mixed reviews and had to try it for myself.  We ordered two small sized poutine's, the portions were perfect for the two of us to share.  There was good flavor in both, I enjoyed the ""Notorious P.I.G."" over the ""Veggie Nacho"".  I found the two to be a great combination, we decided it was best to go with one that was heavy and the other... slightly heavier.  Nice setting, good flavors, but eat it fast or be prepared to grab a spoon for some potato soup in a box. 

Summary
It's a nice venue to check out and open late on weekends.  I would recommend trying it out, but I wouldn't say it fully satisfies my craving for a good traditional Montreal poutine.  It's definitely great to see a new fast food restaurant that is unique and non franchised.  Not that I have anything against franchises, it's just nice to have some variety and competition.  It keeps vendors on their toes, which means higher food quality at reasonable prices."
3,Used to love to get their fish sandwich which was always a good choice. Went today and got an over-fried breaded piece of thin fish on an oversized not-fresh bun. I recall the menu stating beer-battered but this hard piece of fish was breaded which gave an entirely different taste. I would have given 2 stars but the waitress was super nice and friendly which amped the rating. Draft beer was not very cold. Will likely not be returning to NPL for a long time.
3,"I've been to the NPL several times before, but just for drinks. I visited this week for dinner and I was satisfied! First of all, the place is a sensory overload. Lots going on. Fun decor, games, a prize wheel and a popcorn machine. This definitely is a great place for kids! 

Service was average and the waitress was friendly. I ordered a turkey pretzel sandwich. It was good, however a little small. My upgraded to sweet potato fries. Still good, not great, but good. My bf ordered a chicken wrap and enjoyed it. 

Basic bar food with some homecooked weekly specials. Kitchen is open late and definitely a place where you can have some fun. Parking is always available!"
3,"Tom yum soup ia a specialty . The memu also has pad thai with chicken ,pork,beef or shrimp. Yummy beef salad, thi with chicken,pork, beef,or shrim, beef salad. Thi yellow or red curry with chicken or beef, sweet and sour fish, moo shu pork, honey walnut shrimp yummy!!!!, salt and pepper squid and shrimp with asparagus in black bean sauce hmmmmmm good.lunch specials are served from 11am to 3pm."
3,"One of my oldest memories is standing in line at the massively popular 7 Numbers original location waiting for a table. It was pure chaos, people waiting in line for hours to sit at a small wooden table just to eat cooking that reminds you of home. The chaos of the line was nothing in comparison to that of the kitchen, cooks moving each and every direction just to meet the needs of the hungry customers. However, one woman stood out through all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, mama. Her tenacity and enthusiasm for the delicious food she created at her establishment was unmatched. She would greet our family outside and give us all hugs and kisses as if we were actually family. I am a big proponent of looking purely at the food when visiting a gastronomic establishment, however at 7 Numbers it was different. The atmosphere was not that of The French Laundry or Joel Rubochon in Paris, but it truly felt like home. Somewhere you are not afraid to have an extra glass of wine, eat your entire basket of bread or order more than one pasta. I will admit that I do have a bias because I have always and will always go to this restaurant as long as I am living in Toronto. Going back recently was an amazing experience because I no longer have to wait in line for hours to eat her delicious food. You sit down at small wooden table, accompanied by an unpretentious menu at a very fair price. My favorites on the menu happen to be the lamb shank which is fall off the bone tender as well as the orecchiette and linguine which have a pasta sauce that is unrivaled by any. Mama will not be an individual who will in a James Beard award, but instead she focuses on food that seems almost philanthropic in a way. Mama simply wants to put amazing food on a plate, in an unpretentious environment, at a fair price. What else could you really ask for from a chef? Mama, I would like to tip my hat to you for building an institution in the neighborhood and always staying true to your Italian roots, I will see you soon."
3,"I want to start this off on a positive. I came here and ordered all the choices of their buns. They have a great roster of stuff and options. Always best part about Banh Mi is that you make one choice, and that's it! No picking anything else ( for those whom are especially indecisive) but that special one sandwhich. The meats and variations of ingredients inside blended very well, with strong bold flavours. 

However for Banh Mi it is very expensive unfortunately. 

I was unlucky to get food poisoning from eating their buns, mind you I was starving I scarfed them down anyways so that why I am quite sure it was from them. 

The service was a bit lacking and slow. But I will definitely try back again another time so I can hopefully turn this review around for everyone."
3,"Really enjoy the lunch specials that Barro's offers!! A few negatives....don't put my order on a dirty tray....2:13pm 12 dirty tables...hire more people or train staff to clean tables in between customers...lastly please don't reach on the inside of the cup with your fingers....common sense food handling skills...hope the Mgr takes note and makes changes...this will not prevent me from coming back but will note changes. Pizza, salad and drink were good!"
3,"My Grandma was looking for a good Chinese take-out place nearby, so we checked out this place, based on the Yelp! reviews. My Grandma got the Lemon Chicken and really enjoyed it. I ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken. I asked them to make it hot (9 of 10). I didn't really like the taste, it wasn't very hot & the consistency was strange. I've had Panang at several restaurants & this was some of the worst, unfortunately. The service was adequate, so I'll probably try it again, but I'll be ordering something else instead."
3,"Food was good. Atmosphere was not for me, definetly a neighborhood hang out."
3,"The real problem with this hotel was they are under a total renovation and crew started at 8:00 hammering and pounding. If u don't care about dust, no reception area and top dollar then stay here."
3,"Waffle House, I can't give you five stars for awesomeness, but you deserve at least a couple stars for being open 24 hours and feeding a hungry girl with a late night craving of waffles and eggs.  This place is the typical diner fare, but for a fraction of the price.  Don't expect haute cuisine.... but you'll be happy with the cheap eats and friendly service."
3,"Food here is okay, and they keep the selection fresh by rotating their offerings. Sunday is crab day! The wait staff are jackasses, but at least you don't need to deal with them too much. Prices on Sunday are ridiculously high, go if you're starving and can eat your money's worth."
3,"Poutine!  What's not to love?  Gravy..yum!  Cheese..yum!  Fries...yum!
And to make this more interesting, there are a lot more different toppings/selections to choose.

I got the Cowtown poutine.  It has the caramelized onions and beef.  It was delicious.  However, the reasons I can only give it a three stars are because:
- Really, how hard is it to make a poutine.  It is almost impossible to mess it up, no?
- And the presentation of the poutine is quite un-appetizing.  Mind you, the poutine IS delicious, but if you just look into the box.....just not attractive nor appetizing at all.  

The three stars really belongs to:
- Their fries are good.  No doubt.  Just eating the fries alone, I would be happy.
- Their gravy is good.  Not too thick, not too watery.  It is just right.
- The novelty.  I love the idea that they have variety of selections for the poutines."
3,Pretty good food. A good size of variety and option. I know my fountain drinks and it does have an after taste to their pepsi. The food is good though. It's no pf Chang but it not the worst I've had. I'll more than likely come back.
3,The rooms are nice but the included breakfast sucks.  We stayed here twice.  Once on our way down to Florida and on our way back. We counted in the breakfast the first time and we're disappointed.  The second time we didn't even bother.  We skipped it and went to IHOP.  They would be much better off to just lower the price of the room and not even offer the breakfast.
3,"Loving the ambience..casual and relaxed. A great cafe where the waitresses are friendly and efficient! They have a great variety of food from cookies, sandwiches, breakfast munchies and smoothies. I also love that they serve pilot roasted coffee ... Which are my favorite and just around the neighbourhood. 
However, I find the sandwiches a URLs to expensive for the portions served. Quiches are great tasting and the gypsie cookie is definitely an interesting cookie with most mash of ingredients. This place could be packed over the weekend and don't open late."
3,As far as poutine goes they are OK.  There's really nothing too special about their poutine except the fact that they have a large selection of additions.  The service is good and the price isn't too high.  I found that the fries could have been a bit crispier for my tastes.
3,"My friend brought me here. I've known about Banh Mi Boys ever since I tried their Lucky Red spin-off which shockingly closed after just about six months of operations.
I must have been expecting alot out of the flavors for the food here but it didn't really hit the spot. My friend on the other hand liked what he ate which was the Fried Chicken Steamed Bao sandwich, something I had seen offered when I went to Lucky Red.
I had the Five Spice Pork Belly Bao with an order of the fries. For some reason, I couldn't get the most out of the flavor from the pork belly. Maybe I wasn't that hungry as it was already around 9pm so maybe that's why my tastebuds couldn't enjoy my order.
However, I might have to come back here for a second try."
3,"It was small enough inside the buffet was great! The had crab legs, seaweed salad AWSOME loved it! However they were a little on the pricey side but good was delish , the crab legs however were not coming out fast enough people were standing around the buffet food waiting to get the crab legs. One more thin love the egg drop soup just wish there were enough clean bowls thy ran out of bowls. I would go back just when it's not as crowded."
3,"Great coffee, mediocre service.
I went today with a friend, and had ordered an iced coffee. It was written on the blackboard, and I was craving it.
The barista made it for me, but was questionable the whole time and said coldly that the drink was off season (pun slightly intended) and so I apologized. 
My friend and i then sat for a while and left. There was no acknowledgement, rather the other customers leaving at the same time recieved warm goodbyes. 
Maybe because we are teenagers, but i didn't feel good for being treated differently for the way i look, or i am just exaggerating? 
Either way fragrant and delightful coffee."
3,"The worst service possible!!! 

The food and the locale are good but the service is atroutous. 

I have been there multiple times, the waitress will come check up on you once an hour if you are lucky.  During all you can eat, she will not come after the first order.  (Even though you want more beer).

Make sure your bills are accurate.  They do sneak in more beers.  I noticed this and complained and the waitress was stubborn and did not want to take it back.  (The bill was in over 100$, why are you argining for 6$). She obviously ended up getting no tip.  

If you go there go for the atmosphere and do not bother bringing extra cash forol the tip, the service is brutal and they do not deserve anything.

Locale: there are about 10 pool tables and multiple arcade games:basketball, shooting games... So it is a good place for both kids and audlts.
They also have a bunch of TV and projectors so good for sports.  They also have a ""DJ"" playing music.  At one point on the TVs there was baseball, hockey, two different music channels and a random TV show.  

Food: their hottest wings require you to sign a weaver.  The weitress spent about half an hour trying to convince us not to get it (likely since she needs to do more work).  We ended up getting 1 pound for 8 ppl.  After everyone had one, they were fine, the wings were not as hot as they all made them seem.

Conclusion: go there if you want to play pool and watch sports, and eat good wings, but be prepared for bad service."
3,"Been here 3 times, first to celebrate my birthday and 2 family dinners. I find the level of service to be acceptable for a place that gets really busy. I've had good service one time, and felt rushed the other times. The food is good and I find it to be reasonably priced. Family favorites are the calamari, veal meatball, and orrechiette pasta. Little things prevent me from giving it a 4 star rating such as wines are served warmish in plasticky glasses and when we asked our server for some parmesan cheese, he said 'what for?'"
3,"The pizzas here are pretty good for a chain. They also have a large amount of gluten free options. We carried out pizza from here on my visit to Arizona, so I can't speak to dining in the restaurant. The interior is nice, with classic elements of a bar/pizza place.

I had the pan crust meat lovers. The crust was cooked excellently, with a little bit of char to it. The amount of toppings was generous for a chain. The toppings were fairly fresh, not canned like a lot of places. 

They had our order ready right on time and were very friendly. Overall, much better than Pizza Hut or Dominos."
3,"I had a veggie poutine from this place, didn't hate it, didn't love it. It was a bit expensive for what you get, and the customer service was a little less than friendly. Other than that, the corn fritters were definitely worth it!"
3,"In general, the hotel was unremarkable. Room sofa was extraordinarily worn and uncomfortable. Chair was also dirty and worn. Hotel food, from Omaha Steakhouse, was heavy and outdated for my taste and there weren't other options within walking distance.

However, what made my entire stay worthwhile was the staff who made breakfast every day. Wanda and Debra were fantastic. They were happy and friendly and made yummy omelets. I might have to return to the same hotel and, when that happens, I sure hope Wanda and Debra are there."
3,Better than average. The price and location will probably bring us back. And we found the owners to be beyond pleasant. I think it's family run.
3,"My friends and I had our first visit to a Waffle House this week for a late-night nibble.  We were surprised when we asked the waitress (who was super nice) what was good, she said, ""Not the waffles.""  We ordered a regular waffle anyway and it looked and tasted like a big Eggo.  It wasn't that great, but it wasn't expensive at all, so we got what we paid for.  I'm sure it's great for drunk people late at night."
3,"I'm surprised that I haven't reviewed this place before as I've been here at least 8 times in the last two years.  Its more because my wife and kids like this place than me.

So my kids like the kids menu, but moreover the love being able to play the video games and win prizes.  That being said, some of the touchscreen elements on the wheel of fortune machine were not working and my son says he lost out on 50 tickets because the ""L"" was not working when he pressed on it.  The kids love the Mac and Cheese here, so it was a no-brainer for them.

I've had the wings before, which are ok, but merely ok.  I'd put them ahead of Buffalo Wild Wings, but behind Wild Wings.

This trip I had a sandwich.  This is the first time in my life that I've been in a wing place and NOT had wings.  I went for the roast beef dip sandwich, with cactus cut potatoes.  The sandwich and cactus cut showed up fine and were still warm.  The kitchen had forgotten to put the Au Jus and the chipotle for the cactus cut on the plate.  The server got them promptly when I asked.  The sandwich was good, but if you dip every bite of the sandwich you will run out of au jus about two-thirds of the way into the sandwich.

I'll be back, but not on my own volition."
3,"I've heard a lot of mixed things about The Big Cheese, but mostly unfavourable. I've avoided it for that reason. But I happened upon it one evening after some drinks for a friend's birthday at Melrose, which is how I'm sure most of the poutinerie's clientele make their way there.

Despite it being busy, they managed to get the food out very quickly. I had the chicken peppercorn poutine. The fries weren't bad: not great but not terrible like I've heard in the past. Chicken and cheese curds were yummy. However, I could not stomach the peppercorn sauce - not sure what about it but I am all about the traditional gravy, apparently. So much so that I could only finish about 1/4 of it before giving up. 

So, while my first visit wasn't amazing, I will be back to try again as it's not totally their fault that my choice was bad. I think it'll be the buffalo chicken or the traditional next time.

(15/30)"
3,The Big Cheese has improved over the couple of years they've been open.
3,"This is a good place for breakfast when you are traveling in Phoenix. The menu is small, but the food is good. How many places can you find Raisin Toast??? My only complaint was that some of the wait-staff didn't pay attention when I gave my order and I sometimes had to ask for my check. Otherwise, it's a good, inexpensive breakfast!"
3,"The food and selection are reliably good if you go when they first open or when they are ramping up for dinner. Never at the end of lunch or dinner. It's all just leftovers by then. Mostly old n' cold..

We went to the Avondale location Sunday night with some out of town friends. We had our handy 15% coupon that they distribute liberally in the local mail. When we went to pay they had forgotten to give us the discount.. When we told the cashier that  they had forgotten she asked for the coupon. We told her that they had taken the coupon when we were seated, as they always do. 

She flatly refused to give us the discount. When we asked for the manager she claimed to be the manager. We told her what poor management it was to hassle us at all over a 15% coupons you can get on the internet.. We asked for the number for the owner. We asked if she was the owner too and she said ""Yes."" -- Really??!!?. She eventually even held her hand out in front of our friends face.

I haven't been treated this rudely in a long time. Especially at a restaurant I visit fairly frequently with my family and friends.. We had just told our friends how good they were and then this happened."
3,"Good happy hour, always get the grilled chicken salad and content with it. Very good service and fun on birthdays"
3,"The atmosphere was warm and campy with candles in old wine bottles, and the wine served in table glasses. 

The staff is all visible because the kitchen is at the front, so all their antics are on display. I actually had tip money thrown at me inadvertently, which was all part of the fun. 

The french cut pork chop was awesome, topped with caramelized onions. Grilled rapini was excellent, as was the shrimp with spicy pea puree. 

As a gluten intolerant person, my options were limited. I prefer their other restaurant, 5 Doors North."
3,"They did a better job than Jacksons Car wash. The waiting time was much longer and the sales guy kept bugging me for windshield repair. Very annoying after I said, NO two times."
3,"North Park Lounge is always a go to when you can't think of anything else, but it's always pretty decent. Best deal half a hoagie and 2 small pieces of pizza. Also, an amazing fish sandwich."
3,"I would gladly give this place another star, but I just can't bring myself. 

The drinks here are delicious, just to die for. I usually never drink the sweet cocktails, a simple martini is all I need, but it was my hubby's first time here, so we decided to try what they had to offer. I can't remember the name, but it had caramel in it and it was fantastic.

However, after a few drinks, Frank ordered a beer, Guinness to be exact, and since they did not serve it on tap, he settled for a bottle. When the bill came, my jaw dropped. I expect to pay $15 or even more for some cocktails here. After all this is the Bellagio. But to charge $11 for a bottle of Guinness? I was flabbergasted. Shame, 'cause I really liked that place."
3,"As I'm currently on mat leave, in the east end, I'm making it my personal mission to try as many new cafés and have been ordering a single shot latte at each place.

Last week bought Latte to go, after purchasing a mobile at the toy store next door. At $4.70 this is one of the most expensive ones around! Mind you, it is also bigger than most, but a bit too big for my own personal liking. 

The cafe was full, as we were there right around 12:30, but we weren't able to stay anyways, as the bebe was fussing. Seemed like a cute place, but won't make a special trip out."
3,"Stopped by for dinner after shopping in north hills one evening. 

I ordered a fish sandwich and fries. It wasn't bad. It was also filling. 

My bf ordered the eggplant parmesan entree. He felt the sauce on the pasta did not taste homemade but loved the actual eggplant and meatballs. His entree was also served with garlic knots and choice of soup or salad. Great entree deal.

Not a bad option for north hills"
3,Lazy daisy cafe was quaint and hipstery. The service was slow but the food was fresh although not very flavorful. The do have fresh oj which was cool and tables and some couches where you could bring your laptop or a book.
3,"A gringo friendly Filibertos, with a salsa bar and higher prices is the best way to describe this place. 

From the outside it looks like a newer cleaner style store front Mexican food place. Inside not much of a surprise, menu above, counter to order and get food at and tables.

The menu has Burritos, tacos, salads and enchiladas. Prices are a bit more than expected a lunch will set you back $6-9 w/o a drink. Meals do include a small try of chips if you ask for them. 

They will also give you two small plastic cups to attack their salsa bar with. The red salsa is nothing special. The green has great flavor,  the picco is nice and fresh.

I went with the daily special which was cheese enchiladas with rice and beans for $5.99  In reality this should be a 3.99 dish 4.99 at most. The enchiladas were soft and mushy, likely out of a tray and not made to order.

I may go back to try a burrito but I am in no rush. There are plenty of other Mexican options in this area of town."
3,"The rating is true to the food quality.  

I first ordered from then a year ago and we are New Yorkers so we will always get pizza and wings.  Original crust is thick so we prefer the thin crust.  Still, the thin crust is nothing like a Brooklyn pizza.  The sauce is ok and not too sweet.  Overall, pizza is ok for being in AZ and much better than Papa John's, Dominos or Pizza Hut.  Our local fav is Jimmy and Joe's Pizza. 

The wings....now this is where they go really wrong.  First order we learned to order them extra crispy because if not...the skin is soft and soggy.  When we ordered over the phone for delivery or pick up, we always get what we want.  This is the first time we ordered online, extra crispy wings and 1 cold cut sandwhich and we were not happy.  Took 45 min for delivery that was about 1 mile from our house. Wings were NOT cooked extra crispy.  We also ordered Garlic Parm and they were greasy.  (See pictures)

 I think we will keep to the traditional sauce, we may not order online again and we will pick."
3,"We are in Vegas. We expect a bit more. It's normal right? Everything in Vegas is done in grand and sophistication. We wonder what's wrong with this place because it's so small. Nothing really stands out in the place.

I think I'd give this place a better rating if they don't pretend to be a private lounge in the middle of the casino. It's just a bar with about 6 or 7 tables. 

The host was trying to persuade us into buying a table with $300 worth of drinks but we refused. He let us have the table anyway because it was not packed that night. How nice of him."
3,"Main reason for coming here is they have Mongolian BBQ.  The only place in west Phoenix that offers this specialty. And it's delicious. They also have a variety of shrimp, seafood, and meat dishes. My Favs are chow mein, bacon wrapped shrimp, walnut prawns, egg custard tarts,and BBQ pork.  Priced right! Overall if you are looking for a buffet this is pretty good."
3,"Stayed here for one night. This is your standard Embassy Suites with the beautiful water fountain which is part of their brand. The guy at the Front desk on Sunday was friendly and asked if we enjoyed our stay. Told him Embassy known for their water fall/fountain. He informed there will be renovations and the waterfall will be taken down. Wonder since it is part of Hilton chain that's why they making these changes. 

So here is my review of this hotel.

Check in on Saturday only one person working at front desk. She asked for name, an id and credit card, got keys to room and directed where to get the elevators. Informed what time Manager reception and time frame for breakfast. I have stayed in many Embassy for business travel in the past, so I know the protocol, but imagine if this was your first visit to this hotel and did not know where everything was. Guess, customer service has changed a lot these days. When you approach the front desk is it not standard nor customary these days to say hello or how can I help you. Realize it not the Westin, Mandarin Hotel nor Omni.

As for Manager reception, it's great there is no charge for patrons but stale chips and nacho chips- what is up with that?  

Breakfast was good their omelettes was made to order."
3,"Ordered the chicken supreme thin crust and it was okay. It didn't really look like thin crust and it was kind of soggy. They do put a lot of topping on it, but I would have rather gotten the thin crust at dominos."
3,Loved Barros old recipe. Sauce and crust is different. Staff very nice every time. Just so much crust.
3,"It's nice going to a place with all sorts of different poutine options, but I can't say that I was impressed with the food. It is definitely worth checking out with friends, but I am in no rush to head back anytime soon."
3,"Caramel is strictly a LOUNGE. Don't let their booming top 40's music let you think of it as anything else.

This is a nice place to relax and mingle for people in their late 20's and older. Other patrons need not bother coming by.

As sophisticated as this place may look, it does boom loud hip-hop and pop beats, but the dominant vibe in this place is ""sit down, talk, and sip."" 

These two mixed messages made for a night of being too young, too drunk, and being the only people on the ""dancefloor."" Boo.

If you're looking to have a nice chat and a couple of cocktails with a date or small group of friends, this place is lovely. If you want to have a more dynamic, dance-filled experience, do not go here."
3,"After having read Chris B's review and then seeing them later the next day at the Wednesday evening Phoenix Market I decided to give them a try.  
Initially looking and the Cajun Steak Jamburrito, after talking to the chef I decided to just go with the Cajun Steak Jambalaya bowl ($5.99). While waiting I was given a hush puppy to sample...light and crispy just like I like 'em.  Contemplating getting an order I figured it would be too much food. 
 I received my bowl of savory rice mixed with some veggies like peas, corn, carrot topped with a portion of spicy steak and some slices of sausage.  It was very much comfort food.  I did have to put a generous sprinkle of hot sauce to add a touch more heat and flavor but it was a very welcome addition.  
While it didn't knock my socks or wow me, it reminded me of a few things I whip up at home now and again. I left content, full and happy I tried a new food truck."
3,"If you get stuck in Charlotte and are flying US Airways, you might end up here.  The rooms are spacious, and clean... relatively comfortable.  Their little general store was out of stock of everything, so we ended up having to walk to a CVS, but we were able to get the hotel shuttle to come and pick us up on the way back which was nice.  The room service meal we ordered was good, but way over priced.  The internet is also not free, which always is a -1 star for me."
3,"3.5 is my rating.
I'm not a huge fan of viet sandwiches so I don't have them often. Last time I had Banh Mi Boys was at the downtown location, probably 2 years ago. 

Steamed Bao - Pulled Pork and 5 Spice Pork Belly (approx $3.50 each)
Steamed buns stuff with meat, carrots, and a slice of cucumber and cilantro. The pulled pork was slightly dry and not saucy enough. As for the pork belly I couldn't taste the '5 spice', in fact there wasn't much flavor. The pork belly meat was surprisingly slightly tough, not as tender as I anticipated. 
Duck Confit Banh Mi ($6) - This sandwich was large. The duck meat was tender and flavorful.
The Kalbi Beef taco ($4) was actually my favorite. The taco skin wasn't your typical taco soft shell, but tasted more like a roti kinda style. The kabli was flavorful, with all the ingredients it was really tasty!
Portions were quite large though, well worth the price. Generous in terms of ingredients which was unexpected."
3,"The poutine was not as good as I had expected.   Too many fries, not enough cheese curds!  However, the fries were delicious as was the gravy.  It was more the ratio that was off.  There are better places, but it's worth a try!"
3,"Embassy Suites are usually good.  This location is nice because it is close to the airport and near several dining establishments and bars.  The complimentary breakfast was great.  Had a basic hot bar and also a station where custom orders can be placed, to include: pancakes, french toast, sausage, bacon, eggs and omelettes.  The reason for the three stars was the rooms.  They were old and not the cleanest.  The rooms surround a center courtyard which was a nice view.  Would stay again, but would not be my first choice.  Free Wall Street Journal or USA Today.  Plenty of free parking."
3,"This was only my 2nd time eating poutine and this place was pretty good! 

I ordered a regular sized porky pig and liked it. It was the perfect portion for me as well. Tried my friend's pulled pork and it was a little too sweet for my liking. Also, I expected more cheese curds and they weren't even that melted

The service threw me off a little bit. My group of 3 ordered and about 5 min later 1 more customer. Cashier was nice and friendly, but she delivered the random customer's order of plain poutine to me. My friend said she saw the chef in the window shaking his head LOL 
Then she came back and tried to deliver the wrong fries to the wrong person again. I can only imagine what happens when there's a bigger crowd in here!"
3,"Located in Westgate but the atmosphere makes it seem like your in a swanky place. To start off your given a Gruyere popover which was slightly over cooked but good. I  can't help comparing it to BLT Steak popovers since that is their signature bread. BLT has them beat...Silk Road spicy shrimp appetizer wonderful! Manhattan Sirloin good but not great. Cooked exactly right but not sure why not in love. Maybe seasoning? Lobster risotto terrible. Not really any black truffles, tons of sliced mushrooms of other kinds, salty & barely any lobster. Had more truffle flavor in the fries my husband got with his steak. Sent back & didn't eat. It was taken off the bill. Sat at the bar & service was wonderful. That would b the only reason for me for going back."
3,Nice clean place but they are expensive 22.00 for the works wash I usually pay 17.00 or 18.00 for the same thing other places
3,Great place to stop. The service was good and so was the food. Simple menu with all the basics.  This joint is pretty small though but still a good stop for early or late breakfast.
3,Very unimpressed. Sesame Chicken tasted bland and there was nothing special about their food at all.
3,Hotel renovations seem to be done. Breakfast buffet and daily happy hour are the positives. The room was spacious and nice. Staff is very friendly and helpful. There was a good amount of mold in our mini-fridge but housekeeping promptly came and cleaned it. Single laundry machine was dirty with rust and mold.
3,"Formerly was Woodie Wood Chucks (I believe?), walking into the restaurant you wouldn't recognize. 

We were seated right away and our orders were taken however it took about 45 minutes to receive our food. But  we saw some of the workers just chatting right next to us.We could even hear there staff 'meeting' and how some of the employees will be let go... well I could name a few. 

We ordered the platter which included Mild, Sweet & Spicy Thai ( I think?), Honey and the hottest they got. Managed to get through the 5 hot ones without any issues. All the wings were good however the fries not the best.. not compared to Wild Wings.

Finished up and paid.. and headed over to play some pool.  It was good until it took about 20 minutes just to pay for a 45 minute game. We were sent from the hostess back to the bar about 3 times each.

I'll be back, maybe it was just a bad night? Give it another try. Maybe it will change the star rating.

I did like that each booth had its own flat screen."
3,"In general, I am always satisfied with NPL. I live close and it's always a go-to for a quality, delicious meal at the right price. My boo and I stopped in for lunch and sat ourselves, but didn't realize the table was dirty till we sat. A lady came over to wipe it and did not acknowledge our existence whatsoever ... Super awkward and she looked miserable as all hell. Lucky this woman was not our server. We were greeted shortly after and from that point the service was very commendable. My boo got the giant fish sandwich and as you see in the photos, it lived up to its namesake. I got the BBQ chicken appetizer dip as my meal because I had t before at the cranberry location and it was fantastic... This time tho it was not as delicious. Also I asked for flatbread with it instead of chips and was told it was a $1 upcharge. That didn't make sense to me because the spinach artichoke dip comes with the flatbread and it's the same price... But whatever. Chips were stale and I ended up getting the flatbread anyway which was very good. Overall a pleasant lunch experience for the most part ."
3,"The world is your buffet so put on your stretchy pants and enjoy!

The reason I come here is for the BBQ ribs, the mini steaks, and noodles. I also like the crawdads. Other than that, the food is pretty standard Chinese buffet faire. Don't cone expecting the world's best egg drop soup or pants-dropping fried rice. Be real and be reasonable, y'all.

The waitresses here are good looking and the place is pretty clean. 3-stars all around!"
3,"The first time I had BMB was in downtown (the dundas one near Ryerson) couple years ago. It was a lot busier, and I remember the Banh Mi stuffed with meat and veggies. This time, I got the Duck Confit Banh Mi and Kimchi Fries. The Banh Mi came in your regular huge Viet bun size, enough to last me a meal and half. It was still stuffed with all the veggies but the meat seems to reduce significantly. I still prefer the sketchy Chinatown Banh Mis a bit more, for a cheaper price too. Kimchi fries were good, will probably get them again when I go back.

It's not a tiny store, they have couple seats and tables around the restaurant. It gives off a ""fast food restaurant"" vibe but you'll definitely have to wait longer than that for your food."
3,"Nice place to come pre-game. Don't know that I'd want to spend the whole night there. Unless you really like laid back lounge. It's really a small place. All the servers were nice, they gave out free shots."
3,"I went back to try it again, Had a fish burrito for 5.59 over $6 with tax.

It was ""ok"" as was my co workers tacos, and just ok for these prices 
was a let down.

Read my previous review for more details on this spot."
3,"Update: Seriously disappointed that my gel polish chipped and peeled after ONLY two weeks. I've never had gels last such a short period of time. All the gel manis I've gotten have lasted 3-4 weeks, usually leaning on the 4 week end. Not sure if it's their application process or the quality of their products, but sadly I won't be returning now with gels only lasting 2 weeks."
3,"I've been to the North Park Lounge in the past, but not at this location. The one I've been to before had games, and a totally different atmosphere. It wasn't until my boyfriend and I came here for my birthday this past week that we realized this one didn't have games, a little disappointing, but we got over it, it was our own faults for not googling it before coming here. This place was well decorated inside, it was all done up for Halloween and it was pretty cool. I did not like how crammed you felt in here though. Unless you sat at your own booth you're basically sitting side by side other people at other tables, and really can't have your own conversations. 
Compared to the previous time I've gone here, the menu seemed different. I believe when I went years ago, I had some sort of Parmesan crusted chicken and pasta, but didn't see anything like that on this menu. We started off our meal with an order of their mozzarella bites. Which were truly fantastic. They came with a sauce that was phenomenal. My boyfriend ordered a 14inch pepperoni pizza, and it was god awful. I took two bites of it and didn't like it whatsoever. He did like it however. (Maybe it's just me?) Luckily, I ordered my own meal, which was a big juicy cheeseburger and fries. My burger was perfect, and the fries were so good. Since him and I are such gluttons, we also ordered the pepperoni roll, which came stuffed with cheese, pepperoni, and banana peppers. It was okay, nothing to brag over. There was next to no banana peppers in it, and it was 95% cheese and like 5% dough. The bread to cheese ratio was super off to me. 
Overall the experience was okay. The food wasn't anything to brag over, the environment made me sort of claustrophobic. Our server was very friendly and attentive however, we definitely tipped her well for being so respectful and nice on a busy Saturday evening. My honest opinion is that I'd only come here if invited by someone and definitely not by choice, but maybe to one that has games. But more for the games than the food."
3,"The food is amazing. The coconut shrimp, sushi selection is awesome. My kids love it. 

Only downer is the staff is rude as heck. They have eye rolling when you ask for anything to the expert level!"
3,Just go 2 Lo Lo's. Not moved by anything on the menu but the staff were super exellent. Asked 4 cheese on my eggs & grits & they threw SLICED sandwich cheese on it. Terrible.
3,"Cozy cafe and very friendly staffs.
waitress(?) helped me to order for my quick lunch with daughter.
it was ok food with high end restaurant portion."
3,"The Edge Steakhouse in the Westgate was a quiet and elegant place to have dinner before attending a play at UNLV.  I had a reservation for 5 PM and was seated immediately after they opened.  My server, Mark, was excellent and his assistant, Max, was good, too!

I had studied the menu online and I ended with the following order--wild mushroom soup for a starter, the 10 ounce Manhattan sirloin (asked for it done blue), and for a side I got the lobster risotto.

Shortly after getting my iced tea, I was brought a Gruyere cheese popover in lieu of bread and a cup of soft butter.  The popover was excellent.  (Eat the popover while it's hot--it loses the popover fluffiness if you let it cool).

The mushroom soup was good although it wasn't the most appealing looking dish there could be.  When it was time for the main course, I heard a runner behind me ask ""black and blue"" and I knew he was delivering my steak.  The problem here is I didn't order it black and blue--just blue.  The char was good but to get it the steak was overcooked.  If I want it black and blue that's the way I'll order it.  The lobster risotto was OK.  There were some nice pieces of lobster but I'd recommend a different side.  I regretted not getting the truffle fries.

For dessert, I got the quad small cups of the following--S'mores Edge, red velvet cake, key lime pie, and cheesecake coulis.  The key lime was excellent and the s'mores was good.  The other two were just OK.  They almost looked like the servings that buffets are doing now.

Service was excellent as I stated.  Iced tea was refilled without needing to ask and Mark checked on my progress regularly.

The prices are high and are in line with some of the better steakhouses on the Strip which doesn't make sense.  They're Las Vegas Hilton prices in a Westgate world.

The meal was Ok but the food and the prices do not merit a return visit."
3,"went here on a Weds night back in July. 

Had a passion fruit mojito, while the boys had caramel-tini & jack & cokes or something, bill came out to be a little more than $50 for 4 drinks.

We were contemplating where to sit, but were directed by the friendly staff that we could sit anywhere without a ""reserved"" sign. Cool place to chill, but didn't know if we could get rowdy or buzzed off $14+/drink so headed out elsewhere."
3,"Not the best wings I have had but it hit the spot when I was craving wings yesterday. Wish I could give it 2.5 stars. Ordered honey garlic, new orleans and applwood smoke flavours. The new orleans and apple wood smoked were very similar. The honey garlic was ok. The atmosphere and decor is fun. Huge TV screens for sports fans. The service was great. 
AYCE wings for $18.99 on Wednesdays. You can order different flavours. Also ask for non breaded otherwise they will bring you breaded. I will be going back for the AYCE wings. I also will go back and check out the other items on the menu."
3,Very solid homemade Italian food. Limited menu. Restaurant is pretty cramped. Service sucked.
3,"I made plans with a group of 6 last Friday for a Saturday night dinner in midtown--not exactly the best timing. Thanks to Yelp I discovered 7 Numbers Restaurant. Luckily they take reservations of 6 or more, so they had a table for us. (It's not easy booking a large reservation the day before). 

7 Numbers seems to be a family business. There's an open kitchen at the front and you can peer in through the window from the street which is a pretty cool idea. They have an ever-changing menu displayed on a chalk board. The space is small, but they did a good job of spacing out the tables and the noise level was fine despite it being full. I'm happy we were a large group because there was a lineup almost out the door last Saturday at 8pm. I suggest you get here early or eat with a group of 6 if you come here. 

The service was very good once our group arrived. The wine list by the glass was small and I had a chianti which I wouldn't recommend. 

We had:

Barretta - 2/5 skip this, I have had much better Baretta. It was cold and bland. I like the pickled vegetables it came with.

Beet salad - 4/5 if you like beets go for it! It was beets, gorgonzola cheese and almonds. 

Caprese salad - 1/5 It looked dismal. Small balls of cheese with pale slices of tomato. 

Veal meatballs - 5/5 everyone loved these

Veal lasagna - 3/5 2 people ordered this. One person loved it, one person though it was Okay.

Fish of the day 5/5- it was a Branzino and it was AMAZING. There were some bones in it, but it didn't even matter it was so tasty. 

Somebody had the linguini I didn't try it but she loved it. I can not give it a rating. 

Also, the Osso Buco was sold out by 8:30 when we placed our order, so it must be really good. 

Desert: 

apple cheese cake 2/5 
Flourless chocolate cake 2/5 
Both desserts were bland and a bit on the dry side. 

The bill came to $200 with the tip. VERY REASONABLE. 

If you're looking for a casual, no fuss, home-cooked Italian meal 7 Numbers is the place for you. If you want something a bit fancier with more complex favours, it may not be the best choice."
3,"Clean but dated rooms.  The breakfast was one of the worst I have ever had from an Embassy Suits.  All the hot buffet food items were cold.  Bacon remained as bacon bits submerged in their own grease.  There was only two staff members at the omelette station, so the line was 15 people deep."
3,"Alright. So first of all, I have to admit that I am very cheap. I don't like paying more than $15 for a meal and if I do that, I want to be full at the end. $20 at tops, if I'm not doing buffet or all you can eat. This isn't my kind of restaurant, not because it has small tasting plates, but because these tasting plates are not in my desired price range.

Had:

Calamari ($8.50) - about 7-8 small pieces of calamari. A small mixed lettuce salad below. Calamari was tender, but quite salty. Also not fried as crispy as I would like it. Salad was more a garnish than anything. A palate cleanser if you will.

Caprese salad ($12.50) - I've never paid $12.50 for four slices of tomato and three average sized slices of cheese, two or three basil leaves and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil before. I feel incredibly ripped off. Yes, it was buffalo mozzarella, but for that price, I'm still expecting more. I've had buffalo caprese before, for cheaper, and there was considerably more of it. Quite disappointing.

Burrata ($14) - for $14, this was the most decent appetizer we got, from a price/portion/quality ratio perspective. Good enough portion of burrata to share between the four of us. Probably about five cherry tomatoes halved (so ten cherry tomato halves). Two thick wedges of bread. It would have been nice to have more bread. The burrata was quite nice, but I expected the inside to be slightly more creamy. It was lovely and fresh tasting though. Super light. Went great with the olive oil and a touch of vinegar. Yum.

Veal Lasagna ($10.75) - This wasn't horrible for the price, but I expected it to be bigger. If this is the $10.75 portion, I'm quite curious as to what the $7.50(?) portion looks like, but not curious enough to come back to check. Taste-wise, it was quite good. Tomato sauce wasn't overwhelming. You could taste the veal, which was nice. The pasta was quite tasty. The parmesan cheese was served on the side, but I opted out of it. My dad, who did put the parmesan cheese on, said that the cheese + the lasagna was quite salty. Mine (sans cheese) was only slightly salty. I attribute it to the bite of the cheese inside the lasagna.

Pork chop ($15) - Alright in terms of portion, but by no means outstanding. Modest sized chop. Frenched. Served with a small portion of roasted onions and peppers. Shared among four people, it amounted to about a bite and a half per person. 

Service was lovely, although there was a slip up of a mistaken order. We were served two things that weren't ours, and after we let them know, these two were removed from the table (I think I might have accidentally breathed on the server's arm as he put those two dishes on the table, or I may have breathed on those dishes themselves...sorry to whoever received them after). It was very nice of them to recommend Hotel Gelato for dessert after we told them we weren't interested in cake. 

The ambiance was comfy, if a tad small. Our table had two candles, and with the olive oil and the vinegar bottles along with the candles, it left not much space for our plates, which we were sharing. I almost burned my arm a couple times. 

Interesting thing to note. We had four people at the table. Two had steak knives and two had butter knives. Odd.

All in all, the food here is good, but the portions leave something to be desired. Would I come again? Sure...if I wasn't paying."
3,Place was ok. Too much oil in the omelette unless you ask for light oil. Food tastes ok if you are in a hurry. Friendly service. If you have more time to eat you should go over to the peppersauce cafe.
3,"This is a good place for a smaller lounge vibe.  Decent DJ, some stools, so the girls can sit and rest their feet.  Some of the people in our party were smoking, and the staff was wonderful about cleaning out the ashtrays regularly.  After a night here standing with a bunch of smokers, I did not smell like smoke, and that's a testament to the Vegas ventilation and the staff's quick work.

For someone's first trip to Vegas, this would be a good starter club if you're scared of places where the bouncers only pick the pretty people.  It would also be a good place to go if you were too partied out from the previous day/night to go to a major club."
3,"We usually come as a fam for dinner & the main dishes are pretty tasty, soup was ok & place is clean. So we've been here a few times. I haven't tried the bbq yet. Not because it looks bad but there's no covers on the meats & no one standing there to bbq so I'm skeptical. I'm sure it's just fine it's just me. We ventured in for lunch & what we thought was good for dinner was better for lunch especially the soups. The lunch soups seemed thicker & tastier. Mmmm good. As you can tell I'm a soup kind of girl. I really like the hot & sour. I tried the sushi & for a buffet it was really good. We'll back for a lunch on my next Monday off."
3,"My first Waffle House experience. Good simple food and nice portions. Jerimiah was outstanding and hustling, but the service to get a seat and to pay to leave is sloooow. The crew was hustling and getting orders out, could be cleaned up a tad, as others have said, but the effort of the staff was 100% to me."
3,"Went there yesterday for dinner with a group of friends.  
The food was delicious and the atmosphere was very nice too. 
The reason I gave them only 3 stars is because first, my friend was being rushed by a waiter to give him back the iPad menu before she had the chance to decide because he needed to take it to another table. Off to a bad start.
I was also disappointed that a proper Italian restaurant does not offer beef or salmon carpaccio - usually a staple in a good Italian restaurant. 
Then we asked for tiramisu and the waitress said that this location does not have it but their other location on Danforth does.
We all looked at one another not quite sure what to do with this information???
The food we did get was fresh and delicious.  
One of the best osso bucos I've had (And I've had many all over the world including in Italy)
Overall not bad but definitely room for improvement...
Prices are very reasonable."
3,"Cozy, caramel colored themed lounge. Good place to get a drink or two with some friends. Music and drinks were pretty good. There was no cover for us and we got 2 for 1 drinks that night. We were all clubbed out from the 3 previous days and wanted to just relax and mingle with drinks. We decided on Caramel because we happened to be at the Bellagio. 

We ordered numerous drinks and got a nice buzz, hung out, danced and just talked about the Las Vegas trip. Too bad for me we left at 3 AM because I went to the poker room right after and lost a $1200 pot! LOL! 

I can see myself coming back if I'm around. I think Blush is a nicer lounge though."
3,Had my car washed and oil changed there several times and never had a problem.
3,"Attention aspiring science fiction writers:  check out this place.  Remember the movie Back to the Future?  Now, imagine 1985, a time when feminist rhetoric was having it last push as an integral social and academic force in the western world.  What would the world look like if that impetus took over and controlled a segment of the population?  You can have a legitimate peek at this hypothesis at Lazy Daisy's.  Run by Ms. Audible and Mr. Whipped, this venue caters credibly well to reasonable locals with young families.  Beyond the obvious, however, there is a manifest political statement:  a collage of women operating the place as if they are the show, an ambience that assumes an awareness raising collective conscience at the expense of individual comfort, and a selection of food and beverage that auspiciously challenges one to ask for ""regular"" food with the trepidation  of Oliver Twist.  You have heard of eco-fasism?  Here is feminist model."
3,"Clearly, the offering is a notch above what the neighbourhood offers anywhere for a square kilometre.  But, in a neighbourhood which is so impoverished that it only has a crack problem one day per month, that's not hard to do.  That someone chose to do it, however, is commendable; we can hope it bodes well.  Attention to detail within the operation is noticable and appreciated.  While I can like the alternative it represents it could not become an absolute favourite of mine simply because its small and cluttered with staff.  The physical infrastructure renders the presence of the staff more prominent than the refreshing experience I would be looking for in a cafe -- its hard to feel like I'm enjoying a reprieve from the hustle bustle of life when the noisy staff represents merely another version of it."
3,"Chico's is popular with me and my lunch clique from work. It's fast, cheap, pretty good, and in the same shopping center as Starbucks (perfect for a post-lunch stop when we want to kill more time before heading back to the office). The chicken soft tacos are kinda bland, but the quesadillas are pretty good. WAY better than Baja Fresh or a place like that. The salsa bar is definitely the highlight of Chico's with a good variety. I'm partial to the pico de gallo myself.  It's a good place to satisfy a Mexican craving when I'm sober.  The only thing I don't like about Chico's is that it's on the corner of McDowell and 7th Street, which makes turning left out of the parking lot almost impossible."
3,$1 Tacos on Tuesday are great!!  Good size and plenty of meat in them...
3,"this place is GOOD.... for the first plate and then leaves you feeling a little gross on the way out. I've tried similar chinese buffets before in my hometown and I can say that's standard. I liked the sushi selection with the buffet style, the noodles seemed very dry and harder than they should have been. service was ok. might be back depending on how hungry I get"
3,"Wings are great, excellent selection of flavours. Service was not too good, wait time is long especially after the first  batch of wings. But overall pretty enjoyable experience if you don't mind waiting at times!"
3,"We hit North Park for lunch and it was OK.. The menu is bar food with nothing outstanding. The burger that I had was not exceptional but OK. All in all if your in the area and you have this as an option, you won't loose."
3,"It's a lounge. They serve alcohol. They play music. Simple.

Nothing to compliment it on. And nothing to complain about. Average.

Great for older people, I guess."
3,"Cheap food, yummy tacos, generous portions, excellent salsa bar and lard free beans. AND THEY HAVE BEER. Enough said."
3,"Only knocked down 1 star because I assumed that on a Thursday night this club would be a little more poppin' but.....it wasn't....it's a small lounge with a modern look inside...it was almost empty, a big group celebrating a birthday and some others....cover was free which is always a plus, and the reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the music was really good :) all the good new songs were playing and i couldn't stop shaking my ass. 

Would love to check this place out on a busier night :)"
3,What a racket!  Ambient noise continues to plague this spot.  The result is that its about as comfortable to sit in as a McDonalds.  Bottom line: unrealized potential.
3,"I really want to be able to give this cute independent eatery 5 stars, but they just can't seem to get the service part of their business together. I shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes to get a grilled cheese sandwich and a breakfast biscuit only to have them get my order wrong. The food is good, but not worth the wait."
3,"I definitely overhyped myself for this place, it was definitely good, but I was expecting mind blowing. If you manage your expectations you will be very pleased. I had a fried chicken steamed bun and a five spice pork belly steamed bun with jalapeño, both were tasty, but I liked the fried chicken best. Don't be fooled, these steamed buns are quite large, I expected more of a snack size. My husband  had the Kalbi beef Banh Mi and it was good."
3,Their pizza is delicious and the prices are doable. I did notice that they like to burn their pizza a little bit on the crust. I like my pizza cooked but not that cooked. I need to take it out of the oven little bit earlier.The service is good when you eat in. Delivery normally takes 45 minutes to an hour.
3,"came here with a group of friends for an 8pm reservation. we were seated immediately and saw the italian nonna that was featured on the website, so i knew the food was going to be good. we went with the family style meal which came with x many starters, x many salads, x many pastas and a main of individual choice. i went with the ""sexy duck leg"", because i live and breathe for duck. and let's be honest...the name expresses my sentiments towards duck precisely. 

the salads were descent, but who screws up salad, right? the calamari was DELICIOUS and included plenty of tentacles (my fav). the pasta was LEGIT AMAZING. so i had high hopes for the duck leg. 

i got my duck leg and it was COVERED in fennel. CRUSTED in fennel. nowhere on the menu does it say fennel because i would have ordered the lamb shank instead. fennel = deal breaker. 

so i removed the skin completely to try the meat, just to be hit with an unreasonable amount of salt. my dad is from shanghai...we eat A LOT of salty food. i've been told that i prefer things much saltier than the average person. this duck leg was one of the saltiest things i've ever had in my mouth in recent history, short of eating salt directly from the shaker. i ate it anyway, punctuated with large gulps of water in between each bite. when the server came to collect the plates, he asked how it was. i said that i was very salty. the host came to me and said, ""sorry you got a salty duck leg. it usually happens with later reservations."" i appreciated his apology for what it was, but what does that MEAN exactly that duck legs get saltier later on in the evening? do you marinate it in salt water or something???? 

i would definitely go back for the pasta. not for the salty sexy duck leg. 

the lamb shank was amazing though and fell off the bone. highly recommended."
3,Food is a pretty standard Chinese buffet assortment. A little bland overall but a couple of selections I tried were surprisingly good. Very clean and the decor was nice and service was decent. I will visit again.
3,"It's hard to give anything located inside the Bellagio a completely bad review.

Caramel Lounge--small but nice intimate setting if you just want to pop in for a drink or two and mingle for a bit.  Delicious Mojitos.  Once it starts to get crowded though, exit and make your way to another place.  My suggestion would be to go to the Petrossian lounge near the entrance and listen to David Osborne tickle the ivory keys."
3,"i'm not a coffee drinker, so i always feel like a bit of a fraud when talking about cafes... anyway, i went with a friend who had a latte and quite liked it. i had a tea--it was okay. i tried one of their scones (can't remember the flavour) and it was so-so. maybe would have been better if it had been warmed up a bit.
they have a huge, really delicious-looking menu with all kinds of great breakfast-y sandwiches & dishes--i look forward to going again and trying it out."
3,"Food wise 4.5. Pizza is delicious but we had a piece of cardboard or something similar to it from the bottom of the pizza. We told them and they apologize and asked if we wanted anything. We declined this time. Bonesless Wings honey hot was very good. Service was very slow on a Thursday, short staff? But very polite. A lot of people waiting for their to go orders and not one person was at the counter at all times, which is understandable. I would eat here again for food. For now it's a positive 3. Food is a bit pricey and the kids menu is cheap"
3,"Sandwich was good but service was terrible. Went there during rush hour (6:30pm) on a weekday and expected to be in and out. Lady preparing the sandwich was nice and seemed to understand english. Except when she messed up my order, she got really sassy with me, grunting and rolling her eyes. Really did not appreciate. The cashier didn't even apologize for her behaviour. It felt like they were blaming me like I changed my mind, when my order was VERY clear from the start."
3,"I used a $20 Groupon coupon last Saturday for a blowout and deep conditioning treatment.  I'm not sure I actually got the deep conditioning treatment unless you just consider that putting conditioner in my hair and not letting it sit for any amount of time...who knows!?!  The place was nicely decorated and the staff was pretty friendly.  I feel like they tried to rush me since I was using a coupon...might be that way with everyone, not sure.  My hair looked good after the blowout, but again felt rushed and that I didn't get my entire treatment."
3,"I stopped here after doing a little shopping at Last Chance. It was friday night around 6:45 and I could not believe it was completely empty!! not one person in the restaurant. The lady behind the counter was so sweet. She let me order a sandwich with gyro meat and falafel mixed together. The sandwich, fries and a drink were about $8. 

The sandwich was delicious. The fries were average. The hummus was a bit bland. 

One thing that I usually dont like talking about in reviews is the restrooms. HOWEVER I cant keep my mouth shut about this one. It was reallllly gross. The floors looked clean but that is about it. The toilet and the urine need to be cleaned BAD.... like reallly bad. It kind of made me lose my appetite.

I may go back to this restaurant, but will never use that restroom again."
3,"Every now and then I do actually step outside of my comfort zone and try different Starbucks locations other than my normal regular location. I'm almost never in North Las Vegas, but I had a meeting for work that just happened to be not too far from this Starbucks. Located right off the Craig Rd & I-15N exit I knew that with it being a peak time of the morning that they would b e pretty packed and well...  I was right! 

When I arrived, the drive-thru was actually wrapped around the building! Thank GOD for mobile order right?! Well yes to an extent... one of the things that was a little frustrating with this particular visit was a few items I ordered ahead of time weren't actually available. With all the money Starbucks makes, they HAVE to figure something out in the IT department with this application that won't allow customers to order things that are either sold out or out of stock. Currently that feature is available however not on ALL items... Other than that little bump in the road this was an okay visit with decent customer service!."
3,"3.5 stars

Beautiful decor and spacious. 
Good for groups and large parties

Extensive menu with many Turkish food options. Noticed there were a few dishes only available on weekends.

We got the Turkish tea - a bit too bitter for my taste.

Adana kebob meal - meat was tender, juicy, and flavourful. Really really good. A

Donor pide - meat wrapped in Pastry. Very delicious! Must try. Only available on weekends. A+


We had the kunefe for dessert. It's shredded wheat wrapped with mozzarella cheese with syrup. It was pretty delicious! A

5% off the bill if you show your Yelp.

It is pretty expensive because portions are small. I recall getting two kebobs when I go to other restaurants and it's priced the same. This is why I give this place a 3.5 star. I would give it a 4.5 for food but the price and portion size drops it by one. Still worth a try though."
3,"Western PA is very scarce of korean restaurants. 

Parking is very limited and on the street. If I wasn't looking carefully, I probably just skipped this place. Not really visual.

I ordered Pork Belly (Sam Kyup Sal), but the price is ridiculous. The price of all the meat items are ridiculous and the portion was small. I could eat more than one portion, but the price was too stiff for me.

The taste was okay. 

Other than meat menu items, others little better priced."
3,"Solid breakfast.  Great service.  Our waitress was a little older and so good.  Bought the food out fast, due to only two arms she would serve a couple of plates and then acknowledge what would be out next. Know when to refill our cups and glasses.  The Blueberry Pancakes were good with plump fresh blueberries, and came with a small pitcher of fresh blueberries with some blueberry sauce.   From experience know to order the short stack and our waitress also advised that it was 3 pancakes.  Plenty to eat.  The bacon was crisp and is very thick.  

We always seem to get the front room which is quite noisy, all hard surfaces.  The back room does have carpet, wonder if it is quieter?  Our waitress shifted sides of the table to take orders because she could not here people those at the other end of the table when ordering or their questions.

My glass and others were plastic with cracks in them.  I mentioned it to our waitress and she said she would look for some without the cracks but most were cracked but did not leak and she would do her best.  Maybe IHOP should try a different glass?"
3,"The view from the 44th floor is what makes this place stand out! You can get a panorama view of Toronto.

I also love the vibes here. Super vacation like and relaxed!

I didn't have high expectations of the food because many people said it sucked but to its defence, it was actually not horrible! We came for brunch. Though the food was your typical brunch items and nothing special, they didn't screw anything up! It tasted pretty decent.

Service here sucks. Starting from the reception/reservation to the actual waiter. They knew nothing about the place or anything on the menu. The waiter didn't even know the price of a mimosa! 

Also, he disappeared for basically the entire meal and then took forever for us to pay. Even when we were paying...he left somewhere for 10 minutes and handed the machine to us to take care of. Kind of ridiculous!

Well...even though the service here sucks, I'll still be back because it's a rare gem in the city to have such a nice view!"
3,"Good, but not amazing. Bacon was way too thick and fatty - I am more of a thin and crispy person. Their pancakes are delicious,  just as one would hope as it is in fact 'The Original Pancake House'. Reasonably priced, and a very clean venue. 

Honestly I feel this may be one of Pttsburgh's better venues to go to for breakfast or brunch... they don't seem to have a whole lot else. Going here is worth your while for a tasty meal that is priced right."
3,Average pizza could be better!! And the portion size is very big like who needs a 28 inch pizza slice
3,"Quality of food and the prices were good. Our only complaint was that they ran out of seafood pancakes. Silky Tofu was very good.

It's not very easy to find. We would go back."
3,"Average at best.  I am pretty sure that my buttermilk pancakes, potatoe pancakes, eggs, and sausage links were not cooked enough.  Granted, I recieved my food less than 3 minutes after I ordered but I would have been okay with waiting another 2 minutes for a completely cooked meal.  

My mom's pancake recipe is much better anyway..."
3,"How do I even give a Starbucks less than 4 stars??  What's wrong with me, right?  It's not the staff's fault, they are actually pretty good and I always wonder how a coffee artist at a Starbucks deals with all of us grouchy customers before we had our first cup.  

It's not the actual establishment. It's always clean and there's always someone keeping it clean.  It's a small Starbucks. I think my garage is even bigger.  

My issue with this specific Starbucks is that it's always a long wait in the morning.  I know it has to do with location because the IN-N-Out a block away is also the longest wait as well.  Both the drive through and inside service takes at least 15 minutes, sometimes longer.  I think I'll stick to my Starbucks inside Smith's.  No drive thru, but at least I'm in and out.  

By the way...anyone ever notice that most people in line in the morning have this pissed off look.  I hate my life, I hate mornings look.  Then they get their coffee and it's how you doing and have a nice day.  Yes, that's me too."
3,"Let me preface this review by saying that I do, in fact, have a hard time spending any large sum of money on a pancake.  They're really easy, quick, and cheap to make at home and it irks me when restaurants bump up the price for a stack.  Thank being said- I felt like all prices, portions and quality were wonderful at The Original Pancake House.

I had an order of Three Little Pigs in Blankets.  The pancakes were moist, with a much better flavor than I anticipated.  I loved the sweet and salty of the pancake with the sausage.  

My boyfriend ordered Banana Pancakes.  (He's insisting there were walnuts but I do not see such a dish on their menu whilst checking online) He really enjoyed them, but I did think they were a little too sweet for my taste.

The reason I'm giving the Original Pancake House a 3 star rating is because of it's location and competition.  Not only is it right next door to Denny's (say what you will about their food) but it's right down the road from Gab N Eat and Barb's. The difficult parking lot, that is always full, would definitely sway me to pick Gab N Eat or Barb's- especially if I wasn't in the mood for pancakes."
3,"This pizza joint's signature is serving up huge slices and pies. They're as big or even bigger than the ones served up by Pizza Sola. Unfortunately, the flavor of the pizza doesn't measure up to the size. The crust wasn't very crispy. The end of the crust was pretty much a bread stick. The tomato sauce didn't have much flavor, and the cheese wasn't as savory as I like.

I would rate Benny Fierro's two and a half stars."
3,"UPDATE: 
LMAH kept our pup's reservation so we are able to make our trip after a delay. I am appreciative that the trip is back on, just wish we hadn't experienced the additional stress.

I have to say I am heartbroken. My pup was going to stay here while we took a trip to visit family and celebrate my daughter's birthday. A trip that has been planned for months. I made a reservation several weeks ago because most places fill up quickly. I called the day before (6/8, Friday) to confirm the reservation and make sure I had everything lined up for my pup's stay. They told me to bring her by before 7pm on the 9th (the first day of her stay-Saturday). They close at 5pm on Saturdays. Lone Mountain is not my normal veterinarian so I do not know their hours, which is the reason I called the day before to make sure I knew everything I needed to know for a successful boarding experience for my pup. Guess what, no one was there. Now, the trip is a bust. Grandparents' plans are all for naught. Please, please make sure the information your front office gives people is correct."
3,"The only reason I give this a three star and not a 5 star is Dr Sparks. I took my Max in for his shots and when Dr Sparks walked in he acted like he was annoyed that he had to actually work. He interrupted me when I tried to talk and just grabbed Max and took him to wherever he gave him his shots.  I like this place but I do not like Dr Sparks. No bedside manor, so to speak. Another thing that bothered me was they took Max in the back to get his shots. I don't know what he got or IF he got his shots. When I take my Angel there I will definitely ask for a different doctor and why they take them into the back to get shots. Every vet I have ever been to gave them their shots in front of me."
3,"Benny Fierro's is a chain of pizza shops from Virginia who has recently opened up a location on the bad pizza gauntlet known as East Carson Street.  You probably won't recognize the name Benny Fierro's because each location that they open is given its own specific generic Italian mobster last name.  This place is definitely new and it shows..I tried to call in an order but ""the ringer was broken"".  When you walk in the door you are greeted by a really hilarious mixture of bad art motifs...on one side there is a huge mural or what if I can remember correctly was some kind of crazy animal, I an not sure if the mural is unfinished or just bad.  On the other wall they seem to be going with the random antique/tin sign on the wall motif...the cross country skis and canoe must be on back order.  

When browsing the menu at Benny Hoffa's a certain question comes to mind which is ""where is the menu?"" There is no menu because Benny only offers pizza...which only comes in one size...which is comically over-sized....cut in 8.....which costs 30 dollars for a cheese pie.  Unfortunately this is a gimmick pizza shop, which is a shame because the pizza is actually pretty close to being good were it not so terribly inconvenient. 


The pizzas at Benny Bagadonuts are made in a brick deck oven but unfortunately they use screens underneath them while cooking so the dough ends up a bit raw in spots underneath the sauce. The middle of the pies are so paper thin that the dough can't really hold the toppings so you end up pretty much being forced to eat the pizza with a fork and knife or to fold it in half. At about halfway up the slice the dough starts to even out to an appropriate amount.  The crust of the pies are super thick and puffy and almost hard to eat...I almost didn't eat the crust, which is usually one of my favorite parts of a pizza. The cheese distribution on the pie would be perfect if the middle wasn't as thin, the cheese was evenly distributed and pulled all the way to the edge of the crust.  The sauce was somewhat ample and distributed pretty well across the pie as well.  The pizza could have been cooked a bit longer and was still pretty soft on the bottom.  If they didn't insist on having such a puffy crust than they could flatten it a bit and actually have a bottom thick enough to support everything. 


One thing that stands out about the pizza here is the dough, which I think has a lot more fat in it than most Pittsburgh shops.  Benny Buttafuoco's dough has a nice bready fatty salty taste to it which helps it achieve some sort of crunch despite being made on screens.  I'm not sure if they are using shortening, butter, lard or what but it definitely is a lot more rich than the dough found in most shops around here. The dough has a somewhat medium density, not too dense but definitely lacking the fermentation to make it nice and bubbly.  I would be super curious to try their dough cooked directly on the brick but I can't imagine anyone that works there being able to slide a pie that large off of a peel (or a peel that big even existing).  In general the dough has a great taste with a mediocre consistency.  

I think Benny is using mostly mozzarella cheese although it almost tastes like there is a hint of muenster in there too.  The cheese is high quality and melts well without charring.

Benny Mascarpone's sauce is fine.  They are using decent tomatoes and the consistency is a medium thickness which is pretty desirable for me.  The taste is slightly one dimensional...and the dimension is garlic.  It's not an offensive amount of garlic I just wish that I could taste the tomatoes more.  There seems to be some herbs in there too but the garlic is taking over.  



In general this pizza is still pretty good by the standards of this city and I will probably continue to eat a slice here once in a while but overall the pizza is not good enough to justify its own ridiculousness.  Pizza is supposed to be easy, convenient and cheap...you aren't supposed to have to tilt it to fit it in your front door, somewhere along the way Benny Lemonjello forgot that.  This place is a fun gimmick for drunk people who want to marvel over an excessively large slice of pizza.  The menu would make it seem they have no interest in selling pizzas to families or businesses, only to drunks. If they would take the same ingredients and offer an 18' pie it would taste much much better than the pie they make now because it would be made better and would cook the whole way.  E. Carson Street has seen shops with better pizza than this close (pizza sola for example) so if Benny Piscopo wants to make it in this city he is going to have to step his game up.

3,"CAME FOR TACOS DOWN THE STREET BUT I WAS COMPELLED TO THE FALAFEL!

It was soooo hot this weekend! I biked with ""Newspaper Photographer"" and was looking for a tasty eat that wouldn't be heavy on my stomach. We drove up looking for tacos but than I saw the sign for Pitaland! I've bought their pitas in local grocery stores before and I'm a fan. And I gravitate to day to day eating in the vegetarian realm (to keep looking HOT course!) so I was pulled to this place! 

Lucky surprise they have a lunch counter and a great menu. I have the falafel plate and it was perfect and guilt free! Filled with fresh veggies, pita and pickles! Just what I wanted.

If I am ever back in that neck of the woods I will definitely return!

Muah! Love You!"
3,"Korea Garden's BBQ is 191873904172x better than Sushi Kim's BBQ.  Since Sushi Kim's bulgogi is sosososo bad, that really isn't saying much.  Korea Garden's bulgogi actually has flavoring, sauce, and is NOT like eating rubber paper.  

The number of side dishes at Korean Garden is not as plentiful as other Korean restaurants that I have been to.  I cannot complain about that shortcoming because in Pittsburgh, the sample size of Korean Food is '2' .  The beef short rib is a little thick.

I have only taken the food to-go, so I cannot comment on the service.  The hostess who takes my order has always been very courteous, cute, and nice.  Make sure you park legally, as I have seen several tow trucks in the area."
3,"The 3 stars are keeping in mind that this is Pittsburgh and that good Korean food is very much lacking in the area. We've had an order of bulgogi and tofu soup while here, and both were pretty decent and comparable to what one might find in other Korean enclaves in places like San Francisco. The panchan selection was also good, and they refill on request. The environment was also quite authentic, as one can tell immediately that many native Koreans choose to come here.

The bad is that the items are extremely overpriced, for lack of competition. This is true especially for the bbq items; for the soup and the bulgogi, two of us were set back about $50 after tips. The other is the location... being smack in the middle of ghetto Oakland prevents me from coming out here too often, especially for late dinners."
3,"This was a standard place not much was special about it. 

I got the small pho and was pleasantly surprised with the broth but that was pretty much it. As for the curry, the sauce had a lot of flavor but the brisket and the potato lacked flavor."
3,"I have to change my review from 5 starts to 3 and here is why....

I took my water dragon to this hospital back in December, a week before Christmas. It is now January 31st and I am finally getting a response back from this vet after calling multiple times to check on results from a skin test. I even called them after Christmas to let them know my water dragon had passed away but I still wanted to know the results because I have other reptiles.

Apparently the diagnostics place that did the testing LOST the results. Just....gone. I know it isn't lone mountains fault that the diagnostics place lost it, but really....this isn't acceptable. They were nice and offered me to get my bearded dragon tested for free to make sure nothing transferred to him but I just wanted my money back at that point.

These people seem really knowledgeable but I am not happy with how this experience went and I am not sure that I trust to get any other tests done here."
3,"I'm not a banh mi expert but I really enjoyed my roasted chicken sandwich and bubble tea. I think my tea cost more than my sandwich (cheap sandwich, not expensive tea). Good value for a quick and nutritious lunch. 

The small seating area was clean but quite crowded. I think this will be a good spot to pick up a picnic on the way to the Jardin Botanique when the weather gets nicer."
3,"Meh. I confused this place with another gyro place down the street that is just as mediocre. The falafel was gross, but my gyro was just OK. Service was pretty good."
3,"Pretty cool spot in the city. Elevator ride up to the 44th floor where you will walk right into Kost. I love the open style kitchen layout this place had. Everything had a nice touch on it. 

The patio is awesome. Great views on the city. Little small, but what can you do. 

This review is a bit biased, as I didn't have any food. The kitchen closes Friday @ 11:30pm, but drinks are a go until 2am. So maybe next time!!"
3,"I first discovered Vua when hunting for a catering for 100 person call center lunch.  I was getting tired of greasy cardboard pizza and demanded for the lunch budget instead. I first tried Dagwood's with some success but when I ordered Vua grilled chicken sandwich. It was game over.  Vua was an instant hit!!  Agents raved about the sandwiches. That was back in 2010. 

I've been a faithful Vua-er ever since. There's been some changes the last several years but I can't ascertain.  Maybe in the beginning it was more family that were running the store because it felt like every sandwich was made with TLC. Case in point, recently, I got 3 large grilled chicken sandwiches to go and two were good. I took the third one to work for lunch with the intention of making my lunch mates jealous (muahaha) but joke was on me cause when I opened up the sandwich, the only thing staring me back was baguette and chicken with 0 trimmings. See my photo.  No love for my sandwich at all (T_T) I also always get 3 basil drinks (buy 2 get 1 free) They're like bubble tea but healthier!  The basil seeds hydrate like chia seeds and are so addictive to try to chew!  One cup had moldy tasting basil seeds which was really disappointing.  I couldn't drink it.  So again, it seems like the quality was 2 hits for every 1 miss. 

Dear Vua owners, if you're reading this, I'm still very sad about my sandwich and drink.  I've been a loyal fan for the last 6 years but recently it's been disappointing."
3,"Their bread is amazing but they need to work on all the rest. Tried this place three times and every time I said I'm not coming back. It's a bakery, grocery store and a restaurant with some bar style seats. At the beginning, I was excited to try Pitaland because it's the main middle eastern bakery in Pittsburgh area.  It supplies the city with awesome fresh tasty thin pita bread. And they have a brick oven to bake fresh pastries. So you expect they make good wraps, pastries and meals like the rest of the bakeries in other cities. If it's only for the bread, I would give it five stars. Their pita bread is flawless! However, falafels, chicken shawarma, freshly baked cheese and beef pies/sfeehas were all below average. Falafels were very bland and just not right.  The pies (or mana'eesh) were thick and lackluster too. So the food quality on three occasions was 1/5. First experience, I said maybe the cooks had a bad day but it can't be that they had a bad day everyday. I think the most successful restaurant owner is the one who tries their food frequently before serving it. It's really not difficult to make a delicious falafel or chicken sandwich. If you watch a YouTube video about how to make a chicken shawarma wrap, you'll have nicer results. I hate to give negative reviews unless it's for improvement. Service and staff here are slow and not the friendliest. I want this place to be much better and I believe they can."
3,"We come for breakfast quite often...probably 3 to 4 times a month, food is always good and lots of it...waitstaff is great. We had a new waitress yesterday who was sweet and adorable, Ashley? I think was her name. Pumpkin pancakes and potato pancakes were delicious. Everything was good and I would have given 5 stars EXCEPT The horrible blonde hostess woman who seemed to get pleasure by being rude to customers as they were paying and leaving. She is awful. She is outwardly rude to customers and seems to gain pleasure by being so....we left a 30% cash tip for our waitress the other day...she thought it was her place to advise me that I was "" required"" to tip on my credit card at minimum of 15%...not her place to tell me how much or that a tip was required. A tip is a courtesy, not a requirement. We always tip at minimum 20 to 30% depending on service, so her advice would have cost our wonderful server. The hostess needs to learn customer service, basic kindness, general politeness if that is possible. She took a 5 star experience and dropped it to a 3...had our service been off or the food not as good, she could have lost you good customers. TRAIN HER..PLEASE! the next time I hear her being rude or condescending to myself or another customer, I promise I will be calling her out on her rudeness and to management. She is a major detriment to your business.  To other customers, be aware that the awful hostess woman will be rude, will tell you how to tip and will make snide comments about you ...but the food is good and most of the waitstaff is good...so ignore the crabby hostess, she has a lot of bad days, and enjoy your breakfast or lunch."
3,"This place was such a revelation! They had me with the sheer variety of options, both in their grocery store and on the cafe menu! I ordered way more than I could eat.. and most dishes were pretty good. They have lots of vegetarian options. I'd recommend the Halloumi, the stuffed grape leaves and the Muhammara dip. I liked my falafal wrap, but I have to admit it wasn't the best I've eaten. The crispy cauliflower although flavorful was soggy and resting in a puddle of oil. The biggest disappointment though was the cold hard pita. I've heard SO much about this place and couldn't wait to try this apparently amazing and fresh pita that seems to be the USP of Pitaland, but it wasn't to be this time. I'll go back though one more time and try again. The service was ok. Don't miss the Arabic coffee when you're there.. oh and their dips are all pretty awesome!"
3,"Fairly tasty food, nice and upscale (for neighbourhood) decor and friendly service. But there are better Turksih spots in the city. 

Repeat: No"
3,"I'd passed by this place a few times before but have never actually eaten here until this week. The menu offers a variety of Southeast Asian Foods including pho and curry. I ordered the goat brisket in curry with roti while my dad ordered the Hainanese chicken rice. The portions for the roti and the curry were HUGE, I ate just a little more than half of it before having to give the rest to my dad to finish. His Hainanese chicken rice, however, was quite small in comparison. There was a lot more rice than chicken and it just didn't look very satisfying. Taste wise, the curry was all right, but not blow-your-socks-off amazing. The roti was crispier and less doughy than what I'm used to, but it wasn't bad. I didn't get a chance to try the chicken rice. I also ordered a three colour drink and it wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. The straw was too thin to even drink the red beans from so I had to mostly use the drink spoon. 

All in all, this wouldn't be my first choice to eat at, but it wouldn't be my last either. Maybe the pho and noodles would be worth giving a try in the future."
3,Food is just so so. But 40 mins to cooked fried rice!?! I know this is a sushi sashimi restaurant but come on. There's no reason for me to come back here. Heart sushi the service is quicker and the quality is better.
3,"Just finished my flavorless hibachi steak entree.  I have a favorite sushi spot in town but they don't have the hibachi plate type I love to each (non-bento).  I sought Osaka out since it was close by and the photos look ideally good.  The staff greeted me and helped me with the menu for a takeout order.  There are special prices for sushi if you dine in.  My order seemed to be fine as I left.  The sushi (kani) was okay.  I like the two pieces that came with it which was like a bagel/fried style better.  I was thrown off wondering if I was charged for it.  No description about those pieces included from the menu.  A little pricey because I usually order Eel Avacado for the same price of $4.50 anywhere and it taste like a $6 roll.  The wasabi was REALLY fresh (moist) and made me question if other sushi spots use was REAL wasabi.  I chose hibachi steak as my single entree because that's usually the protein to order.  It was a helpful serving with sweet carrots and mixed veggies.  The steak and veggies were totally not seasoned.  Just cooked with oil and looked like pepper but no pepper flavor.  No smell of flavoring and quite a bit of water in my plate.  My cat who always stares and begs for food didn't want the piece of steak I gave him.  In fact, he sat down then left the sofa.  I absolutely loved the ginger sauce and would love it in my salad if I was to return.  There's a good hint of pineapple and orange in it!"
3,"Find my review here about the Montreal Sushi joint where the kid sneezed into his hand and continued to prepare my take-out. I tossed the whole bag into the garbage and came into this place, wot I should have tried first.
The only thing that was weird, was the checkout line moved WAY fast-lots of people in this place. And no English! A little intimidating, especially as when I checked out, the Credit Card machine decided it was time to piss off. Got the stink-eye from a lot of folks in line,  but I made it. Wish there was a place like this close by in the States.
I had: Montreal roll sushi, a pair of Vietnamese cold spring rolls with peanut sauce, and a brownie. All fabulous! And pretty cheap to boot!"
3,"I came by KG for the first time since my undergrad years at CMU- subtle changes, but I noted that they have a few tables with the KBBQ grills built in! The dining room is pretty sterile, but brighter than it was many years ago.

When I come here, I always get the Kkanpoongi (fried sweet, spicy chicken) and the Soondubu (soft tofu soup). The kkanpoongi is pretty addictive, and it comes with finely chopped carrots, which adds great texture to the dish. 

Everything tasted the same as it did many, many years ago. Those two dishes I mentioned above are safe, and is probably going to be what I order every time I go there."
3,"It's very hard to find parking around this place. 

Otherwise, they have Decent Korean food for Pittsburgh standard.  Its better and cheaper than Green Pepper."
3,"I been here few times and tried different things. Food is okey. One of the guys that works there suggested the beef shawarma but it wasn't as I expected, the beef was chewy. Chicken shawarma was good, but you have to buy a side it doesn't come with fries or anything. Falafel are ok, a little dry. The lemonade that they make is 85% water you can barely taste the lemon. Some of the things like the feta spinach of meat pies I find a little pricey, $4 and it's as big as the palm of the hand. The place is fairly clean. I like the baklava and pastries there. I also tried the stuffed grape leaves which I liked. I absolutely love the bread here, always fresh."
3,"There is something odd about this store and this whole neighborhood.  But still they do have homemade pitas, a huge olive bar and pistachio baklava.  Not as much fun as shopping at Whole Foods or East End Food Coop.  But definitely more genuine."
3,"In terms of the drinks I've had here, there's nothing to complain about. Good ol' delicious caffeine as sustenance to get us through the day. The service, however, isn't always on par. I haven't frequented it enough to say I'm a regular or to justify that the service is always like this...but when I have gone, they don't seem to be very efficient. They didn't take names for orders, so when it came to picking them up, there was a slight confusion. It also doesn't help when the person calling out the order is soft spoken and you couldn't hear them in the first place. I've never gone through the drive thru at this location, so I can't vouch or comment on that."
3,"Pleasantly surprised with the Prince. 

Although Prince Sushi doesn't look like much from the outside, the (tiny) interior is very nice if a little cramped. I especially enjoyed the knockoff Nagel prints. 

Our group did not do AYCE for lunch (not sure if it's available during the week?). I had a few basic rolls and found them to be fresh, well made and tasty. There are lots of combos available that include soup and salad and prices seemed reasonable.

Service was lightning fast and attentive - Prince knows how to move people through which is a good thing at lunch. They'll also take a reservation for lunch, another nice touch."
3,"Not my go-to choice when it comes to cuisine, but the restaurant we wanted to come to was super full with a long wait, so we came here instead.

Unique decor reminiscent of the cuisine is seen here, but things do seem a little old school. Cell service is probably the best at this restaurant as it is more open than the other restaurants in the plaza. 

The food is about as good as you can get elsewhere. My family got House Special Beef Noodle Soup, and I got the Lemon Grass Pork Chop Rice. I would say the food overall is okay, absolutely nothing special about it. 

Service was quite good though, as the staff were quick on their feet and accommodating. 

Probably not my top pick to come for a meal, but wouldn't mind coming back if no other choices were given."
3,"If you want a lot of sushi for a moderate amount of money in the Matthews area, you are in luck! My family and I come here frequently and love the Kiss Me Roll, Fiesta Roll, and the California Roll. If you are not a sushi person go for the Chicken fried rice (with extra sauce just trust me;). The service is slower than average and the ambiance is not much to see, but the food is still pretty good."
3,"When we walked in, we have to seat ourselves. There are only 2 server during busy lunch hours, took a while for a server to come and take orders for us. We ordered house special noodles and pork/chicken rice, the rice dish was flavorful but the rice is bit dry. They have us a wrong noodles soup, when we asked the server, she apologized and brought another bowl of soup with all the items on the house special."
3,"This is a tough review for me to write.  They hit all the right notes - this *should* be a 5 star review.  But, for some reason, I am stuck on 3 stars.  This place is A-OK - and that's about it.

I went in on a DealChicken special.  Shampoo, scalp massage, deep condition, blow dry and makeup for $29.  (Value $85.)
I had a party coming up, so I made an appointment for noon on the Saturday of the party.

I was greeted when walking in and immediately offered refreshment.  (Water bottles, OJ and bubbly for mimosas, a lovely fruit tray, choclolate dipped strawberries and mini cinnamon rolls.  Poured myself a srong mimosa and went back with my stylist du jour.

Conversation was fine - she was professional and friendly.  
When one of the assistants saw my mimosa was getting low, he offered to freshen it up with me.  He came back with a new mimosa and two chocolate covered strawberries on a plate.  I love him!

The hair part went fine - then we got to the makeup.  She asked what I was looking to do.  I don't usually wear a ton of makeup - and I usually stick with neutral tones and an ""office conservative/natural"" look. I told her I was going to a party, and am open to new styles - so something a bit bolder than normal, but not quite clown-school level was the goal.

Result?  HOLY KARDASHIAN, Batman!  That was A LOT of eye makeup!
A couple trusted friends told me it looked good on me, so I decided to leave it for the party.

All in all, the service provided was exactly what was advertised.  I wasn't unhappy with any aspect, and in the case with the assistant bringing a fresh drink and munchies, I was impressed and felt that went above what was expected.  While in there, I was thinking 5 stars for sure.  But even by the time I got to my car, it was just A-OK.  

I don't know what I was expecting, I don't know what could have been differently or better - I really did have a good experience.  But for some reason, I am not tempted to shout from the rooftops that this is the best place ever - or even worth driving to if you don't live in the NE Valley. 

If I had a hot date at Pure Sushi (next door), I may make an appointment to go in a couple hours early and get dolled up - but super-savings deal or not, it's really not worth a 30 minute drive each way."
3,"Few reviewers liked this place better than Bamiyan's, I would like to differ. I would agree that they have huge portions. Their menu is good too, you may taste two different types of kebabs in the meal but I believe that the kebabs at Bamiyan taste much better.

The food here is amazing value as I was only able to finish half of it. I took a parcel to eat it next day, but didn't feel like it as the taste was okay at best. It was a little too salty for me."
3,"For a sushi place .. i wasn't really impressed... maybe i'm spoiled by all the other sushi places I eat att ..

here here is my run down, food is alright, menu is okay, and the prices are alright too, but having said that i found the sushi to be just regular ..

staff really sucks, and have nothing to add in terms of opinions or anything .."
3,If your looking for a slice this place is nice.  You get a piece that takes two plates.  The pizza was good.  The dough was pretty good but my piece probably needed a couple more minutes in the oven.  It is a thinner crust but puffy on the edge. The dough had a nice taste but a little under done.
3,"Sushi-3
Service-5
Atmosphere-3

We got the eel and avocado, dirty old man, rock and roll, and philly king rolls. As a whole, the sushi was OK, not the best we've had, but OK. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and provided great service."
3,"This place intrigued me since it is literally a stone's throw from my office and I was hearing good things about it.  For downtown the prices are very reasonable and the banh mi itself is quite tasty.  You can get a 10 inch banh mi for only $4.50 and it will do a good job of filling you up.  I went for the BBQ pork and it was very tender and juicy.  They also didn't skimp on the other toppings which I appreciated. 

The reason I gave this place three stars instead of four is that they handled their lunch rush quite poorly when I came.  First of all the guy taking sandwich orders wasn't following any particular order as he floated through the line and consequently skipped a few people which in turn lead to confusion at the counter.  At the cash the sandwiches were piling up and they were confusing orders so people were waiting longer than necessary.  It actually felt like there were too many people on the floor and it was at the point where it was becoming counterproductive."
3,"I love Japanese food and I know the words AYCE does not represent the best of Japanese food.  So when the monthly business meal comes around and Japanese food was chosen, I was thrilled... that thrill kinda died down when I found out it was at this AYCE place. 

It's conveniently located next to the giant AMC in north Mississauga with a ridiculously amount of parking available.  The restaurant itself is in the 'restaurant row' where you'll find a whole choice of food selections.  The restaurant itself is clean, trendy looking, and clearly had some effort put in for creating a good environment.  Black modern looking banquettes coupled with the occasional tones make it quite modern.  The service I cannot fault... it's always courteous and attentive.  

So why did I give this an average rating... the food.  Our group of 5 went with the AYCE and the pacing was slow.  It was as if the chefs couldn't keep with up with the orders from the various tables and the restaurant was only at 50% capacity.  In general, cooked items arrived hot so it wasn't the front of the house staff being lazy... it dragged our normal 1 and a bit hour lunch to nearly 2 hours.  

We ordered the tempura, dragon, dynamite, green and red dragon rolls.  In general, they were not bad.  The rolls were loosely packed and this caused most of the rolls to come apart when picked up with the chopsticks.  Often you had to rescue your roll because it fell apart in the soya sauce.  

The sushi was not great.  The shari (rice portion) was HUGE compared to the thinly sliced fish that sat on top of it.  The tuna was a bit too chewy... it was a weird texture.  Ebi (shrimp) was mushy actually... it was a bit alarming.  Usually it's chewy as heck but this was something else.  Salmon was ok... nothing memorable except for the mound of rice beneath it.  Also knife skill was clearly lacking as it looked like some pieces were cut with kindergarten scissors

Cooked foods fared much better but still slow coming out.  Katsu pork, chicken teriyaki, and salmon teriyaki were all better than food court fare and plated much nicer with good portions.  I think their chefs in charge of the hot foods are much more skilled.

So would I recommend or come back here?  I can't say I would do it willingly considering there is a new AYCE that is getting raves in the northern part of town (Heart Sushi).  I think I'll go there next to compare."
3,"I get they are busy but shouldn't drinks go out in order? I had to wait 10+ minutes for my drink and three people who ordered after we with a few drinks got theirs before mine and I just had one . I got a fruity drink and it taste like they accidentally put coffee in it first and just dumped it out . I personally hate the taste of coffee , so the whole drink was ruined for me ."
3,"Ordered for pick up on a Wednesday night after work.  Our order was ready on time and was waiting when we arrived.  We ordered a large 3 topping pizza.  Pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage.  The pizza was loaded with toppings under the cheese.  The cheese was plentiful and honestly a bit too much for my liking.  I am also not a huge fan of toppings under the cheese.  The crust was also a bit too thick for my taste.  Overall,  it was decent pizza but a bit pricey.  Just not quite what we are used to.  May go back to try their other dishes at some point."
3,"Highlight of the restaurant = Kanafe(dessert)

Service (Slow)
Been here twice, only because we absolutely love the kanafas they serve. 
The service is on the slow side as they are pretty understaffed for a restaurant that size, so the waiter forgets things, have to ask for water again and again and all that fluff, can't blame them, they have soo much on their plate, but i can blame the management.

Atmosphere (Good)
I dig the ambiance of this place, quite, and family oriented environment. The seating is comfortable, the table is at the perfect height.

Main dishes (Meh)

the food is very pricey!! one dish of Iskander would be good for one person and its for $18, I would have been fine with the price but there is really nothing unique about the food, just a lot of tomato flavour.

Pasha dinner  - is good for two people, they grill the meat perfectly but it doesn't really have a lot of flavour to it, and the rice that comes with doesn't go with the grilled meat at all, definitely need some sauce for flavouring.

If i were to go there myself, i would go there for the kanafas, as they have the best out of all the turkish/middle-eastern places i have been to."
3,"Located in Richland plaza which consist of other different cuisine. It is one of my favourite spot to visit if I am in the Richmond hill area. The seating is not spacious but it's not pose as a fancy restaurant. They have the standard Vietnamese dish and in variety of sizes. One thing I would point out is the difference between small and large is the bowl size and more soup which at first it seems a better choice to get large, however, it is the same portion as small. Which is a let down, so I would consider that next time I visit. Overall, standard customer service experience, quick and easy as any Chinese restaurant."
3,"I'm personally not too big on pho but this place is alright, the portions are large and the food is okay. I wouldn't mind coming back. I liked that the pho noodles were thin and had a nice chewy texture to it but I thought that the rice and grilled meat dish was just mediocre. Overall, it seems that this business is doing well because of the plethora of guests waiting for seats during lunch hours."
3,"Wow, was that some oily bulgogi.... Although that by itself doesn't warrant 3 stars, only offering 3 plates of banchan does!!! What Korean restaurant only offers THREE banchan dishes? That's like opening up a McDonald's and only offer one type of burger. 

Anyway, it wasn't thoroughly disappointing, but it was pricey and we didn't even get the full-service banchan that I'm used to =( And I'm sorry if I sound like a jackass, but coming from LA I'm sure this restaurant would go bankrupt if it had to compete against more authentic Korean places. My 2c."
3,"This place was packed on a Sunday evening and I was shocked due to the long wait. Considering this small mall was all about foods, i think there's only 5 or 6 restaurants here but this mall the only one that was packed lining up.

Having said that, we finally got a table after a half hr wait...we ordered the infamous curry, beef broth noodles, spring rolls and some appetizers.

Overall, the price is considerably good for the portion and taste. The curry was spicy enough but slightly lacking fragrance in my opinion.

We ordered a big bowl of pho and that was just average, it didn't have enough flavour for the soup base. It wasn't bold enough, considering the fact that thr soup base is one of the most important items in the pho...

All in all,  a place I would come back but may not drive out of the way to come..."
3,"Real rating: 3.5/5

Prince Sushi is located in the AMC/Cineplex complex which is very convenient if you want a good place to have sushi and see a movie afterwards.

Thank god I called in earlier to make a reservation because when we arrived for dinner on a Sunday night, the place was packed. This AYCE restaurant is pretty small so expect to wait on a weekend if you didn't make reservations. FYI, they end their AYCE lunch at ~3-3:30 pm. Their selection is pretty common among other AYCE sushi places. However, it's not a huge selection to choose from compared to Sushi 168.

The salmon sashimi were cut very small and pretty thin compared to other places. Also, it was a bit brown on the top which was weird =S...I ate it anyways and haven't gotten sick yet so I guess it's okay (y). The unagi rolls didn't have enough unagi so you couldn't really taste it. The avocado on the green dragon rolls were a bit brown (refer to my picture) which didn't make it very appealing to take pictures of and put on Instagram. PS: drinks are not included in the AYCE price of $22.99.

Overall, Prince Sushi is decent and not bad but the colouring of the sashimi and avocado made it seem like the food wasn't very fresh. I probably wouldn't choose this as my first choice if I wanted to go for AYCE sushi though."
3,"It is truthfully a 3.5 but I am rounding down to a 3. The food itself is a 4, the service was also a four, but the interior of the place drags the overall impression down to a 3. Interior is dated and it looks like the grimy and worn out carpet should have been replaced about 10 years ago. But, I would still go back because the sushi is very good and the waiter was knowledgable and friendly. But don't go there for a special occasion or if the furnishings are really  important to you. Nobody is going to be impressed with the layout, but anyone who likes sushi will like the food and the dinner prices are reasonable."
3,"I love the location of this Starbucks. It's conveniently located right off the 15 which makes it a quick trip for me. And it has a drive thru which is a huge plus when you have a baby! As far as drive thru wait times, they're the fastest of all the Starbucks I frequent.  
The cons: Every time I come here in the morning I'm given the wrong order. Either somebody else's order or they make a hot drink cold or a cold drink hot (even though I specify hot or cold), but They are always quick to fix the problem. It's only an issue in the mornings and has never been an issue when I come in the afternoon (different staff)."
3,"This feels like a self help colonic. They provide a clean facility but you need to do everything else on your own. My normal colonic person's rate keeps on going up.  So I was hoping to find a more affordable location in vegas.  It's not worth it for me at all even though they were nice enough to dropped the rate when I checked out.  
You will have to insert your own tube, push yourself and massage yourself.   Lately, my other injury makes it really painful for me to push and that's why I need to frequent colonic more often until my surgery date.   Maybe I am too used to working with someone who has more than 35 years experienced in this field, too.  I guess I am not aware how lucky I was until I tried healing water."
3,"Brunch and view are AMAZING but there is a major miscommunication between the hostesses and management. On several occasions I have been told that you can NOT reserve spots on the rooftop on Sunday brunch, but you get turned away at the door due to reservations or sent to the bar, while multiple tables are left empty."
3,"In comparing this place to Ahipoke (Tempe-5 stars) and Poketrition (Chandler- my favorite-5 stars), I thought it was good/ok.. The place was clean and the employees seemed friendly.  I got the regular bowl with tuna and salmon, it was good, nothing great.  I prefer the toppings at the other poke places I have tried, like watermelon radishes and fresh mango. Here they had corn and pineapple (not sure if pineapple was fresh pineapple or canned, but didn't look appealing to me).  The plastic bowl itself was too small so you couldn't mix everything up.  The portion size itself is much smaller than Ahipoke and Poketrition for their price.  It's the only poke bowl place in Gilbert right now, so if you feel like poke and don't want to drive, it's fine."
3,Sushi was fresh; it came with a bowl of miso soup and salad. I'd say their sushi was better or similar to typical sushi you can get at a shopping mall sushi chain. I found it unusual that they charge you for your bag if you order a take-out because most restaurants don't charge you for the plastic bag used for the take-out.
3,Bulgogi and kalbi too expensive so my family didn't even order it ($25-$30 for one).  Only 2 sides - kimchi and radish - were served. Husband got the bibimbop and wished it had bulgogi in it instead of ground beef. Seafood pancake was good. Ordered an interesting cold beef soup with buckwheat noodles. I understand now why it is served with a pair of scissors - those noodles are long and chewy!  There wasn't much meat in it but it was worth trying and also a large portion.  I really wish there was a reasonably-priced lunch menu and more side dishes.
3,"I've been here a few times now and usually this place is fairly busy around lunch time. The good thing, however, is that the table turn around time is quick and the wait is usually short. However, if you're looking for amazing table service, you're not going to find it here. This is your typical Asian style eatery where your food will come as soon as it's ready, and often times, if you aren't dining solo, people at your table will be watching others eat. The saving grace is that food usually comes out so quick that the watching isn't very long.

I generally get the noodle soup (house special, beef satay, etc), which is usually good, but not particularly outstanding. The broth isn't overly complex in flavour, yet it's still oddly satisfying (not sure if this is because I'm usually starving around lunch), and not overly overly salty. In the past, I used to really like the satay beef noodle soup, but over time, I (and others) have found that the quality of it has declined. The roti is also pretty good and the portion size is substantial."
3,"I popped in here for lunch the other day after a meeting in Central Phoenix. It has a great central location near 16th and Camelback and I can NEVER say no to Greek food! I ordered the Greek salad with chicken and a side of tzatziki and pita. Unfortunately, I had to send the first salad back due to wilted lettuce and dirt on it (I'm not just talking one piece...about half of the salad was like this!). They were extremely friendly and replaced the salad immediately. The second salad was quite good and I loved the light dressing that they put on it. It definitely could have used more veggies and feta! The chicken gets 5 stars for sure. The spices and marinade were incredible. I am sure the pita sandwiches are a better option at this restaurant. All in all, I have other Greek favorites in the Valley so I may not be back but if you are in the area and craving Greek food, Greka is worth a try!"
3,"A couple friends and I decided to go to Kost for the gram. We get there and the first thing that pops in my head was they work out! As soon as we walked on to the patio we were blown away from the view, then we all started posing because like I said we were doing it for the gram, and as I was posing, a thought came to me and I was like Drake should have taken his album cover here. This is were the real views are. We then ordered food and it wasnt the best. Overall, a good spot for display pictures, nothing else. I'll go back though."
3,"First time having this food and I ordered the chicken kebab plate with just salad. The order was a good size and the chicken and sauces provided (the hot sauce and salad dressing) were full of flavour. The reason I'm giving this a 3/5 was because the salad was just iceberg lettuce, cucumber and tomato...I was really hoping for some other items true to the traditional offerings. I would go back because it did have good flavour."
3,"If you can find a spot in the lot, then give it a try. The building is pretty neat, and the prices are reasonable. I had an omelet with American cheese (it was a Friday in Lent, so I can't speak for the meat); they make each omlete with 6 or maybe even 8 eggs, and it fills up the whole plate. It was excellent, as was the fruit salad. I wasn't feeling the love from the pancakes or the coffee, however. The coffee was extremely strong, so that's fine if you like it that way, but I don't. There wasn't really anything wrong with the pancakes, they just weren't anything to write home about; they had a bit of a burnt taste. Because of the omelets, however, I'd probably pick this place over a Denny's or something. 

Word to the wise: map this place before you come. We came from McKeesport and went through all of the South Hills, and it ended up taking us about an hour and fifteen minutes to get there. However, it ended up being maybe a mile from the Greentree Rd. exit on the Parkway West, so we could have been there in 35 minutes had we taken that route."
3,"After much anticipation, we finally had a chance to sample what other Yelpers voted as ""the best pizza in Durham region.""  As much as I value fellow Yelper's opinions, I was still skeptical coming from some disagreeable experiences from previous Yelp recommendations.  

We drove into this very nondescript plaza on a lazy Saturday afternoon looking for lunch.  We were greeted and seated promptly by a very efficient young server who was also our pizza maker.  Since it was our first time, we decided to stick to something ""safe"" like a medium size pizza (Pino Special, I think) and a Caesar salad to share between the two of us.  

What first came out was a huge mound of over-dressed romaine in store bought dressing with a very generous amount of house-made croutons and enough bacon bits (the real thing) to clog a grown man's artery!   To be fair, I have to mention that we were given an option of receiving our salad tossed or with the dressing on the side.  And since we opted for the salad to be tossed in the kitchen, we can't really complain about the dressing overload part.  But let me just say that my husband is a real bacon lover and even he proceeded to push extra bacon bits he couldn't consume to the side of his plate which by the end of our belly-busting meal, created a small tower.  The salad was so huge that by the time our pizza arrived, we were already pretty full.  

And then the behemoth of a pizza was placed on our table.....and we just looked at each other and burst into laughter at the thickness of this thing.  We had read numerous reviews about pizza pino's pizza being thick crust but seriously....this was like having two regular pizzas (like what you'll get from pizza pizza) stacked on top of each other.  Again, not necessarily a bad thing for those wanting a hefty meal but for us, it was supposed to be lunch.  

Our pizza was LOADED with pepperoni slices, mushrooms, even more bacon bits, I think there were some green peppers and soooooooooo much cheese.  I can't even begin to describe what this thing looked like.  (please refer to the photos)  I had ONE slice and could not dare grab another one.  My stout hubby had impressive TWO slices.  The shock of the thickness aside, the pizza was tasty.  How could it not be with that much goodness???  It's just a shame that we were so full from our salad.  We packed up the rest (more than half of the medium pizza) for dinner.  We ended up eating the leftovers over 2 meals!

Now, the million dollar question is, would I return to Pizza Pino.  I think I might....that is if I could recruit enough heavy eaters to justify ordering a pizza that big (or that thick)."
3,"I started going here when I got a Sugar Glider and the associated Vet near me did not take Exotics.  I have to say that the staff was very welcoming and knowledgeable when it came to my little fur baby.  Sugar Gliders at the vet are rare so seeing how gentle they were with her made me comfortable to bring her back for boarding and nail trimmings.  When I started to bring me two new rescued Chihuahuas here however I did feel as if they were very over priced.  Tried to nickel and dime a lot. I have no been back since but I would consider it due to my previous experiences with them.

I would say they get 3 1/2 stars."
3,"We ordered: 
-fried chicken vermicelli (8.95) 
-chicken curry roti (12.95) 

This place is okay. The price is too high though. Better curry and wayy better roti at Gourmet Malaysia for a better price. There was a big chunk of coconut undissolved in the curry. The chicken was nice and tender. The roti didn't have that baked goodness on both sides, only one side was baked. The flavour and freshness wasn't there. The vermicelli is bun, I got confused and thought I was getting chinese vermicelli (soup noodles) since they were serving fusion of items inclusing curry and pho lol, but oh well. Flavour of that dish was not bad. Nothing I would come back for. Can't believe they charge for takeout containers... and they don't take credit card. Atmisphere is like a food court - wall is not closed so you can hear everything from the hall outside the restaurant in the mall... and there happened to be 2 small undisciplined children hooting and hollering. All I want for Toronto is adult-only restaurants..."
3,"I write this with mixed feelings.

Sales: I would never buy a car from them again. The salesmen lied to us and promised us a rebate we never got. He even promised to buy us lunch if we came back and he lied about that! (it was a measly $10!). The sales manager is no better and doesn't stand behind what his salesmen promise. They will lie just to make a sale.

Service: Wow. Best service I have ever received. Only went back the first time because I needed some warranty work done, but the staff here is great- especially Jennifer. My car is always ready when promised and if it isn't, she will give me a loaner. She is always friendly and helpful and goes above and beyond.

In short: buy your car elsewhere, but bring it in here for service!"
3,"Ah, good enough.  I have been to several around the valley and I from Hawaii so I have a pretty good experience with poke.

I would rank this third best I have tasted.  The other 2 are in Tempe.  Same as the others.  Rice or salad, 2 proteins, and toppings.  Extra for avocado.

I had the Salmon and Spicy Tuna with spicy mayo.  Not bad.  Portions could be bigger with the fish.  Nothing really spectacular.  One thing it has going is it is close to the house so I can calm my cravings when I need too.  My wife thought these guys were good so we probably be going back.

Prices are pretty much the same.  The other places give miso soup so that sucks they don't offer extras like that.  

To me, the one thing that these places are missing are the extra.  In Hawaii, we call it Pupus.  Having a beer and eating pupus is what these type of places need.  Offer garlic edamame, sashimi, poke by the pound, hamachi kama, and the rest of the local grinds that they call finger foods."
3,"So disappointed. The service was great but the food was bland. The bulgogi bento box comes with fried rice but it is not listed on the menu. My husband isn't a fan of it so after it was served we asked for white rice. The waitress informed us it would be an extra $2 . It just didn't  seem fair since its not listed but we asked for it anyway. So here we are eating our meal and we are both looking at each other with sad eyes. The bulgogi bento box, well let's just say that the white rice was the best part of that meal. The bulgogi was so bland and the dumplings tasted funny. My bim bim bap wasn't bad, it was just okay. We won't be going back."
3,"I used to be a regular customer but it seems like the sushi quality has gone downhill recently. The rice falls apart too easily when you try to pick each piece up with chop sticks and the crispy cali rolls aren't too crisp. The appetizers were great I just was not impressed with the sushi, which was a bummer...customer service was good though."
3,"Just a few quick notes before the food part of the review. It's World Cup time and the servers were very preoccupied with trying to get the game on the tv. You have to ask for napkins. Compared to other Asian restaurants the service here IMO is slightly worse. They don't have a big restaurant but the service is slow so it makes it harder to overlook. 

I came here with my partner and her parents. My partner got the pig feet soup, which from my guess was their version of Bun Bo Hue. Obviously I couldn't tell because the menu is in English and Chinese and didn't obviously say Bun Bo Hue. I got the oxtail soup. First the ""Bun Bo Hue"" the soup was basically spiced water. The broth didn't retain any of the flavour of tomato that a traditional soup should have. But if we're saying it's not Bun Bo Hue the soup is still on the thin side as the flavour of spice is the only thing that you taste. 

My oxtail soup was significantly better. The flavour of the spicy blends well with the lemon grass and creates a more complex and pleasing flavours. The oxtail is tough but is sliced thin so that you're not trying to gnaw on a huge tough piece of meat. 

My overall impression is that the food is decent but not anything that's going to impress you or make you come back unless it's convenient. We got other food like spring rolls and chicken wings as well but I feel like the contrast between my partners and my noodle dish highlights the inconsistencies of the restaurant. 

Unfortunately this restaurant's food would not bring me back and the service is what it is."
3,"It was ok. 

I mean I guess the view is nice? I had a window seat (we did leave a note on the reservation requesting a window seat, but upon arrival, did not get the seat we requested. It was not at all full, so we requested the window seat after being seated, in which they accommodated). But in front of the window is the pool deck, with many other seats, chairs and people taking photos. So, its nice... but with some... obstructions. I did not go out to the deck after, so maybe if I did, my mind would have changed. 

In terms of the food. It was ok. Not mind blowing. My potatoes did look alittle... dark. 

The service was fine. Coffee was refilled periodically. They did the thing again where they give you the bill without you asking. Maybe this is a norm in Toronto? Not sure. 

It was cool to go once. but thats about it."
3,"Place was a bit farther and in an area I was less familiar with so it took me a while to find this restaurant. When we arrived, the ambience of the place seemed a bit dull. There weren't really any customers there but we sat down anyway. We ordered a squid stir fry, dubboki and bibimbap. The squid stir fry was around $20 some bucks and was actually pretty good. However the portion sizing is way too small compared to its price, especially with the dubboki. The plate of dubboki looked like a layer was barely placed over it to cover the plate and the side dishes were a bit sad to look at. Overall, it's quite overpriced but the food quality isn't bad."
3,"A popular Scarborough self-serve fast food place. Self-serve as in there are table seatings but you order your own food at the counter like any fast food restaurant but you have the choice of siting at the restaurant with real plates and cutlery. 

Their portions are generous and pricing are fair. They are relatively new. Their interior design is nicely done. They also have a point system to receive free items. 

Overall, I'd come back for a meal or two. Their dishes typically come with salad and rice. They take credit/debit/cash"
3,"We decided to try out Prince Sushi since he's never tried it before and I haven't gone  back in over two years. It was quite empty Sunday evening so reservations were not required. But if you're going in a larger group I suggest calling in because the restaurant isn't that big.

What stood out to us the most was the sashimi quality. The salmon sashimi were sliced to the perfect size and tasted so fresh and delicious! Also, the surf clam sashimi were larger compared to other places and tasted yummy. The maki rolls were quite large so we got full pretty quickly. We didn't even get to order a second round of food haha. We both liked how they didn't skimp out on the stuffing within the maki rolls. My boyfriend enjoyed his spicy salmon hand roll because it wasn't stuff with a lot of rice. Also, it was filled all the way to the bottom of the hand roll.

Service was great throughout our visit. Servers came back frequently to fill up our tea and asked how we were doing etc."
3,"Entrée inapercevable .. il faut savoir que c'est dans le sous-sol. Fast food vietnamien, ca fait la job. Pas bcp de tables , surtout pour emporter."
3,"The staff was great and I was impressed that they were able to get me in for a same day appointment. However the cost was a lot higher than I would have expected and of course they couldn't give me a quote or any idea of a price before I went in. $376 to test for a urinary tract infection and I still had to wait for the results because they couldn't test inhouse. They called me with the test results two days later and wanted to do further testing because, as the technician put it, they wanted to find out specifically what type of bacteria was causing the infection. If it cost $376 for the simple test I didn't want to know the cost for the more extravagant tests"
3,"The best example of a hit and miss. When it is busy in the drive thru the quality of the drinks, food, and service seem to go down hill. 

When they aren't completely swamped, the frappuccino's are made very icy and thick. On the days I visit and the lines are long I just hit reverse and save myself some money for another location as the drinks become watered down and packed with everything besides coffee and ice. When I've complained about my drink in the past to the bartistas working they said there's nothing they can do about it. Lol bottom line is don't do it to yourself"
3,"Environment was very fancy. They had very good, we'll portioned  food at a reasonable price. I got the kandahar kofta chicken skewer which was juicy and flavourful along with the spicy and white sauce. I was just disappointed with how hard the naan was.  Seems like they may have reheated it. Other than that, I would give Kandahar Kanab a second chance."
3,"I've been to Ben Avery a couple of times. Once for skeet, twice for pistol + AR shooting and the most recent (early '08) for my CCW class (taken through GCC). It's a huge shooting facility with separated sub- ranges. It's a no-frills outdoor place so you gotta plan your visits based on the weather. 

But having a range master tell you when you can/cannot shoot is a PITA so my friends & I always just go to Table Mesa now. Plus, it's free!"
3,"I ate here with a group of 10-12 people.  Everything was very good until the bill.  Rewinding, all the main entrees (four) listed as beef really had lamb mixed and I detest lamb so my choices dwindled so I ended up ordering boring chicken kabob.  Chicken was average tasty huge chunks, but nothing special, as it was a bit bland and wasn't overcooked/not dry so that was good.  The plate was huge and came with salad and grilled vegetables.  The grilled green peppers were raw and would have been tastier if grilled longer.  Beautiful ambience due to decor and clean.

The Manager whom identified herself as Bulgarian was our server and she was friendly until payment.  For payment, she started on the opposite end and didn't inform everyone that tip was already included and it was noticed after some paid (I couldn't hear much because of the long table), BUT I heard the Manager scold and yell at two people from my table whom caught the tip and asked for a refund on the double tip (one was clarifying what the service charge was).  The Manager said to both separately (yelling) that ""It's not my job.  It's your job to check.  I already told people earlier"" and one of them told her not everyone was aware since she was on the other end of the table.  She complained and was annoyed at having to do two-three refunds (not everyone bothered to ask).  This was extremely unprofessional and we felt that she did this on purpose (being dishonest)  hoping nobody would notice or wouldn't bother doing anything so she'd have extra tip.  Regardless of her intention, she should have handled the refunds in a professional manner.  I knocked off 1-star for the rude behaviour."
3,"Came here for a Christmas dinner with my colleagues. It's a very posh place and definitely not cheap. We shared a bunch of appetizers and each had a dish for ourselves. I got the branzino which 2as delicious, but one of my colleagues got the tofu and wasn't that impressed with it. The view and service were great. I wouldn't recommend this for a sit down dinner, but it's a nice place for drinks and apps with friends if you don't mind splurging."
3,"I had such great things about this place and was so excited for it to open up. First time i went was in Ramadan, food was not on point at all, meat was tough and lamb were under cooked ( i chalked this up to the fact that it was iftar time and restaurant was packed) Recently we went another few times and its so disappointing because some thing or another is always missing here from the menu. Usually whatever I want to order is 'sold out' for that day. 

The food is okay, the staff isnt that professional either."
3,Opened by Cantonese people. Food was just okay. We ordered Vietnamese beef noodle soup. My bf said beef was not very fresh so he just ate noodle. Fish cakes were mostly made my flour and deep fired. I had curry chicken which was fine. Service was extremely bad. Waitress have an extremely strong accent and was rude and impatience. I won't say I will go back there again. Cuz  you can have those kind of quality food  every where in town.
3,"much nicer inside after they renovated this former Foodland space ...
the cafe is interesting but the food is crazy expensive for what you end up with, in my opinion...the beef schwarma is tasty as is their hummus / kibbee balls / etc.
i usually end up getting tacos at Las Palmas, a few doors up since it's a much better bargain but fans of middle eastern food ought to check this joint out ."
3,"Food 2.5 stars.  Services plus portion +0.5 star.  Overall 3 stars.

Average soup noodles, insane portion is the synopsis.  We ordered 2 small noodles.  The portion was close to the medium sized bowl of other Vietnamese noodle places.  Together they could feed 3 people.  The broth of the Shredded Chicken Rice Noodle Soup was clear, and bland.  The Spicy Beef Rice Noodle Soup was not spicy whatsoever.  I added chili sauce.  

The services was considerate and effective.  We ordered a Stirred Fried Chinese Broccoli with Salted Fish.  We asked to substitute Chinese broccoli with Chinese green, since the broccoli was too tough for my mom to chew.  Not only there was no issue, the waitress voluntarily suggested to instruct the kitchen to make the Chinese green extra soft."
3,"I tried both the beef shawarma and the falafel sandwiches at this place. It's both a food counter and a middle eastern style deli/grocery. The service at the food counter was slow and impersonal, but about what you'd expect from such a place I guess. 

I wasn't super impressed with the shawarma. The beef was tough and it felt more like a gyro with tahini sauce instead of tzatziki sauce.

I enjoyed the falafel sandwich much more. The falafel is freshly fried and while not the best texture was very flavorful with a nice crunch. The pickles on it were actually pretty good even though I'm not a pickle fan... Definitely house made and not soggy. The other veggies as a lot of flavor, although the overall veggie to falafel ratio is a bit off. Still a very tasty sandwich, though."
3,"They do the job but you'll have inconsistent experiences and hit or miss staff. Manager was nice first time, rude the next. I was barely greeted while she stared at the computer screen. One time they offered something to drink, next time they didn't. They charge you if you cancel within 24 hours, which is hard for my ever-changing work schedule. And I love energetic music but it's way, way too loud and they had some nasty songs in rotation that would require me to cover my daughter's ears. They need more seating to wait in and better training and leadership. this could be a goldmine if they made some changes, but I'll go to Drybar as my first choice."
3,"Sometimes, the craving for a gyro and baklava takes me by storm. I saw this place had recently opened, and it was time get my fix.

The owner was behind the counter - incredibly friendly and excited to talk about his food. I asked for the gyro and baklava, and asked what else could I not live without  - he told me the chicken shawarma was incredible, so I ordered that, as well.

There was nothing *wrong* with the gryo - and the menu does describe it as ""thinly sliced."" Maybe I should have asked him to qualify that. It was shaved meat, not sliced meat. The flavor was spot on - but the texture was just...odd. And - my fault - I don't care for lettuce on my gryo - just the meat, tomato, onion, and tzatziki. The menu said lettuce - I should have asked for that to be left off. (It's impossible to get all the lettuce shreds off of sauced shredded meat.)

The chicken shawarma was okay - again, nothing wrong with it. But it was a bit too heavily seasoned. To the point I couldn't really tell it was chicken. 

The baklava was perfect - and I will be back to check out more of the menu. Next time, I will ask the owner if he can slice the gyro a bit (a lot) thicker - more like the consistency of every other gyro I've ever had anywhere - and hold the lettuce. Based on the flavor of the meat - I would definitely go back for that!"
3,"After reading the reviews, we decided to come here for our first dinner after arriving in Canada. We ordered the small veggie pizza which was pretty good. It was very doughy and kind of reminded me of Pizza Hut pizza. We also ordered the pasta with meat sauce and mushrooms and liked it. This dish brought back memories of my dad.  :). We also ordered poutines which were ok. The french fries w Service was very friendly. Glad we stopped by!"
3,"On our way out since the nearest Pamelas was closed due the Labor Day Holiday we drove here. I ordered the kielbasa and pancake platter and it was really good. The coffee was terrible though, and the waiter had add as we had to keep repeating what we wanted."
3,"Tried this place out on my lunch break this week - I had the falafel wrap for $7.  The falafel itself was pretty good, but slightly overcooked. My main issue was the staleness of the pita bread. At first it seemed fresh and soft, but as soon as you lifted it with everything inside, it cracked and split down the middle, spilling all the falafel and toppings back into the take out container. Better quality, or fresh homemade, pita would definitely elevate this place to a solid 4 stars. The tzatziki was passable, but a little on the bland side. 
Overall: a decent to-go sandwich that's maybe more accurately valued at around $4.99 than $7, and VERY friendly service from the family that runs the place. I'll probably go there again, and try the gyros, and maybe even give the falafel a 2nd chance. 
I've had better, but I've also had a lot worse...so 3 stars is about right."
3,"Great tasting curry here, and good portions. There's quite a lot of gravy as well to soak up all the rice. Good stuff. 

My wife ordered Thai style pho, which was pretty decent. Its huge as well... medium is more than enough for one person. 

I was going to give 4 stars, except they charge 50c for takeout containers!! Never seen that before. 

Cash/ debit only"
3,"I would say that the food was good but nothing special. The menu is really extensive with a lot of pancake, crepe, French toast, and waffle options from the griddle. If you're in the mood for savory food, they also have a lot of options with eggs, omelets, and the whole 9 yards for breakfast. They also have a lunch menu, but I didn't look at that. The service was really not that great, but it wasn't the worst I've had either. I would probably go back though!"
3,Been here a few times as AYCE places go this is one of the better I've tried but their menu has changed so you don not to have options of all the classics anymore.  green Dragon roll and Spider rolls were trustworthy and their hand roll spicy tuna was pretty good.  Like that they offer dessert even though not listed on the menu.
3,"Came here to get lunch with two of my friends on New Years. The service was just okay. The girl at the cash didn't seem like she knew any background knowledge of the place she works at. The menu tends to change (because it's on a screen), and she was just staring at us.. we had to tell her were waiting for the menu to come back. We asked her what the difference between two dishes are, and she just pointed to the menu.... we were like okay then.

I got the breast chicken kabab and wow the portions are HUGE! We decided to dine in, so when our order number gets called, we have to go pick up our dish. Once I placed the dish infront of me I'm like WOW this is a lot and smells so good! However, after trying it I realized that it was pretty bland and did not have enough flavour. I mean, it wasn't horrible but definitely not the best Afghan food that I have tried. They should put more flavour into their dishes. I feel like the dishes are worth the prices they charge, because it's a huge portion that also comes with a huge piece of naan (I actually loved the naan), two sauces (the white sauce is so good) and salad. They also give free water."
3,"I've tried Osaka a couple times now for dine in and take out. It's subpar at best. The shrimp sauce is good and food is just okay. I've ordered regular sushi and half priced lunch sushi, all times it's just been okay. Just an average Japanese place. Not really worth going back."
3,"I went back to this place again and it was very busy. The food took more than half an hour. The chicken breast kabob was very dry and overcooked this time and the naan tastes very stale, like it had been reheated. Not sure that I would come here often anymore."
3,"Not too bad. Nice little Viet shop that allows you to buy pre-made food (i.e. spring rolls, grilled chicken w/rice, desserts, spring rolls).  Cheap and large sandwiches (2 sizes - 7"" and 10""), but I thought they were just average.  I ordered the grilled pork sandwich.  The bread they use is thicker than I prefer (bc it takes up more stomach space!), they put on more mayo than I prefer, and the grilled pork was just average.  Eggrolls are NOT good, so don't order them.

I had no issues w/service, but I also am Vietnamese and am just used to Vietnamese service, which can be curt and to the point."
3,The only time I come here is with my buddy MUZA he loves this place I don't know why they looks the same food is good but a bit pricy but good will still come here enjoy
3,"Since Drybar was booked solid all day yesterday, my mom & I tried Primp and Blow since they had availability. Even though I read all of the reviews for both locations, we thought we'd give it a shot since even a terrible blow out is better than what I can do myself.

We were greeted & brought to our spots. I was thrown off since we weren't offered anything to drink, eat, magazines to read...essentially everything the website boasts. They also don't have a look book, so you just have to describe what you want; lucky for us, we both have short hair so it was pretty easy. 

Brytoney did my mom's hair and did a fantastic job. Very friendly & a great listener. Jenna did my hair & also did a great job. We both got exactly what we were looking for in about 40 minutes. 

The girl at the front desk made our experience less than fantastic. We shouldn't have had to ask for a drink - it should have been offered when we walked in. She also misunderstood how much I wanted to leave for a tip, so when I asked for my receipt and it was double what I had said, I told her - which led to her rolling her eyes & having to do it again. Never apologized, thanked me for coming in, nothing. She was a total brat & needs a lesson in customer service.

I'd definitely come back to see the same women who did our hair, but the front desk needs to up their customer service game & follow through on offering what is on the website - and with a SMILE!"
3,"Just as we sat down a young male waiter yelled at the hostess and made a scene RIGHT IN FRONT OF US! that we were sat in his section, she herself ended up taking care of us and I'm glad she did. However, I totally understand there is a system, we were one of three people sat in the section and he was waiting on one party of the three. I get this is a chain and for what it's worth, it's good breakfast food. My finicky boyfriend was very pleased with his eggs Benedict.   I'll go back as long as that guy isn't my waiter. I had view of kitchen and saw his attitude through out the whole time. It was dissapointing. I work in the food industry and understand situations and attitude, there is no excuse for his behavior, at least take it away from view of your customer."
3,Nothing special about the food taste and small portions. BUT... I will definitely go back just because the atmosphere and view of the place is great.
3,"Drive thru is always decent. Not fast.

I don't suggest sitting out on the patio like people do here...it smells.
Not only does it stink but the car fumes and smokers are out of control.

I have been inside and its not the cleanest. Maybe a deep clean or pressure wash is due outside...and in!!!!

Iced doppio and a splash of almond mylk is my jam."
3,"We went there today, on a windy and cold winter day. The waitress seated us by the window. The wind was literally blowing inside and it was freezing cold. Luckily the restaurant was quite empty, we were replaced to another table.  Decoration was very nice. Table cloths were double layered and clean. Music was just right.
We ordered cacik, eggplant in tomato sauce and a large salad as appetizers. The fresh bread was good but nothing extraordinary. Appetizers and salad were all delicious and fresh but the portions were too small for the price. I was wondering the size of the small salad if this was the large one. 
For main dishes we ordered sizzling sauteed lamb, Adana kebab and Turkish dumplings. Lamb dish was huge, 2 of us shared. The meat was very tender and delicious. Adana was a bit bald and dry. Dumplings were ok. The dough could be thinner. For desert we had creme caramel. It was decorated with a very unnecessary chocolate syrup. I would definitely prefer its natural caramel juice. We ended our dinner with tea, which is a Turkish tradition. Tea was tasteless and was not fresh.  The bill was too high for what we had."
3,"Prince Sushi is an average Japanese restaurant. The sushi/sashimi tasted fresh and the soft shell crab is one of the best side dishes. The décor is nice and contemporary. However, the service is poor and was not friendly. Many of our dishes ordered did not arrive. Overall, this restaurant has improved during my last visits but needs to have better service. I would not recommend this restaurant."
3,"Cue music: ""She was a one-fork, one-knife, shrewd Pretentious Pizza Eater...""
Hate to crash the 5-star pizza party here, buuut... pizza is a personal thing, and personally, Pizza Pino's isn't my favourite. They do the thick crust with generous toppings style well, but if you prefer thinner crust and more modest amounts of cheese, specify that when you order.

What I liked: dough was well cooked although it was thick; toppings were generous.

What I didn't like: personal taste again, but the sauce is a specific brand used at some pizza places that has a bitterness to it, and they're a bit heavy-handed for my liking; their usual amount of cheese is A LOT of cheese, so it doesn't melt into the other toppings but instead kinda lays on top like a stretchy blanket. Overall it's just too heavy.

I will be back to try thinner crust and all that but in summary, know that you're getting good North American-style pizza here. For anything else, go somewhere else."
3,"I picked up takeout here for a group at work. Only 1 person had been here before, so he did the ordering and the rest of us had no idea what we were getting ourselves into.

We got Chicken Kabab, Beef Chapli Kabab, Sardari Kabab and Kabul Kabab. I'd only had Afghani food once before and it was not in kabab form, so I didn't know what to expect. The chicken had a yellow colouring, making it look like curry, but it wasn't. It was tender, juicy with great seasoning. This was a crowd favourite.

The beef chapli was INTENSE. It's a beef patty at first glance, get closer and you can see it's jam packed with spices. I had to drink some water and eat some rice to cleanse the palette before diving in again. Be ready! Only a couple people could handle it....I was not one of them. :(

The other kababs looked the same, but were not. They both came with sliced chicken under the kabab. Sardari kabab was spiced lamb. I love lamb! Kabul kabab was made with beef. The seasoning was similar, just need to choose which meat you prefer.

The portions were huge! All came with on giant bed of plain basmati rice plus salad. we ordered 5 meals for 6 people and 2 people had the leftovers for lunch the next day. The rice was plain, was hoping it would've had a little something to it. 

They've got a decent sized menu and it's all halal. If you're not sure about something, just ask. They know their stuff! It's a beautiful place, I wouldn't mind going there for a meal now that I know what to order!"
3,"Nice ambience, but comparatively  I absolutely love Bamiyaan much better... These guys are also pretty good but I felt their chicken was super oily left a trail of oil on my rice .. And wasn't a fan of their sauce plus chicken was spicier .. Didn't taste like a true afghani restaurant like Bamiyaan does."
3,"Good if you are into selfies with the CN Tower, but not good if you need to use the bathroom. Great view and nice rooftop terrace overlooking the city, but you are an elevator ride from the bathroom. The food was good, but not as good as it should be for the location and price."
3,"I stopped by here this past Tuesday with my father for lunch.  I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.  Whenever we finally made it inside, it was not what I had expected but in a good way.  The store was super clean, bright and open with an olive bar, central aisle of grocery items, deli and then a food counter with bar seats.  They also have some tables outside so that you eat there if the weather is nice.

For my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken shawarma in the donor size while my father went with the gyro in donor size.  While we were ordering I noticed a rather clever tip jar sign that had something to do with ""pita"" spelled backwards.  After placing our order we decided to sit inside at the counter on this day since the sun and humidity outside would have made for a miserable experience.  After only a few minutes of waiting, our lunches were handed over to us.  My chicken shwarma came out to me on a large pita with lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato and what I think was a a garlic mayo sauce?  The size of the pita was pretty large and I knew that by the time I was finished that I wouldn't need anything else.  Sadly I was disappointed with the sandwich and that mainly had to do with the chicken.  Since it was done rotisserie style I thought that meant that the meat would be good and moist.  However, it ended up being super dry and seemed to be overcooked as well.  The rest of the sandwich ended up being good though and I really enjoyed the larger pickles that were in my pita.

The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While my chicken shwarma ended up being somewhat of a disappointment to me I think that this place has potential and I would like to give it another try."
3,"Space is limited, and with that said if you want a place to study this isn't the place. This place gets busy and  gets more noisy that usual because of the space. The parking is all so limited. I used to come here often, but they moved the tables around so the access to outlets  to be able to charge your laptop while studying is limited. Other than that is your regular Starbucks."
3,"[LOCATION] - 5/5
Located at Finch Ave & Markham Rd. Just look for the a big, orange sign that says ""Kandahar Kabab Afghan Cuisine."" 

[SERVICE] - 1/5
Disorganized self-serve style service. Customers place orders and pay for food at the cash register. Then, grab your own seat. The cashier will call-out your order number on the PA system when your food is ready. Unfortunately, the system does not work very well on a busy Saturday night. My friends and I had to stand in line, decide what to order, and also stare at people until they finish their meal so we can take their seats! We stood in line for 15 minutes, ordered our food, and waited another 45 minutes for our food. The cashier did not even inform us that the wait-time was going to be that long! 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5
This place is huge, but unable to accommodate the high volume of customers on a Saturday night. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5
Quality was pretty good overall. Chicken meat was average, but kofta (ground meat) was pretty high-quality. Salad was fresh, and rice was was infused with aromatic seasonings. 

[ORDER] 
- Sardari Kabab - $13.00: comes with chicken breast and a kofta kabab: chicken breast meat was a little dry, but paired well with the seasoning and sauces on the side. Kofta kabab was seasoned very well, soft, and juicy. Also came with a huge quantity of rice & salad. 

- Herati Kabab - $12.50: comes with a chicken kabab & kofta: chicken meat had the same consistency as the chicken breast meat. They used the same kofta in this platter and the Sardari Kabab. This dish also came with lots of rice and salad. I would just order this platter because it is less expensive than the one above, but the chicken meat is pretty much the same in both of them. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
Overall, the platters were really good and came in large portions. I would recommend this place if you enjoy delicious Afghan food. However, you risk encountering a long line, limited seating, and a long wait before you receive your order. Good things come to those who wait, right?"
3,"I'm from Dallas Texas, and just came here for vacation. My family and I decided to get some banh mi at banh mi Vua as I heard it was good based on some of the review that I've read from yelp. As it turned out, it was ok, not that great. Maybe because I came from a bigger town with a lot of choices. We have bigger Vietnamese community in Texas and the banh mi I had were much better than the one I had today."
3,"Food is good - quite authentic. Yet, portion is small compared to the price. Ordering simple 2 dishes for myself always ends up being $60."
3,"i took a sunday off to take a handgun safety course this past weekend and this place is huge! there are ranges for not only pistols, but high powered rifles, shotguns, and even bows and arrows. it's all outside and very safe, as gun ushers were constantly alert and around to make sure everyone was following the proper etiquette. i did feel a bit out of place without camo, a trucker cap, and my ""Go Palin"" bumper sticker...but luckily i have a heavy duty southern accent, so i guess i was OK. 

i hear it's cheaper than the indoor ranges closer to phoenix, but you pay for it in gas driving all the way out there. ...i don't want know you name, i just want BANG BANG BANG."
3,"You will be really surprise how busy this place can be during lunch hour.

They specialized in Vietnamese beef soup noodle and curry. I always order either the small size Tom Yum beef noodle soup or if I have 2 person then we will share a medium size. The broth is really favoured, not salty. Their small size is equal to a medium at other restaurants. 

Service is fast and prompt! And the price is great!

BTW, no lunch special... is the same menu for the whole day...

Please don't sit near the little opening where the wait staff pick up the food. You will have a view of the kitchen..(which I prefer not to see).

CASH only!"
3,"Located by Leslie and 16th, this place wasn't too hard to find. The restaurant is inside a little chinese plaza. I really liked how the restaurant was open concept. There were no windows or pillars that blocked the outside view of the plaza. The only issue I have with that is people that are walking the plaza can watch you eat.

The food was good, but nothing to rave about. The soup in my Pho tasted like the pre-made soup cubes that you can find in chinese supermarkets. I wasn't expecting much, as this is my second time coming here. My coworkers got the lemon grass chicken with rice. Like the Pho, it was nothing to rave about. The chicken tasted bland, even with the fish sauce added. There wasn't enough garlic in both the chicken or the sauce, so that was a disappointment. But the food certainly LOOKED good! :)

Service was.. sub par, but passable. Lady was extremely friendly, which is why I gave 3 stars instead of two.

Don't take up my review and not try this place, though. There is definitely potential in their other foods, so make sure you try other dishes too. I come here bc it's a minute away from work, when I don't feel like driving. If I had a choice, I'd go to Kim Bo on hwy 7/leslie or Vic Hong on Bayview and major mac."
3,"Wife and I were in the mood for kebabs about 2 weeks back (as of this writing).  It was late into the evening.  Still a lot of customers.  First time for afgan cuisine.  Price is a bit higher than we are used to however..for the portions we saw other customers chowing down on the prices seem justified.  Tho the price on their single kebabs could be a tad lower, 1 stick for over $4 bux seems a bit much.

We ordered take out since we wished to eat at home.  Tho we found out the portioning for take out vs dine-in was very different.  The chicken kebabs for us was very tasty.  We also enjoyed the yogurt dill sauce that was provided.  Their hot sauce had quite the kick for both of us.  It had us reaching for a glass of milk (we're not really into super spicy foods/dips) to quench the flames our taste buds were experiencing.

For future cravings of the kebabs we may opt to dine-in since the portioning is more.  Nothing really special to comment on their salad offering..might opt out on the salad on the next visit.

The only main advantage for us kebab wise, is that it is the closest one to us.  Haven't tried Bamiyan Kebab yet, but I have a friend who has recommended it."
3,"This place has homecooked Korean food. 
They have kpop playing, and it's family owned. I'm pretty sure that the music playing in the restaurant comes from the waitress's ipod, which I am totally ok with. They always have the latest kpop music, which I HIGHLY appreciate haha. 
Their ddeokbokki is mediocre, the ddeok is rather hard and flavor just isn't amazing.
tbh, most of their stuff is mediocre in general. We've been here many times because there arent really many Korean restaurants in the Pittsburgh area... *sigh
Their seafood noodle soup has a ton of noodles, but the soup is salty (or so I've heard, I personally cant stand seafood)

I would recommend Nak Won Garden over this place"
3,This is a strange fusion place I think.  Decor is Greek photos and fake bonsai trees?  Menu is Greek and Korean?   I got the Gyro lunch special. Not bad but between the meat and fries I felt my fingers full of salt.  Time for blood pressure medication!  Staff is friendly and food is hot but this won't replace my favorite local Greek spots.  No Opa here!
3,"Tucked in Richlane Mall, this restaurant has been around for a while, serving adapted Malaysian / Viet / Thai dishes. The portions are big, but the price is not exactly cheap. A regular bowl of pho is served in huge bowls and its not uncommon to see a group of 2-3 with their tables full of plates.

My dad remembered this place serves up decent malaysian curry. The portions are huge, but the sauce lacks some spices and depth and is a little runny. I was looking for some heathier options and the only 2 veggies dishes is yu choy in oyster sauce ($9) and stir fried green beans in balachan sauce ($15). Knowing the price of my veggies, I wouldn't pay $8 for a plate of blanched veggies. The stir fried green beans did not disappoint. The balachan toppings are crispy, delicious, and the dish comes with 8 large shrimps. Much better ingredients for the price.

Also ordered the lemongrass meats (chicken and pork chop) ($12). Tastes amazing, and not expensive for the amount and quality of the meats. If you're trying to reduce carbs, consider getting this instead of the regular pho or the lemongrass meats served with rice. It is large enough to share with a small group."
3,"To say this is the best Korean place in Pittsburgh wouldn't be fair. Considering there are only like 3 restaurants that serve Korean food, kind of hard to make a statement like that. 

In any event, if you're looking for Korean food, this place isn't bad. Might actually be on the good side even. It's a small quaint little place so you'd probably pass by here and not even know it. Parking around here is almost impossible considering it's on the same street as a bar, beer distributor and a pizza/sub joint. 

The food here is par for what Korean food is. Nothing great, nothing bad, but kind of in the middle. Place is a bit pricey for the food in my opinion but definitely a nice change of pace from the usual subs and pizza for lunch. Worth a try at least."
3,"I would not mind going back here, but I have been to better restaurants that I have felt fully comfortable and content at. The kebabs were good, and the chicken was exceptional. The decor is nice what with its fountains and chandeliers, but one thing I was not happy about whatsoever was that when I was chewing a piece of kebab, I felt something hard in my mouth. After rolling it around a bit in my mouth to see what it was, I took it out. I though it might be a tooth, a bone, or an uncooked piece of meat but it turned out to be a gold, metal, something of a screw! :O  I do not know if it is a piece of the grinder, but I hope that if I do go back here, this will not happen again or to anyone else for that matter. But, I suppose the manager made up for it with how sincere he was when informed about what happened and giving us free dessert, which was delicious. All in all, this is an alright place but they better make sure to watch out for anything that may have made it into their food throughly."
3,"UPDATE: A few hours after I posted my review I got a call that the meds were ready for pick up.

The good: 
They are one of the few places who see reptiles. They were able to get us an appointment for the next day. We were seen at our appointment time. They answered all of our questions.

The bad:
We were prescribed a medication that was only a 5 day supply and were told by the vet when it gets close to running out just call and they'll refill it. We went in on a Friday, I called Tuesday (her last dose) to request a refill. I was told they usually don't refill that medication and would have to get vet approval (who was out that day) and they would call me back in the morning. I called back Wednesday afternoon because I hadn't heard back and was told the same thing by a different person. I called back Thursday and it was again the same thing. It's now Saturday and still no call backs."
3,"I like how this place was designed. If you get a window seat it feels like you are eating outside. There is no actual glass so you can hop over if you wanted to. 

#03 chicken/beef skewers @ $10.50 total 6 skewers - by far some of the largest portion skewers I've had but lacked in flavor and tenderness when compared to other restaurants like Thai Basil. Peanut sauce also lacked in flavor.

#16 chicken roti (I think it was $12.95) - once again pretty big portions but the sauce is missing the sweet coconut flavor that I like and the chicken meat was almost melting of the bone like it was sitting for a while. Also if adding extra roti its around $6 and they give you extra sauce in a bowl. A bit pricy for extra roti and the extra sauce was not even needed.

#41 fried noodles with shrimp and chicken meat( I think it was $9.95)  - a fairly simple dish that was done well.

#76 beef brisket in curry sauce with rice (I think was $12.95) - same curry sauce that came with the chicken roti. The beef was tender but not fall off the bone quality and once again the curry sauce is lacking in flavor."
3,"Sushi was good but I'm disappointed they don't have the rose sushi. The sushi was average but they did not have a large selection. Sushi was average but not outstanding and memorable. Service was okay, and food was coming out at a good pace. Would not recommend to a friend."
3,"The sushi was delicious!
The only thing I'd comment on is that the food came out very slowly. We ordered a lot (as there were a lot of us) but they also stuck us in a dark corner of the restaurant, maybe they forgot about us because we were hidden?"
3,"As I am a bit of a sushi snob, I give this place an average grading.  The restaurant is quite an intimate space.

Their menu is extensive with cold and hot items to order.  My date and I ordered a little bit of everything on the menu.  The food was presented well.

Service was quick, food was brought out to the table as they were ready.

The only downside is that we only did two rounds of ordering until they took away our menu.  We were a little bit confused as to why but we were also full. :)

For dessert, order the green tea.  My date got vanilla and it was really mushy.

Recommend this place if you are in the courtney park area."
3,"Good and bad.

First the good: They have a great skeet, trap and sporting clays range and the range officers were very nice and helpful on me and my buddy's first time trying sporting clays. Several officers noticed he was having problems hitting clays as he's used to shooting scoped rifles. They all stopped by and offered their help in a non-threatening and polite manner and even used their own credits to not waste ours' during the instruction.

Their small bore range is very nice and of the matches I have been to have had great experiences. Went to Winter Range one year and was very impressed on how that was set up.

Now the bad: the public range. The range officers always seem to be cranky and also generally not friendly. I can kind of see why because the other bad is because of some of the shooters there. They are unfamiliar with their weapons or downright don't care. There are some dangerous people on that range. I have been swept with the muzzles of both loaded and unloaded gun NUMEROUS times. Sometimes the officers see, but usually not. I tend to see them more concerned about some very minor violation or making their own rules up. And as I said, just seem to be downright cranky. From what I understand they are all volunteers but that is no excuse. If you can't check your attitude at the door and don't enjoy what you are doing, don't do it.

I used to like the public range for sighting in rifles and scopes, but now skip it due to the dangerous shooters and the poor attitude of the range masters. But the skeet and small bore areas are good to go!"
3,The cold noodles are too pricey. You can get same stuff with half of the price in any other Korean restaurant.
3,"Service was amazing, without a doubt. We got the large pizza and wings combo with the pino sticks to start. The pino sticks were great and the hot wings were great too. But I am probably the only person on this page who didn't like the pizza. Far too much cheese, crust is way too thick, and we just didn't enjoy it. That being said, my husband had their panzerotti a few weeks ago and loved it. I would go back, but only for the pino sticks or a panzerotti."
3,"It's Starbucks - overpriced, but deliciously refreshing.

I usually come to this location for a frap of some sort. I have ordered a Chai Latte, which was done horribly and banana bread, which is usually dry.

There aren't really any other coffee shops near this location, and they move the line pretty quick. I like the location overall."
3,"Here is a review of my trip to this restaurant. My girlfriend co worker came and said it was good, let see.

The first official dish that came was the rare beef. Warning about rare food, it must be kept below 4C. The beef came on the table almost at room temp. I am not eating that and I told the waiter why but I did not get an apology. Not a good start......

So the unagi roll came, not bad. The sashimi came, the rare material is fresh but the cutting is bad, the white tuna is not cut equally. Getting the grill steaks is actually good. This dish along with spider roll with a nice size soft shell crab saved this review from a bashing review.

Overall, this is a nice Japanese restaurant but I would be careful of what you eat here."
3,"For the money, I'll go out to Rio Salado Sportsman's Club.

Here's why:
1. Ben Avery is very simple in what they offer you. 
2. The range master picks out your shooting bench for you, not the other way around.
3. There are no sand bags or rests provided.
4. Going up and down the 17 to anywhere provides to be more of a PITA from central Phoenix than driving out to Mesa.
5. There's no wind protection out here from the winds that plague North Phoenix this time of year. Learn how to use some ""Kentucky Windage"" or you'll have a very long day here.

Don't get me wrong, its a great facility, but its not five stars worth of the greatest facility. I've shot all over Phoenix now as I shoot a lot to stay sharp, and this place is just ""ok.""

Though for the money, the people there are damn entertaining. I really thought some of the stereotypes about Phoenix being highly Republican and Xenophobic were just larks and jokes, but some of the shooters out at Ben Avery on a Thursday afternoon prove these to be truths instead of hyperbole. 

All things being equal, I'll spend my money at Rio Salado while the desert is closed for shooting due to summer fire dangers."
3,"Food: 3/5
Ambiance: 2/5
Service: 3/5

Coming from New York City, where Koreatown has all the Korean food one can imagine, Korea Garden shines ever so dully in my mind. Upon entering the restaurant at prime time on Friday night, there was only one table being served, with the other eight or so empty and devoid of life.

""Weird,"" I thought, ""especially since this restaurant is located so close to where students live!"" Alas, I gave it a try anyway, since I desperately wanted some Korean stew ever since moving to Pittsburgh two months ago.

I got the soondoobu. It's alright. Just, alright. It's quite spicy, but I like my Korean food spicy. The side dishes were... less than ideal. Bland to the point of tasting stale, I did not consume any more past the initial sampling.

So... The food is alright. This restaurant would not survive in New York City's Koreatown, but I was just glad to find some Korean food in Pittsburgh.

Oh, and a note about the service. After I came in, no more customers came in. So, the employees of the restaurant left the front desk and all congregated at the back of the restaurant to chat amongst themselves. There was no service between the time my food got to me and the time I asked for the check. They didn't even bother come over to see if I needed anything, or if the other table needed anything. I was almost anticipating walking to the back of the restaurant to inform them that I would like the check and leave, but goodness the employees left their table gathering just in time.

TL;DR: it's Korean food. Not the best, but satisfies a craving."
3,"Went here for a quick dinner. This place is actually always packed whenever I pass by it so I assume the pho must be good. I wasn't really feeling for pho so I got the Laksa Noodle Soup. I have never tried Laksa Noodles before so this was my first and not gonna lie, it's not too bad. Would I get it again? Maybe not. It's essentially just like a curry broth with a few shrimps & vietnamese sausage slices and two different kinds of noodles; some sort of thick egg noodle and vermicelli? Taste is not bad. I'm not really a fan of curry anymore so when I first put it in my mouth I was like aww...bummer. Noodles were fine; they were cooked just right. The shrimps and sausages were...questionable. Not a huge fan of them...(I LOVE BOTH SO YOU KNOW ITS SAD AF) 

Place is a little dirty looking LOOL SORRY BUT everything looks bleh. Our table was covered with water stains and other oily liquids. And the placement of one of the tables is like wtf? It's literally next to the hole where they bring out the food...like what if your hands slipped and it spilled on the customer? :/"
3,"I was out shopping all day at Heartland Town centre in Mississauga.. Yeah.. yeah.. nothing new haha. Both of my sister in laws were starving and so was I, so we decided to get some sushi. We thought about going to Prince Sushi since it wasn't far from us, thanks to the handy Yelp app. It was Sunday night and parking at Courtney Park was brutal. After zig zagging through the parking lot we managed to find a place to park and ran into this place. At this point our since stomachs started to growl and we started to get really grouchy. When we walked in we had the oppurtunity to pick our own place to sit and we decided to get a booth infront of the kitchen. We decided on the a la carte menu and skipped on the ayce. To start we decided to get the calamari, chicken/veggie gyoza and two miso soups. The food came out fairly quickly and the calamari was so fresh and hot, that I burned the top of my mouth.. Just great! The gyoza was perfectly fried and went awesome with spicy mayo. The miso soup on the other hand was too salty and when we asked for another miso soup, the server didn't understand what we were saying. Why hire people who don't understand simple english.. Ahh language barrier kills me lol.  Any way nothing got solved but we ended up getting our dragon roll and spicy salmon with butterfish and tuna shashimi. It was so moist and fresh we devoured that in seconds. When we got the bill, we still got charged for the two miso soups that we took a sip from. Very irritating. Even if I asked to take it off the bill, he probably wouldn't have understood. Good thing is the sushi was on point. I want to give this place another star but the service ruined it for me. I just hope their servers improve because this place has great sushi :)"
3,"I came here on a Sunday evening and it was quiet.  The restaurant was clean and open.  The hostess sat us right away and there wasn't a wait on the food.  The menu was large and extensive.  They have Japanese style hibachi food and sushi.  I ordered the miso and salad to start and then had a teriyaki tofu dish.  

The tofu was large and a bit soggy.  The flavor was good, but it was definitely too soggy/wet for me.  The veggies were tasty, like I said the sauce they used was flavorful and perfect.  The miso was ok, just average.  The salad, the same.  Overall, nothing special.  I would come back and maybe try something different next time, with the same sauce!"
3,"Good food, but pretty expensive for the portion size. The chicken and kabobs were great, and so was the bread as well. The way they presented the turkish tea and coffee was really nice, and the kanafe was delicious! Great restaurant overall, the only thing is that portion sizes are relatively small for a med/middle eastern restaurant, and prices are quiet expensive, especially considering the area and neighbourhood."
3,"I was here on business from Los Angeles where we have lots of nice quality Sushi.    I also travel to Hong Kong alot where also there is great Sushi.    So for starters I did not have my expectations set very high seeing as how I am in Mississuaga Canada just outside Toronto.

Positives =  Nice AYCE quality served on platters for each item you ordered.    The food quality was about a 6-7.    I was surprised it was this high.    I especially enjoyed the rolled beef with onion.    I felt the price was also a positive as compared to where I am from it was quite economical.  

Negatives - I agree with others comments regarding the servers.   All very sullen, meek, quite, passive, and almost zombie like.    They obviously are not happy working there which is a shame.    IF a quality waitress were to work here I am guessing due to the higher average ticket that they could make a nice amount of tips.    I think this is an OWNERSHIP issue and not wait staff.    The reason I say this is because they don't assign just ONE person to your table but rather serve you as a group.   Thus no single person seemed to have responsibility for the table.   Perhaps a better approach to management and opportunity for each wait staff to take personal ownership for their customers will result in competition and increased incentive to please customers, earn tips, and garner repeat business for the establishment.     If they insist on waiting on customers as a group then the MANAGER of the group needs to motivate, coach, and develop the team better.    It's always the fault of the manager when a whole group is that way."
3,"I'm new in town, went there based on recommendation to celebrate my birthday with some friends. We arrived early so we were not allowed to go up to Resturant until our reservation time. We were guided to sit at the lobby bar/lounge which was very nice and had first good impression of the hotel, however when we finally moved to the Resturant. First impression, It's a casual dining place, if you are craving Mexican food, it's not the place, it's not a Mexican Resturant. I was disappointed where we were seated indoor and at the entrance of Resturant . Didn't even get to see the view. The menu for main dishes are limited., starters are tastier but not Mexican, it has Mexican twist in some of the starters. we ordered sea bream ceviche, fried calamari, burrata, green leafy salad, French fries. My friend and I shared a Bronzino as main dish it was good. The rest of us ordered the spaghetti, the roasted chicken, and lamb cutlet. No one could finish their dishes as we all gave it 5/10. The dessert menu was limited too, however we loved the treleche . If I go back, probably would want to try the breakfast, brunch or drinks if I get a table to see the view. Overall service was good, the hostesses were friendly and attentive."
3,"I have been to this restaurant many times. Hands down some of the best Sushi in Mississauga, and very nice ambiance.

However we had some of the strangest service I have EVER encountered in a restaurant in ANY of the many countries I have traveled to, let alone Canada.

My husband took me there last night for my birthday supper (I am 28, not 19), we had a baby sitter for our son, and it was meant to be a nice relaxed evening, not some crazy birthday celebration.

We first ordered water and a beer each. They asked us how we planned on getting home. (huh? I am against drunk driving, but I have NEVER been asked such a thing upon ordering ONE beer each with a meal). We advised them we arrived by cab and were returning home the same way. (Note: we had not been drinking prior to arriving, and were not loud, rowdy, or acting in any manner that should make anyone question this.)

They brought us ONE beer to our table, and said ""This is big enough for you to share, yes?"".  SERIOUSLY??

So after that sort of response from them, it made things slightly uncomfortable. We ordered our food, didn't even finish our (ONE) beer and asked for the bill.

Once we paid and were going to leave, they offered to call a cab, and I thanked them but said we would be going to the movies first (it is adjacent to AMC theaters). Then they started to QUESTION us, and asked ""are you SURE you're going to call a cab?""

How insulting!!! I have NEVER been treated like that in a restaurant. I could understand if we had been drinking, and acting loud, or rowdy, but we were not, in ANY way, shape or form. This was a very uncomfortable and awkward situation - despite the great sushi."
3,"From the 44th floor so close to the CN tower with a gorgeous pool. the view alone is worth coming here. It has tables and lounge pods, the interior was also beautiful with lots of light wood, the vibe was great. 

A reservation was made for 4 people at 9.30pm, when I was getting in they were starting to form a short line for the night. Went inside and was given a plastic card to take the elevator up. There was a bit of confusion at the elevator about our reservation. We made it up 10 minutes later. We stood at the front waiting for a hostess for a while, we were greeted by at least 3 different people but still haven't gotten a table, it seemed to be disorganized and overbooked. We were told we would be getting table but everyone seemed to be just walking around not knowing what to do. 

Another 10 minutes pass by and we are still standing there, at this point we were standing around for almost 20 minutes. A manager came by (or someone with an earpiece) and acknowledged we have been waiting around and was unhappy with the staff, but he had the audacity to say ""We have the most beautiful hostess but she is also the stupidest"" and went on to tell us how he thought she was dumb. I was appalled that he said that to us! CASUAL MISOGYNY just being thrown around especially to paying customers. I can understand that he was upset but it was just hard to stomach. 

We finally got a table, an amazing corner table with a wrap around view. I got the meatballs for $14, the price was very good for a place like this. It came with lots of crispy pita with a savoury tomato sauce. The meatballs were hot and were a good portion size. I was pleasantly surprised. I also got a cocktail for $18, which was fine it was good. 

We also got chicken skewers for the table to share. I bit into my piece and it was completely RAW on the inside! We returned the chicken and were not charged for it and we were given 2 desserts instead. We got the tres leche cake, which was great it was really moist. And the panna cotta which was soooo good, it came with kiwi and pineapple. It was refreshing and sweet I would order this again. 

Our server at our table was extremely nice, much better than the other service we have received from any one else. By the time we were leaving almost midnight they were no longer letting people in. 

I want to like this place so badly but there were just so many faults that night from the raw chicken but especially the man who called their hostess stupid out loud to customers. I would love to come back but have a hard time support a restaurant that feeds into sexism."
3,"Pros: 
-atmosphere and view of the city 
-drinks (they have an onsite wine sommelier, which is interesting) 
-tapas (food was good but overpriced - you're paying for the atmosphere)

Cons:
-while our waiter was friendly enough, whoever was the floor manager- man in grey suit- the night of the 21st was a dick. (We were still looking at the menu and he came over and told us our table was reserved at 930- it was 730 at the time- and so we better hurry up and order soon, which set the tone for a very rushed dinner. Who does that ?!) 

For such a supposedly high end restaurant, food wait times and overall service made the experience a one time ordeal."
3,"Came here with my colleagues for the first time and I must say I am impressed. 

First impression of the place is not too bad. Looks clean and had some nice waterfall glass decor.

The meals are made fresh and was pretty quick. I went around noon so it wasn't too busy. I ordered the lamb chops and they were super tasty! Some parts were a little burnt resulting in it being overcooked.. 

Overall was a good experience."
3,"I've been here a handful of times over the span of a few years. They have a huge breakfast menu, and also a lunch menu. The lunch menu is mostly sandwiches and wraps. I love the decor inside and everyone is always friendly. The location is behind Denny's all the way up on the hill."
3,"Nice place. One of those pay first and wait in line  for your number to be called to pickup your order and take it to the table.

Nice and clean inside and out. Good potions I actually could not fully finish my meal though it was decent food. Would require a second trip to this place to fully review the dish."
3,Standard Starbucks. Nothing fancy. I will note that the drive thru here is very efficient.
3,"This is a great place for a late night slice of pizza after frequenting other local establishments on Carson street. It will run you $5.00 a slice and there are a few flavor selections, although I've only had the pepperoni. Don't let your eyes fool you....one slice is enough, trust me. I bought two with lofty goals last week and ended up throwing the second one away because I was stuffed and did not want to hate myself in the morning. I rate this place 3 stars for a couple of reasons, it's good - not outstanding, and I wish they would give a girl a box when they see she is going to get a slice to go. Walking a few blocks back home precariously balancing two paper plates is a chore. I will absolutely be back, maybe to try another topping combo."
3,"Great experience at Kost. Food was below average, service was great and the views were incredible. Expect a fun crowd and take plenty of pictures on the roof. It's best to grab a reservation."
3,"Met up with a few out of town friends for brunch at this spot and was pleased with the food.  When we got there there was a 20 minute wait, but we may have waited less than 10 minutes before being seated.

I ordered scrambled eggs and sausage patties and a side order of pancakes (be aware that side orders come with 3 pancakes...I would have been content with 1!).  I only had one of the pancakes because that's way too much food for me but I will say the pancake was delish.  

I can't say the same for my husband's blueberry waffles.  Rather than have the blueberries cooked in the waffle batter they were thrown atop of  a waffle.  While this may not have been a problem if the blueberries were fresh (they weren't, they were frozen) or in the least bit sweet (they weren't and barely edible) my husband took off all the blueberries and ate them without it.  I get that it's not blueberry season so there may be an issue with getting fresh blueberries, but tossing inedible (still cold/partially frozen) blueberries on to an otherwise decent waffle makes it worse.  

I would suggest sticking with their pancakes or getting a plain waffle.  The eggs and sausage are good, but not sure how those can be messed up!."
3,"Do in Canada
Vietnamese sandwiches
It was A-OK

I just can't get into the Vietnamese sandwich thing. I don't know what it is. My friends say that it's because I haven't actually had an amazing bahn mi experience, and I guess I would have to agree. 

Vua is like a Subway/Chipotle for Vietnamese sandwiches. They are decently priced, decently sized, weakly stuffed, and are the same price as a drink here (approximately $5-6). The bubble tea is ridiculously sweet... not sure if that's a complaint or not...

I did what had to be done: Bahn Mi in Montreal, but I wish it was better. Le sigh."
3,"I wish I could do 3.5 on this one. But I can't justify doing 4. Is it the best option in Southside? Definitely. Unless you travel down to the works and hit up Michael's. 

Went in on a Tuesday around 9 just to grab one to take home. I got 2 slices for myself to go because I didn't want to be limited with just one haha but I could have just had one and been good. 

First off, both the garlic sauce and ranch dressing were not good. However, I did really enjoy the sauce on the pizza. The crust was just ok to me. And all around it was pretty decent just not something I would need to go back for any time soon. 

The kicker to me is I ordered two slices to go and the to go was just on paper plates and in paper bags. I understand that I didn't pay for a whole pie buy considering I paid $10 and that's the price of normal small pies, I think they could have some cheap boxes. Especially since 2 slices are the size of some pizzas. 

Will I go back? If I'm down here super late night and need pizza, absolutely. Just because I want pizza, no."
3,I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the cordial and efficient waitress. The good was quite decent with soy sauce and my compatriots enjoyed the food and time spent there.
3,"Our group planned on Denny's which was closed for renovating, so we ate at OPH instead. Our group of 3 was seated as soon as we walked in around 9:30 on a Sunday morning, in the back area. Our server was friendly, she seemed young, and unfortunately couldn't answer our question about the type of filling in the blintzes. She also forgot to bring extra silverware, straws, and coffee creamer after running back and forth a few times to get our drink orders.

The 4 slices of thick cut bacon could've used a bit more cooking to be crispy, sunny side eggs were cooked nicely, and the stack of pumpkin pancakes were a bit on the thin side. The strawberry blintz was about the size of a good burrito, my daughter couldn't tell if the filling was cream cheese based, or not. She did like it, but not enough to eat the whole blintz. Our fellow diner, had ordered 2 of the crepes, but only got one in his order. So he wasn't too happy about that oversight. 

My impression is that this is a nice place to try, but nothing I'd plan on making it a regular spot. Extra training for service would help a lot, and the parking lot could use some extra space as well."
3,"Pizza was OK and generous with cheese - had half spivak and half pino. Pino had meat that seemed overcooked, but the spivak was fine. Server was very nice. However we waited 45 minutes for the pizza to finally arrive."
3,"I also drive about 45 minutes to use Chapman to service my girlfriend's Mazda. We bought her car here about February of last year and forced the salespeople to stay there until like 1 in the morning at the end of the month before they closed us.

I trust their service department to a certain extent. When we test drove my girlfriend's car before buying it, none of the salespeople were available to join me so they asked a service guy to accompany me. This service guy wasn't very professional but he did let me really test drive the car by pushing it to its limits. I have worked with some extremely friendly service guys here though, especially this heavier set guy who was very knowledgeable about Mazdas.

The salespeople weren't very forthcoming about the reliability of the car we went their to buy, although we did go into the sale knowing that we would need to be very diligent about maintenance being that it is a rotary engine car. What I am most upset about is that they straight up lied to me about how they thought the value would hold up with the car. Several months after we bought her car, the KBB dropped about $5K. So screw you guys for that, won't buy another car from you because of that. Pretty shady, but I have worked sales and I know what you guys have to do sometimes, I guess I was just a victim this time.

But I will continue to have the car serviced here because I am OCD about having my service records be from the same dealership every time. You got me with the 10 dollar oil changes."
3,"Meh. Not bad, but below average pho. Didn't enjoy the fish cakes. Not a consistency that I'm used to. The lighting made us feel depressed. 
Not a bad experience, but no reason to come back."
3,"Tasty pho and good portions of meat. The only thing I don't like is how the restaurant has such a strong smell of pho, and you always end up smelling like it for the rest of the day."
3,"I've been wanting to review TOPH for awhile and on my fourth visit I figured it was about time. Hit or miss on other visits, my fourth time was here was the kicker. 

First, the place doesn't look like a pancake house. With a little more wood paneling, this place could be confused with a steak house if you weren't aware of where you were. Beautiful light fixtures hang from a high ceiling, and high, wood framed archways welcome you into the restaurant. Easy listening music play softly in the background. 

I looked over the menu and decided on a short stack of buckwheat pancakes and a cup of coffee. For those of us worried about caloric intake TOPH lists calories for each meal (sans syrup) and a short stack (3) of buckwheat is 560 calories. Pancakes are my comfort food, my indulgent meal. 

The cakes were hot off the griddle, steaming and just a little undercooked in the middle which added to their tenderness. The syrup added the sweetness needed and complimented the  the buckwheat pancakes to a tee. Did I detect a touch of cinnamon in the syrup or was it in the batter? Who cares, it was delicious. The coffee was nothing special even though  the menu exclaims it's award winning and they sell if on premises for home brewing. 

The place is overly noisy, no acoustic absorbing ceiling tiles to keep the customer's conversations from bouncing off the walls. For convenience, at the bottom of the bill they give a gratuity calculation or 18 or 20%. Way better than Eat N Park, Denny's and King's, my only issue is the parking lot, smallish and way undersized for a restaurant this size. Avoid this place on a Sunday morning, as I'm sure it's packed to the rafters. My bill was 8.56 for three cakes and endless coffee."
3,"I had high hopes for this place when I ordered it. Unfortunately the food was not as great as I had hoped. 

Food was quite bland, it wasn't as tasty as I had hoped. I would skip this place and go to Fat Pasha instead."
3,"Located right outside of the ever busy Berri-UQAM metro station and at the corner of the Latin Quarter, it's no wonder that this below ground restaurant always has a line up at the cashier. The incredibly affordable freshly pre-packaged options are plentiful: all different sizes of boxed sushi, salads (Greek, pasta, or Vietnamese), Vietnamese salad rolls, and sweets. If you've got time though, the made to order banh-mi and bubble tea are worth the wait.   

Besides the few coveted seats on the sidewalk patio out front, the dim, but air conditioned dining area features clean seating and televisions looping the latest news and weather."
3,I've given this place a couple of tries and although the food is good. The service is quite slow and have witnessed the cashier/waitress get in arguments with customers over items that could easily be rectified. I'll be driving the extra 5 mins and go to Bamiyan instead.
3,"I avoided Vua for a long time because it looked so much like a chain restaurant.  I was expecting the Vietnamese version of Thai Express or Sushi Shop. Turns out I was wrong and it's actually just an independent shop that clearly aspires to be the Vietnamese fast food franchise chain of note.

At first I thought I arrived in a convenience store (and in some ways it is), but they also have a deli counter where I ordered a Saigon style 10"" Bahn Mi. Their ten inch sandwich was too much for me, next time I'll stick to the regular size.

My sandwich was ready mere minutes after ordering.  The staff don't slack, they can get really hammered during lunch time and at $2.95 a sandwich, volume is where their profits lie.

Most of the interior is lined with shelves and refrigerators bursting with an impressive assortment of ready made Asian goodies.  It spans from Banh Mi of course to Sushi and Bubble Tea, and lots and lots of imported snacks and drinks.  If you need an Asian fix, but Chinatown is too far away, Vua might satisfy your cravings. They even have a few tables near the entrance and a small terrace for customers.

I'm not really an expert on Vietnamese sandwiches, but I have had the real thing.  While not as good as the original, they do serve up a reasonable facsimile.  Is there better Banh Mi in Montreal? Probably, but sometimes it's all about location and Vua is in an incredible spot, and at $2.95 you'll not find a cheaper lunch in the area."
3,"This place isn't bad.

We stopped here after work to grab a quick bite.  I love Greek food so I was excited to try a new place out.  

I tried the chicken shwarma pita wrap and a side of Greek fries.  I have to say I was disappointed.  There was plenty of food so portion was not a problem.  The chicken wasn't bad but just didn't have the flavor that I have seen at other similar restaurants.  The Greek fries came with feta but had no oil on them so they were pretty dry.  

The staff was friendly so no issues there.  I can't say for sure I would stop in again but who knows.  Overall, not bad but not great either."
3,"Pretty standard range. There's one skinny kid with glasses that thinks he's king of the range and is kind of a dick. He also stares at people way too long for comfort. He'll stand over your shoulder staring at you like your a 5 year old and dont know anything about firearms, and try to small talk with you while your shooting too. It's really annoying."
3,"I found this place on a list of great cheap eats. It was OK. Banh Mei was good but not great. This is fast food, nothing special. A sandwich and spring roll $9. Fine in a rush for cheap, don't take to impress"
3,"Got a TON of food from this place: chicken banh mi, chicken wings, two avocado/cucumber sushi boxes, sesame ball, shrimp spring roll, chicken spring roll and a basil seed drink.

Stingy with chicken banh mi but very flavorful & fresh ingredients.  Loved the sauce they put in it.  I've had better in NYC though.

Chicken wings could use more flavor but at 30% off, what's the problem.  Same applies to the sushi.  They also water down their soy sauce tremendously to the point of almost no flavor.  Sping rolls could also use more flavor.  I've made better at home.  Peanut sauce is helpful with flavor but again, could use more bang.  Sesame ball is better at dim sum.

Loved the basil seed drink.  Not too sweet with a bit of chewy crunch.  Yum.

Fed two people dinner and breakfast for $20, what's the [big] problem?"
3,"Located in the Richlane Plaza, Green Lemon Grass serves mostly Vietnamese, Thai and other South East Asian dishes.  The menu is actually quite extensive and covers a variety of dishes from noodles, rice, curries amongst others.

I ended up getting the large Pho special which was the sliced rare and well done beef, tripe, tendon and meat balls.   The broth was good and flavourful but didn't really stand out.   The tendon was underdone and a bit too chewy for my taste.  

Some of the other dishes that people ordered looked pretty good so wouldn't mind trying them out next time.

It does get busy during lunch and dinner time but food comes out fast so turnover is high.  A pretty good option if you are in the area."
3,Food was good but pricey. Gave you large portions enough to share. Restroom was disgusting.
3,"The food wasn't as good as it used to be a few years ago. The quality is decreasing in some foods like the tempura. The one a few years ago was traditional, but now the alternate is not as good as it used to be. So I have to go to like Sushiya to get some better quality food."
3,"Local place, the sushi was good and service was nice. It is a good place if you live in the area but I would not recommend anybody drive across town to visit it."
3,"We came across this place quite by accident, and actually a nice ""find"".

Nice decor and friendly staff.
Good offerings, although I will say that I am pretty new to Turkish food --- lots of Mediterranean type tapas and appetizers, and really good kabobs, and lamb dishes.

They do the turkish coffee perfectly at the end -- served with ice water and a piece of turkish delight!  That was the best.

Unfortunately they were out of the regular baklava --- so I guess we will have to go back and see if next time they have it!"
3,"Overall 3.5 stars.
We came here for dinner with family. This place gets really busy during dinner rush; had to wait a while for a table. 
We ordered a number of dishes to share. Portions were large.
- Curry beef brisket roti: this was one of the fav dishes of the night, even my little nieces loved it. Roti was nice and fluffy and not overly greasy; we had to order a second roti. The curry was a bit too salty for my liking, but everyone else liked it.

- Spicy beef rice noodles (Bun Bo Hue). This is a popular Viet noodle soup. I am Viet and found that the noodle wasn't quite authentic. I wouldn't get this again.
 
- Beef satay noodle soup; beef satay served with soft Pho noodles and peanut. I enjoyed this, very flavourful and I loved the Pho noodles. The small size is quite large.

- Pad Thai: comes with shrimps and chicken; decent portion. It was just alright, not bad but not amazing. Very average pad Thai.

- Pineapple fried rice, comes with shrimps and  little chunks of grilled lemon grass flavoured chicken. Fried rice was quite tasty but the little chunks of pineapple could have blended in a little better. We did enjoy this dish.

Overall, decent food, large portion, affordable prices, service is typical asian standard (which means don't expect much service). I would come back"
3,"Most starbucks usually have good service but this is the second time my mobile order did not process bec the sricker machine jammed up.  When I was asked what my order was, it seemed rushed and i had to get the lady's attention several times. The reason I order mobile is because i'm in a rush and i have special instructions."
3,this range is a hidden treasure.  low wait times and few restrictions.  the only thing missing are misters for our AZ heat!
3,"Decided to finally come here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday evening. I heard so much about KOST, so my expectations were pretty high.

Service: When we first walked in, we were greeted with the hostess at the front who was very kind and accommodating with our seating requests. As for the rest of the night, I was not particularly impressed with the service we received. We were seated for approx 30 minutes before someone approached us to take our drinks order. Once we were finished with the drinks, it took yet another 15-20 minutes to get a waiter's attention for the dinner menu which he then proceeded to give the whole table just one menu???

Food: To start, we ordered a pitcher of sangria. Every other table seemed to get their cup filled with ice and some oranges/lemon in the cup as well. Our server just placed the cups on our table with no fruit or ice in it. Also, the sangria did not taste fresh at all. It was as if it was made from a powder mix. As for the food, it was very good and had unique flavours which I really enjoyed. We shared the green chorizo meatballs, spaghetti al limone, and the tomato and burrata salad. My only criticism for the food would be the chorizo meatballs. they had a good taste, however I did not like the texture. For dessert, we ordered the coconut lime and guava sorbet which also had a great flavour to it. 

Price: It was on the pricey side, however it wasn't as expensive as i thought because we split it amongst 2 people. The main dishes are on the more expensive side.

I wouldn't necessarily come back here for lunch/dinner... maybe brunch instead.  Would definitely return just to see the view though!"
3,How is it that no matter what time I come in here there is no one in the store yet they toke FOREVER to make a drink let along make it right... it's like they're challenged or improperly trained... Never understood when it's busy you would rather deep clean then get drinks out in a faster pace... Seems no one has a sense of urgency!
3,I always have a good time out here but the range officers not all of them can be very hostile some of them really like to scream. I understand if someone is being unsafe you have to let them now there's a couple of these Guys are very aggressive towards the people out here
3,"Not bad, but nothing special. The omelets had a weird aftertaste. Not a place I would seek out again."
3,"They seem to pack you in when you have a large party. This is a problem since your order is multiple plates. DO NOT order the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict - there is far too much cheap fillers in their crake cakes. I did not care for having to pay as you head out the door, maybe since our table was near the register and the lines at times crowded our table. I found nothing to make me come back. Our waitress seemed to run past the table avoiding eye contact and was poor on checking back."
3,"I find Pizza Pino somewhat deceptive, they put the cheese on top which covers how few of the other items they actually put on the pizza."
3,"I chose to come here based on the pictures I saw from the interior and the reviews I read here. I love Middle Eastern food, but never had Turkish food. So, I followed my curiosity and decided to bring my family here to try the 4 star Turkish restaurant. The plaza this restauant is located at is very ghetto, and the parking lot was empty, but the interior design and the comfy pillows in the booths surely impressed me. They brought the appetizer and main food together. The chef's appetizer plate consisted of 6 different items, which were very average in taste. I have had much better Hummus and Babaghanouch elswhere. I gave Lahmacun a try and it was alright (it's very mild in terms of spiciness and has ground beef and cheese with herbs). The only thing I really liked was the Kunefe dessert. It's like baklava but has cheese inside! trust me you want to try this one! Also, the Ayran (home made yogurt drink) is very thick and delicious. I was surprised how average the tea was, considering all the excellent reviews. The tea was nothing special in my opinion. If I come here again, I'll try their other pizzas."
3,"Huge pizza, but pretty slim on the toppings I felt.  I came all the way from Oshawa to try this pizza out.

Perhaps Friday night was an off night, because the XL Pino Special I got was one slim pizza when it came to toppings.  It was pretty reasonable with the cheese, though, but I think I'll just stick to Beenos in Oshawa.  Same style of pizza but probably double the toppings as Pizza Pino."
3,"This place is great when the drive thru line is not wrapped around pretty much the whole store. When it's busy, the quality of both drinks and food seems to go way down.

When they weren't swamped, my frappucino was icy and my bf's iced cappucino had ice in it. When they were swamped, my frappucino was like the ones in the bottles (melted completely) and his cappucino was watery."
3,"Food is good here.  Love the soft shell crab app here.  

The reason for the 3 star rather than 4 is because the service here is horrible.  

For an AYCE they time you to the second.  Often prior to your time up... they bring you the bill and rush you out even if you still have over 30mins to go.

I will not be coming back for this reason alone.  There are so many other places to feel comfortable and you feel good to give your money to."
3,"My partner and I decided to visit the Original Pancake House for a late weekend breakfast. 

We were quoted 15 minutes and we waited about 10 for a table. 

We were greeted quickly and we both ordered a large orange juice. It was definitely fresh squeezed, and quite sweet!

We were given the breakfast menus but I had heard there were lunch menus. I am not a big breakfast person so I was looking for it. I didn't see it on the menu so I decided to stick to breakfast but after ordering I found that some nearby tables had one tucked in to the condiments. so they may offer lunch in the morning I am not sure.

My boyfriend of course ordered the famous Apple Pancake which we were told takes at least 30 minutes to prepare, which he was fine with. It is worth the wait people! It basically tasted like a huge (the size of a frisbee) apple cinnamon roll that with a gooey, syrupy, sometimes crunchy coating of pure caramelized sugar deliciousness. It is extremely rich & I would recommend sharing this with at least one other person, because it's huge & very very sweet.

I got the Italian omelette w/ a fruit cup. The omelette was just huge. The egg was fluffy, and the sliced hot sausage inside was soft and yummy, but the sauce tasted very bland and just thrown on top. I also didn't care for the sharp shredded cheese on top, I think mozzarella would fit better. Mostly, there was just way too much egg to get an even bite of everything. I wouldn't recommend this omelette.

The fruit cup was good with a nice selection of bananas, grapes, pineapple, and cantaloupe. 

Our waitress was very friendly but when it's packed, it does take a while to get a refill of water, our food, etc.; service is so-so. They need to hire more people.

Also, it is a bit expensive for breakfast but they seem to cook everything to order and make many things from scratch. I would categorize this as more of a special occasion than a 'hey let's go get breakfast' kinda place.

I might be back if my boyfriend makes me, but I wouldn't choose it for myself."
3,"Their drive thru is currently wrapped around which means that all the baristas are making drinks for them. While I'm the only one that ordered from their lobby area, it's been 10 mins and still no drink for me. I usually don't complain but I do think that they shouldn't ignore other consumers. 

Ordered a white chocolate mocha frapp, made to perfection. Their lobby is clean, lots of tables and chairs available to lounge in or study. The music is a little too loud at this location but at least it's calm music. Bar seems to be fully stocked and wiped down. My go to location when I'm on the north side running errands. 

One of the bathrooms were clean but someone forgot to flush on the other. Not sure if they check on that hourly but I'm assuming they do because of the wet floor sign that's blocking the entrance."
3,"2.8 /5
I frequented this place a lot but haven't been back for so long.  I was told the quality and portions have declined but decided to see for myself. I went on a weeknight and right away I felt the business has declined it used to be pretty full even in the evenings I think we were 1.5 hrs before closing which was at 9pm  we usually get the stir fried vermicelli with grilled chicken  and a Pho but the kitchen said that they couldn't make it the stir fried just the regular,  bummer. So all in all the portions are smaller but more important the taste was different my tastebuds were not satisfied, better and cleaner Viet placed around."
3,"Lori from LMAH contacted me after reading the initial review. She apologized for the incident and refunded the $50 exam fee. I appreciate her prompt response in resolving this matter. She is very reasonable, kind and easy to talk to."
3,"I was craving Korean food so my bf took me here. We both never tried the place but decided to give it a try. It was during Sunday lunch and luckily it wasn't too busy so we got our food quickly and the service was great considering it was just one guy waiting on 4 tables. 

My bf got the black bean noodles. He said it was okay. I think the sauce might have been from a frozen pack and not home made. I got the kim chi jigae. It was good. Nice and spicy and hit my kimchi craving. We also got the duk bok gi and that was really yummy.

Overall this place was okay. Not spectacular, but okay. Some of the prices are expensive compared to other places I've eaten. Otherwise, good place to go if you want to have a quick Korean meal."
3,"Good Korean food, but just wayyyy too expensive for their quality. I don't think anyone in their right mind should charge $20 on bulgogi without any quality sides like fish or scrambled egg, potatoes or tofu soup combinations...they don't even do that in LA restaurants!! Good food, but they're taking advantage with their pricing. Average cost for two people is about $50 meal, without appetizers or dessert and maybe just ONE beer. The first time I went here, their food was really good. The second time, it got really oily and sparse...and they added too much onions to fulfill the plate. Would go here again, but not as often as I'd like to, or at least til I find another local Korean joint."
3,"It was hard to find parking on Sundays. The atmosphere is really nice but noisy. It reminds me of the waffle house but more elegant. You have to wait to be seated which took around 15 mins. After we sat, the waiter did not come for like 5 mins. When she came, we were ready to order. We had to wait around 30 mins for our food. The food was good but I was disappointed in some of the dishes such as the fruit crepe. The crepe was soggy and salty. Service is OK. The waiter did not come to check on us until we were done eating. The prices are reasonable."
3,Nice views. Overpriced dishes. Nice views. Go here in the summer for drinks.  I live in the building and I rarely eat here unless it's to showcase the view.
3,"Lunch with colleagues, group of 9. Place is always busy so need to call for reservation. Frequent this place before but find it dirty this visit. The glass of water served has some leftover food sticking on the inside, service tea has floating bubbles, is it soap? Yayks! 

Servers could a add a smile or a friendlier feel 

Foodwise is ok. Ordered phad thai and lemongrass chicken wings. Both are not bad but nothing really stands out. 

Weird that their machine charge $. 25 surcharge fee for debit after adding the amount and tip.  Also they charge you extra for take out containers!"
3,"I saw this place opened right next to my nail shop, so I decided to grab some lunch after my mani/pedi. They describe their food as ""healthy Mediterranean cuisine"".  They have most of the regular items you'd expect to find at a Mediterranean restaurant, but they also have sandwiches that have nothing to do with Mediterranean food (e.g., Philly Cheese Steak, Tuna Salad, etc.).  I'm not sure whether that's good or bad.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with half basmati rice and half salad (French fries are also an option).  It comes with a side of tzatziki.  All in all, it was a pretty good meal.  I would call this Mediterranean-light -- similar to Pita Jungle, which is fine in the middle of a workday, as I'd be asleep in my office if I ate heavy Mediterranean food at lunch. 

It's a nice addition to the area, and will be my regular go-to for lunch after my pampering time."
3,"I enjoy this place for their pancakes and their eggs which they always cook just the way I like them, crispy on the outside and the yoke still a little bit runny

Some of their waffle and omelette combinations are interesting and my kids seem to enjoy the waffles with fruit on top"
3,"I have mixed feelings about this place.

My family came here for Mother's Day. It's a Turkish place that serves halal meat (as do many if not most other places in this area). We had a reservation for 9pm. When we went in, it was busy but not so busy that we couldn't pick our table. We didn't get that chance though. We were seated on the side where two large parties with small, fussy babies and children were. This affected our atmosphere.

While the servers were helpful and friendly, I found the overall service to be odd. We ordered a chili dip and zucchini patties to start. The server brought out the olives and bread to start. Then we got just the dip (no bread) and the zucchini patties. Not sure if the dip came late for some reason, or if there was accompanying bread that was forgotten? Anyway, the chili dip is not good. But the zucchini patties are amazing.

For mains, we ordered the chicken skewers, the adana kebab, the iskender kebab and the Turkish ravioli. The ravioli was the worst thing ordered. the past was small so you could barely taste the meat in it and it was covered in a tangy youghurt and sauce. The chicken was byfar the best meat. It was so succulent and juicy! The iskender kebab is basically the doner kebab with more stuff. It was pretty good. The adana kebab is made of ground veal and it was okay.

We finished with pistachio ice cream which was delicious and fragrant (of rose water).

There's definitely things I enjoyed about this place and I'd like to come back. However, I wasn't completely wowed, especially considering the price, so returning isn't high on my list of priorities at the moment."
3,"This place has some good Pancakes. I like fast breakfast, I.e. Waffle House but you can not compare the both. If you have time this is the place. There should never be a speedy breakfast, an these guys are great with the quality of the food."
3,"My friends eat out a fair bit. Some might even say too much. So when it comes to reliable choices for post gym, hearty, heart warming food, I feel plenty comfortable blindly following them anywhere. Yesterday, that meant a quick lunch stop at Green Lemon Grass.

Green Lemon Grass is a small South East Asian restaurant located in a building within which there there are several other restaurants. We went on a holiday afternoon, and were lucky enough to nab the last couple of available seats. I doubt making reservations here is an option, but that being said, I doubt that you would have to wait too long if you stop by.

Hopefully they serve plenty of other good stuff, but we went purely for the curry. I couldn't tell you what the specific name is of the dish that I had, but it was probably something like pork roti with curry. The dish is pretty simple. You'll be served a warm curry with relatively no spicy heat, (which isn't a bad thing), and a several pieces of roti that sandwich pork bits, and what I assume is some sort of egg mixture. On on top of being simple in composition, the dish is relatively simple flavour wise. But don't get me wrong; simple flavours done well are often all you need for a filling meal. For under $9, you'll enjoy the freshly baked roti, and a curry recipe that they obviously have confidence in, since all the other curry dishes on the table had the same base.

Upon leaving, I was plenty satisfied. Aside from wanting some more elbow room and access to the restaurant's bathroom instead of the one down the hall, I can't complain. The food certainly won't knock your socks off, but you'll be happy."
3,"Very nice interior. Lots of seating. Went on a Sunday evening yand was really busy yet only had one cash open which was weird. Got the herati Kebob with one chicken Kebob and one beef kofta Kebob. Took about 30 minutes to be ready. 

As a regular bamiyan customer I will compare the two. Bamiyan wins hands down. The chicken was over cooked and te rice was too dry. Even the bread wasn't as fresh. Overall good experience but with bamiyan only a 10 min drive north I'd rather drive over for far superior food."
3,"Not value for money. Chicken shawarma was good. But, most of the food feels like reheated and place is deserted even during lunch hours. They need to improve quality of food and presentation significantly"
3,"It was pretty good.  I had one of the bowls with rice.  I thought the options were good, but overall I did not feel like the quality was as good as some other places I have tried.  I went at the end of the day and I felt like it could have been fresher.  I just wondered how long some of that stuff had been sitting out."
3,"Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks.  There is simply times when you need the extra jolt that Starbucks gives you and today was that day.  Nothing fancy today- just a large bold coffee and out the door.  

Service was a bit slow, but it was fine."
3,"Green Lemon Grass recently renovated and looks better than before.  The food itself is still the same thou.  The Rare beef noodle is okay, the soup flavouring is decent, noodles not too soggy but the beef itself was a poor cut - tasted bad and rubbery.  Also Beef to noodle ratio isn't that good.  This place gets busy on most days and do require waiting.  The service is pretty fast when the staff is not too busy watching tv.  The pricing is decent compare to all other pho places.

Rating:

Service: 3/5
Food Quality: 2/5
Comfort 2/5
Decor  4/5
Value: 3/5
Parking: 4/5"
3,"Pleasantly surprised by this place. One of best sushi places I've experienced, food-wise. The lukewarm customer service experience is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. I do value good customer service."
3,Good food but one thing that really threw me off and kinda makes me want to stay away is the fact me and my wife received straws with makeup stains on them which leads me to believe they were trying to be reused.
3,"I like the concept and the food came out pretty damn quickly, but I probably shouldn't have ordered the Pad Thai. It just wasn't very good. The flavor wasn't right and the noodles were pretty mushy.

I would consider trying them out again, probably trying something a little more ""safe""."
3,"This steakhouse has been on my hotlist for a while now and I finally had an occasion worth going for. Have always been a little hesitant due to the pricing but decided to give it a shot and see what they were all about. Very nice old school classic steakhouse with stained glass windows and interesting decorations. Complimentary valet parking is a nice extra but honestly completely unnecessary as the parking lot is very small and close to the restaurant but I suppose older patrons appreciate it. The service was good, although like other reviews I've read I also found they were either rushing us and hovering over the table and then nowhere to be found in the 2nd half of the meal. My mother in law also told she had been here before and they were treating her not very nicely because her English isn't very good. For the prices they charge and in this area service should be impeccable to everyone that walks through the door. Aside from being hard to find in the latter half of my meal the server was polite and on point if not a bit rushing. For apps we tried escargot and onion soup, these were not the best and to be honest the keg does these dishes much much better and for less. Everything else was good, some pickled vegetables for side appetizers and garlic bread was nice and very garlicky. The steaks were excellent! Cooked well and delicious, I found my New York peppercorn to be definitely one of the better steaks I've had in the city. My wife found her filet mignon to be a bit dry. Typically filet mignon is a less fatty cut that drys out easily which is why so many places wrap it in bacon to keep in the moisture but octagon just serves it straight up so expect a dryer steak if you are getting the filet. Otherwise everything else was really good. This is worth an experience to go once but I'd skip on appetizers and just go with steaks and drinks. They have a very nice wine list. Overall I don't feel the prices are justified and bang for buck I'd choose keg over octagon but if you're trying to impress for a business meeting or something it could be the place to go."
3,"I've been to Sumo a handful of times now. The sushi and cocktails are amazing. Extremely flavorful sushi and a variety of raw and cooked rolls. Strong drinks to top off the night. Loved the sake! 

I was expecting a better hibachi experience. Ordered the chicken and shrimp dish...it was mediocre. The glaze on the chicken was bland. Our cook that evening did the usual hibachi style tricks - ""egg-roll"", ""butter-fly"" (literally), choo-choo train with the onion stack which is amazing for the kids. Fun stuff, but the adults could use more entertainment and interaction from the cook.

The sumo statue in the entrance of the restaurant is awesome! I love the concept. Cute drum waiting seats to sit on or for little ones to play with. The interior was designed beautifully especially the sushi bar. The first time I went to this restaurant a lady who was probably the manager was loud or just seemed extremely overwhelmed with employees and customers when giving direction. No other issues with waiters or waitresses. Would definitely come back for sushi and drinks."
3,"Location: this is a decent size store with all different types of appliances that you can think of. 
Service: a sales rep greed us when we first walked in. He showed us where the dishwashers were and gave us space to look for things on our own. He stopped by again to check up on us but was never a bother. On my way out (without purchasing any item), he said thanks for stopping by and let us go. 

We were here looking for a dishwasher and they were all overpriced. You can get much better deals at home depot or Lowe's and we ended up getting a LG one at home depot. 

Rating: I'll probably not come here again due to pricy items. I still want to give it a 3 stars because service is decent."
3,Update:  After some huffing and puffing and correspondence with the better business bureau Spencers agreed to resolve the issue.  New rating reflects good pricing and experience with sales person but will look elsewhere for new purchases (including the matching dryer we intended to buy) as I found management to be lacking in customer service skills.
3,"I rated 3 stars because i expected more from an upscale steakhouse with this price point. The food is really good in general. Complimentary garlic bread is crisp which i really enjoyed. The platter came with pickle, olives, and pepper are unusual compared to other steakhouses but also very great to munch on. We shared the escargot, caprese salad and the porterhouse (24oz). The escargot is bland, nothing special. I actually like the keg's escargot more because it is way more flavourful. The caprese salad is very average as well. Dressing is not fully coated and again, $18 make me i think it'd be more special. The Porterhouse is very good. It came medium rare just how i asked and the meat is soft, definitely not chewy at all. Service wise is professional but not warm and welcoming. Theres no wine list so the server had to list it out for me but he was in a rush when listing it so i couldn't catch anything so i just picked whatever i heard. Later on when food came out he said next time he would not be able allow us to share the steak because policy is one entree per person. We understand that but the way he explained was not really empathetic and That kinda ruined our mood too because we are those people who never stingy with paying for food and 24oz steak is really big for both of us. Whenever we eat out we always get 8 or 10 oz. And the porterhouse is something i always wanna try so I picked that on the menu.  Plus we ordered 3 drinks, and 2 appetizers so i dont think we were being cheap.  Afterall it was a great classic steak house with great service but id rather be at jacobs, barberian, Ruth chris or even the Keg."
3,"I was really excited to try honeygrow because healthy, quick-service restaurants are pretty rare in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the food on both tries. 

I first got a build your own noodle bowl. This lacked flavor and I had to add a combination of sauces to try to revive it.

The salad was okay, but nothing I'd order again. 

Although they charge to add individual ingredients, they skimp on quantity. I opted to add a few extra things but could barely find them. Also, they charge almost $2 to add a hard boiled egg and I wasn't even sure an en entire egg made it in. 

While I love the idea of this place, I think it's far too expensive for the quality and quantity."
3,"Nice Service, But Not Impressed By My Drink Here.....

The girl at the counter a few weeks ago when I visited here was really friendly and did her part well. I cannot complain at all about the service and the atmosphere of the business was nice and clean as well. I specially like all the pictures of things on the wall which help someone like me make a choice by seeing that it looks tasty and expecting that it will actually be tasty as well.

I saw a bunch of my yelp friends have really enjoyed this place and frequent it often. We thought we would stop in for a little treat and I don't remember the thing that I ordered anymore since it's been a few weeks but I definitely wasn't impressed with my treat.

I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't much flavor or anything going on with my drink. When you go to get a treat you expect some sort of treatishly goodness to excite your mouth. All I got was a drink that didn't really taste like too much and left me wondering why I had bothered get it.

I feel bad giving them only three stars but out of five stars that three stars was for the service and clean environment. The treat just really didn't do anything and was a disappointment."
3,"I was so excited that my favorite Vietnamese che place from CA opened in AZ.  We were the only ones there that day and location is rather hidden in the plaza.  The ones in CA are always packed so that was a surprise.  It's great that they have a large picture menu wall showcasing all their creative colorful che combinations.  I ordered the Red Bean Combo (red bean, taro, pandan jelly, coconut milk).  Unfortunately, it was waaay too sweet for my taste and I have a pretty sweet tooth.  There was even a table with bottles of syrup for if you wanted to make your drink EVEN sweeter.  I think the drink would be as good as the ones I've had in CA as long as I request less sweet next time.  Will give it another try."
3,"Stopped by here for lunch on a regular week day.  The all you can eat sushi deal looks fun, but opted for something from their takeout menu and ordered the Fire House roll, Red Dragon roll, edamame and the miso soup.  The Fire House roll was by far my favourite, the rest of the order was ok, nothing to write home about.  

Service was meh, but the prices were good.  I will definitely go back to try the All You Can Eat deal next time."
3,"Stopped in for lunch, a little concerned that I was the only patron at the time. You order at the counter, and then they bring it out. I had the pulled chicken sandwich with a side of street corn casserole.   Unfortunately my side dish came out cold, so I had to go back to the counter and ask for them to warm it up. My sandwich was ok, seemed like the chicken was in a small pile on one side of the sandwich. 
Food was ok, but not inspiring in any way."
3,"The food I've always gotten here is very fresh. Never spicy though. If you like spicy like I do, make sure to find some way for them to kick it up a notch. The food is a little pricey but for me, it makes two meals so I can't complain. The place always seems clean to me."
3,My friends have been raving about Bambu from Cali trips.  Then they heard one was opening in AZ.  And they have been here a few times.  But then I hear about the place having a smell due to the dog grooming next door.  I came here on a Saturday night but I did not smell anything unusual but then again I have three dogs.  LOL!  The staff was extremely friendly and super awesome to explain the drinks.  I got the blended Thai tea with boba.  It was a lot sweeter than I like.  All the other drinks look good.  I will ask for 1/2 sweetened next time.
3,"Finally went to the new Congee Queen. It was easy to find. Situated close to Pickle Barrel/No Frills. Or for those who are more familiar with the separate plaza across, across from Beer Store/Timmys/Baskin Robbins. 

Lots of space when we entered here on Saturday evening. We ordered...

E4 Taiwanese Vermicelli - 
This was a bit dry and a tad bland. 

K47 Crab Meat Seaweed Salad - 
It looked very impressive in the photos but it didn't taste that good. Maybe they could add more mayo. I've had much better crab meat salad before. Also there was very little seaweed in there. Unless cucumbers count as seaweed. 

K53 Fried Chili Turnip Patties - 
Bland. Usually you can taste the spice. The turnips were cut quite large.

K38 Fried wings w/ garlic - 
It was ok. I still think Kenny's delight is better. But it tasted better a day later. Too sticky with the honey.

K17 Snow pea leaves w/ garlic sauce - 
This was probably the best dish. Very tasty and just perfection. But it better be for $12.99

K22 General Tao chicken - 
Disappointing. I liked this dish more at 'fake' Chinese restaurants. Portion was a bit small. 

It was ok but I prefer the location and standards of the 404/Steeles location better."
3,"My BF and sister went here about 1 year ago and meant to write the review, so here it is now. I had made reservations (thankfully - because the place was packed!! in February) and people waiting at the door. I LOVE the old-school 'fat bastard' element about this place. The service is top notch (if not slightly snooty) for sure and I'm a sucker for it. (Def. not Hipster vibe) Old wood beams, some stained glass.. as I said, tres old school. We had the table-side Caesar, which was good, but a little too much of the white stems. Since we were pretty full from that, we ordered steaks on the smaller side.  The steaks, I'd give a 7/10. The pickle plate and bread that comes to the table are terribly sad.  Actually, with the prices as they are here, I would really expect VERY good bread.  We received, cold, stale garlic bread.  I think that was the big downfall of our meal (since bf loves bread) and at Smith Bros and Keg have AMAZING warm bread.
Just because I love the old school service, I would come back, order a larger steak (hoping it's cooked better than the smaller ones we had).  
We all had creme brule for dessert and it was Yum :)"
3,"I really wanted to like this place because of the location, the menu looked good and our server provided great service. However, the food was not that great. My friend ordered pancakes and they were just meh, and I ordered the huevos rancheros.  The ""crisp"" tortillas were far from crisp, but everything else had great flavor. I also asked if I could get scrambled egg whites instead of the sunnyside up egg, which they gladly accommodated me, but I could not get over the stale like tortillas which kind of threw off my breakfast. 

Other tables came in after us, and received their food before we did which I thought was kind of odd, but wasn't that big of a deal because the football games were a good distraction. I may try this place again for their happy hour or dinner menu, but not completely sure."
3,"Good sushi and sashimi but SLOOOOOW service. At both their yonge and queen locations. Also our servers never seemed happy to serve us and when asked questions I'd get a grunt or mumbles in reply. Had to ask for tea at least 3 times. I'll be back tho because I'm addicted to sushi and this place is very decent. 

Try the spider roll!! And fried banana with your ice cream!"
3,"I'm so torn. First visit we loved it. Interesting food choices, from the grilled avocado, to the awesome corn, to the pork luau tacos with pickles. With pickles! Game changer. Was all set to come back. And then? Saturday happened. Had a group of 11 meeting us there for my birthday. On our way in an Uber and they call saying they're in the parking lot but no one is there. I reassured them they were new and not very busy. They clarified there was no one there, including the employees. The lights were on and so were the TVs, but the doors were locked. What? Were they coming back? Closed for the night? No one knew. The only thing we could come up with was the ASU game was happening. Had to scramble for new plans and ended up going somewhere with slow service and boring food. Was so disappointed. Really talked this place up to my friends and family. Happy birthday to me!"
3,"I went to this place for the first time not really knowing what to expect.  The menu has a different concept in ordering.  I had the teryaki bowl.  It was ok, but not something that I would get again.  My daughter had the sweet and sour chicken and it was great.  I usually get take-out and I think that the sweet and sour chicken would not be good for take-out because it would probably get soggy.  It is great to eat in."
3,I got the Carne Asada burrito. And a drink total was 9$ not that bad that's a responsible price. I got like 7 chips on the side lol.. They should of just gave me none because the chips aren't good at all and their salsas are okay nothing amazing. The burrito was actually pretty good it was very juicy every bite I had juice like spill out that's what it was making it good the guacamole inside was perfect with the meat. Place is cool like 4 tables were dirty when I walked in I cleaned it myself. Also the girl upfront doesn't have energy and just stands their and waits for you to come up to her to order. Kinda awkward. The place needs a little bit more energy. Also theirs a 25 cent refill box by the coke machine. Hahaha I don't think anyone would ever put 25 cents because one it was dirty and their was nothing in it. They seriously need to take that out just embarrassing. The bathroom was dirty too so I didn't understand how these guys get an A when food inspection comes because the place was dirty everywhere I looked. If you want just a good burrito yeah sure come grab one but it's not a place I'll be coming back to just doesn't have what I like in a place.
3,??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????10??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
3,"Yummy salt squid...so so pad thai but gorgeous in appearance. I think it lacked flavour n it tasted artificial sauce wise. Cantonese chow mean was yummy yet couldn't help but think that it too had an artificial tasting flavour in the sauce. Beef sizzling plate was nice. Over all nothing to write home about. Its nicely decorated also has a cased in duck n BBQ room .
A little music would have been nice to drown out the kids and general kitchen noise.
Customer service is one of the worse I've ever encountered. No hello no greeting just a stoned faced person w a samurai expression asking if we know what we want. At the end my husband gave the wait person a $50 n $20 dollar bill to pay the $53. Dollar bill and gave him $7 in change. 
My husband had to ask her for the other $10

Will I go back? Nah...this was a test run.

Dismal customer service"
3,First time trying honey grow! - little disappointed. PORTIONS WERE SO SMALL! Honestly I was a little horrified to see how little the bowl was filled but happy that I did feel somewhat full even though it felt like I got so little. I got the honey sesame stir fry which came out to a little over nine dollars but it was reallyyyy salty. Probably won't be coming back to be honest but glad I tried it!
3,"Probably closer to 3.5, but we don't get those yet. The dated decor is matched by a somewhat dated menu, but you know what you're coming here for. There's no question that the service level is very, very high, but the food felt a little uninspired - even for a steakhouse. I think for the price tag you'll probably have a better steak in the city. But if you insist on staying uptown, your hands are tied."
3,"honeygrow is another fast-casual restaurant where you can customize your dish--either stir fry or salad in this case. If you're looking for a salad, I'd suggest going to hello bistro instead; the ambiance might not be as great, but you have more topping options and get more salad for your money, and it tastes better too. The salads and the stir fry here are pretty good, but I just can't get over the fact that they don't put prices for their non-custom menu items. The most recent time I went, my fall harvest salad was $12 (there wasn't even meat in it), and my friends' stir frys were around $15. Seems a bit steep to me. Three stars because the touch screen is easy and nice for when you want minimal human interaction and the restaurant is very clean and modern."
3,"I had to post a review about my experience today. I go here often because I love how fresh their drinks are, however, this experience wasn't so pleasant. I found/drank two hairs in my boba drink!!! How disgusting and disappointed. This has never happened to me before at this place. There was a different girl who did make our drinks so probably that made a difference? C'mon now, please, while you make our drinks wrap your hairs up in a net not just a beanie or a cap. I am very disgusted by today's experience and will probably have to stray away from this place for awhile. I URGENTLY ask for your staff to wear some sort of hair nets while making people's drink because you will find unhappy customers, whom are your frequent shoppers. Very disappointed today. I had to rate this place a 3, unfortunately."
3,"I'm still on the hunt for a great hibachi restaurant. Ever since Ginza closed, nothing  has tasted nearly as good as their food.  Sumo was very busy last Friday night which to me is a good sign. It's very nice inside with I believe 9 hibachi tables. Service was extremely slow. We waited and waited just to get water. Our drinks arrived after being at the table for 30 minutes. The chef came out with the food cart and was having issues with the table so walked away and was gone for over 10 min with the food cart out. It was strange -- then he got it to work and started cooking. I wasn't impressed with the food. The 2 good things were the fried rice and the steak. The Chicago sushi roll was disgusting. My friend and I had to keep dunking it in all the sauces just to semi enjoy it. For $12, you'd think it would be a good roll but the ""crust"" on it was so hard and thick. Don't get that roll. We were there for over 2 hours. I wouldn't go back for dinner."
3,"Longest wait for a 2 taco combo. I know they're new but a little faster service would be tighter. The tacos in the end were pretty good, not street taco good but decent to sustain my crave for it. The place is quaint and plays some really good music overall, also the staff are pretty nice."
3,"Stumbled across this place when we were trying to figure out what to eat. We were seated right away and brought our menus. A few minutes later, someone came by and gave us the happy hour menu. The waitress came by and asked what we wanted to drink and brought us waters. She took our order and that was that. She would check on us occasionally, but I swear she never smiled. She almost seemed irritated to be working. The food was great, the restaurant itself had a very chill and relaxing atmosphere. The only reason I have to give 3 stars is because I wasn't too impressed with the waitress. I wish she would've smiled or pretended to like her job. I don't know if I'd go back or not."
3,"I had the Tuna plate along with their special Rainbow roll for $50 - it definitely wasn't worth the money.  You have better options, TAKE THEM!"
3,"We ordered takeout from here last week. It was good, but not as good as Congee Wong. All the standard dishes are there and they certainly try to stuff the containers full of food. It was just one notch away from being really lip smacking delicious. They do deliver to the immediate area so that's nice. But I'm not sure if we would order from here again."
3,"I went to this place for lunch to try the all you can eat since my favourite place in the area recently closed.  It was unfortunately underwhelming.  I've had some amazing AYCE sushi and this did not stack up.  I got a green dragon roll and the avacado was hard to the point of crunch.  my handrolls were also not that great as im pretty sure the seaweed was stale.  I didn't end up getting the last 2 handrolls that I ordered but I didn't even mention it to them because quite frankly, I didn't want them after what I had already eaten.  I also ordered a miso soup and it was just not good.  Toronto has some of the best sushi that i've had so I was upset that this was the quality that it was.  The service was fast and they were nice enough, but not the best at customer service.  One server stood beside my table because I only had 2 rolls left and she wanted to take my plate away - so she waited and watched me eat.  

I won't go back again"
3,"Went there for dinner. It's a relative decent AYCE place. I liked the sashimi. Salmon, saba and butterfish were all good and fresh. Sadly, they didn't have tuna on the menu. Seawood salad was awesome (Ordered twice). The sushi maki rolls are average. Th firehouse roll was prob the best one with fish flakes on top, but everything tastes the same (different variations of california rolls with minimum differences). Avoid anything that has tempura in it. Feels like the tempura wasn't particularly fresh and a bit soggy so the sushi roll that had tempura bits tasted below average. Their katsu was good , but other appetizer dish were rather lacking.

Tried their ice-cream desserts. Red bean and green tea were okay, but avoid the mango pudding at all cost. Even my boyfriend who is not hat picky about food couldn't finish the pudding. 

Great service overall. The order came really quickly. Granted, we were the one of the two tables that night. No problem with the bills and the server was attentive. 

Overall, good value for the food and downtown location if you go there hungry and order sashimi and a few special rolls. The ambiance is not great though, the place does feel a bit dreadful with its lighting."
3,Phone number listed for the location on Central is incorrect - it is for the uptown location - and apparently this location does not offer quinoa or roasted potatoes AND 2 sides as the website states.
3,"The food was good and prices are decent. The staff seems slightly confused, or at the very least, easily distracted. 

I was told I needed to try Jimmy Hula's since I live so close by. I was craving a burger and figured this would be the perfect time to try. I go through the drive-thru and had a bit of a hard time ordering. The guy taking my order was very nice but didn't know the menu well. I spent about 3 minutes repeating my order. I wanted the Duke with Mac n cheese. He seemed to ramble off other items on the menu, trying to figure out what I was ordering, while asking someone else in the restaurant for help. When we finally settle my initial order, I asked about the different fries options but he didn't seem to know what they were. He kept saying a proprietary blend of spices. I shrug and just go with my original order. 

I didn't have to wait too long, a couple more minutes and the burger was out. The burger came with a side of fries and a small soda. For a decent sized burger meal between $7-9, I didn't think it was a bad deal. The only problem was that when I got the burger, there was both cole slaw & mac n cheese on it. There was no pork or onion ring. Not exactly how the burger was described, but tasty all the same. 

Hoping they get the order right next time :)"
3,"I had their che (green tapioca with black jelly and coconut milk) and it's no where close to a Vietnamese che, their coconut shake was average.. The service was good, the lady was very nice and sweet.."
3,"I've been here several times, and I really like the concept of all the Che they offer but I'm also extremely disappointment by the flavor. One one hand, they serve all my favorite Vietnamese desserts. On the other hand, it tastes extremely watered down, not authentic, and for a hefty price relative to usual prices of Vietnamese desserts. One portion size is sizeable and could be shared among two people. The boba drink is pretty on par with other places, but I think their boba is above average. It's extremely sweet and soft!"
3,"Pretty good, not great. We both enjoyed our meals and would eat here again unless there was an option I knew I liked better."
3,"The food here is decent. I come here with family a lot - it's good for serving a big group, but is a bit pricey if you're with less than 4. The service is not good. It takes a long time to get attention, and my order had been messed up several times."
3,"One of the better ""average"" time shares we've exchanged into. Very helpful friendly staff. Clean, pleasant -- though definitely ""dated""--surroundings. Good shuttle service to the strip. Easy walk to shopping --including a marvelous and cheap international (food) market. And a shuttle to a full grocery store. To make it better (in addition to some modern in-suite decorating) they need wi-fi in the rooms (now only in the lobby) and a shuttle to the airport. I appreciated the free bagels and cream cheese (unusual for a time share in my experience).  (We bought lox and juice @ the nearby grocery and enjoyed a great breakfast for a fraction of the usual cost.)"
3,"I had high hopes for this new spot since it's in my neighborhood but unfortunately I wasn't very impressed. The menu is almost the same as Viva Chicken or even the other new place Roasting Co. Due to the location of Coaltrane I was hoping they would try to tap into the nightlife in Plaza Midwood. 

We walked in and were warmly welcomed by either the manager or owner. She informed us there were some specials and that their was a bar upstairs. We placed our order and the gentleman taking it didn't seem to know the menu or how to ring it in. Now I know they are new but your staff needs to be trained before interacting with guests. I told the guy 3 times that I didn't want beans on my stuffed avocado. I also had asked if there were any other type of bean, other than pinto, that could be subbed out and the manager said she is working on getting black beans. After placing our order we went upstairs to check out the bar. This bar is more like a small server station and it's outside. I am so disappointed with the set up of this place because it had so much potential. They have signs up for NYE at Coaltrane and it seems like they want nightlife but you can't count on that with a tiny little outside bar. 

Now we decided to sit inside since the temperature was in the 30's. The food was delivered to us and the waitress was very friendly. I cut into mine and there were beans, lots of beans. Now the stuffed avocado was good minus the dang beans. Then I ordered the street corn casserole, I'll warn you now it's not street corn... it's cornbread. The favor was good if you wanted cornbread but it didn't taste anything like street corn. My date got the quart dark chicken and he said it was ok but that he prefers the other two chicken spots over this one. 

I think they are trying to tap into a market that is already a bit monopolized. I am just so disappointed to not see this as a nice place to grab a cocktail. I would give them a second try but I don't think this will be a regular spot for me. Best of luck Coaltrane!"
3,"I'm going to start off by saying I might be going a bit harsh with only a 3 star review. 
I've dined at my fair share of AYCE (All You Can Eat... for the uninitiated) sushi restaurants and this location doesn't stand out for me as either above or below average. Everything was good but not great. Nothing was disappointing but nothing surprised me with it's quality. 

A friend and I showed up here on a Saturday night to an empty restaurant. It seemed like more people came here to pick up rather than sit down. The ambience of the dining space was definitely lacking with some poor lighting and a lack of decor (at least at the front of the restaurant where we sat). Our orders came out relatively quickly and as far as I could tell we got everything we ordered, no more and no less (some other sushi places often mess up the large AYCE orders). Maybe this was just because it was a slow night, but I'd like to think they just have good staff. The rolls and sushi were what you would expect from any AYCE sushi place. They were tasty but unimpressive. I was a LITTLE sad about the quality of the salmon sashimi we ordered. Again, it wasn't bad, but it just seemed a bit less fresh than other restaurants I've eaten at. The price was alright for the wide selection they offered, maybe a touch less expensive than I've seen elsewhere (~$50 for the two of us together). 

I wouldn't say it's the best AYCE sushi in Toronto, not really even that close, but it is a fine place to catch a meal with some friends if you're in the area and pining for some tasty Japanese fare!"
3,Pretty good food. Everything I have ordered has been pretty good. There's places close by though that are just as good or better but give free chips and salsa.
3,"I visited yesterday afternoon and found the interior to be beautifully decorated. I'm not sure if they were employed there, but a woman greeted me at the door. The woman behind the counter was also friendly and had good customer service. What makes me dock two stars is what I received. I ordered the Bamb? Special. Not bad, but it wasn't anything spectacular or out of this world. The second item I ordered was the black milk tea. Someone with me ordered the French vanilla iced coffee. I really liked the creamy flavor of the black milk tea, but we were disappointed that one small cup cost approximately $4.75. On top of that, there is 75% ice in the cup and 25% liquid. I might return again the next time I visit Lee Lee's and try the other chè they have to offer, but will probably never order their teas or coffee again."
3,"Come for the food. Not the service.

The congee queen and king chain are all over the place but i think this one is by far the best one.  Its very well kept, spacious and clean compared to the older ones.  Its decor Is also much newer

In terms of the food, the congee of course is the must have with good price.  I feel the waitress do not have firm grasp of sizing... for example, we asked how many bowls (The small asian bowls used in this place) are typically in the small congee. They told us probably 3-4 but in truth there were at least 6 bowls of congee. So don't worry you will not get hungry. 

They also have some pretty good side dish.  We like the steamed fish and vegetables. The stoneware rice with chashu is also pretty tasty. The vegetarian fried rice wowed our guests so much that they insisted on making one last trip before leaving the country. 

The service here is inconsistent, unfortunately. Seems to be up to their moods. Most of the time they get their job done. But once or twice we found their patience lacking when we phoned for takeouts or if visit close to closing time.  

I think this is like a place you can come day to day, but not the special occasion type of place, and for its price range, it successfully occupies the niche it aims for."
3,Diablo was good. Asked for it protein wrapped but got it with no bun. Salad for a side was ok. Nice waitress. Cool seating. Good price.
3,"Came here before work on a Monday morning for breakfast. Pulled in to the drive thru and ordered 2 of the breakfast sandwiches. The price and taste were both good, however there seemed to be only one person working the whole place which made it take a while for things to get done. I would say it took approximately 12ish minutes for the time I ordered to the time I got my food, so if you are trying to grab a quick bite before work, I am not sure if this would be the best place. Also I ordered the combo which on the menu said it came with a drink, so I asked for coffee but when I pulled up to the window it seemed like there was some confusion if coffee was included with the combo which I thought was strange because I don't know what other beverage you would get with breakfast. Overall the food was decent and reasonably priced. I would come here again if I wasn't in a rush to get somewhere else."
3,"Nice store and friendly staff but the drink was way over sweetened. I went because I used to go to the same store in San Jose, Cali but this location in Chandler doesn't have the same drinks I used to have."
3,"Good tacos and burritos, Can't beat the 1.99 tacos even if you get ""TNS"" taco neck syndrome.
One day soon I'll try that burrito that is as big as a baby's arm. Then I'll be back to review it."
3,"Stopped in for a quick Honey Bar treat. Because this was my first visit I had a few questions. The Caucasian woman behind the counter who was also preparing salads and fruit cups, sounded bothered by the three inquiries. I noticed I placed the order at the kiosk twice so I deleted the extra order. The system didn't print a receipt. As I was called up two bowls were waiting. After being questioned about the order one bowl was removed from the bag. No biggie as I didn't need or plan to pay for two. The bowl was covered with yogurt. So much so that my bag was icky. The price point alone should be an indication of the level of quality one should expect. After wipping off the bowl and cleaning my sticky hands, I was able to finally enjoy my evening snack. 
May consider coming again"
3,"A little bit over priced desert for the majority of canned food fruits... but hey I guess someone's gotta pay for the AC and sitting area... BUT this is an in and out kinda place... not really a hang out spot, so I don't see the price is just... doesn't make sense. But desert is still good"
3,"I found Bambu on Yelp when I was looking for a smoothie to tide me over until lunch. I wanted  simple strawberry and banana and mostly fruit. Unfortunately, what I got at Bambu was more like a milkshake with very little strawberries and bananas in it.  The flavor was OK, just very weak. It tasted more like vanilla ice cream than anything. Also, it was expensive for a small.  Finally, at the time, I was the only one in the store, and it still took quite some time to make my smoothie.  I felt like the quality of the yogurt or the ice cream or whatever they used was high-quality, if you're looking for something for your kid that is more like a milkshake, then this would be the place to go. However, I wanted a healthy smoothie that was mostly fruit, so I would probably not go back."
3,"Solid sushi with plenty of bang for you buck! No seriously, I dropped nine dollars (tax in) for the L4 lunch special here today and I walked out with a huge bag of food. Someone doesn't really like the environment because it is plastic and Styrofoam aplenty but I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. 10% off take out! 

The three sushi chefs at the sushi bar are young, in constant motion and know their stuff. Every roll I've had has been very fresh and very tasty. It's all pretty good and standard. Not too inventive of a menu but all your favorites will be there. Pretty quick with the take-out too. 

A while ago I had AYCE sushi here and I remember that being pretty great- a lot of stuff you wouldn't normally see on the cheaper take out menu (ex. butterfish sushi). 

Note: Today, I saw a waitress drop a spoon for someone's ice cream on the floor, run it under water for a several seconds and then put it back in the bowl. Not saying that I wouldn't do this in my house, because I would and I do, but I'm not really sure that's appropriate for a restaurant. Especially since the offending spoon was dropped in a high traffic area. 

Anywho, I'll be back for to stuff myself to the gills with these tasty, Japenese delights."
3,"The food...plain and simple...it's great. Get the potatoes, street corn casserole, and half stuffed avocado and enjoy the food coma. The sauces they have rival other places, especially the chimichuri sauce. Get extra. You'll need it. Good beer selection and cool upstairs patio area

Update to my review:

They really need to get better quality control at the restaurant, meaning tonight was the second time my order was incorrect. The first time I let it slide because they forgot to put the sauce in with my order (which caused me to have to drive back round trip 25 min.) but this time they forgot one of my sides that I ordered. They even correctly named off all the food I ordered and handed me the bag. At that point I'm not going to check my order to see if it correct. After getting home, it wasn't right. I'm going to give them one more time to get it right or it may be Roasting Company going forward."
3,"Everything was just ok. The service was better than the food/prices. The food was decent, but not for the price. I ordered the bangers and mash - the flavors were good, but very basic. My husband got the prime rib sandwich. The horseradish cream was  very overpowering and made the sandwich kind of hard to eat. Overall, this was just a ""meh"" visit. Everything was ok, but nothing wowed us."
3,"Saturday lunch AYCE for $12.99 from 11:30-3:00. 

I'm one of 6 tables up front with room for ~35 people. I hope weekends are slow and this is not representative of the quality of fish I just ordered. For 13 bucks, it's worth trying. A few more parties flowed in until almost all tables were filled on the floor by 2:00. 

Out of Butter fish :(
Snapper, salmon and Saba sushi
Spicy Yellowtail hand roll
Red Dragon roll
Californian Rainbow roll
Black Dragon roll
Dynamite roll
all decent. 

The rice is a bit undercooked an crispy at times. The fish was cold (very important to me) but paper thin but that's to be expected with all you can eat. That said, it was good. Very good when I think about what I spent. 

Service is fast but I can do without the Kiss 92.5 music and would prefer more authentic or mellow lunchtime tunes. All in all, you get what you pay for. I would never come at dinner but for lunch, it's worth it."
3,"Not a bad spot if you're looking for fast service and a diverse selection Chinese food. Just don't bank on the quality.

We came here at around 9pm, and this place was still quite lively with small groups and families. With a menu that probably consisted of 10+ pages, it was quite overwhelming for us first-timers. Eventually we settled on a plate of bbq pork, the turnip patties that everyone raved about, a beef noodle soup and the shredded pork & preserved egg congee.

At 9pm, I was starving, and Congee Queen did not disappoint with their speed. I am honestly a bit suspicious as to how they can whip together these dishes in the span of 10 minutes.

I was most impressed and surprised by the barbecue pork. It was juicy, saucy and quite tender. The turnip patties were great as well - they had a creamy texture and the spice added a kick. I was only able to have ~5 pieces however, as they were on the heavier side. The other dishes I probably would not get again, but I would be open to try some of the other items on the menu."
3,"It's a Denny's. The food will never look like the picture. The service will be underwhelming at best. The prices will always be too high for what you get. But with the 2-for-1 entree coupon (check out any area weekly magazine), it's not bad. And I kinda like their skillets. This location can have a long wait on weekends, so be prepared for that. It's never usually too bad (10-15 mins), though, for a table for 2. All in all with a coupon and a hankering for a skillet, Denny's will hit the spot."
3,"I'm an ex-Vancouverite so I'm a bit of a sushi snob. However, Aji Sai wasn't half bad! Came here for the $20 dinner AYCE on a Saturday. The restaurant wasn't packed so our food came out fast. 

Sashimi was fresh and the slices were adequately sized. Tempura was crispy and fluffy. The house rolls were great, especially the Volcano Roll and the Black Dragon -- very delicious! They also offer butterfish sashimi, which I've barely seen elsewhere. They have pretty good filling-to-rice ratio in their sushi so it wasn't just a chunk of rice like many other AYCE sushi places in Toronto. 

As extensive as the AYCE dinner menu was, there was no seafood motoyaki! Blasphemy! And no oysters either... =( 

However, this place would get four stars if it wasn't for the rude service stint at the end. We were about an hour and half into our dinner and was about to finish off with ice cream, a waitress told us that there was a group of six waiting at the door and they were running out of tables, at which time she handed us our bill. When we handed her our order form, she said that would be the last round (I've never seen limits to ordering rounds at AYCE places). We were almost done anyway, and we didn't want to keep the group of six waiting, so we finished our ice cream and left. As I was walking out the door, I saw another WHOLE EMPTY SECTION at the back of the restaurant behind the sushi bar that was elevated by maybe five steps of stairs. There was definitely more than enough space to sit a group of six, and she rushed us out for nothing. 

At least the food was solid."
3,"We get lunch here occasionally at work.  LOVE the burgers!  All the tacos seem to please everyone that orders them.  Not really impressed with the bowls.  Other than that, nothing to criticize.  It's a solid recommendation for lunch."
3,Food and experience was just ok.  Service was ok.  I really miss Perkins (from the east coast).
3,"They could've spent a little more time on the toss. This was my first pedicure in almost 6 months and they were very fast, even though I paid for the social package ($45)"
3,"Have been here twice now. I got the red curry with tofu the first time, which was very good. The second time, I got the tuna white bean salad. Was very underwhelming, and dressing was sparse so it was pretty bland. My partner got the pork bowl, which was way too oily and he said the broccoli was super undercooked. 

Maybe it was an off night. Service was quick and staff were nice. Would go back for noodles and avoid the overpriced salads."
3,"It's good for the fast-food kind place it is supposed to be. The first time I went, I bought a Groupon and ordered an iced vietnamese coffee, dan dan noodles and singapore noodles. The vietnamese coffee was kinda gross, but I should have not expected much from the kind of place it is. The dan dan noodles were so far removed from the dish the namesake is from that I had a hard time enjoying it. It tasted fine, but not anything I would ever order again.

The singapore noodles, also very different from the dish it's named after, were surprisingly quite yummy. It had a wonderful peanuty-sauce and plenty of veggies. I have gone back once more with a couple friends and I ordered the same--the singapore noodles. 

You just have to order from the menu and try to distance yourself from the dish's name otherwise if you're expecting the actual flavors from the dish's name, you'll be disappointed. 

The service is always friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately, I probably won't be back for a while because I no longer work in the area."
3,"Ehh. Dennys. What can I say about this location. Well the food is Okay, the service was decent and the cleanliness was not up to par. There was dirty forks under our booth and the floor was filthy. I had gotten the half serving of nachos. It had more pico then meat and cheese. The sour cream was just slapped on there. When we asked for our drinks I got a Diet Coke with cherry. The cherry syrup was at the bottom of our drink. Wasn't mixed in. All I tasted was syrup. The waitress was friendly but seemed like she was on autopilot and just doing her job. Still left a 20 percent tip though. I rarely eat at chain restaurants. But Dennys I wasn't feeling it. Wasn't satisfied at all. Just seems like a last resort place you would go to."
3,"Staff is friendly, and seem to be on top of things. The fried wontons were good - a little over cooked. The teriyaki rice bowl lacked flavor. The sauce was extremely watery, and the rice was overwatered as well. The meat didn't have any flavor other than the watered down teriyaki sauce."
3,"I've been wanting to try Sumo ever since we drove by it. We decided to give it a try Tuesday night. Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by the sight of two giant sumo wrestler statues. The space is large with plenty of parking. We opted for the regular dinner versus the hibachi grill. Our hostess seated us and gave us menus.

We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Tuesday nights they have a special sushi and martini menu. The rolls, nigiri, and martinis were very reasonably priced. Our waitress came by with water and to take our drink order. The menu is pretty extensive so I needed more time before ordering when she returned. 

When she eventually came back we ordered the Ladies Fingers (steamed okra), Grilled Squid, Mackerel and Scallop Nigiri, Sumo, Shrimp Tempura and Eel Rolls. The Ladies Fingers was a platter w/two rows of okra covered w/a tasty soy sauce. I really liked this dish -- pretty, the sauce was delicious, and I would order it again. The grilled squid was kind of hit and miss. It was a good sized squid, I would say about 9 inches, beautiful to look at, with a mildly spicy mayo. The tentacles and the end of the squid were very rubbery, hard to chew and impossible to cut with your fork. The middle was cooked perfectly - tender and flavorful. I preferred dipping the squid in the soy sauce on the okra versus the mayo which actually came with the squid. I kept my water-glass near the end of the table hoping it would be refilled and occasionally it was.

The sushi was pretty decent. The mackerel slices were on the small size but the scallops were larger. Both were fine. The Sumo and Shrimp Tempura rolls both had eight pieces. Their flavor was excellent. The eel roll was six pieces and I enjoyed it but not as much.

I really like that Sumo had some dishes I have not seen elsewhere such as the okra and the grilled squid. I also really liked the Tuesday night prices. The service while friendly was definitely a little lackluster. I would go back to try the Hibachi on a special occasion and I can imagine going back on a Tuesday for the specials but it won't become a regular for us."
3,"Quality and cleanliness have fallen off over the past year. On my last visit for a gel manicure, the base coat was missed and the polish popped off in a few days. I'm shopping around for a new salon."
3,Borderline candidate for the regular lunch rotation.  The price point a tad high and the sauce a little too heavy.
3,"Nicely decorated and big, but for some reason, every dish is about $3 more expensive than all the other congee restaurants, including Congee Time (5 min drive)."
3,I've actually had Bambu in San Jose and LOVED it. I saw one here in Chandler and decided to give it another go. There wasn't really any people there and the girl up front didnt seem like she knew what she was talking about when I asked her some questions. I ordered the sour sop smoothie and it tasted flavorless. I guess you can't order anything unless it's CHE.
3,"Just north of Bloor St on Yonge is Aji Sai. After seeing some of the yelp reviews it was necessary to pay a visit.  
The place is quite spacious though it may appear small. Our server was helpful and was able to provide me some feedback on what to order on their AYCE menu.
The every dish that came out was beautifully presented. Among notables I admired their green Dragon, salmon avocado hand roll, and cowboy roll.
Their prices listed; lunch is $13.99 and dinner is $19.99 is quite reasonable for the area. 
I've been to a few places around downtown, this place is good and they've got a good selection.
Seating can be quite squished as some of the tables are so close to one another.
Quite a surprise though it's just north of  buddy Bloor and Yonge, it was somehow quiet lol...which is a plus! 
Parking is nearby for those driving and for those taking public transportation, the subway is a skip away.
Good place, I shall revisit if I'm in the area craving sushi."
3,"I have really fond memories of this place when it was Todd English P.U.B., and this was my first visit back since the change. The beer selection was fine, the bartender was friendly, and the food was... uninspiring. I get that it's not fine dining, but this was on the low end of what I'd consider pub fare.

However, I'm giving it an extra star because it provided me with some of the best entertainment of my trip. A guy a few seats down from me at the bar ordered a pastrami sandwich. He was really unhappy with the quality of the pastrami, and proceeded to have the absolute weirdest reaction I've ever seen. He proclaimed LOUDLY that he didn't want a discount and didn't want to make a big deal of it but that it was the WORST quality pastrami he ever experienced. He really didn't want a discount, a refund, or a replacement - apparently he just wanted to lecture every single staff member about the evils of low-quality pastrami and the perils of buying your meat from the lowest-cost bidder. For a good 45 minutes. Maybe he was a meat salesman? The extra star is for the staff, who were unfailingly polite to this weirdo.


Edit to add that the lady who sat down after meat critic left also ordered the pastrami and seemed to enjoy it."
3,"Here for birthday celebration.

Meat is cooked perfectly. worth the price. Good wine selection.

Service can be better though. Sat for 20 mins before someone's there to take our orders and bring us the wine list."
3,"Check out the pics, place was all hype but when I finally got a taste, I was pretty disappointed..nothing to brag about other than the service and cheap drinks"
3,"This certainly wasn't the worst experience, but wanted to share with Yelp users as there are many more nail salons in the area that do a better job.

The staff wasn't extremely friendly or welcoming. The only time anyone talked to me was to ask what I was there for and command me to ""pick a color."" The girls talked to each other the whole time, rather loudly, but not the customers.

The girl did a good job with cleaning my feet up, slightly rough but ultimately a good job. It was a long massage which is ideal to me but didn't use pressure at all so that was a let down.

A young girl sat and waited to get her nails done the entire time I was getting a pedi and there were two other women there. There were only three of us customers in the salon. I felt bad and she patiently waited for the woman with the other customer to finish while the other two ladies sat around, laughed, ate, etc

Again, not an awful experience, but with all of the salons in the valley, I won't return to this one. The overall experience was mediocre at best.

Take care."
3,"We went here on valentines day. The service is superb! From the complimentary valet service to the table you will be  constantly taken care off. The menu  was a limited version of their regular menu. The fillet mignon was good, the cesaer salad was average. The prime rib was served cold and it was not very tender. The sides were very limited and basic with no effort on the presentation.  The tiramisu had  a refrigerator taste. 
Generally , considering the price the food does not impress."
3,"I've eaten at several locations of Congee Queen but this was my first visit to this one. While I can say that the food has been fairly consistent and good, the big difference has been the service.

We kept it simple, with a congee and a chow mein. We enjoyed the meal, despite discovering egg shell in the congee. The service could have been better. We had to call our server a couple of times to get plates and the check at the end.

I'll probably think twice before coming back to this location."

Aesthetics: 9.5/10

After reading the reviews and considering the type of restaurant style. I expected the service here to be exceptional. However, the restaurant was not full and yet the service was quite disappointing. 

The food was not exceptionally unique and often times over salted. There was nothing that stood out or made a good lasting impression. The beef was at least tender, but for the price, I could've gotten Wagyu steaks. The ribs appetizer we had was decent, and it was the best thing they served. The desserts were decent, but once again nothing amazing. 

They do have a decent selection of wine. The prices for the wines are also reasonable and not heavily marked up. It'd be nicer if they had a decanter though, some of their wines could definitely benefit from one. 

The service was lacking to me, the dining room had several waiters, but service was slow and pretty impolite. 

I enjoyed the dining room, the Victorian/Gothic decor was interesting and the stained glass definitely caught your attention. The building itself is unique as well. 

This restaurant is definitely a unique experience, but as a steakhouse it is utterly disappointing. I was hoping for something better, but even the keg has better steaks, and it'd be half as expensive. I don't think I would recommend eating at this place, and I doubt that I will be back here any time soon."
3,"I really like the food, however I ordered the Sumo Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp, and got chicken instead. I did not complain, I was very hungry, and just wanted to eat. It wasn't a deal breaker. I'll go back again."
3,"Food is actually surprisingly good. The burgers are greasy and messy but the flavor makes up for it. The French fries definitely need work, they're super soggy."
3,"This is an old-school fine dining establishment.  The decor is all dark, carved mahogany wood and back-lit stained glass windows.  Servers are dressed in dark suits.  The austere atmosphere and serious wait-staff can make guests feel uncomfortable.  If you skip dessert or don't order alcohol be prepared to feel judged. 

The steaks are tender.  The Caesar salad prepared table-side is expensive at $18.  But, at least it is meant for two.  Prices are high, as expected for this type of upscale restaurant. 

I would only recommend The Octagon for a special occasion and older clientele."
3,"Great food. Slow service. Dropped in for two tacos and have been waiting for over 30 minutes since i gave my order. New place, so i hope they streamline their systems to be more efficient on getting people in and out or load up those that want to hang out."
3,"The good:
* Fried Chili Turnip Patties (diced turnip patties stir fried with shrimp, chicken, pickle and egg) - fan favourite. 
* Beef Tendon/Beef Brisket Noodle in Soup - Big chunks of beef with delicious ""mein"" noodles in a flavourful broth.
* Fried Squid - Big chunks of squid, battered lightly with salt and pepper. 
* Fried rice - big shrimps!

The meh:
* Their congee is super thick and flavourless. I like mine thin and well, flavourful. 
* Beef and gai lan. Pretty meh.
* Lychee Bubble Tea - very watered down and the bubbles were mushy. 

The décor is modern and spacious. Plenty of seating and great for big groups."
3,"I still love this place, however I just got a chimichanga and it didn't have any sour cream or guacamole which just makes this a deep fried burrito."
3,"This place was great when it first opened but now it seems to be hit or miss. Last few times I've called in a simple order they have gotten it wrong. Wrong rice, no sauce for Sweet N Sour Chicken, charged us for a large adult order for my daughters kids portion. When i say something I get an excuse with attitude. Too bad, the food is good when they get it right"
3,"Mixed feelings about this place at this point. 

I came during their opening week and waited around 30 minutes for a Taro Boba....it was the best (non-alcoholic) drink I've ever had in Arizona so it was totally worth the wait and would garner 5 stars if that was a repeatable experience here. 

I deliberately drove 30 minutes out of the way just to come here again the next week and had a less than stellar experience. I've been back maybe 3 more times since and it hasn't been the same. The bathroom is under maintenance a lot, and the drinks can range from excessively overwhelmed with ingredients to weirdly disgusting. The last drink I ordered was sour...which I felt like was done on purpose but I had no idea why?

I'm still a big fan of their fresh ingredients, but it's just too hit-or-miss at this point. I feel like there should be recipes for making their drinks but I'm not getting that consistency..."
3,"I'm vegetarian and I went there with my friend, I like Wakame salad so much Tufu steak also good but mango salad is very awful for me . Miso soup also good too and their service is good , I like all of them just one girl who has a moody face and angry with us. My friend ordered kimchi beef fried after she ate 1 bite , she returned it back . She said it's not delicious. I didn't eat much because I was full easily. I went there Saturday afternoon the price is 16.97$"
3,"I've been here a couple of times this year and it's OK.  Nothing spectacular about the decor or the menu but it is priced on the lower end of the AYCE Japanese restaurants in the city.  It's not very big and twice we came with a group of 10 so we sat in the far back up the stairs.  It is one of the better AYCE places in the Yonge-Bloor area.  It appears to be a chain of Aji Sai in the city and I haven't been to the others before.

Chinese operation here (like most of the Japanese restaurants in the city).  The quality of food was average compared to others I've reviewed on Yelp.  Sashimi is not as good as the other places.  The service was average and the server told us we could only order ice cream once (as much as we wanted) because too much scooping it was difficult on her arms.  One of the personal trainers in our group (yes, we're gym rats) offered her his services :P I've given this a 3 star rating."
3,"I needed balayage and a cut (a pretty significant one, at that) - a coworker had been here and liked it so I booked an appointment. I go in for my appointment only to be informed that the woman I booked with no longer works there. They claimed to have called everyone who had an appointment with her to inform them, but I never received a call (I even checked my missed calls to make sure). So they book me with someone else.
10 days later I go back in. I tell the stylist what I want and after asking some questions, she gets to work. I didnt have her blow it out at the end because I had already been there for over three hours, so I didn't see what it looked like immediately. 
First of all, a price tag of over $200 for cut and color is insane. I know coloring is expensive, but balayage is no longer some new thing that you can mark up so absurdly. So that itself was not thrilling. But it happens - it's definitely on me for not verifying the price first. 
Second, the tone of my hair was completely off. It was barely lighter than my natural color and was weirdly orangeish. In all 5 years of highlighting my hair, no one has ever messed up the color. It's a pretty simple request, particularly since I always have some blonde remaining so it's easy to see what color I need. Naturally, after such a to-do just getting the appointment, I was annoyed and upset. The stylist brought me back in 10 days later and fixed it and it's better, but still not quite what I wanted. 
After all the hoopla with the appointments and the unsatisfactory execution, combined with the steep price tag, I will not be returning to Shine."
3,Clean location but a bit aged.  Easy location to get to other places without have to stay right on the strip.  Because of the way the units are structured they are very quiet.  View of the pools from the room was probably better than the views for other rooms on the outside which are views of parking lot and other buildings. Clean rooms and clean kitchen.  Not very large kitchen but it worked for our party of 4.  The furnishing were stained and aged but the rest was very clean and the linens are really good here.  Our original booking was at the Tahiti Village which is the flag ship resort to this Tahiti Vacation Rental location on W Tropicana so we were a little disappointed to find out our location was this TVR when we were expecting the Tahiti Village which is a lot newer but overall the stay was great and everything worked well and was clean.
3,"This new Japenese / Sushi / Hibachi style restaurant left us very unstaisfied for the high prices.  The food was all around just ok!  We have eaten amazing sushi all over the U.S. and this was a bit lack luster as there is many very good sushi places in Madison.  It was plated beautiful, rolled nice, cut well, but lacked taste and creativity.  We orderd a filet mignon hibachi dinner that came with veggies and rice for $30 after upgrades.  It was like 10 pieces of small cut up steak, $1.00 worth of fried rice and basically a pile of frozen veggies!  So my $30.00 meal looked like a $4.00 plate I could have done at my house my better.  I orderd the blue crab sushi which was pretty good (the only thing I liked all night).  The other one we tried, was not one we would order again.  It was some sweet chili, pinneapple cream cheese, crab????  Maybe poor choice on our part.   Regardless!  My daughter's honey chicken and fried rice was just ok as well.
The inside of this place is designed very nice.  Looks clean and very classy on the inside.  Very clean and well kept bathrooms.  Nice hibachi style grills in main seating area.  Also lots of booths, bar seating, as well as private dining for larger groups or private parties!   Hard to find driveway to pull in.  We will give this place some time to get thier feet under them and try them again!"
3,"Just remember this is right by airport. First morning, couldn't get used to plane noise and couldn't get back to sleep-My fault!
Other than the unavoidable of being by airport, everything else was great. Breakfast was pretty good, had a shuttle to Mandalay Bay and to the airport. 
Suite was really a suite, had a couch, nice bathroom area, and a pizza place that delievered to our room on last day. Not bad for $50 on hotels .com  on a labor day weekend."
3,"This joint is always busy. I came here twice and both times, I've waited around 30-40 minutes to be seated. I came on a Sunday evening around 5:30pm last time and there was a huge crowd waiting to be seated. Luckily the food does come quite quickly. I would recommend everyone to look at the menu while you're waiting to be seated so you can order as soon as you sit down which means you can spend less time waiting and more time eating."
3,"Wow its been forever since I've last been to a Dennys. Our last visit ended at Wildfire Casino, and the manager was being really rude and in the end we got kicked out! :x ... We decided to go to this Denny's because 1) it was late and not many other places served breakfast food 2)tired of going to our usual places to eat. Anyways this place's rating is solely based on the food. We ordered from the $2, $4, $6, $8 menu: $2 Biscuits w/ gravy and hash browns, $4 all you can eat pancakes, $4 Fried cheese melt w/fries, and $7.99 Philly Swiss steak omelette. A lot of food for two people huh? LOL well I wanted to try a variety of things and we were starrrvvvingggg. I gotta say, the food would've been more enjoyable it the ac wasnt literally at 65 degrees and blowing right down at us. Our hash brown and food turn cold within minutes. So we found ourselves eating cold gravy, cold eggs, pancakes were okay, fries were cold, etc. Hmmm aside from the cold temp, I think the food would've still be mediocre. Our server was awesome though. It was a slow night for her so she was very attentive and had a cool conservation about public transport transits! If you are a fan of diner food this is the place to go and the food is fairly price. Only thing, MAKE SURE YOU SIT IN A NON VENTILATED AREA so at least your not covered in goosebumps and chills LOL."
3,"** bad network connections **
Stayed here as part of a timeshare exchange with Interval, the rooms are nice , there are a few minor issues with the shower and ac but nothing insurmountable. The primary issue I found was the total lack of AT&T coverage, the crappy wireless in the lobby that can't sustain a Skype connection, the in room wireless is overpriced and also horribly  slow. Lovely place to stay but not if you want to keep in touch with anyone in the outside world."
3,"Come here for the steaks.  Don't order anything else.  It's more like 3.5 stars ( 4.5 stars for the steaks, 2 stars for everything else)

We ordered the escargots and bacon wrapped scallops for appertizers. Escargots were average.   Bacon wrapped scallops was very underwhelming for the price (around $22-$24) .

We ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye and the octagon cut prime rib.  Both were excellent melt in your mouth.    

The 2 sides(fries and mash potatoes) that come with the steaks were a big disappointment.  Probably the worst fries and mash I have had in a long time.

We ordered a coconut cream pie to share.  Don't order please.  

Overall, just order steaks here and you won't be disappointed."
3,"Meh is right. We arrived late night for an early flight in the a.m. The staff just wasn't very welcoming. Stayed in much better Hampton Inn's and as a Hilton Honors member I was not treated as such. Disappointment but you can't win at them all. Not accommodating on getting us a cab at 5:30 a.m. The staff said it would easily take 45 min to get a cab.  Even their shuttle service that runs 24 hrs a day...only runs on the hour ... That doesn't make sense.  The airport is literally 5 min away.  For what it is and the price it's fine. Also, my room heater was on set to 78?!?!

Ok. Regarding accommodations this location has got it. Brand new and large rooms. As all Hampton Inn's comfortable beds and a great living space. If not for this would have easily been a two star.

I'm all about hospitality and to me, at least at a late night check in, this place didn't have it. But what do you expect?"
3,"So I haven't eaten at a Denny's since high school when it was the hang out spot back then. So why come here now? I had a really strong craving for mozzarella sticks and onion rings specifically from here. I don't know why, but don't judge. 

My BF and I came here around 7 pm and it was pretty dead. We noticed that all the other patrons were senior citizens, which we didn't mind because it made for a quiet dinner. The restaurant was clean in general but had a few dirty tables that were eventually bussed. The manager on duty was the one who sat us, took our order and delivered our food. I think her name was Karen, who was very nice and friendly. 

As for the food, it's Denny's. Everyone knows the Denny's menu. From breakfast to dinner to dessert, they have it all. The mozzarella sticks and onion rings were hot and fresh out of the fryer. Yummy! I also ordered breakfast which was pretty basic. My BF ordered a cheeseburger, which was surprisingly tasty for a chain restaurant. The only thing that we weren't too fond of was that our side salads were sad. The lettuce looked old and the tomato they put on my salad was questionable. 

This visit fulfilled my craving, but as for dining here regularly? I doubt it."
3,"My friend and I ate here ahead of Aria's 7:00 poker tournament (finished 68 out of 160 entrees, out of the money).  I had the burger and my friend had the prime rib sandwich.  Neither was bad but neither exactly set the world on fire either.  This is roughly average and there are better sandwich and burgers in Las Vegas."
3,"I've been twice now and first was good with stir fry where they even let me try the sauce before I ordered. The most recent experience not as great... I ordered a to go salad,  yes it was dinner time but it took almost 20 minutes for it to be ready and then I got home and realized half the toppings (nuts, cheese, etc) were not on it... that was a $12 salad with only arugula, chicken and yams.... Im sure they are working out some kinks, overall concept is cool.
Pros: healthy farm to table ingredients 
Cons: pricey for what you end up getting compared to others in the area"
3,"I had seen this place for a while and wanted to try it out, so tonight I did. Although it wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly good either.

The biggest complaint I have is that the food was WAY too salty. To the point that I could barely taste the other ingredients. I had the Santa Barbara burger with fries, but it was hard to discern the avocado or sauce over the salt. Also, the fries were pretty limp and not that hot. 

This place could be good if they can iron out these issues. You can't have a good burger place if your fries aren't crisp. You just can't. Cut back on the salt too, and maybe I'll be back. Until then, sorry, but I'll stick with In N Out."
3,"It's a lovely old school type steakhouse with dark wood paneling and stained glass. Service is good, we did feel a bit rushed- we ordered appetizers and entrees and we had all our food by the 45 minute mark. We had the crab cakes which were good and the clam chowder which was quite thick and had that almost gelatinous quality when it cooled down a little- not a fan. You're not allowed to share entrees- my sister and I were going to split the lamb chops but ended up ordering from the lighter menu instead. I had the salmon and she had the chicken Parmesan which were okay, we don't eat beef. Our mother had the steak- we went there for her birthday and she loves steak, and she said it was delicious. Overall underwhelming experience for quite an expensive meal."
3,"We looked at the property prior to it being completed and ready for rent, when we arrived to move in the property was a diaster, we had to completely clean the property to live there (food running down the walls, carpet with black stains, etc ...).  We documented everything well with pictures and on their move in sheet. On Q responded well to maintenance items while we were living in the property. At move out they witheld a portion of our security deposit for items that were pre existing and documented or did not exist. On Q charged us $185 to clean a 16"" x 16"" dirt stain on the deck and charged us for oil stains in the garage that were not seen at our joint walk through at move out, they had no pictures or proof that these stains existed and they were not on the invoice from the maintenance company.  I would also add that the maintenance company they use is their own company which would appear to be a conflict of interest and would not allow for objectivity.  Hopefully this can be resolved without further action.  Beware and document well with On Q, be prepared to fight for a fair settlement with your security deposit.

Since writing this review the owner Taylor Tenney contacted me and has refunded the money due plus a little extra.  I appreciate him doing this and he has restored some of my faith in this company, because of this I have given the company 3 stars up from the original 1 star."
3,I think the overall review score here is really spot on. It's good but nothing is great. A nice fast casual concept butt nothing special. I usually get the Pad Thai  and it does the job. I think this is a great place to grab and go in a hurry but not much else.
3,"It is Denny's so you know what you are getting. Food is mediocre and well.......Denny's diner.  That being said, the place is clean, the servers are ok and our food was hot.   Sometimes, don't you just want a skillet breakfast smothered in gravy for dinner?   You know you do!   When that mood strikes, this Denny's can fit the bill."
3,"Underwhelming at best. The steak was good (once they got the order right), and the service was pleasant. However, for overall value I found it over-priced. There are other options around at or below the price-point and better. Granted, it's been around for some time, but that doesn't necessarily indicate it's great. The ambience was more of a loud chattery restaurant versus your traditional subdued steakhouse. 
Will I go again? No. But I'm sure others will for their own reasons."
3,"Came for dinner on a Saturday night. First time here. Daughter and I visiting hubby who's here for work. If you've never been to a place like this, you can choose the regular dining area or the hibachi area where they cook in front of you. You will sit with other strangers if your party is smaller. 

Service: Greeted by host who was friendly. I couldn't understand her at first though. We waited around 30 min. Waiter, whose name I forgot was friendly as well. He kept making jokes with our table. It did take quite awhile after finishing our soup and salad before our hibachi chef came out. But he was also friendly! No complaints whatsoever with the staff. Though when we did leave, the ladies at the front watched us walk out and didn't say goodbye or thank you. 

Food: Ok, I am part Filipino so I don't mind all the flavors used. I've been to Benihana and Shogun in California many times so I was expecting similar flavors. I ordered a rib eye dinner. It comes with onion soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, 2 shrimp and your main entree. We also ordered gyoza. Whatever dressing they used for the salad was delicious! Gyoza was good. I did not like the flavor of the fried rice. But everything else I ate tasted like soy sauce. I like soy sauce, but way over flavored with soy sauce. I ordered my steak medium well and it came out more on the well side. Which was fine. The dipping sauces were delicious. Basically tasted like the salad dressing. It helped to mellow out the soy sauce flavors. 

Ambiance: Very cute place inside!!

I liked the place. My daughter has never been to a restaurant like this and she loved it. Though I do like the places in California better, this wasn't bad for Madison. It also wasn't ventilated enough inside but it wasn't unbearable. I wouldn't mind coming again and trying something new."
3,"We wanted a somewhat healthy option for lunch so decided to give Coaltrane's a try. We were greeted by the friendly face at the register in the rear of the restaurant. The place has a cozy feel downstairs but also has an upstairs area with a full bar. The food options are similar to Viva Chicken and Roco. I had the quarter white chicken option. The chicken was just ok. But with the sauce it was good. I asked for mash potatoes but was told they had none. So I got Street corn casserole and stuffed avocado..which was pretty good. The wife had wings. She had to get them to go because was told after 10 minutes of waiting for our food that it'd take 20 minutes for wings. We may try Coaltrane's again one day. Maybe. With so many other good options in the area now, they need to step it up if they wanna survive."
3,"I do not love this place as much as others, it is your standard issue mall hibachi grill located outside a mall in a family friendly environment. You can find similar quality at lower prices, or higher quality at similar prices, but if you're looking to keep a group of kids entertained, it's probably worth it. Most parents in my circle and their kids enjoy it. The biggest thing that turned me off is the ventilation. Hopefully they get this corrected fast, you walk out smelling like a hibachi grill. Me, I would much rather go to Takumi A few blocks down the road."
3,Really good service. Clean and trendy environment. Awesome location and there's actually parking right next to it which is rare for this area. I really wanted to like this restaurant but the food was somewhat boring. The chicken wasn't dry or anything but it wasn't enough to be my favorite meal. I'll give it another try
3,I normally Don't write these kind of reviews but our server we had here was great. I wish I could remember his name. His was so good to me and my family. We came in on a Friday night. I came here specifically for the pumpkin pecan pie pancakes and let me tell your they were delectable. By far the best pancakes I had in a while because of the glaze on top. They. Could have been fluffier but this is dennys people. I'm not expecting five star pancakes but they were pretty good. My grandma is old school and likes breakfast at all meal times especially when you can pick 4 items for under $5. So on this rainy  Friday evening this was perfect. Service was great. Our server was very attentive. If they had these pancakes all year round I'd probably order more but they're seasonal. Until neat year dennys.
3,"It's decent, but not great.  Both the food and salsa are a little bit on the light side, so I suppose they are perfect for those who like Mexican-like food but not the full flavors of real Mexican food.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are quite large.

They have a salsa bar with four salsas available.  All were good, but again, all were a little bit too light and none had any heat to them.

I went here when my car was being serviced nearby, and I'd do it again if I found myself here again.  I wouldn't choose it on purpose."
3,"Nice atmosphere similar to Springrolls, comfy chairs and good food for good prices but the service was bad. It was hard to get a server's attention because she doesn't look at you even when you stare at her to get her to take your order. 

Neither of us knew what to order from their menu. There are so many kinds of congee, soup, chow mein and rice dishes as well as drinks and desserts. I wanted to try Fried Chili Turnip Patties and she got Corn and Bean Curd Congee and Fried Thick Noodles with Shrimp & Shredded Pork in Shanghai Style.

Fried Chili Turnip Patties was pretty good. It tasted like roasted chopped potatoes. I think I could have it for breakfast. The congee was okay. I wouldn't choose congees with bean curds in them though, because bean curds are soft; I want some crispiness or some flavour in my congee. Fried Thick Noodles was really bad. After taking one bite, we didn't want to eat it. I felt so bad wasting that huge dish but we didn't even have it packed to go. It was that bad. I'm sure people enjoy that dish but it just wasn't for us. There were very little pieces of shrimps and shredded pork; it was mostly the noodles and even the noodles were cut short and broke easily.

I would try a different congee if I come here again."
3,"This place is wavering between a 2 and a 3 Star.  The food was good, but the experience left me wanting more.  It wasn't a show, like I expected, but more so a guy cooking my food in front of me.  There was no egg in the hat trick, no flaming onion tower, and no fancy knife skills.  The other very disappointing part of the meal was the sauces - normally where you would get soy and something spicy, Sumo serves thousand island dressing and ginger sauce.  I don't understand...they didn't pair with the food at all.  Another pet peeve of mine is that the food was cooked in an odd order - rice, then meat, then veggies.  Then it was over, and a strange sense of boredom and dissatisfaction ensued.

That being said, the food was decent.  I had filet, my husband had scallops, and both were tasty.  They put their weird ginger sauce in the fried rice, and it was pretty good in that, even though it didn't marry well with anything else.

The other tables had fun, and their chefs were acting like expected by flipping dishes and food every which way, so it's likely we just got someone who wasn't having a good day - who knows, but judging by the other reviews, I would just go downtown and get some better food with some better service for a better price."
3,I went here the first time to discover it closed for repairs.  I visited it later and it wasn't too busy.  Service is good.  Thought it was fast food but it's sit-down.  Wasn't a fan of the fries but the burger was ok.
3,"Of course the only Bambu in Arizona would be located near the only Lee's Sandwiches across the street! As another Yelper had mentioned, I too, was stoked about seeing Bambu being brought down to Arizona and was overjoyed since I miss Vietnamese desserts like Che from Bambu back home in San Jose!

One would think such a shop would be a hit in Chandler and added with hot weather would be perfection, but the shop was pretty empty. I ordered my go-to the Bambu Special which consists of pandan jelly, chia seeds, coconut juice, coconut and longan topped with shaved ice. The jelly was chewy, had good flavor but was mostly stuck together and the coconut flesh was a bit hard (mature coconut?) other than that it was okay. Pricing was a bit steeper than usual, about a dollar more than I'm used to. The portion was kind of lacking and wow factor was not there. They may be working out the kinks still, but it's good to see something familiar as it's hard to find places such as Bambu out here.

Also, I think it would be better if they used an unscented table cleaner instead of the Chlorox-smelling kind they used. While having my Che, some tables near me were being cleaned off and the smell was overpowering and was unpleasant while eating.

The pros are that this is one of the only places I know that serves Vietnamese desserts along with smoothies and the like. They accept credit card and have a loyalty/frequent card system. Fast service and clean atmosphere."
3,"I have always wanted to try this steakhouse and finally has the opportunity to do so. So first thing is that his place is very old school, reminds us of the Old Scott House.  Waiters are dressed up formally and very friendly.  We had a very nice waiter but he was quiet busy so we had to wait longer than we expected to get our orders taken.  I opted to go with the Fish Almondine (I know who goes to a steakhouse and orders fish right?!). I wasn't feeling like beef so wanted to try something new.  It was quite plain, fish with almonds spread over it.  My dinner companions had prime rib and they made a good choice as it was a big portion, juicy and tasty.  The garlic bread is addictive and the table side Ceasar was very good but croutons underwhelming.  We ordered desserts and they were very frozen and probably something that is not made in house.  I'm happy I experienced it however will probably not be back.  If you go, order Caesar salad and steak."
3,"I went for the hibachi dinner for my birthday & had a chicken/rice/vegetable dinner. It was nice to watch the chefs cook in front of me & the atmosphere was nice. I wish the prices weren't so high though. Also, we could've had better seating at the hibachi station but the host chose to sit us (a party of 2) further from the chef. On the bright side, they sang happy birthday to me & got a free scoop of ice cream lol."
3,"I've been here a few times.

I'm a fan of all types of Asian foods.  Wok Box offers a smattering of Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Indian inspired dishes.  

We've tried a variety of them and all are pretty good. 
None are particularly authentic but they are what they are.  

There's a guy who must be an owner that sometimes brings out the food, and helps here and there.  

Dude, you always seem really cranky.   I assume you are an owner because any employee that always seems so dour, wouldn't be allowed to interact with customers.

But while the food is pretty good, the bottom line is the bottom line.  
There are 4 of us.  For about $50, we could eat at a ""real"" restaurant so Wok Box doesn't often make the cut for being a regular stop."
3,"My first impression of this restaurant was that it served healthy choices in a hipster style - which is exactly what I experienced haha. Somewhere where fitness junkies would stop by after their workouts. And the hipster part was that you order through a touchscreen monitor. You can choose from salads or stir frys. Once you choose your selections, you'll pay, get your receipt, wait for the food to be made in the kitchen and pick it up when your order number is called. Just the interior in itself was clean and minimal. I would say the space isn't that big but there is seating available. I saw a lot of people getting take-out though. 

I ordered the White Bean Tuna Salad and my friend ordered the Red Coconut Curry Stir Fry. Compared to the pictures, I thought the salad didn't look or taste as appetizing haha. Just felt like something I could have made at home and the ingredients didn't seem too fresh... maybe it's because we went towards the later time of dinner?? As for the stir fry, you can definitely taste the coconut, which I'm not a big fan of so it was just okay for me. I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong thing...? But the food and experience here was just average. Nothing really ""wow-ed"" me from the hype that it had. I think you'd get bigger portion and quality from Hello Bistro in Oakland. 

One thing that was pretty neat was that there was a word search on the back of the napkins, so that was fun to do after finishing our meal :)

Considering coming back to try the more popular dishes and the honeybar."
3,"Place was OK. I rely on yelp almost exclusively as I travel often for work and love finding new, great restaurant's while on the road. I will say that this was one of the very few times my fellow yelper's seem to 'over sell' a little bit. It wasn't bad but the decor is very drab, old school, and stuffy. Some people perhaps enjoy that but if you are looking for a high end steak/meal with a fun and lively atmosphere, this is def NOT the place. They don't even have a bar you can sit at to eat/drink if you are dining by yourself. My food wasn't bad but it certainly doesn't fall anywhere near my top steakhouse list...a list i have to say I take very seriously. It seems there are much better steakhouses in the Toronto area."
3,"I used to occasionally get food from the Don Mills/Steeles location but now this location has opened up literally across the street from me. They have also recently started delivery.

The items I have tried so far taste exactly the same as the other location, so no complaints there. The prices are cheap considering that each item can usually feed over 3-4 people. Wish they had a bit more vegetarian options however, or a separate section since their menu is quite large.

So far I have eaten in once, and ordered delivery twice. My only complaint for eating in is that they have huge air vents that were blowing out cold air over almost every table so it could not be avoided either."
3,I went to Beverly nails recently and was treated horribly rude by a nail tech named Vicky. I had a scheduled manicure appt that lasted 30 minutes (was extremely rushed) the soaking dish containing water was cold she was put out by having to answer any of my nail questions she berated me when one of my polished nails touched the towel and had to be touched up and when I initially called to make the appt and asked if there was any extra charge for having my current gel polish removed(I just wanted a regular manicure at this appt) they said no as long as we do a manicure for you at this appt they did charge me $5.00 for removing the gel polish so a $12 manicure cost me $17 . my mom also had an appt same day later time and was treated much the same and her acrylic nails looked horrible! Never will I go back and I will be sure to always let others know of the customer service and quality (lack there of) of work they do.
3,"Decent place, wasn't thrilled with the manicure. It was very busy that day, but it felt very rushed and little attention to detail that left my nails uneven and cuticles a mess. Not sure if I will be back."
3,"Too expensive for the portions and restaurant in general; crappy plastic bowls and plastic forks. stir-fry was mediocre and i made my own! the juice was great, though. I had the better go red juice (i think that's the name) and it was so refreshing. again, a little overpriced but the juice seemed worth it."
3,"I've been excited to give honeygrow a try! I selected the red curry tofu noodle bowl - it was slightly disappointing as it wasn't packed with as much flavor as I imagined it to be and the portion wasn't as large as I feel it should be for $10. That being said, I loved the location and the ordering kiosks. The interior is cool and minimal and I enjoyed being there. I love the idea of a quick, healthy (vegetarian) option so I will definitely give honeygrow another try - maybe next time with a salad and a treat from the honey bar."
3,"Heard of this new place on Facebook and decided to give it a try. This place will do good because arizona needs more businesses that serve cold and refreshing drinks and treats. I wasn't 100% sure of the che but I ordered the fruit addict and it was weird for me because I've never had anything like it before and there was a lot of stuff and jellies in there but it tasted good. My husband got their honeydew milk tea with honey boba and something tasted like what a salon would smell like. We weren't sure if it was the smell of the business or if the place used to be a salon, but we kept tasting something funny.. Can't quite put my finger on it. I liked all of the different options they had to pick from to put in your drink. We'll be back sometime soon"
3,"First time we tried this place. We ordered thru  Grubhub. Overall it was  just ok. Portions were rather small but were appropriate considering the inexpensive cost. I had the create your own salad and he had create your own stir fry. They forgot to include my dressing  and the 50 cent focaccia bread was a tiny slice.my salad was overwhelmingly spinach. His sauce was sesame garlic sauce which was on the bland side and the roasted tofu tasted like it wasn't really roasted but had a dab of smoke on it. Disappointing

We heard from honeygrow , they did not apologize for our poor experience only said that's not what they are well known for . We stand by our three and our review and would be very reluctant to order again or recommend them to anyone. Also , the email address they gave me to respond to their comment was not valid."
3,"Good sushi, fast service! ... Not the best i tasted, but surely works if you crave for sushi, and thats the only place nearby, you can go to kill the Sushi craving."
3,"It's hard to go wrong with Denny's. I dig the whole make your own grand slam thing they have going on.

The food didn't take very long to come out so that was cool. I got stuffed for under $10 and that doesn't happen very often. The layout here is basically the same as any other Denny's. It's simple, it's easy and it's Denny's."
3,"I'm new to Charlotte so I haven't found my go to brow spot. I tried this place out because I saw it had good reviews and they have a special discount on Tuesdays. The service was quick and the lady was nice but she did not arch my eyebrows the way I liked it, however she kept them thick which I appreciated. I probably won't be back."
3,"After all the hype about Bambu opening in Chandler, I was so excited to go this place. I went with my husband couple weeks ago, and we both didn't enjoy what we got. I got the oolong milk tea, which I think didn't taste like oolong at all and overly sweet eventhough I have already requested for less sweet. It tasted more like regular  boba milk tea rather than oolong. I  know how Oolong taste like, as it is  my go to drink when I'm in La or the Bay Area.I think  Teastreet in Chandler has much better Oolong milk tea. My husband got no 1, the Bambu special. He think it was okay nothing special, but a little overpriced for what you got for $5.75. It feels like something that you can make yourself at home using coconut water and mixed fruits. We might give this place another try again but probably for a little while."
3,"i think that the place is clean, its unfair that unlike other hotels they cheat you on time, that there is a fee for early check in, its inconvenience when u have children, and also that you check in at 4pm, when all other establishments are 2pm, ive even checked in at 1pm, and check out is at 10am?, they kick you out during breakfast, especially when kids are tired from night bfore.."
3,"I go to this location often and the service is a hit and miss. Depending on what time of the day you go of course. Most servers are nice some faster than others. The Food is not consistent during dinner. I wouldn't get any salads since they use pre washed greens and taste dry and dirty like they need to be washed. I would also avoid any dishes with roasted potatoes or chorizo both are most likely gonna be over cooked. If you have kids avoid the pizza it's never cooked properly. It always looks microwaved. The Burgers, sandwiches, pastas, finger food are good. Breakfast is usually on point anytime. Remember you don't go to places like Denny's expecting fine dining. You cause they are open and cheap lol."
3,I threw away my last take out order of rice noodles and red curry. It was sooooooo spicy I couldn't even palate it. I didn't know anything could be that spicy! Some people must have iron tongues! Whoa! I sometimes contemplate going back and trying something else but then I get scared and chicken out.
3,"Quiet, peaceful property away from the Strip. It's a timeshare that also rents out rooms nightly..studio, 1 bedroom and 2 bedroom suites. It has a more mellow feel than what Vegas is famous for.

Some highlights... 
-Spacious, clean rooms. Kitchenette and jacuzzi tub in every room.
-Has two 24 hour sand bottom pools, surrounded by palm trees, along with a waterfall hot tub.
-Free shuttle runs all day to the Strip.
-Front desk folks are friendly and try to be accommodating.
-Free popcorn at the front desk..better than nothing I guess.
-Putting green is fun for kids..it's small, and has no challenging breaks. Not serious golfer quality.
-Free continental breakfast, but selection is poor.

Some lowlights...
-$13.44 RESORT FEE...............grrrr
-Lots of old folks frequent this property, they're quiet but very sensitive to ANY noise. Each stay we've had here, there have been creepy drunk guests leering from balconies at anyone in the pool. They made my wife uncomfortable and feel unsafe.
-Area is a little sketchy and cars feel exposed.
-No restaurant.
-No casino.
-Entertainment seriously lacks.
-Rooms are limited, so requests are not often fulfilled.
-DVD players used to be free from front desk, now they charge.

Lack of entertainment and quiet atmosphere can get boring if you stay too long. If you come to Vegas to quietly read by the pool all day, every day, this place is for you. If you prefer action, entertainment, gaming, socializing, food, drinks or atmosphere, stay at a casino resort. But Tahiti can be nice for a short stay to unwind and relax, or even get some quiet couple time. 

But keep in mind, there are a lot of comparable or even superior properties at Tahiti's price point, with a lot more entertainment value, many at a much better value (Eastside Cannery, Rio, Hardrock, SLS, Palms, Excalibur, Luxor, etc).

We used to enjoy coming here until recently falling back in love with the livelier part of Las Vegas. Tahiti does not feel like Las Vegas."
3,"2.5 stars. I've been to many AYCE sushi places and this one is slightly below average. Their menu selection was nothing special. You will find all your standard stuff. They did a few dishes well, and a few were edible but not good. Notable fails were the kalbi, seafood udon, and stir fried squid. On the other hand, their rock shrimp and rolls were decent. The chicken skewer was good too. 

Service is not note-worthy as you can expect from any Chinese owned place.

Price is reasonable. There are better places but I won't mind coming here again if I'm in the area and want to stuff myself."
3,Food and table service was good but the hostess and gal at the register were both very rude.
3,"Boba teas and juices. It was nice inside I suppose I expected more variety. Also the girl couldn't explain to my friend what boba is. 
On the plus side they have baby bottles with samples of things most people inquire about."
3,"I come here if I want a pedicure every couple months because it's close to my house. Depending on the day and time, it can get really busy so I would suggest going later in the day on weekdays (they close at 7pm). The staff working there are friendly and accomodating. It's definitely not top of the line but it's nice enough. For a basic pedicure, it's around $20 but I always get callus removal, which is a $5 charge. I've gotten a gel manicure here before too and was told it would last 2 weeks without chips. Mine lasted 5 days before it started looking bad. I'm not really into manicures anyways. One thing I do like about this place is you can just walk in and not have to make an appointment. I wish the pedicures lasted a little longer and that they used hot rocks like competing nail salons but it's still a nice time to relax."
3,"It wasn't horrible. The girl seemed like she couldn't be bothered and wanted to be else were. The guy was trying to be impressive with all his different topics. He was be over bearing and ignoying  to me. I wasn't  impressed by his conversations.

They job they did was standard."
3,"A new addition to East Liberty!  It's a cute space, open floor plan, bright and inviting.  No doubt, the interior is nice.  However, something was missing from the food that made my experience just okay.  I ordered the ""Make it Grain"" salad.  I wasn't a fan of their honey ginger vinaigrette? because it left a strange aftertaste?."
3,The bartender was super sweet and very attentive. The food was tasty however. I ordered the sumo deluxe and I only received. My entree. No soup of salad.  I was offered if when I was paying my bill but it defeated the purpose.
3,"Finally tried Honeygrow. If you have not tried it, it's in the new trend of fast, ""locally sourced"" real food, like Chipotle, Choolaah Indian BBQ or Piada in Oakland. I'm sure they would not like to be grouped together, but to me they are basically all the same; quicker versions of ""ethic"" food. They also have the customizable order component. Ordering at Honeygrow is done via a kiosk, where you pick your protein, veggies, add-ins and sauce, etc. They do have a few pre-made meals on the menu as well. I tried the rice noodles with chicken, some veggies and the tahini sauce, on the side. (I didn't like it so I ended up asking for a side of the sesame garlic.) The BF got the brown rice with pork, veggies and the sesame garlic sauce. I like the BFs brown rice better than mine, but that was my fault; I'm funny with noodles. And as I said, I didn't really like the tahini sauce, but I got it on the side, so it wasn't a problem. He didn't realize you could choose lite, heavy, etc. sauce, and the amount they used was a little too much for him, but he liked it otherwise.  
The overall verdict? It was ok. The pros are lots of options- by changing your protein, rice/noodle, sauce- there is something new to try. Plus, if you want to watch what you're eating, you can really control things like sauce and add-ins. And if you're looking for a fast dinner/lunch, its quicker than sitting in a drive thru half the time. The cons? It's just so-so. We will be back but it isn't like I'm dreaming of the place. If you want real Chinese/Thai/Asian cuisine, this is not it, but if you are looking for a decent, quick, semi-healthy grab-n-go meal, it's a great option."
3,"I haven't been here in a long time and the last time I was here was at least 1.5 years ago before I joined the Yelp community.  It's typical AYCE quality, but their best roll is the Firehouse roll. It's essentially a California roll topped with red tuna and tempura flakes with spicy mayo on top.  This was my favourite.  The sushi itself was of average quality.  

I think the positives to this place are: Price - $12.99 for lunch, fairly fast service and the sushi is okay.  

The biggest negatives to this place is that they don't offer dessert, or shrimp tempura and their kitchen items are a bit below average.  

Not worth a special drive, but if you are in the area, it's good for a quick AYCE sushi lunch."
3,"The Greek salad tonight was disappointing, the lettuce somewhat wilted. They piled the feta on, maybe to hide the second class lettuce? 
We both ordered the 6 oz New York strip steak from the ""lighter menu selections"". Despite the size it was very good."
3,"I'm not super picky about where I get my pedicures. After they closed my regular shop (McDowell Mountain Nails) I've been shopping around. 

Evidently, this place isn't that memorable as I apparently visited a year before with my mother and didn't recall. 

This is certainly not a new shop. There were stains and chunks of the fabric missing on the massage chairs. I asked for a pedicure and they had me sit in a massage chair. 

I was a little bummed because the chair was a little broken and didn't recline/incline so I was stuck in one position. 

It took about 15 minutes for someone to even turn on the water. I was a little grossed out that they didn't use a basin liner and encouraged me to put my bare feet on the foot rests (rather than cover it with a towel first) 

Once my actual pedicure started the woman barely spoke to me but was very social with her colleagues. She was very rough on my cuticles and made my big toe bleed at one point. 

I picked the special pedicure which offered a choice of coffee or white tea mask but she didn't give me a choice. I *think* she gave me white tea. 

It felt really rushed. Granted they were busy but 45 dollars isn't exactly a ""discount"" pedicure. 

I didn't end up with any fungus and other than bleeding a little no major damage was done but I don't think I'll be visiting this location in the future."
3,"Stayed here for my anniversary back in october, it was nice, pretty okay. i just wish we had full kitchen and washer and dryer because we stayed for 1 week. we book 7months in advance for a full kitchen and washer/dryer and did not get that room. bummer. the best part honestly was the tub."
3,"This location has better food than the one at Queen. I mean don't expect gourmet sushi, ok? But it is delicious. It was cheap, good food, ok service. Its a small place as well so may not be ideal for big groups. 3 stars. B - rating."
3,"We had dinner here opening night for a friends birthday. It was a group of us who had all been eager for the opening. The food was excellent and the wait staff were great! 

There was a gentleman who was working, not sure if he was waitstaff or what but he was singing and really just making the experience great. 

Our Hibachi chef was not the most entertaining. We had another family at our table that was not part of our group who had a younger boy and I thought the chef could have been a bit more interactive with him. We have visited other Hibachi restaurants in Madison often and the chefs are usually the most entertaining so we felt that they were lacking in that regard. 

Overall the experience was good and the food was fantastic."
3,"Dude (or Dudette - I don't see race or sex), have you ever been to a Dennys? Well this one is exactly as you expect and have experienced at other Dennys.

Not sure there's much to say except that Dennys is at least consistent in their offerings and with their quality of food. Everything is A-Ok and the prices are pretty cheap. Also on your birthday you get a free Grand Slam.

In my personal opinion you should really only be eating at Dennys for their breakfast options. All their other attempts like dinner entrees and lunch items are pretty meh. Breakfast is where they shine."
3,"Once we managed to get a hostess to notice us, and then managed to flag down a waitress, we ordered the minced beef congee and the Taiwanese style stir fired vermicelli with seafood. The congee was alright. Not the best which is ironic considering the restaurant's name. The vermicelli was pretty good. Overall the food was decent, but the service is pretty bad. They have enough waiters but they seem to actively avoid eye contact. I don't even care if they're polite or smile but at least try to help out customers instead of standing around."
3,"Solid Chinese comfort food. Because of location and fancier decor, they're charging a few dollars more per dish. Service pretty typical of a congee place - get the food on the table ASAP and try to turn tables quickly. Clean.

Tonight we had:
Cha siu which was delicious and excellent quality
Snow pea leaves in garlic sauce, also yummy
Ying Yang fried rice, nicely presented and delicious

All in all a good meal. We had leftovers to take home."
3,"I was very disappointed the last 2 visits. The fish in my tacos was so overcooked I couldn't even chew it. They forgot the sauce for my fries and I waited almost a half hour for my take out order, there was no one else there so not sure why the wait. I had been there before and the food was great. Very inconsistent food quality, however the servers are always great"
3,I have been here a few times. Tried a few different items. They are all good but nothing exceptional. Plus I feel some of the dishes portion sizes could be a little larger. It seems to be a little inconsistent from time to time. But I will be back to try some other new things.
3,"Went back there more recently. They have more staff now so there is less waiting. I almost always can get an appointment at a time that I need. They do still try and push shellac on me every single time ""oh but it's shiny!"". They also get really weird when you try to pay with a card. I watched them argue with a 16 year old girl when she said she only had a credit card and couldn't use an atm.

The best thing about this place is one woman. She said she is going back to school so she probably won't be there much longer. It's really nice to have someone who I can understand and actually talks to me and can explain how to better take care of my nails. Also, whenever she does my nails they look absolutely flawless."
3,"Bottom line, Flo's has way better food for a comparable price. We ordered to go so maybe it would be better if we dined there? Either way, to go should be prepared to match the quality of dining there.  The food is decent but I didn't think it was good enough to justify the cost.  It was expensive for meh...."
3,"This is pretty good fast food Asian. Compared to another popular Asian fast food this is far superior     The service is excellent and fast. The restaurant is very clean. 

I thought the serving sizes were fine. The choice of a small bowl or a regular bowl is offered   Other reviewers thought the servings were small, I respectively disagree. 

We ordered a small pad Thai.  Thought there could be more chicken and a few less veggie pieces. 

The regular chicken Singapore cashew was a little more hot than I anticipated   The noodles were really good. Although I would suggest a little more chicken"
3,"Stopped by here yesterday for a quick snack and decided to grab a honeybar. And in my honest opinion, it is not worth it at all... $6+ for a smidge of yogurt and some fruit and granola? You're better off going to a fro-yo place where you can get 3x the amount of frozen yogurt and toppings for the same price. Or make your own at home, it's the same quality. It's very much one of those ""hipster and yoga"" places that are expensive because they have gluten free options. The honeybar was good but not worth the price, at all. 

I've heard good things about their salads, but honestly paying $10+ for a salad is sus in my book too. You could buy sooo much other food with that. There's maaaaaaany other options on Highland Ave, I would recommend going somewhere else.

I can't comment on the service because none of the three workers greeted us when we walked in and you don't interact with anyone when ordering; it's all done on a self-ordering screen. But I will comment on how we were the only table sitting in the restaurant for 10 minutes and it took 15 for our honeybars to come out (which is just yogurt with toppings)...

I was excited to try this place since I've heard good things about it; I was very optimistic! But now, I probably wouldn't come here again by my own decision."
3,"Thought I would try something different and I've passed this place probably a dozen times so I finally went in. Ordered two tacos and mac n cheese. The mac n cheese was very much ok. Nothing special, but not bad either. The tacos were both pretty good, I ordered a Wipeout and  a Luau and it's a nice change from normal tacos you'd get everywhere else. Service was good, especially considering how busy it got after I arrived. It was like coming in right before a rush."
3,"Food is pretty good here, service not so much. Prices also went up (but still very reasonable).

Even during a non-busy time, the service was lacking. It was hard to find someone to flag down.

On our most recent visit, we ordered:
Congee (dried fishstock & pork bone & peanut) - ordered the small size and most of the bowl was pork bone, so not as much congee as we would've liked
Chili turnip patties - turnip cubes were mushy this time around. Tip: add chili oil
Spice and pepper pork chop - delicious, esp w white rice
Dough fritter rice noodle roll - I think these were overdone as they were very crispy. Also didn't come with enough soy sauce.
Snow pea leaf w king mushroom - This was the best dish on the table. Done pretty much perfectly."
3,"I think the $4 Pancakes (2), Eggs, and 2 pieces of Bacon or Sausage (You choose One) is one of the best deals in town! The Value Menu is separate then the regular menu! It is usually placed next to the salt and pepper, but if you don't see it, ask the waitress!

If $2 is too much to spend, they even have $2 menu items!!
Its as cheap or cheaper then McDonalds, except you can rest easy knowing you are at a RESTAURANT, not a Fast Food place that has a ""Character"" called ""The Grimace!""
 
As for the Restaurant, the decor is OK, and since this is a ""Denny's Diner"" they play VERY OLD Music from the 50's!

Are you like me and enjoy eating a Delicious Breakfast while listening to music where all the artists have passed away?

Then this is the place for YOU!"
3,"I have been to all the Congee Queens in Toronto and the food is pretty much great at all of them. They seem to have the same standard that places them a bit above all other congee restaurants and I really enjoy eating here. Besides their congee, their BBQ section is amazing. I also recommend any of the noodle in soup and their salt and pepper squid (the toppings are what really do it!) 

The problem with THIS location is that the service is GOD AWFUL. I have been to this location a total of 6 times and 4/6 times they forgot an order. One time it was so bad because we had to ask the waiter TWICE, he forgot both times so we walked out. When I went last night, we had to get for our bill from 3 different servers and still... none of them brought it. 

If possible, I recommend going to their location at Don Mills and Steeles - it's definitely a big difference."
3,"The food was okay, rather bland though I will admit that I prefer highly spiced dishes. The staff was friendly so the restaurant merits an Average rating. 

I had the chicken KOREAN FIRECRACKER noodle dish which is supposed to be spicy  (it was recommended by the young man who took my order); it however was not spicy at all. The ingredients are fresh and there are plenty of options. My takeout order came-up quickly and I was on my way. 

I may give it another try eventually but for now, I'll stick with P** W** for Asian fast food"
3,"Although this is my go-to salon in Madison, it tends to be hit or miss. 

When they're not swamped with walk-ins and appointments, service here is top notch. Everyone is super nice and accommodating. Love the glass of wine you get with your service! They also generally do a great job at both manicures and pedicures.

However when they're busy, I've been very disappointed with their service and quality. The last shellac manicure I had began peeling in 3 days, definitely not what you expect or pay for. The polish application was also very messy and uneven. They didn't apply enough coats and it was see through in parts. 

They should utilize the other half of their building for additional pedicures and manicures and hire more staff. I think this would help their throughput and quality issues."
3,"A super-old-school Steakhouse with a gentleman's club meets Catholic Church type of environment, with lots of wood paneling and stained glass, plus solid service and food quality, however I feel the price point promises more than the experience ultimately delivers.

I've been here several times now and there's never been anything wrong. I always have good food and good service, but it always feels like everything is just not quite impressive or worth bragging about, considering Octagon's fine dining aspirations and price point.

I love the old school garlic bread, and the pickle, olive and pepperoncini platter, and the prime rib in particular is usually very good. But price, and portion, and overall experience, all certainly fall a few steps behind steak houses in Toronto.

The Octagon is simply not in the same league with Tier 1 steak houses in Toronto like Harbour Sixty or Jacob and Co. And I would suggest that it lands in the lower end of the Tier 2 places, delivering a more upscale environment, but similar food quality, to a place like Smith Brothers in Scarborough.

So in the end, I've always had a solid meal, with solid service, and I've enjoyed repeatedly devouring huge baskets of garlic bread, plus a ton of olives and skinny hot peppers, so I typically leave feeling satisfied, but like things didn't quite manage to live up to the price I paid."
3,"No doubt this is a classy place with your all male staff (one woman at coatcheck) and beautiful pod and decor. I found there were too many greeters at the door, but that's fine. 
Our waiter never cracked a smile but was polite. It was my wife's birthday and she really loves steak. She had the filet mignon and loved it. I had the full rack of ribs and wasn't impressed. Huge portion, but the meat was very little off the bone, and very dry and tough. The taste was good though.
The garlic mashed potatoes was lumpy!?!?!  Not impressed.
We had the coconut cream pie for dessert which was amazing.
All in all, I guess I would come back, but I would stick to the steak and not order the mash."
3,Was definitely not a fan of my pedicure. Little colors to choose from and cheap interior. Chairs were broken and uncomfortable. Prices aren't bad though
3,"Had a pretty decent Breakfast burrito. The menu is gigantic and I was staring at the menu board for like ten minutes. They have over a dozen breakfast burritos and a ton of other unusual items. The salsa bar seemed well stocked, but alot of the items were of the spicy variety (onions and carrots) and two hot salsa's. Anyway, my burrito did not say cheese, but it had eggs, cheese, peppers, onions and I added rice. It was basic, but very filling and rolled tight. Place is tucked away deep in the corner of strip mall, so tough to find, but I wasn't looking for it, so that makes it a better discovery. Most breakfast burros are about $5-$6."
3,"It's a Hampton folks! The place was very clean during my stay. The staff providing personable top notch customer service. 

There is ample parking at this place and the continental breakfast is your run of the mill continental breakfast. 

Trust me you won't miss your fight if you hiding out at this hotel as the landing strip is directly across Sunset Blvd. Planes started dropping out the sky at 5:00 am."
3,"I was so excited to hear that a honeygrow location opened up in Pittsburgh. I love the concept of healthy food that's both quick and completely customizable. However, honeygrow didn't quite live up to the hype.

The ordering system is through a computer so it limits any employee-customer interaction. I like the idea but in practice, it made the process more confusing and time consuming - not to mention 2 of the 4 computers kept freezing up. 

They offer different menu options but you can also build your own salad or stir-fry. I built my own salad with tofu ($2 extra) which comes with 3 add-ins and 2 toppings. The variety of dressings could have been better. The pre-fried tofu was almost inedible. Aside from being cold and bland, it was so tough that it became a jaw workout. Other than the tofu fail, the rest of the salad was great, and the portion sizes were surprisingly large. 

Overall, honeygrow did not wow me. It wasn't fantastic but it also wasn't bad. I would stop in again if I didn't have any other healthy options around."
3,"Aji Sai is a good choice downtown for all you can eat sushi. There is a lot of selection on the all you can eat menu - even for those who don't like raw fish. The sushi is what you expect from all you can eat - a bit scaled down versions. The service is so/so. The price is as expected (around $20/person).

Make sure you try the cream cheese won tons and the seaweed salad."
3,"This place is actually not bad! I try to stay away from AYCE places cause I always end up eating too much. But my friend wanted to go here so I figured why not give AYCE sushi another shot.

I'd order these menu items again: seaweed salad (but I'd request sauce on side, cause it came kind of drenched in sauce); atlantic smoked salmon roll; fire house roll; black dragon roll; salmon belly; spicy butterfish handroll. I wasn't a fan of: rocknroll maki; squid tempura.

I think I'd actually come back in the future (although probably not for a while)."
3,"The butter chicken was delicious, but I ruined my lunch by ordering the cheesy kimchi fire ball. *facepalm Stay away from them I almost lost my lunch. I will go back and give this place a second chance."
3,"Well, I've now officially been to 4 Congee Queen branches. Unfortunately I felt this place fell a bit short compared to the other three I've been to (McCowan, Steeles/404, Commerce Valley).

I went to this branch with some friends one night, as it was a more central location for some who live in the west end. Not surprisingly there was a lineup at around 6:30pm on a weekday, so the demand is definitely there for this branch.

We ordered the general tao chicken, shredded beef and preserved vegetable chow mein, fried beef noodle, fried turnip patties, and spice/pepper salt squid. All the noodle dishes were good, as well as the general tao chicken. However, the fried turnip patties were large in size and lacked the ""turnip"" texture, and the squid was too overcooked (overfried? too much batter/squid ratio).

Service was par for your typical Congee Queen, if not a bit lower. It was harder to get someone to take an order due to the less than spectacular setup here compared to the other branches.

I likely won't return to this branch as I've had better experiences in the other branches."
3,"Lobby area is beautiful but service is a little slow at this hotel. For the price point and location, the room was spacious and clean, with a nice enough bathroom too. They serve a complimentary hostel-styled breakfast: the bare minimum but hey, it's complimentary.

The biggest con for me in staying here is there is no shuttle to The Strip. But all in all, it's a decent hotel."
3,"The place was clean and the guy who took my order was friendly.  

I really liked the salsa bar.  They had a decent selection of salsas that were very different from the typical ""Bertos"" restaurant salsas.  I mixed the hot and the medium which was really good.  The salsa were definately made fresh.  

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito and shredded beef taco.  The burrito was a good size and hot.   The beans were okay, if I didn't use the salsa with every bite I would say they would have been a little bland.  The taco was great!  Their taco shells are exactly the way I like them, crispy but thin.  

This place reminded me a lot of Senor Taco.  The salsa was similar and they also used the white Monterey jack cheese.   

My only complaint is the prices are slightly high if you order a la carte but I would eat here again and recommend it to a friend."
3,"We stayed here for one night while we were in town for an event. Parking was easy, check in was fast and we were given a king suite on the 3rd floor. The elevators were clean but really slow. It wouldn't have been bad but the cleaning staff were using them most of the time and their carts took up the entire elevator. 

We arrived in the room and the electronic key actually worked the first time! The room was very clean. We had a couch that was quite comfortable, along with a flat screen TV and about 60 channels. There was also a mini bar area but we forgot to bring drinks! The lighting in the bathroom/counter area was excellent, as was the water pressure!

The bed was uncomfortable and only made worse by the air conditioner unit 2 feet away blowing directly on the bed. There were two units in the room but they were both controlled together on the wall. We had to make a choice between freezing all night or turning off the unit and going into thermal overload! We chose to leave it on half the night and turn it off the other half. Strangely enough, our friend, Larry the cockroach didn't seem to mind the temperature as he was scurrying around the bathroom in pure delight! My wife didn't have any shoes on when she found him at 2:30am so she just put the trash can over him so he wouldn't be inclined to crawl in bed with us. That's not the kind of threesome I keep requesting! We'll see if the cleaning crew finds Larry in the morning!"
3,"I really want to like this place!! I really do! We've tried it multiple times. The service is great, the restaurant is clean, the food is just okay. All of the dishes just seem to kind of taste the same to me. It could also be a matter of preference, my husband does like it. My biggest complaint is it's really pricey for the amount of food you get."
3,"Walking into this Congee Queen for the first time; the decor is fancier than the other locations. Maybe the fancyness of this place has the front staff acting pompous... I'm not sure.  

This place would have gotten a 1 star based on the type of service received... but the food was on point. Got the usual (the I don't need a menu, I already know what to order) - minced pork & fish w/ beans, crispy chicken, fried squid w/ spicy salt, cantonese chow mein.. ohhh and the BBQ pork. 
BBQ pork was succulent. Crispy chicken, skin crispy, chicken juicy... veggies on other dishes not overcooked...  Have to say The. Food. Was. Goooood

If the food is always like this at this location - a tip for management/owners... Get rid of the front of house staff - servers, hosts. THEY SUCK. Let patrons sit themselves and order for  themselves, let the cooks get the credit they deserve and guarantee 4 and 5 star ratings will be the norm."
3,"Went there around two weeks ago with another couple. The ambiance was amazing, however, the food did not reflect that. 

We ordered the seafood platter for two, Caesar salad (from the back) and a rib-steak bone in. The steak was very good but the seafood platter was subpar - and for $205.00, it was simply outrageous. I have been to other establishments where they have this item and it is better quality with more food such as filet mignon, and approximately $40 less expensive. Their platter came with no meat, only seafood.

Caesar salad was $17.00, it was good but far from the best I've ever had. 

All of us have never been there before, and likely never to return."
3,"I've been here half a dozen times, food is good. Nice, healthy selection, clean environment and friendly staff. 
Takes waaay too long for a fast casual restaurant. You need to set aside 15 minutes just to get your food, not counting if you have to wait in line.  Also, on the expensive side. Least expensive option is going to run ~$9. Scale up from there if any extras or different proteins.

If I'm going to pay that much and have to wait that long I'll go to one of the sit-down restaurants in the area."
3,"Decent tasting food options here. I've tried a few noodle dishes. Flavors are good. But for the price, servings are small. It's an upgraded version of Panda Express - nicer food options and ambiance - in my mind that doesn't justify an average of $12 for a lunch entree + soda."
3,"Dinner visit. Seated quickly. Opted for a la carte menu. $1 oysters when you purchase an alcoholic beverage or opt for their all you can. These were really good! Got the tatoki sushi roll and that was mediocre (not a big fan of cream cheese in my rolls) majority of the choices incl. cheese so it's difficult to shy away from it and not to mention the offering list is short. Beef kimchi fried were mediocre. Sushi combo was ok. Service was fast and good. Prices reasonable. Overall, experience is positive and would visit again primarily for the oysters. (Mon-Weds special)"
3,"I stopped by this place after Lee lee's.. I tried the taro lover. It's not bad but very different.. I never tried anything like it before.. I don't know if it was the texture or what.. But overall it wasn't bad, I'll probably stop by here again to check out all the other drinks they offer.."
3,How is this place a resort? Only good thing was the 24 hour pool. We were here for 7 days with NO housekeeping services. Had to dump our own trash.
3,"Cool vibe going on here with an island/ surf atmosphere and some good reggae playing. Stopped by for lunch and the service was good. I ordered the fish taco combo. Which comes with a choice from the menu of two fish tacos, coleslaw, fries and drink. 

The food came out quickly and is served in a basket. the fish tacos were well packed and of decent size, but I was disappointed in the portion of coleslaw in a tiny plastic cup about a tablespoon and very few fries. It's enough food but I think they could beef up the portions of slaw and fries. 

I like the atmosphere and the food is decent and fair priced. I expect to go back."
3,"Took a while for them to come take our order.. staff are friendly they move around quick.. I've noticed all locations are pretty busy and this location is busy as well I guess due to its in a mall. 

After our order food came out within 5min..

We ordered the super bowl congee which is good enough for 4- people depending on their appetite it has soft clam crab meat salmon shrimp and scallops..

The other dishes we got was the crispy Cantonese chowmein with assorted meat beef chicken bbq pork crab shrimp squid and few pieced of veggies.. 

The taste is òk they use alot of MSG in  their dishes though.. I don't know when the best time to come cause it seems they are always busy no matter what time.. and make sure once a server comes to you finish whatever you need to say cause it will take a while before they come back and check in you cause the people that bring the food to the table are in training..

Would I go back to this place yes it is worth the money and fast service.."
3,"I had a chicken hibachi meal and my friend had the salmon. Food was ok, I may order the shrimp next time i go instead. It tasted a little better. The portions were decent and the chef was very funny, he had us laughing quite a bit. The atmosphere is really well done, you have to see it to know why. They could definitely get more hot tea on the menu. But I will go again for sure!"
3,"Having been to their other locations, thus one has a pretty big foot print and plenty of seating... if you can manage to get seated.  Going in at peak of Friday night dinner, I was asking for trouble.  Fortunately I was seated but saw the line up grow outside, surprisingly there were also many empty tables to be found... the staff were hard to flag down and walk in 3s chit chatting away.  When our order finally went in, we got 2 wrong dishes.  The staff did not seam to care about this even upon telling them twice of it.  The food was super salty.  More so than the other ones as we usually order the same stuff.  I would go down the street to congee time with better service than come back. Meh"
3,"Fairly standard not too expensive sushi. I've eaten here a dozen times out of convenience and some days are pretty bad, some days are better. Likely depends on their shipment of fish.
It's fine for what it is, but don't expect fine dining.
The staff are nice though we typically ordered take-out."
3,"This nail salon is ok, but don't go here expecting a real 'spa' experience. I went here today with a couple of friends to get pedicures as the salon is close to where we live and convenient for all of us. We made appointments and did not have to wait, so that was a positive. One of my friends' man who did her toes was really friendly and personable, but my guy was not. Mine was a younger man, and he did a nice job, but he gave a pretty weak massage and was texting and watching tv throughout the pedi. Not really the best experience, but my toes came out nice and my little toe design turned out cooler than my friends (sorry guys!) so he gets props for that. I felt like for a newer salon, the massage chairs weren't the best and a lot of the 'fun' nail colors offered were in off brands (not OPI or China Glaze)...which makes me wary to try them. A basic pedi was 22$ and the nail design was 5$, so it is fairly reasonable, but I don't know if I would go back because I had a better experience at a different salon (nails 8000) for around the same price."
3,I can only tell you about their rolled tacos which are some of the best rolled tacos I have tried. The only thing is that they are small for the price but the quality makes up for that. Also the price for a soda is almost three dollars. I would have given them a higher rating but they only got three stars because of the portion size and  price. I would still recommend this place and I will be back for those rolled tacos but I will be drinking water. Haha!
3,"The decorations in the lobby and restrooms are amazing. We started with a drink in the bar because not all of our party had arrived. We chose to sit at a table so we could more easily have conversation. The chairs were anchored to the floor so you couldn't really get close enough to the table to be comfortable.  The chairs in the dining room were also a little too low to be comfortable to eat.

When it came time to be seated we got to watch the show on the other half of the table. This chef was amazing, squirting sake (we assume) into guests mouths, flipping broccoli for them to catch, lots if animation and descriptions. 

Our chef came started out OK. He did none of the embellishments that make it so fun, he didn't even explain the volcano...His eyes did wander frequently to the soccer game on TV. OK, why are their TV screens in the dining room when you are paying $20 per plate?? He really just didn't talk so it wasn't much of a show.  The food was cooked OK. 
This is the first time that we ever did not tip the chef.

The couple that came with us had never had a hibachi experience before.  I'm still not sure that they had an official hibachi experience."
3,"Coat check service. Friendly staff. Nice authentic Italian decor. Clean setting. Fast service.

Sat down and our server came right away to ask about drinks. Drinks came promptly after. Whenever something is needed you'll get it quite fast. 

We ordered striploin, rib steak, and prime rib regular cut. For appetizer we ordered the escargot.

Complimentary bread, pickles, olives, and some peppers offered. Pickles were well pickled and nicely sour. The peppers were nicely pickled as well and added a great kick to the food. The garlic bread was quite oily and full of garlic flavour. Tasted great and nicely crisp but can make do with less oil.

Escargot - was a bit bland and oily in my opinion. Felt heavy from the oil used to cook them but wasn't flavourful enough. 

Prime rib - meat was nice and tender. Jus was nothing special but the horseradish finished the dish. 

Rib steak - if your looking for something hearty with an umami taste, get this. Well seared and full of flavour, the rib steak was tender, seasoned well, and cooked to medium rare as we like it. Bone in always seem to taste better.

Full entrees come with a potato side and veggies. Broccoli and carrots were glazed with honey giving it some sweetness. Still a bit oily. Mashed potatoes were nothing special and more on the less impressed side. 

Overall steak was tender and flavourful so I would say that the quality is there for the price. Good for special occasions."
3,"I love the way they thread my eyebrows every time however, the last time I went I got the brow tint. I was told the brow tint would last between 2-4 weeks and let's just say it didn't even last 5 days! I have got the tint before from another place & it lasted a while. I was careful to not wash my face hard or wipe the brows but it still came off before my trip which was the main reason why I got it!"
3,"In theory, this place is great. I came here with a friend, and we were able to get in quickly. The woman did a nice job, and overall my nails looked good. The only issue was, that they chipped within 4 days. I sit at a desk all day. My nails should NOT chip that quickly. We had a great time, and we were in and out quickly - but perhaps it was a little TOO quickly. I wish they had taken the time to take a bit more care with my nails. 

For the price I paid, if I have to re-do my nails in less than a week, that's just not worth it for me."
3,Great service on the morning of Xmas day restaurant super buzzy with multiples fire hazard violation people blocking the aisles put in extra seats by the side of the booth the bathroom was super dirty and papers all over the place our meals was so so but my chocolate shake was amazing at the end the girl on the cashier could it be a little nicer to explain how to put the tip on the credit card in general everybody working busy as a team and it really busy day
3,"The leg/foot massage and massage chairs were amazing, which let's be honest is the only reason I go for pedicures. I couldn't care less about the Polish; I can do that myself. However, the young man who did my nails cut one of them too short and cut some of my cuticles too short as well to the point where the acetone and water hurt when it touched my toes. Although I don't care about the polish, it was done well."
3,"I paid my first visit here with a fried recently for lunch.
The food is decent compared to the price (12.99 AYCE). The variety of dishes in  AYCE menu is average, no sashimi though. The pieces were of a good bite size, not too big that doesn't fit in the mouth. Not too much rice to fill  you up fast either. The fish were fresh and of good quality. I got to try butterfish for the first time and really enjoyed it. Every thing was delicious.

Service is not superb but is OK. Wait time was short. And it has average seating area. 

One thing that I must say, because it is really important, is that a tiny bug find its way some how to my dish and when I notified the server she only took my plate away and brought a new one! Definitely gross"
3,"Decent experience and standard AYCE. Some of the rolls were not put well together, but there's nothing wrong with the taste."
3,"I spent our Christmas Dinner with my girlfriend this year. The only thing that's good is the salad. The steaks were ok only, they were quite dry. I don't think they worth over $50 per order. Also the service wasn't good either. This is gonna be the first and last time we dine there."
3,"3 stars out of 5

We ordered the Salmon Congee and Chicken Fried Rice.  The place feels more spacious than the other Congee Queens, perhaps because we went at 6pm but it gets busy closer to 7pm.  The Salmon Congee has enough salmon and was nice and hot.  Not bad for $7.  The Chicken Fried Rice had a good portion but there wasn't much chicken in the rice (see picture).

Overall, we felt the place was average."
3,"The food is just ok.

The salad and soup is delicious. The hibachi chicken is good. 
Didn't care for the fried rice or veggies. No seasoning at all! 
I could just be use to the hibachi style in AL,GA, TN and TX. I love hibachi so I wouldn't recommend this place. 
The yummy yummy saw tasted too sweet."
3,I came here to eat on a Saturday night and ordered the AYCE. Ordered the spicy sushi roll and it did NOT look fresh. The rice broke apart and salmon was unappealing. Later ordered some dimsum. And it looked as if was microwaved. I decided to give them the 3 star for their attentive service and willingness to move to a warm table since their original spot by the door was freezing.
3,"Service is top notch in here, but the quality in my opinion is not there if you add all factors in (ambiance, price, service)
The lack of choices for appetizers and mains, makes it a little hard to find something specific you might be in for. They could enlarge their menu selections, and add few items.

I have visited it a couple of times, but it wouldn't be something that I would repeat or recommend.

Their steaks are good, mediocre, but definitely not the best in the GTA
I've tried the fillet, and the pepper corn steak, not bad but not the best."
3,I've always found the food to be very fresh. Read the menu carefully and order what sounds good. My kids love the Terriyaki chicken. Have not had a horrible dish but certainly prefer some dishes over others. I definitely recommend anyone give it a try. I like that the veggies are fresh and crisp. Staff is always helpful and the restaurant is always clean.
3,"Three stars because the food was tasty and tables clean - also, I 1) found parking and 2) got back on my way in what is typically a nightmare traffic zone. 

The Pad Thai tasted good but there were maybe (!) 4 pieces of chicken and the vegetables were so slivered and so few (except for a few onions) they were nearly nonexistent. 99% noodles.... Really? For $10+? I may give one more try, but this was pretty disappointing."
3,"I've been here a few times with friends, and I would definitely say it's a better AYCE sushi restaurant. Some foods I really like from here: avocado salad, seaweed salad, vegetable and salmon soup, rock n' roll shrimp, grilled salmon, pretty much all the rolls, and some more that I can't remember. 

However, the only thing I dislike about this restaurant is their gratuity system. I absolutely hate it when restaurants impose a gratuity on you (especially for small parties of, say, three), because I find it tacky and rude. I can understand if they do this for large parties, but we were three people. I happily tip waitstaff 15-20%, depending on how ingratiating they are, so they're actually losing out by making me pay 13%. 

Secondly, when you pay with credit card or debit, the machine asks you if you want to add a tip, sort of encouraging you to tip twice if you don't read the bill carefully and realize that the tip is already included in the total price. My friend and I both made this mistake, because the waitress simply quoted a tip-inclusive price verbally as she brought our bills and punched in payment prices on her machine, so we had not even had a chance to look at the bill.  My friend thought the price we paid was mathematically too high for the dinner price, so we did decide to look over the bill. After we realized the double tip, the waiter adamantly **refused** to give us our extra money back. They said it would be too much work for them. Really? I've worked in restaurants before, and all they would have had to do was make a note when balancing the till, or inform management regarding the discrepancy. They had no reason at all to not refund us. After almost getting into an argument with them, they grudgingly gave us the money back and didn't seem happy at all! I still remember this experience... just because it stood out so much. So beware of double tips if you come here."
3,"Janna is a good stylist & colorist.

Although I thought my wants for my hair were very specific, it seems that I wasn't using the right terminology or I didn't understand what she meant as we were discussing my hair.  

Overall though, the color is good and the cut is the best I've had in a long time.  There are some techniques/terminology I need to make sure I understand the definition of (i.e.. final result) from her and I look forward to doing that with Janna.

The salon itself is a great, open space that they've used to good effect to highlight their products along with some great artwork by Susan Nuttal & Leigh B. Williams.

The one thing I disliked intensely was being called honey & sweetie by one of the greeters at the desk.  She was completely friendly, but that's just a nails-on-chalkboard feeling for me."
3,"I ended up at this resort because I had to use my timeshare points before Nov 1 or loose them, and this was the cheapest usage.   I actually thought I was staying at Tahiti VILLAGE when I was talking with RCI. I felt duped. I did not experience the breakfast, pool area, or shuttle, or anything else except concierge for show discounts.

Pros:

Staff was really nice, all of them.  Concierge people were also very helpful and got me a really good seat for Michael Jackson ONE.  I did think 3 people at concierge was overkill, and told them that.  They didn't deny my observation.  

I stayed in two different studios, why 2? see #1 below.  Each room was as clean as clean as can be.  

The beds were pretty comfy, and I liked the pillows, cos they were firm and had substance, not like the feather ones that smash into nothingness.

Has good blackout curtains, so I slept till 11 with my earplugs, cos of the noisy hall AC, see #1 below .

Maintenance will come to your door and take care of your issue even after midnight.

They let me have 1 hour later checkout (I think 10 am is the earliest I was ever made to check out), but at 10:20, desk girl woke me up and asked why I was not out yet.  She did not read that it was documented I was given till 11 am, she said, ""Sorry about that"".  

Cons:

1.  I figured out from the hall AC intake being right outside my door 316A, that the hall AC above my unit.  Hearing the WOOO WOOOO WOOOO undulating vibration of the AC, penetrating my skull disturbed my stay and sleep in that unit. DO NOT STAY IN UNITS ON EACH FLOOR FROM 16a - 20. e.g 116A-120, 216A-220. 316A-320, cos the hall AC vibrates the walls for those rooms. Took me a few nights to figure out where noise was coming from, so I had to suffer it 3 nights, then the 4th night, staff was nice to move me to 222A.  Long walk there, but it is away from any AC vibration and was very quiet.

2.  My check in desk clerk told me specifically that not only local calls were free, but calls to other states were free, like a cell phone.  But later in the room I saw on the phone that l.d. calls were extra charge.  By that time another clerk told me calls to other states were NOT free, and the girl who told me they were free, was new.   Also another desk clerk showed me on the map that there was another elevator in mid building to my room, but it was untrue, only 1 elevator in the front. So I said desk staff was not thoroughly trained.

3.  Because I came back after midnight each night, I seemed to always have to park in the several covered spaces on west side, where there I had to step in sticky soda spills to get to my car door.  I track this sticky knyuck, knyuck, knyuck go my shoes, stuff into your carpet, and then I have to wash my shoes when I get in the room.  I did tell a staff person who said he would tell someone to use pressure hose to wash the many spaces that have soda spills in them (very obvious when you look), yucky.  I dreaded going to my car.  By third night I got wiser and parked in the uncovered spaces in front of the main entrance, but I felt my car would be more vulnerable to theft, since those spaces are next to the street and the entrance.

4.  Bathroom fan was so loud that I used the bathroom without turning the light on, to avoid hearing that fan. Wish fan and light was on separate switches.  Also hot is on the right not the left, of the one-handle shower valve.

5.  Not enough light where the table and chairs are, this varies with the room.  Some rooms have dimmer light bulbs

6.  I sorely missed facecloths in the bathroom.  Also funny thing is the conditioner and ""lotion"" are identical (see the ingredients, consistency and appearance), just one label says conditioner and other says lotion.

7. Exterior building is extremely dated to me.  I was shocked, and could not find the building because I wasn't expecting something so OLD looking, the color of the building was from the 50's, light sea green.  When I told the desk clerk she said it was supposed to be the color of the water in Tahiti.  

8.  I was told my room has ""pool view"", but when I got to 316A, the window view was totally plastered with palm tree leaves, thick, and that was my ""view"", so little light came in.

I MAY stay here again if it is as cheap as a Yelper said, $47, but won't book through RCI."
3,"We have been to this location previous times.  However today, (11 March 2018) it was quite busy, and the service staff was not quite as attentive.  We had about a 7 or 8 minute wait to get a table, and then (since I prefer a booth) we were seated at a table next to others.  The pork congee didn't taste as appetizing as our previous visits.  Even when I paid the bill, left a generous tip, the waiter just took it and never said a word."
3,I stopped here for happy hour with a co-worker after a long day at an event. It was a nice place to sit outside and grab a drink and a snack. We ordered the happy hour special rose along with the fried pickles. The staff was friendly and the beer list was extensive. There wasn't a ton of seating outside it's a little crammed and you're kind of tucked away so there is no view or action but it's a good place to check out.
3,"A disappointing visit, but worth another shot with different menu items. 

We visited Sumo after my boyfriend received a very generous birthday coupon for $20 off the total dinner bill. We stopped in on a Thursday night and were able to get seating immediately. The decor is striking (especially the giant sumo wrestler statues when you enter) and the restaurant is unrecognizable from the building's former life as a buffet. 

There's a takeout counter when you first enter, and then a host station a little farther in. Hibachi is toward the back of the restaurant, and ""regular"" dining is to the left. We chose regular dining. 

Drink orders were taken promptly and overall service was good (minus one thing that we'll get to); my boyfriend's soda never went more than half empty, finished dishes were cleared quickly, and even little things like my straw paper were whisked away within a minute of placing it on the end of the table. Our server was kind and food came quickly after being ordered. 

We ordered the crab rangoon appetizer and I placed an order for the chicken tempura dinner. I thought my boyfriend was ordering beef teriyaki but he ordered the chicken tempura as well. I almost changed my order to the orange chicken, and wish I had. 

Dinners come with onion soup and a salad. The onion soup was okay; it was a good portion but for me it was too sweet and earthy. My boyfriend enjoyed it quite a bit, though. The salad was iceberg lettuce with a sweet mayo dressing and croutons. I did like the taste of the dressing, but the combo of iceberg and mayo was similar to coleslaw and I only had a couple of bites due to the sweetness. I didn't sample the crab rangoon, but they did look perfectly fried and the filling had some fresh herbs. My boyfriend had me try the dipping sauce, which he liked, but I didn't care for it. Both were definitely a step up from fast food delivery, though. 

Soon our tempura arrived, and it was honestly comical. I was picturing rice, veggies, and some lightly breaded chicken pieces. What it was in actuality was a mountain of fried food in thick, crunchy, panko breading. The base was two large, thick slabs of panko-crusted sweet potato, plus an even bigger piece of panko-crusted white potato. There was a huge panko-crusted mushroom, five panko-crusted chicken strips stacked like firewood, and a large panko-crusted onion ring. Each plate also came with a bowl of rice and a small dish of the same sauce that came with the crab rangoon. 

One tempura dinner would have made an okay appetizer for four people, but as an entree it was impossible to eat. Even my iron-stomached, non-picky, clean-plate-club boyfriend could only make it through half a sweet potato slice and two pieces of chicken before feeling ill from the grease and heavy crust. I was able to eat one chicken piece before my stomach started turning from the richness. I tried one bite of the sweet potato, but there was no discernible seasoning and the thickness of the cut made it a little more firm than I prefer. 

I will say the chicken was good quality and if I had some spicy mustard to cut through the deep-fried goodness it would be a really tasty app. I would have asked for some, but once our entrees were delivered we didn't see our server again until we had been sitting for ten minutes and barely touching our plates. By then we decided to just get boxes (chopping up the chicken with some fresh veggies will probably make a good lunch) and go. And here we come back to the service point I mentioned - I wasn't asked if I enjoyed my food and no comment was made that I really hadn't eaten anything. I was just asked if we wanted dessert, then the check, and then we requested the boxes. 

My boyfriend and I had already discussed that we wouldn't have asked to send it back since we did get what we asked for, and it was what the menu said; we just had different expectations that it would be a more balanced entree with some lighter/fresher elements rather than a jumbo pile of fried breading. 

We noticed most people had sushi and it looked great; we may return and go that route, but we'll probably skip the entree section."
3,"Just ok. Service is friendly but they forgot to put chicken on my Cobb salad. I just think that's an expensive mistake, and a silly one at that. Also, the salad was really nothing special and for 11 dollars I just felt a little let down. Haven't tried any of the other stuff so this review is solely based on the salad I had."
3,"This is my 2nd time eating here. This time around, by a fortunate mistake, I ordered a sushi combo that included sashimi. My first time eating sashimi and I liked it. Fresh and filling."
3,"There is a lot to like about this hotel ....quiet, nice suites, clean, comfortable. Did not like the clueless staff, rude shuttle driver and bad Internet access. If they would just fix the wifi access, I might stay again. No excuse for wifi issues this day and age."
3,"After months of waiting, Bambu is finally open. This place specialIzes in Che which is a Vietnamese dessert made usually with mung beans, black eyed peas, kidney beans, tapioca jelly and fruit such as jackfruit, lychee, durian and longan. The store is small with limited tables but clean. After looking on Yelp to see which Che to get, my fiancé and I ordered #3 Awesome Trio and #6 Fruit Addict. The Awesome Trio had Red and white mung beans, taro, pandas jelly with coconut milk. The Fruit Addict has red tapioca, panda N jelly, lychee, longan, jackfruit, Palm seed, coconut  and coconut milk. I usually order Che when I got to a Vietnamese restaurant and love it. However I wasn't really impressed by the Che I had. I thought it lacked flavor and it was kinda bland. Overall I give this place a 3.5 just because I really didn't enjoy the smell of this place when I first walked in. The smell reminded me of a bathroom and it was lingering which made it unpleasant. I also didn't like that the menu was blinking and going blank then coming back on , especially when your trying to order. However the service was good and our order came out  fast. I know this place just opened so they're still in the process of figuring out all the kinks. I will be back to try some of their other drinks and update my review later."
3,"The restaurants decor was really nice and I especially like the metal lotus leaves that hung from the ceiling. We ordered the Soya Sauce Chow Mein, Lao Wan Style Congee, B.B.Q. Pork Rice Noodle Roll, Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll, and an additional plate of Dough Fritters to have with our congee. The Soya Sauce Chow Mein was very oily and we left almost half of it uneaten. The congee was very good with an abundance of different toppings like roast duck, lettuce, green onions, squid, peanuts, and some pig skin(which I don't particularly enjoy, but I'm sure it might suit some people's taste buds). The downside was that it became very watered down as time went on(it's best to eat it while it's hot). We ordered Dough Fritters to go with the congee and were surprised that it was made fresh(perhaps it was because we came early and they hadn't had the chance to make any yet). The Pork Rice Noodle Roll was what I enjoyed a lot and was stuffed with a lot of meat and green onions. The Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll was good as well as it was nice and chewy on the inside, crunchy in between, and covered with a thin layer of Rice Noodle."
3,Went to this Denny's after work at 2am. The server was amazing but the surroundings wasn't. Food was good.
3,"Not impressed with this particular Hampton Inn. We are rewards members and predominantly stay at Hampton Inns. This particular Hampton Inn is right next to the airport runway and the jets were taking off and landing continually which makes for a difficult night sleep. Our room, 442, faces north and was closest to the runway. If you stay here ask for rooms that don't face the runway. It may be quieter for a more restful night sleep. It would have been nice if while checking in the hotel staff would have advised us of the potential noise issue or if they would have placed us in a room away from the airport runway. 

Now to our room in particular. The tact strip between the carpet and bathroom tile was sticking up and was very painful when you walked across it with bare feet. When we checked out and told the hotel staff about it they were already aware of it. The carpeting throughout the room was rippled and stained. It was long overdue to be needing to be replaced. The remote control in the room did not operate the television. When we called down to the front desk they sent another one up to the room and it did not work the television either. 

We like Hampton Inns but not this one in particular. Seemed a lot more expensive than the other ones we stay at."
3,"We have been coming here for years. Great steaks, wine selection, and best cesar salad. But our most recent visit was quite disappointing with the service."
3,Beer and burgers. Simple but expensive. Service was ok. It seemed like I was a burden sitting at the bar. Bartender was too busy to talk to customers. Watched a sporting event on TV that wasn't live. nothing special. Take a cab to In-and-Out 3 blocks away.
3,"The pool is good, service is fine, and rooms well kept Overall It's a nice place to stay.
Here come some of the surprisingly bad reviews. It's the year 2010 and they still want to charge their guests for logging onto their Wi-Fi! Are you kidding me? McDonald's down the street offers FREE Wi-Fi. Also they want to charge us to use the pool table. I hate to complain about free stuff but the continental breakfast was a small pre packaged muffin, water and/or coffee.  Come on Tahiti I want to praise you as a fine resort and want to nickel & dime your guests like we're staying at some shady roach motel.
The Tahiti is a fine place to stay, it's just to bad they feel they need to charge extra for common hotel services."
3,"Congee Queen at Yonge/Steeles is one of my frequent go-to's for lunch.

Although I find their decor a bit on the tacky side, they do a decent job on their BBQ meats and snack type dishes. For actual congee itself, it's also alright, although I find Congee Wong down at Yonge/finch to have tastier congee (and around a dollar cheaper on average).

Being at a Chinese restaurant, you are expected to flag down any servers instead of having someone check on you every once in a while - not really an issue, however the restaurant is a bit on the big side and servers tend to congregate around the cashier area, so people sat at the corners and sides tend to have a hard time flagging down servers for ordering and getting the bill.

Overall, Congee Queen is an acceptable restaurant, and prices are relatively affordable. Just don't expect anything mind-blowing."
3,"A tasty reasonably priced lunch.

Today was my first visit to Ricardo's Mexican Food Restaurant.  As you enter Ricardo's your greeted by friendly staff who advise you of all the specials.

The dining area was clearly clean, maintained, and well-staffed. My lunch companion and I ordered the Thuraday lunch special, a shredded beef taco, three shredded beef rolled tacos, and a cheese enchilada . 

I didn't care for the enchilada, it was somewhat soggy and lacked taste. However, the tacos and rolled tacos were quite good. The shells were crispy on the outside but soft enough to not fall apart.  The shredded beef was moist, tender, and seasoned as to not overpower the toppings of lettuce, cheddar cheese,  and tomato. 

If your looking for inexpensive Mexican food and great service give  Ricardo's a try."
3,"First impression: food was tasty, very fresh and much healthier than other lunch options.  Service was quick and polite. I felt the portion sizes were small for the price but not unreasonable.  This is Asian fusion, or as i call it ""white people Asian food"". It's not going to satisfy a purist but that's not the aim. Everyone will find something on the menu that they like.  I'll be back."
3,"Food is ok, little pricey for the quantity. There are better roasted meat restaurants within walking distance."
3,"Food is good but the staff are so unkind to none asians. Very poor discriminated service 
They always take none asian people to sit on the  end side which nobody is there"
3,"Their flat rate is the main appeal about this property management company. However, their customer service and contractor services (Mammoth) are bad. I had work done at my house and the quality of the work was poor. Epoxy floor in the garage were peeling within a month!  
When I ask about it, they didn't do anything to make things right. So, I had to write off the cost.

In fairness, on other instance, the boiler failed and they did a great job on checking the warranty on the water heater and service was excellent. So, so far it has been 50-50.

The chargers for some inspections/work performed by Mammoth are  somewhat overpriced in comparison to hiring a contractor on yelp, and they don't make an effort to check with other contractors besides their own company. Nonetheless, given the convenience; it is worth it. 

Overall, it's an OK company and beats trying to manage a property from a different state. I need to work further with them to decide if i would recommend them and stay with them, but otherwise - right now, I am happy with their service."
3,"Food was ok but pretty bland. I was told the Taquitos we're homemade but sadly they were skinny and seemed to be premade. Now my biggest gripe was the cheap dime store plates and cuttlery, the knife and fork we're so flimsy it was a chore to cut and eat the cheese enchiladas. I can think of better places to go."
3,"UPDATE to original review below: Service was better this time; much more organized. The garden salad served before our meal was watery and possibly made ahead of time as the lettuce was brown an wilted. But presentation was standard and the rolls were also lacking the 'wow' factor (maybe more sauce?) My husband ordered the Hot Pot Chicken and it tasted like they used a bottled sauce...? I ordered the American Combo which came with a California Roll, Super Crunchy Roll, and Shrimp Tempura Roll. The super crunchy roll is the one I was most confused about. ""Assorted Fish"" was an ingredient, does that mean whatever fish is about to expire? Because it had a funky taste. Facility was clean enough; sticky residue was on the table and J put my arm in it as soon as we sat down. I would recommend having a childless section. We were surrounded by crying infants and children using flatware to tap on anything in sight. I understand this can be expected in a family restaurant but again maybe consider an 'adults only section'. Between the annoying surrounding customers and the standard food experience I maintain my 3/5 stars and will probably not be back to have sushi but instead to try the hibachi. Specialty sushi roll prices are similar to downtown sushi restaurant prices. 

I went the first week they opened. I'm thinking my husband and I need to go back and give it another go... I may have been persuaded with the idea to go back by the $20 birthday coupon I got in the mail recently! But anyways, presentation was top notch but flavor not so much. I was really disappointed by one of my rolls, primarily because it wasn't what I ordered. Service was chaotic and unorganized, but again we went the first week."
3,"Service was excellent but pricing is an issue and I unfortunately won't be returning. Prices are listed ""and up"" which I admittedly didn't notice when reviewing the menu but my total was very far from beginning menu prices for a very simple cut & color. When I got home, I felt very disappointed in the cut I got because of this overpayment."
3,"Been here a few times and the food seems consistent each time.  Came for lunch around 3PM Thursday and ordered some combo meals with a drink.  Really enjoyed the cold lemon tea, while my gf wasn't a fan of the HK milk tea.

Wasn't that busy around that time, half the restaurant was closed off (empty) while our half only 3 tables including us.

Food came out quite fast and big portions for a decent price tag.

Would come here again."
3,"Tony, thank you for your response, I will certainly give the Pub another shot. (Just beef up that Belgian and English beet menu...)"
